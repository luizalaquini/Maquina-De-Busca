Billy Smallburys smock-frock  There twas to be I
suppose Your lot is your lot and Scripture is nothing
for if you do good you dont get rewarded according to
your works but be cheated in some mean way out of
your recompense
No no I dont agree withee there said Mark
Clark Gods a perfect gentleman in that respect
Good works good pay so to speak it attested
Joseph Poorgrass
A short pause ensued and as a sort of entracte
Henery turned and blew out the lanterns which the
increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even
in the malthouse with its one pane of glass
I wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a
harpsichord dulcimer pianner or whatever tis they dcall
it said the maltster Liddy saith sheve a new one
Got a pianner
Ay Seems her old uncles things were not good
enough for her Sheve bought all but everything new
Theres heavy chairs for the stout weak and wiry ones
for the slender great watches getting on to the size
of clocks to stand upon the chimbley-piece
Pictures for the most part wonderful frames
 And long horse-hair settles for the drunk with horse+
hair pillows at each end said Mr Clark  Likewise
looking-glasses for the pretty and lying books for the
wicked
A firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside
the door was opened about six inches and somebody on
the other side exclaimed --
Neighbours have ye got room for a few new-born
lambs
 Ay sure shepherd said the conclave
The door was flung back till it kicked the wall and
trembled from top to bottom with the blow Mr
Oak appeared in the
P 156
entry with a steaming face hay+
bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow a
leather strap round his waist outside the smock-frock
and looking altogether an epitome of the worlds health
and vigour Four lambs hung in various embarrassing
attitudes over his shoulders and the dog George whom
Gabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe stalked
solemnly behind
 Well Shepherd Oak and hows lambing this year
if I mid say it inquired Joseph Poorgrass
Terrible trying said Oak Ive been wet through
twice a-day either in snow or rain this last fortnight
Cainy and I havent tined our eyes to-night
A good few twins too I hear 
Too many by half Yes  tis a very queer lambing
this year We shant have done by Lady Day
And last year twer all over by Sexajessamine
Sunday Joseph remarked
Bring on the rest Cain said Gabriel  and then run
back to the ewes Ill follow you soon
Cainy Ball -- a cheery-faced young lad with a small
circular orifice by way of mouth advanced and deposited
two others and retired as he was bidden Oak lowered
the lambs from their unnatural elevation wrapped them
in hay and placed them round the fire
 Weve no lambing-hut here as I used to have at
Norcombe said Gabriel  and tis such a plague to bring
the weakly ones to a house If twasnt for your place
here malter I dont know what I should do this keen
weather And how is it with you to-day malter 
 Oh neither sick nor sorry shepherd  but no
younger
 Ay -- I understand
Sit down Shepherd Oak continued the ancient man
of malt  And how was the old place at Norcombe
when ye went for your dog I should like to see the
old familiar spot  but faith I shouldnt know a soul
there now
 I suppose you wouldnt Tis altered very much
Is it true that Dicky Hills wooden cider-house is
pulled down
P 157
 O yes -- years ago and Dickys cottage just above it
Well to be sure
 Yes  and Tompkinss old apple-tree is rooted that
used to bear two hogsheads of cider and no help from
other trees
Rooted -- you dont say it Ah stirring times we
live in -- stirring times
And you can mind the old well that used to be in
the middle of the place Thats turned into a solid
iron pump with a large stone trough and all complete
Dear dear -- how the face of nations alter and
what we live to see nowadays Yes -- and tis the same
here Theyve been talking but now of the misesss
strange doings
 What have you been saying about her inquired
Oak sharply turning to the rest and getting very
warm
 These middle-aged men have been pulling her over
the coals for pride and vanity said Mark Clark but
I say let her have rope enough Bless her pretty face
shouldnt I like to do so -- upon her cherry lips
