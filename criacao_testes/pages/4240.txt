him in sheer idleness If I had never played a trick
upon him he would never have wanted to marry me
O if I could only pay some heavy damages in money
to him for the harm I did and so get the sin off my
soul that way Well theres the debt which can
only be discharged in one way and I believe I am
bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power without
any consideration of my own future at all When a
rake gambles away his expectations the fact that it is
an inconvenient debt doesnt make him the less liable
Ive been a rake and the single point I ask you is con+
sidering that my own scruples and the fact that in the
eye of the law my husband is only missing will keep
any man from marrying me until seven years have
passed -- am I free to entertain such an idea even
though tis a sort of penance -- for it will be that I
hate the act of marriage under such circumstances and
the class of women I should seem to belong to by doing
it

It seems to me that all depends upon wher you
think as everybody else do that your husband is
dead
I shall get to I suppose because I cannot help
feeling what would have brought him back long before
this time if he had lived
Well then in religious sense you will be as free
to 1think1 o marrying again as any real widow of one
years standing But why dont ye ask Mr Thirdlys
advice on how to treat Mr Boldwood
No When I want a broad-minded opinion for
general enlightenment distinct from special advice I
never go to a man who deals in the subject pro+
fessionally So I like the parsons opinion on law the
lawyers on doctoring the doctors on business and my
business-mans -- that is yours -- on morals
And on love --  -- 
My own
Im afraid theres a hitch in that argument said
Oak with a grave smile
She did not reply at once and then saying Good
evening Mr Oak went away
She had spoken frankly and neither asked nor ex+
pected any reply from Gabriel more satisfactory than
that she had obtained Yet in the centremost parts of
her complicated heart there existed at this minute a
little pang of disappointment for a reason she would
not allow herself to recognize Oak had not once
wished her free that he might marry her himself -- had
not once said I could wait for you as well as he
That was the insect sting Not that she would have
listened to any such hypothesis O no -- for wasnt
she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future
were improper and wasnt Gabriel far too poor a man
to speak sentiment to her Yet he might have just
hinted about that old love of his and asked in a playful
off-hand way if he might speak of it It would have
seemed pretty and sweet if no more and then she
would have shown how kind and inoffensive a womans
No can sometimes be But to give such cool advice
 -- the very advice she had asked for -- it ruffled our
heroine all the afternoon

CONVERGING COURSES
        I
CHRISTMAS-EVE came and a party that Boldwood
was to give in the evening was the great subject of talk
in Weatherbury It was not that the rarity of Christmas
parties in the parish made this one a wonder but that
Boldwood should be the giver The announcement
had had an abnormal and incongruous sound as if one
should hear of croquet-playing in a cathedral aisle or
that some much-respected judge was going upon the
stage That the party was intended to be a truly jovial
one there was no room for doubt A large bough of
mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day and
suspended in the hall of the bachelors home Holly
and ivy had followed in armfuls From six that morning
till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared
and sparkled at its highest the kettle the saucepan and
the threeiegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames
like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego  moreover
roasting and basting operations were continually
carried on in front of the genial blaze
As it grew later the fire was made up in the large
long hall into which the staircase descended and all
encumbrances were cleared out for dancing The log
which was to form the back-brand of the evening fire
was the uncleft trunk of a tree so unwieldy that it could
be neither brought nor rolled to its place  and accord+
ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving
it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew
near
In spite of all this the spirit of revelry was wanting
In the atmosphere of the house Such a thing had
never been attempted before by its owner and it was
now done as by a wrench Intended gaieties would
insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs the organ+
ization of the whole effort was
