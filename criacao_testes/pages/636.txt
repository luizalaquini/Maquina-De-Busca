But the Dornishman’s blade had a song of its own

and a bite sharp and cold as a leech





Beside the brazier a short but immensely broad man sat on a stool eating a hen off a skewer Hot grease was running down his chin and into his snow-white beard but he smiled happily all the same Thick gold bands graven with runes bound his massive arms and he wore a heavy shirt of black ringmail that could only have come from a dead ranger A few feet away a taller leaner man in a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales stood frowning over a map a two-handed greatsword slung across his back in a leather sheath He was straight as a spear all long wiry muscle clean-shaved bald with a strong straight nose and deepset grey eyes He might even have been comely if he’d had ears but he had lost both along the way whether to frostbite or some enemy’s knife Jon could not tell Their lack made the man’s head seem narrow and pointed

Both the white-bearded man and the bald one were warriors that was plain to Jon at a glance These two are more dangerous than Rattleshirt by far He wondered which was Mance Rayder

Jon Snow Your Grace He wondered whether he was expected to bend the knee as well

Your Grace The earless man looked at the big white-bearded one You see He takes me for a king

The bearded man laughed so hard he sprayed bits of chicken everywhere He rubbed the grease from his mouth with the back of a huge hand A blind boy must be Who ever heard of a king without ears Why his crown would fall straight down to his neck Har He grinned at Jon wiping his fingers clean on his breeches Close your beak crow Spin yourself around might be you’d find who you’re looking for

Jon turned
