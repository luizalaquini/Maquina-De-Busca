Your sister would not approve my lord

My sister would soil her smallclothes He smiled in the dark I saw no signs of any of her spies skulking after me

I am pleased to hear it my lord Some of your sister’s hirelings are mine as well unbeknownst to her I should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen

Well I’d hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for naught

Scarcely for naught Varys assured him They know you are here Whether any will be bold enough to enter Chataya’s in the guise of patrons I cannot say but I find it best to err on the side of caution

How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance

The tunnel was dug for another King’s Hand whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence

And yet you knew of it

Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel Careful the steps are steep

They emerged through a trap at the back of a stable having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under Rhaenys’s Hill A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about A mule and three horses occupied the stalls He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth Old he said and I have my doubts about his wind

He is not a mount to carry you into battle true Varys replied but he will serve and attract no notice As will the others And the stableboys see and hear only the animals The eunuch took a cloak from a peg It was roughspun sun-faded and threadbare but very ample in its cut If you will permit me When he swept it over Tyrion’s shoulders it enveloped him head to heel with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows Men see what they expect to see Varys said as he fussed and pulled Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children so a child is what they will see A boy in an old cloak on his father’s horse going about his father’s business Though it would be best if you came most often by night

I plan to… after today At the moment though Shae awaits me He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King’s Landing not far from the sea but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed

Which horse will you have

Tyrion shrugged This one will do well enough

I shall saddle him for you Varys took tack and saddle down from a peg

Tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly You missed a lively council Stannis has crowned himself it seems

I know

He accuses my brother and sister of incest I wonder how he came by that suspicion

Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard’s hair as Ned Stark did and Jon Arryn before him Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear The eunuch’s laugh was not his usual giggle but deeper and more throaty

Someone like you perchance

Am I suspected It was not me

If it had been would you admit it

No But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long It is one thing to deceive a king and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney Besides the bastards were there for all to see

Robert’s bastards What of them

He fathered eight to the best of my knowing Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle Their mothers were copper and honey chestnut and butter yet the babes were all black as ravens… and as ill-omened it would seem So when Joffrey Myrcella and Tommen slid out between your sister’s thighs each as golden as the sun the truth was not hard to glimpse

Tyrion shook his head If she had borne only one child for her husband it would have been enough to disarm suspicion… but then she would not have been Cersei If you were not this whisperer who was

Some traitor doubtless Varys tightened the cinch

Littlefinger

I named no name

Tyrion let the eunuch help him mount Lord Varys he said from the saddle sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King’s Landing and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy

How odd I think quite the same of you





BRAN

Long before the first pale fingers of light pried apart Bran’s shutters his eyes were open

There were guests in Winterfell visitors come for the harvest feast This morning they would be tilting at quintains in the yard Once that prospect would have filled him with excitement but that was before

Not now The Walders would break lances with the squires of Lord Manderly’s escort but Bran would have no part of it He must play the prince in his father’s solar Listen and it may be that you will learn something of what lordship is all about Maester Luwin had said

Bran had never asked to be a prince It was knighthood he had always dreamed of bright armor and streaming banners lance and sword a warhorse between his legs Why must he waste his days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood Because you’re broken a voice inside reminded him A lord on his cushioned chair might be crippled—the Walders said their grandfather was so feeble he had to be carried everywhere in a litter—but not a knight on his destrier Besides it was his duty You are your brother’s heir and the Stark in Winterfell Ser Rodrik said reminding him of how Robb used to sit with their lord father when his bannermen came to see him

Lord Wyman Manderly had arrived from White Harbor two days past traveling by barge and litter as he was too fat to sit a horse With him had come a long tail of retainers knights squires lesser lords and ladies heralds musicians even a juggler all aglitter with banners and surcoats in what seemed half a hundred colors Bran had welcomed them to Winterfell from his father’s high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms and afterward Ser Rodrik had said he’d done well If that had been the end of it he would not have minded But it was only the beginning

The feast makes a pleasant pretext Ser Rodrik explained but a man does not cross a hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine Only those who have matters of import to set before us are like to make the journey

Bran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above his head Robb would tell him not to play the boy he knew He could almost hear him and their lord father as well Winter is coming and you are almost a man grown Bran You have a duty

When Hodor came bustling in smiling and humming tunelessly he found the boy resigned to his fate Together they got him washed and brushed The white wool doublet today Bran commanded And the silver brooch Ser Rodrik will want me to look lordly As much as he could Bran preferred to dress himself but there were some tasks—pulling on breeches lacing his boots—that vexed him They went quicker with Hodor’s help Once he had been taught to do something he did it deftly His hands were always gentle though his strength was astonishing You could have been a knight too I bet Bran told him If the gods hadn’t taken your wits you would have been a great knight

Hodor Hodor blinked at him with guileless brown eyes eyes innocent of understanding

Yes said Bran Hodor He pointed

On the wall beside the door hung a basket stoutly made of wicker and leather with holes cut for Bran’s legs Hodor slid his arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight around his chest then knelt beside the bed Bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support himself as he swung the dead weight of his legs into the basket and through the holes

Hodor Hodor said again rising The stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by himself on his back Bran’s head almost brushed the ceiling He ducked low as they passed through the door One time Hodor smelled bread baking and ran to the kitchens and Bran got such a crack that Maester Luwin had to sew up his scalp Mikken had given him a rusty old visorless helm from the armory but Bran seldom troubled to wear it The Walders laughed whenever they saw it on his head

He rested his hands on Hodor’s shoulders as they descended the winding stair Outside the sounds of sword and shield and horse already rang through the yard It made a sweet music I’ll just have a look Bran thought a quick look that’s all

The White Harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning with their knights and men-at-arms Until then the yard belonged to their squires who ranged in age from ten to forty Bran wished he were one of them so badly that his stomach hurt with the wanting

Two quintains had been erected in the courtyard each a stout post supporting a spinning crossbeam with a shield at one end and a padded butt at the other The shields had been painted red-and-gold though the Lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen and already well scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at them

The sight of Bran in his basket drew stares from those who had not seen it before but he had learned to ignore stares At least he had a good view on Hodor’s back he towered over everyone The Walders were mounting up he saw They’d brought fine armor up from the Twins shining silver plate with enameled blue chasings Big Walder’s crest was shaped like a castle while Little Walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk Their shields and surcoats also set them apart from each other Little Walder quartered the twin towers of Frey with the brindled boar of his grandmother’s House and the plowman of his mother’s Crakehall and Darry respectively Big Walder’s quarterings were the tree-and-ravens of House Blackwood and the twining snakes of the Paeges They must be hungry for honor Bran thought as he watched them take up their lances A Stark needs only the direwolf
