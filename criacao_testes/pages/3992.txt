no reason to alter it If we move swiftly maybe we can
reach Snows mansion before the mutts reach us But
theres a sloppiness that comes with speed the poorly
placed boot that results in a splash the accidental clang of
a gun against a pipe even my own commands issued too
loudly for discretion
Weve covered about three more blocks via an
overflow pipe and a section of neglected train track when
the screams begin Thick guttural Bouncing off the tunnel
walls
Avoxes says Peeta immediately Thats what
Darius sounded like when they tortured him
The mutts must have found them says Cressida
So theyre not just after Katniss says Leeg 1
Theyll probably kill anyone Its just that they wont stop
until they get to her says Gale After his hours studying
with Beetee he is most likely right
And here I am again With people dying because of
me Friends allies complete strangers losing their lives for
the Mockingjay Let me go on alone Lead them off Ill
transfer the Holo to Jackson The rest of you can finish the
mission
No ones going to agree to that says Jackson in
exasperation
Were wasting time says Finnick
Listen Peeta whispers
The screams have stopped and in their absence my
name has rebounded startling in its proximity Its below as
well as behind us now Katniss
I nudge Pollux on the shoulder and we start to run
Trouble is we had planned to descend to a lower level but
thats out now When we come to the steps leading down
Pollux and I are scanning for a possible alternative on the
Holo when I start gagging
Masks on orders Jackson
Theres no need for masks Everyone is breathing the
same air Im the only one losing my stew because Im the
only one reacting to the odor Drifting up from the stairwell
Cutting through the sewage Roses I begin to tremble
I swerve away from the smell and stumble right out
onto the Transfer Smooth pastel-colored tiled streets just
like the ones above but bordered by white brick walls
instead of homes A roadway where delivery vehicles can
drive with ease without the congestion of the Capitol
Empty now of everything but us I swing up my bow and
blow up the first pod with an explosive arrow which kills the
nest of flesh-eating rats inside Then I sprint for the next
intersection where I know one false step will cause the
ground beneath our feet to disintegrate feeding us into
something labeled Meat Grinder I shout a warning to the
others to stay with me I plan for us to skirt around the
corner and then detonate the Meat Grinder but another
unmarked pod lies in wait
It happens silently I would miss it entirely if Finnick
didnt pull me to a stop Katniss
I whip back around arrow poised for flight but what
can be done Two of Gales arrows already lie useless
beside the wide shaft of golden light that radiates from
ceiling to floor Inside Messalla is as still as a statue
poised up on the ball of one foot head tilted back held
captive by the beam I cant tell if hes yelling although his
mouth is stretched wide We watch utterly helpless as the
flesh melts off his body like candle wax
Cant help him Peeta starts shoving people forward
Cant Amazingly hes the only one still functional enough
to get us moving I dont know why hes in control when he
should be flipping out and bashing my brains in but that
could happen any second At the pressure of his hand
against my shoulder I turn away from the grisly thing that
was Messalla I make my feet go forward fast so fast that I
can barely skid to a stop before the next intersection
A spray of gunfire brings down a shower of plaster I
jerk my head from side to side looking for the pod before I
turn and see the squad of Peacekeepers pounding down
the Transfer toward us With the Meat Grinder pod blocking
our way theres nothing to do but fire back They outnumber
us two to one but weve still got six original members of the
Star Squad who arent trying to run and shoot at the same
time
Fish in a barrel I think as blossoms of red stain their
white uniforms Three-quarters of them are down and dead
when more begin to pour in from the side of the tunnel the
same one I flung myself through to get away from the smell
from the--
Those arent Peacekeepers
They are white four-limbed about the size of a fullgrown
human but thats where the comparisons stop
Naked with long reptilian tails arched backs and heads
that jut forward They swarm over the Peacekeepers living
and dead clamp on to their necks with their mouths and rip
off the helmeted heads Apparently having a Capitol
pedigree is as useless here as it was in 13 It seems to
take only seconds before the Peacekeepers are
decapitated The mutts fall to their bellies and skitter toward
us on all fours
This way I shout hugging the wall and making a
sharp right turn to avoid the pod When everyones joined
me I fire into the intersection and the Meat Grinder
activates Huge mechanical teeth burst through the street
and chew the tile to dust That should make it impossible
