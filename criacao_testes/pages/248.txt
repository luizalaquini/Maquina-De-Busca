Frowning Jon continued on his way He led the mare for half an hour until she was dry Ghost did not appear Jon wanted to mount up and ride again but he was concerned about his missing wolf Ghost he called again Where are you To me Ghost Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf even a half-grown direwolf unless… no Ghost was too smart to attack a bear and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling

He should eat he decided Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up There was no danger yet Castle Black still slept In his saddlebag he found a biscuit a piece of cheese and a small withered brown apple He’d brought salt beef as well and a rasher of bacon he’d filched from the kitchens but he would save the meat for the morrow After it was gone he’d need to hunt and that would slow him

Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad He kept the apple for last It had gone a little soft but the flesh was still tart and juicy He was down to the core when he heard the sounds horses and from the north Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare Could he outrun them No they were too close they’d hear him for a certainty and if they were from Castle Black…

He led the mare off the road behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels Ouiet now he said in a hushed voice crouching down to peer through the branches If the gods were kind the riders would pass by Likely as not they were only smallfolk from Mole’s Town farmers on their way to their fields although what they were doing out in the middle of the night…

He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad From the sound there were five or six of them at the least Their voices drifted through the trees

…certain he came this way

We can’t be certain

He could have ridden east for all you know Or left the road to cut through the woods That’s what I’d do

In the dark Stupid If you didn’t fall off your horse and break your neck you’d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up

I would not Grenn sounded peeved I’d just ride south you can tell south by the stars

What if the sky was cloudy Pyp asked

Then I wouldn’t go

Another voice broke in You know where I’d be if it was me I’d be in Mole’s Town digging for buried treasure Toad’s shrill laughter boomed through the trees Jon’s mare snorted

Keep quiet all of you Haider said I thought I heard something

Where I didn’t hear anything The horses stopped

You can’t hear yourself fart

I can too Grenn insisted

Quiet

They all fell silent listening Jon found himself holding his breath Sam he thought He hadn’t gone to the Old Bear but he hadn’t gone to bed either he’d woken the other boys Damn them all Come dawn if they were not in their beds they’d be named deserters too What did they think they were doing

The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on From where Jon crouched he could see the legs of their horses through the branches Finally Pyp spoke up What did you hear

I don’t know Haider admitted A sound I thought it might have been a horse but…

There’s nothing here

Out of the corner of his eye Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees Leaves rustled and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows so suddenly that Jon’s mare started and gave a whinny There Halder shouted

I heard it too

Traitor Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle He turned the mare’s head to slide off through the trees but they were on him before he had gone ten feet

Jon Pyp shouted after him

Pull up Grenn said You can’t outrun us all
