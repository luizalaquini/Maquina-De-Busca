Yoren spat There’s for your ghosts He tossed the stick down in the mud Mount up

Arya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal Evil King Harren had walled himself up inside so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre Nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers Sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning all burnt up Arya didn’t really believe that and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago Hot Pie was being silly it wouldn’t be ghosts at Harrenhal it would be knights Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe That was what knights did they kept you safe especially women Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl

The river track was no kingsroad yet it was not half bad for what it was and for once the wagons rolled along smartly They saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall a snug little thatch-roofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat Yoren rode out ahead hallooing but got no answer Dead might be Or hiding Dobber Rey with me The three men went into the cottage Pots is gone no sign o’ any coin laid by Yoren muttered when they returned No animals Run most like Might be we met ‘em on the kingsroad At least the house and field had not been burned and there were no corpses about Tarber found a garden out back and they pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before they went on their way

A little farther up the road they glimpsed a forester’s cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall both deserted They passed more fields wheat and corn and barley ripening in the sun but here there were no men sitting in trees nor walking the rows with scythes Finally the town came into view a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast a big sept with a shingled wooden roof the lord’s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west… and no sign of any people anywhere

Yoren sat on his horse frowning through his tangle of beard Don’t like it he said but there it is We’ll go have us a look A careful look See maybe there’s some folk hiding Might be they left a boat behind or some weapons we can use

The black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl and split the rest of them into four groups of five to search the town Keep your eyes and ears open he warned them before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling or his guards

Arya found herself with Gendry Hot Pie and Lommy Squat kettle-bellied Woth had pulled an oar on a galley once which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor so Yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat As they rode between the silent white houses gooseprickles crawled up Arya’s arms This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they’d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything What could scare them so much

The sun was low to the west and the houses cast long dark shadows A sudden clap of sound made Arya reach for Needle but it was only a shutter banging in the wind After the open river shore the closeness of the town unnerved her

When she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees Arya put her knees into her horse galloping past Woth and Gendry She burst out onto the grassy sward beside the pebbled shore The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper It was the biggest lake she had ever seen with no hint of a far shore She saw a rambling inn to her left built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings To her right a long pier jutted into the lake and there were other docks farther east wooden fingers reaching out from the town But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn its bottom thoroughly rotted out They’re gone Arya said dejected What would they do now

There’s an inn Lommy said when the others rode up Do you think they left any food Or ale

Let’s go see Hot Pie suggested

Never you mind about no inn snapped Woth Yoren said we’re to find a boat

They took the boats Somehow Arya knew it was true they could search the whole town and they’d find no more than the upside-down rowboat Despondent she climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake The water lapped softly around her legs A few lantern bugs were coming out their little lights blinking on and off The green water was warm as tears but there was no salt in it It tasted of summer and mud and growing things Arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar They felt good She wished she could take off her clothes and swim gliding through the warm water like an skinny pink otter Maybe she could swim all the way to Winterfell

Woth was shouting at her to help search so she did peering into boathouses and sheds while her horse grazed along the shore They found some sails some nails buckets of tar gone hard and a mother cat with a litter of new-born kittens But no boats

The town was as dark as any forest when Yoren and the others reappeared Tower’s empty he said Lord’s gone off to fight maybe or to get his smallfolk to safety no telling Not a horse or pig left in town but we’ll eat Saw a goose running loose and some chickens and there’s good fish in the Gods Eye

The boats are gone Arya reported

We could patch the bottom of that rowboat said Koss

Might do for four o’ us Yoren said

There’s nails Lommy pointed out And there’s trees all around We could build us all boats

Yoren spat You know anything ’bout boat-building dyer’s boy Lommy looked blank

A raft suggested Gendry Anyone can build a raft and long poles for pushing

Yoren looked thoughtful Lake’s too deep to pole across but if we stayed to the shallows near shore… it’d mean leaving the wagons Might be that’s best I’ll sleep on it

Can we stay at the inn Lommy asked

We’ll stay in the holdfast with the gates barred the old man said I like the feel o’ stone walls about me when I sleep

Arya could not keep quiet We shouldn’t stay here she blurted The people didn’t They all ran off even their lord

Arry’s scared Lommy announced braying laughter

I’m not she snapped back but they were
