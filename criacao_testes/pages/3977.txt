her to us But a few words from Finnick call her back
Delly who Ive known since I was little but never gave
much thought to has grown in my estimation She was told
what Peeta said to me that night after the wedding but
shes not a gossip Haymitch says shes the best defender I
have when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me
Always taking my side blaming his negative perceptions
on the Capitols torture She has more influence on him than
any of the others do because he really does know her
Anyway even if shes sugarcoating my good points I
appreciate it Frankly I could use a little sugarcoating
Im starving and the stew is so delicious--beef
potatoes turnips and onions in a thick gravy--that I have to
force myself to slow down All around the dining hall you
can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring
on The way it can make people kinder funnier more
optimistic and remind them its not a mistake to go on
living Its better than any medicine So I try to make it last
and join in the conversation Sop up the gravy on my bread
and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous
story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat Laugh
before I realize hes standing there Directly across the
table behind the empty seat next to Johanna Watching
me I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my
throat
Peeta says Delly Its so nice to see you outand
about
Two large guards stand behind him He holds his tray
awkwardly balanced on his fingertips since his wrists are
shackled with a short chain between them
Whats with the fancy bracelets asks Johanna
Im not quite trustworthy yet says Peeta I cant even
sit here without your permission He indicates the guards
with his head
Sure he can sit here Were old friends says
Johanna patting the space beside her The guards nod
and Peeta takes a seat Peeta and I had adjoining cells in
the Capitol Were very familiar with each others screams
Annie whos on Johannas other side does that thing
where she covers her ears and exits reality Finnick shoots
Johanna an angry look as his arm encircles Annie
What My head doctor says Im not supposed to
censor my thoughts Its part of my therapy replies
Johanna
The life has gone out of our little party Finnick
murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her
hands Then theres a long silence while people pretend to
eat
Annie says Delly brightly did you know it was
Peeta who decorated your wedding cake Back home his
family ran the bakery and he did all the icing
Annie cautiously looks across Johanna Thank you
Peeta It was beautiful
My pleasure Annie says Peeta and I hear that old
note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone
forever Not that its directed at me But still
If were going to fit in that walk we better go Finnick
tells her He arranges both of their trays so he can carry
them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other
Good seeing you Peeta
You be nice to her Finnick Or I might try and take her
away from you It could be a joke if the tone wasnt so
cold Everything it conveys is wrong The open distrust of
Finnick the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie
that Annie could desert Finnick that I do not even exist
Oh Peeta says Finnick lightly Dont make me sorry
I restarted your heart He leads Annie away after giving me
a concerned glance
When theyre gone Delly says in a reproachful voice
He did save your life Peeta More than once
For her He gives me a brief nod For the rebellion
Not for me I dont owe him anything
I shouldnt rise to the bait but I do Maybe not But
Mags is dead and youre still here That should count for
something
Yeah a lot of things should count for something that
dont seem to Katniss Ive got some memories I cant
make sense of and I dont think the Capitol touched them
A lot of nights on the train for instance he says
Again the implications That more happened on the
train than did That what did happen--those nights I only
kept my sanity because his arms were around me--no
longer matters Everything a lie everything a way of
misusing him
Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon
connecting Gale and me So are you two officially a
couple now or are they still dragging out the star-crossed
lover thing
Still dragging says Johanna
Spasms cause Peetas hands to tighten into fists then
splay out in a bizarre fashion Is it all he can do to keep
them from my neck I can feel the tension in Gales muscles
next to me fear an altercation But Gale simply says I
wouldnt have believed it if I hadnt seen it myself
Whats that asks Peeta
You Gale answers
Youll have to be a little more specific says Peeta
What about me
That theyve replaced you with the evil-mutt version of
yourself says Johanna
