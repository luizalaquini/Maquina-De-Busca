714 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children
unclean but now are they holy

715 But if the unbelieving depart let him depart A brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases but God hath called us to
peace

716 For what knowest thou O wife whether thou shalt save thy
husband  or how knowest thou O man whether thou shalt save thy
wife  717 But as God hath distributed to every man as the Lord hath
called every one so let him walk And so ordain I in all churches

718 Is any man called being circumcised let him not become
uncircumcised Is any called in uncircumcision let him not be
circumcised

719 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the
keeping of the commandments of God

720 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called

721 Art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou
mayest be made free use it rather

722 For he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lords
freeman likewise also he that is called being free is Christs
servant

723 Ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men

724 Brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with
God

725 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord yet I
give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be
faithful

726 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress I
say that it is good for a man so to be

727 Art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed Art thou
loosed from a wife seek not a wife

728 But and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin
marry she hath not sinned Nevertheless such shall have trouble in
the flesh but I spare you

729 But this I say brethren the time is short it remaineth that
both they that have wives be as though they had none 730 And they
that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though
they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not
731 And they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion
of this world passeth away

732 But I would have you without carefulness He that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the
Lord 733 But he that is married careth for the things that are of
the world how he may please his wife

734 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin The
unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord that she may be
holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for
the things of the world how she may please her husband

735 And this I speak for your own profit not that I may cast a snare
upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon
the Lord without distraction

736 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let
him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry

737 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no
necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in
his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well

738 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that
giveth her not in marriage doeth better

739 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but
if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she
will only in the Lord

740 But she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and I
think also that I have the Spirit of God

81 Now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all
have knowledge Knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth

82 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing
yet as he ought to know

83 But if any man love God the same is known of him

84 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in
the world and that there is none other God but one
