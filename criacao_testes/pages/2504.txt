people and bring his blood within the vail and do with that blood as
he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat and before the mercy seat 1616 And he shall make an atonement
for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of
Israel and because of their transgressions in all their sins and so
shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth
among them in the midst of their uncleanness

1617 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place until he come
out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household
and for all the congregation of Israel

1618 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD and
make an atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bullock
and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar
round about

1619 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of Israel

1620 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and
the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the
live goat 1621 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of
the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
of Israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting
them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of
a fit man into the wilderness 1622 And the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness

1623 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation
and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went
into the holy place and shall leave them there 1624 And he shall
wash his flesh with water in the holy place and put on his garments
and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering
of the people and make an atonement for himself and for the people

1625 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar

1626 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
clothes and bathe his flesh in water and afterward come into the
camp

1627 And the bullock for the sin offering and the goat for the sin
offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in
the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung

1628 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp

1629 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the
seventh month on the tenth day of the month ye shall afflict your
souls and do no work at all whether it be one of your own country
or a stranger that sojourneth among you 1630 For on that day shall
the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that ye may be
clean from all your sins before the LORD

1631 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you and ye shall afflict
your souls by a statute for ever

1632 And the priest whom he shall anoint and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priests office in his fathers stead
shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen clothes even the
holy garments 1633 And he shall make an atonement for the holy
sanctuary and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
congregation and for the altar and he shall make an atonement for
the priests and for all the people of the congregation

1634 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an
atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year
And he did as the LORD commanded Moses

171 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 172 Speak unto Aaron and
unto his sons and unto all the children of Israel and say unto them
This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded saying 173 What man
soever there be of the house of Israel that killeth an ox or lamb
or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp 174 And
bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD
blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man
shall be cut off from among his people 175 To the end that the
children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the
open field even that they may bring them unto the LORD unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest and offer them
for peace offerings unto the LORD

176 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and burn the
fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD

177 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils after
whom they have gone a whoring This shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations

178 And thou shalt say unto them Whatsoever man there be of the
house of Israel or of the strangers which sojourn among you that
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice 179 And bringeth it not unto
