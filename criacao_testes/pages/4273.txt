singing
Vowels are frequently nasalized too
A very effective demonstration of the amount of nasalization in ordinary
speech can be obtained by cutting a nose-shaped hole in a large
baffle which divides a room speaking normally with ones nose in the hole
and having someone listen on the other side
The frequency of occurrence of
nasal sounds and the volume of sound that is emitted
through the nose are both surprisingly large
Interestingly enough when we say in conversation that someone sounds
nasal we usually mean non-nasal  When the nasal passages are
blocked by a cold nasal sounds are missing em

When the nasal cavity is switched in to the vocal tract it introduces
formant resonances just as the oral cavity does
Although we cannot
alter the shape of the nasal tract significantly the nasal formant
pattern is not fixed because the oral tract does play a part in nasal
resonances
If you say
ul
m
ul
n
and
ul
ng
continuously you can hear the difference and feel how it is produced by
altering the combined nasaloral tract resonances with your tongue position
The nasal cavity operates in parallel with
the oral one  this causes the two resonance patterns to be summed
together with resulting complications which will be discussed in Chapter 5
rh Sound sources
Speech involves sounds other than those caused by regular vibration of
the larynx
When you whisper the folds of the larynx are held slightly
apart so that the air passing between them becomes turbulent causing a noisy excitation
of the resonant cavity
The formant peaks are still present superimposed on the noise  Such
aspirated sounds occur in the
ul
h
of hello and for a very short time
after the lips are opened at the beginning of pit
pp
Constrictions made in the mouth produce hissy noises such as
ul
ss
ul
sh
and
ul
f
For example in
ul
ss
the tip of the tongue is high up
very close to the roof of the mouth
Turbulent air passing through this constriction causes a
random noise excitation known as frication
Actually the roof of the mouth is quite a complicated object
You can feel with your tongue a bony hump or ridge just behind the front
teeth and it is this that forms a constriction with the tongue for
ul
s
In
ul
sh
the tongue is flattened close to the roof of the mouth slightly farther back
in a position rather similar to that for
ul
ee
but with a narrower
constriction
while
ul
f
is produced with the upper teeth and lower lip
Because they are made near the front of the mouth
the resonances of the vocal tract have little effect on these fricative
sounds

To distinguish them from aspiration and frication the ordinary speech
