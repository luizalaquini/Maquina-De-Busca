1028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of
the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all
the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the
king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho

1029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah and all Israel with him unto
Libnah and fought against Libnah 1030 And the LORD delivered it
also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel and he smote it
with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he
let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto
the king of Jericho

1031 And Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him unto
Lachish and encamped against it and fought against it 1032 And the
LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel which took it on the
second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls
that were therein according to all that he had done to Libnah

1033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua
smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining

1034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon and all Israel with
him and they encamped against it and fought against it 1035 And
they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and
all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day
according to all that he had done to Lachish

1036 And Joshua went up from Eglon and all Israel with him unto
Hebron and they fought against it 1037 And they took it and smote
it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the
cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none
remaining according to all that he had done to Eglon but destroyed
it utterly and all the souls that were therein

1038 And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to Debir and
fought against it 1039 And he took it and the king thereof and all
the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none
remaining as he had done to Hebron so he did to Debir and to the
king thereof as he had done also to Libnah and to her king

1040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south
and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none
remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the LORD God of
Israel commanded

1041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza and all
the country of Goshen even unto Gibeon

1042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel

1043 And Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to
Gilgal

111 And it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
things that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of
Shimron and to the king of Achshaph 112 And to the kings that were
on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of Chinneroth
and in the valley and in the borders of Dor on the west 113 And to
the Canaanite on the east and on the west and to the Amorite and the
Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the mountains and to
the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh

114 And they went out they and all their hosts with them much
people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with
horses and chariots very many

115 And when all these kings were met together they came and pitched
together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel

116 And the LORD said unto Joshua Be not afraid because of them for
to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before
Israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with
fire

117 So Joshua came and all the people of war with him against them
by the waters of Merom suddenly and they fell upon them

118 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel who smote
them and chased them unto great Zidon and unto Misrephothmaim and
unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they
left them none remaining

119 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him he houghed their
horses and burnt their chariots with fire

1110 And Joshua at that time turned back and took Hazor and smote
the king thereof with the sword for Hazor beforetime was the head of
all those kingdoms

1111 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe
and he burnt Hazor with fire

1112 And all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them
did Joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he
utterly destroyed them as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded

1113 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength Israel
