children

1628 And Moses said Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me
to do all these works for I have not done them of mine own mind

1629 If these men die the common death of all men or if they be
visited after the visitation of all men then the LORD hath not sent
me

1630 But if the LORD make a new thing and the earth open her mouth
and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go
down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have
provoked the LORD

1631 And it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these
words that the ground clave asunder that was under them 1632 And
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses
and all the men that appertained unto Korah and all their goods

1633 They and all that appertained to them went down alive into the
pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the
congregation

1634 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
them for they said Lest the earth swallow us up also

1635 And there came out a fire from the LORD and consumed the two
hundred and fifty men that offered incense

1636 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 1637 Speak unto Eleazar
the son of Aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the
burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed

1638 The censers of these sinners against their own souls let them
make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered
them before the LORD therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a
sign unto the children of Israel

1639 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they
that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a
covering of the altar 1640 To be a memorial unto the children of
Israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron come near
to offer incense before the LORD that he be not as Korah and as his
company as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses

1641 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron saying Ye have killed the
people of the LORD

1642 And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against
Moses and against Aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the
LORD appeared

1643 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
congregation

1644 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 1645 Get you up from
among this congregation that I may consume them as in a moment And
they fell upon their faces

1646 And Moses said unto Aaron Take a censer and put fire therein
from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the
congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone
out from the LORD the plague is begun

1647 And Aaron took as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the
congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and
he put on incense and made an atonement for the people

1648 And he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was
stayed

1649 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of Korah

1650 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation and the plague was stayed

171 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 172 Speak unto the
children of Israel and take of every one of them a rod according to
the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the
house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon
his rod

173 And thou shalt write Aarons name upon the rod of Levi for one
rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers

174 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony where I will meet with you

175 And it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom I shall
choose shall blossom and I will make to cease from me the murmurings
of the children of Israel whereby they murmur against you

176 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel and every one of
their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to
their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of Aaron was
among their rods
