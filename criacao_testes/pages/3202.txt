538 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and
seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly

539 And when he was come in he saith unto them Why make ye this
ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth

540 And they laughed him to scorn But when he had put them all out
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were
with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying

541 And he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her Talitha
cumi which is being interpreted Damsel I say unto thee arise

542 And straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the
age of twelve years And they were astonished with a great
astonishment

543 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it and
commanded that something should be given her to eat

61 And he went out from thence and came into his own country and
his disciples follow him

62 And when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the
synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying From whence
hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given
unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands  63
Is not this the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and
Joses and of Juda and Simon and are not his sisters here with us
And they were offended at him

64 But Jesus said unto them A prophet is not without honour but in
his own country and among his own kin and in his own house

65 And he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folk and healed them

66 And he marvelled because of their unbelief And he went round
about the villages teaching

67 And he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by
two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits 68 And
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a
staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse 69 But be
shod with sandals and not put on two coats

610 And he said unto them In what place soever ye enter into an
house there abide till ye depart from that place

611 And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart
thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against
them

Verily I say unto you It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city

612 And they went out and preached that men should repent

613 And they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that
were sick and healed them

614 And king Herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad
and he said That John the Baptist was risen from the dead and
therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him

615 Others said That it is Elias And others said That it is a
prophet or as one of the prophets

616 But when Herod heard thereof he said It is John whom I
beheaded he is risen from the dead

617 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and
bound him in prison for Herodias sake his brother Philips wife for
he had married her

618 For John had said unto Herod It is not lawful for thee to have
thy brothers wife

619 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have
killed him but she could not 620 For Herod feared John knowing
that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he
heard him he did many things and heard him gladly

621 And when a convenient day was come that Herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of
Galilee 622 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and
danced and pleased Herod and them that sat with him the king said
unto the damsel Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it
thee

623 And he sware unto her Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me I will
give it thee unto the half of my kingdom

624 And she went forth and said unto her mother What shall I ask
And she said The head of John the Baptist

625 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked
saying I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
John the Baptist
