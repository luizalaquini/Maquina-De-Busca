Tyrion shook his head We need someone who can do more than repeat our words and fetch back a reply Our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly

The Hand speaks with the king’s voice Candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in Cersei’s eyes If we send you Tyrion it will be as if Joffrey went himself And who better You wield words as skillfully as Jaime wields a sword

Are you that eager to get me out of the city Cersei You are too kind sister but it seems to me that a boy’s mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle And you have a gift for winning friends that I could never hope to match

Her eyes narrowed Joff needs me at his side

Your Grace my lord Hand said Littlefinger the king needs both of you here Let me go in your stead

You What gain does he see in this Tyrion wondered

I am of the king’s council yet not the king’s blood so I would make a poor hostage I knew Ser Loras passing well when he was here at court and gave him no cause to mislike me Mace Tyrell bears me no enmity that I know of and I flatter myself that I am not unskilled in negotiation

He has us Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish nor did he want the man out of his sight yet what other choice was left him It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself and he knew full well that if he left King’s Landing for any length of time all that he had managed to accomplish would be undone There is fighting between here and Bitterbridge he said cautiously And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brother’s wayward lambs

I’ve never been frightened of shepherds It’s the sheep who trouble me Still I suppose an escort might be in order

I can spare a hundred gold cloaks Tyrion said

Five hundred

Three hundred

And forty more—twenty knights with as many squires If I arrive without a knightly tail the Tyrells will think me of small account

That was true enough Agreed

I’ll include Horror and Slobber in my party and send them on to their lord father afterward A gesture of goodwill We need Paxter Redwyne he’s Mace Tyrell’s oldest friend and a great power in his own right

And a traitor the queen said balking The Arbor would have declared for Renly with all the rest except that Redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it

Renly is dead Your Grace Littlefinger pointed out and neither Stannis nor Lord Paxter will have forgotten how Redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of Storm’s End Restore the twins and perchance we may win Redwyne’s love

Cersei remained unconvinced The Others can keep his love I want his swords and sails Holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that we’ll have them

Tyrion had the answer Then let us send Ser Hobber back to the Arbor and keep Ser Horas here Lord Paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that I should think

The suggestion was carried without protest but Littlefinger was not done We’ll want horses Swift and strong The fighting will make remounts hard to come by A goodly supply of gold will also be needed for those gifts we spoke of earlier

Take as much as you require If the city falls Stannis will steal it all anyway

I’ll want my commission in writing A document that will leave Mace Tyrell in no doubt as to my authority granting me full power to treat with him concerning this match and any other arrangements that might be required and to make binding pledges in the king’s name It should be signed by Joffrey and every member of this council and bear all our seals

Tyrion shifted uncomfortably Done Will that be all I remind you there’s a long road between here and Bitterbridge

I’ll be riding it before dawn breaks Littlefinger rose I trust that on my return the king will see that I am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause

Varys giggled Joffrey is such a grateful sovereign I’m certain you will have no cause to complain my good brave lord

The queen was more direct What do you want Petyr

Littlefinger glanced at Tyrion with a sly smile I shall need to give that some consideration No doubt I’ll think of something He sketched an airy bow and took his leave as casual as if he were off to one of his brothels

Tyrion glanced out the window The fog was so thick that he could not even see the curtain wall across the yard A few dim lights shone indistinct through that greyness A foul day for travel he thought He did not envy Petyr Baelish We had best see to drawing up those documents Lord Varys send for parchment and quill And someone will need to wake Joffrey

It was still grey and dark when the meeting finally ended Varys scurried off alone his soft slippers whisking along the floor The Lannisters lingered a moment by the door How comes your chain brother the queen asked as Ser Preston fastened a vair-lined cloth-of-silver cloak about her shoulders

Link by link it grows longer We should thank the gods that Ser Cortnay Penrose is as stubborn as he is Stannis will never march north with Storm’s End untaken in his rear

Tyrion I know we do not always agree on policy but it seems to me that I was wrong about you You are not so big a fool as I imagined In truth I realize now that you have been a great help For that I thank you You must forgive me if I have spoken to you harshly in the past

Must I He gave her a shrug a smile Sweet sister you have said nothing that requires forgiveness

Today you mean They both laughed    and Cersei leaned over and planted a quick soft kiss on his brow

Too astonished for words Tyrion could only watch her stride off down the hall Ser Preston at her side Have I lost my wits or did my sister just kiss me he asked Bronn when she was gone

Was it so sweet

It was    unanticipated Cersei had been behaving queerly of late Tyrion found it very unsettling I am trying to recall the last time she kissed me I could not have been more than six or seven Jaime had dared her to do it

The woman’s finally taken note of your charms

No Tyrion said No the woman is hatching something Best find out what Bronn You know I hate surprises





THEON

Theon wiped the spittle off his cheek with the back of his hand Robb will gut you Greyjoy Benfred Tallheart screamed He’ll feed your turncloak’s heart to his wolf you piece of sheep dung

Aeron Damphair’s voice cut through the insults like a sword through cheese Now you must kill him

I have questions for him first said Theon

Fuck your questions Benfred hung bleeding and helpless between Stygg and Werlag You’ll choke on them before you get any answers from me craven Turncloak

Uncle Aeron was relentless When he spits on you he spits on all of us He spits on the Drowned God He must die

My father gave me the command here Uncle

And sent me to counsel you

And to watch me Theon dare not push matters too far with his uncle The command was his yes but his men had a faith in the Drowned God that they did not have in him and they were terrified of Aeron Damphair I cannot fault them for that

You’ll lose your head for this Greyjoy The crows will eat the jelly of your eyes Benfred tried to spit again but only managed a little blood The Others bugger your wet god
