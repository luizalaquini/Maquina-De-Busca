I don’t want to race Bran looked around for the direwolves Both had vanished into the wood Did you hear Summer howling last night

Grey Wind was restless too Robb said His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt and a reddish stubble covered his jaw making him look older than his fifteen years Sometimes I think they know things… sense things… Robb sighed I never know how much to tell you Bran I wish you were older

I’m eight now Bran said Eight isn’t so much younger than fifteen and I’m the heir to Winterfell after you

So you are Robb sounded sad and even a little scared Bran I need to tell you something There was a bird last night From King’s Landing Maester Luwin woke me

Bran felt a sudden dread Dark wings dark words Old Nan always said and of late the messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie from Mother but that had not been good news either She did not say when she meant to return only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner Bran had sort of liked the little man yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine There was something about the Lannisters something he ought to remember but when he tried to think what he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen Afterward riders were sent out on fast horses carrying Robb’s commands throughout the north Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top of the Neck No one ever told him what was happening yet he knew it was not good

And now another raven another message Bran clung to hope Was the bird from Mother Is she coming home

The message was from Alyn in King’s Landing Jory Cassel is dead And Wyl and Heward as well Murdered by the Kingslayer Robb lifted his face to the snow and the flakes melted on his cheeks May the gods give them rest

Bran did not know what to say He felt as if he’d been punched Jory had been captain of the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born They killed Jory He remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate or sitting at his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall joking as he ate Why would anyone kill Jory

Robb shook his head numbly the pain plain in his eyes I don’t know and… Bran that’s not the worst of it Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight Alyn says his leg was shattered and… Maester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy but they aren’t sure when… when he… The sound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road to where Theon and the others were coming up When he will wake Robb finished He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord Bran I promise you whatever might happen I will not let this be forgotten

Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful What will you do he asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them

Theon thinks I should call the banners Robb said

Blood for blood For once Greyjoy did not smile His lean dark face had a hungry look to it and black hair fell down across his eyes

Only the lord can call the banners Bran said as the snow drifted down around them

If your father dies Theon said Robb will be Lord of Winterfell

He won’t die Bran screamed at him

Robb took his hand He won’t die not Father he said calmly Still… the honor of the north is in my hands now When our lord father took his leave of us he told me to be strong for you and for Rickon I’m almost a man grown Bran

Bran shivered I wish Mother was back he said miserably He looked around for Maester Luwin his donkey was visible in the far distance trotting over a rise Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too

The maester is timid as an old woman said Theon

Father always listened to his counsel Bran reminded his brother Mother too

I listen to him Robb insisted I listen to everyone

The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone melted away like the snowflakes on his face Not so long ago the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement but now he felt only dread Can we go back now he asked I’m cold

Robb glanced around We need to find the wolves Can you stand to go a bit longer

I can go as long as you can Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short for fear of saddle sores but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was

Let’s hunt down the hunters then Robb said Side by side they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood Theon dropped back and followed well behind them talking and joking with the guardsmen

It was nice under the trees Bran kept Dancer to a walk holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went He knew this wood but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time The smells filled his nostrils the sharp fresh tang of pine needles the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider

Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind until Bran could no longer hear their voices From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters It grew louder until they reached the stream Tears stung his eyes

Bran Robb asked What’s wrong
