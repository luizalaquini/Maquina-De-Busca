812 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering unto the LORD to make an atonement for
the Levites

813 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons
and offer them for an offering unto the LORD

814 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
Israel and the Levites shall be mine

815 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer
them for an offering

816 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
Israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the
firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto me

817 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both
man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of
Egypt I sanctified them for myself

818 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
children of Israel

819 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
from among the children of Israel to do the service of the children
of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an
atonement for the children of Israel that there be no plague among
the children of Israel when the children of Israel come nigh unto the
sanctuary

820 And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of
Israel did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded
Moses concerning the Levites so did the children of Israel unto them

821 And the Levites were purified and they washed their clothes and
Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD and Aaron made an
atonement for them to cleanse them

822 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron and before his sons as
the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites so did they unto
them

823 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 824 This is it that
belongeth unto the Levites from twenty and five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation 825 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease
waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more 826 But
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service Thus shalt
thou do unto the Levites touching their charge

91 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
Egypt saying 92 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover
at his appointed season

93 In the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in
his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according
to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it

94 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel that they should keep
the passover

95 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the wilderness of Sinai according to all that the
LORD commanded Moses so did the children of Israel

96 And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a
man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on that day 97 And those men said unto
him We are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept
back that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed
season among the children of Israel  98 And Moses said unto them
Stand still and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning
you

99 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 910 Speak unto the
children of Israel saying If any man of you or of your posterity
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar
off yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD

911 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs

912 They shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone
of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep
it

913 But the man that is clean and is not in a journey and
forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people because he brought not the offering of the LORD
in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin

914 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the
passover unto the LORD according to the ordinance of the passover
