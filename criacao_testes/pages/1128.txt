Stubborn boy the maester sighed setting his book aside Would you like to go see

I can’t Hodor won’t go and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer

I believe I can solve that difficulty

In place of Hodor the wildling woman Osha was summoned She was tall and tough and uncomplaining willing to go wherever she was commanded I lived my life beyond the Wall a hole in the ground won’t fret me none m’lords she said

Summer come Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms The direwolf left his bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth Maester Luwin went ahead with a torch Bran did not even mind—too badly—that she carried him in her arms and not on her back Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha’s chain struck off since she had served faithfully and well since she had been at Winterfell She still wore the heavy iron shackles around her ankles—a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted—but they did not hinder her sure strides down the steps

Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts It had been before for certain When he was little he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and his sisters

He wished they were here now the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom then stopped lifted his head and sniffed the chill dead air He bared his teeth and crept backward eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester’s torch Even Osha hard as old iron seemed uncomfortable Grim folk by the look of them she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones

They were the Kings of Winter Bran whispered Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place

Osha smiled Winter’s got no king If you’d seen it you’d know that summer boy

They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years Maester Luwin said lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces Some were hairy and bearded shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet Others were shaved clean their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps Hard men for a hard time Come He strode briskly down the vault past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures A tongue of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went

The vault was cavernous longer than Winterfell itself and Jon had told him once that there were other levels underneath vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried It would not do to lose the light Summer refused to move from the steps even when Osha followed the torch Bran in her arms

Do you recall your history Bran the maester said as they walked Tell Osha who they were and what they did if you can

He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him The maester had told him the stories and Old Nan had made them come alive That one is Jon Stark When the sea raiders landed in the east he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor His son was Rickard Stark not my father’s father but another Rickard he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter Theon Stark’s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard They called him the ‘Hungry Wolf’ because he was always at war That’s a Brandon the tall one with the dreamy face he was Brandon the Shipwright because he loved the sea His tomb is empty He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again His son was Brandon the Burner because he put the torch to all his father’s ships in grief There’s Rodrik Stark who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts And that’s Torrhen Stark the King Who Knelt He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror Oh there he’s Cregan Stark He fought with Prince Aemon once and the Dragonknight said he’d never faced a finer swordsman They were almost at the end now and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him And there’s my grandfather Lord Rickard who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him Not me another Brandon my father’s brother They’re not supposed to have statues that’s only for the lords and the kings but my father loved them so much he had them done

The maid’s a fair one Osha said

Robert was betrothed to marry her but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her Bran explained Robert fought a war to win her back He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all

A sad tale said Osha but those empty holes are sadder

Lord Eddard’s tomb for when his time comes Maester Luwin said Is this where you saw your father in your dream Bran

Yes The memory made him shiver He looked around the vault uneasily the hairs on the back of his neck bristling Had he heard a noise Was there someone here

Maester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre torch in hand As you see he’s not here Nor will he be for many a year Dreams are only dreams child He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb as into the mouth of some great beast Do you see It’s quite empt—

The darkness sprang at him snarling

Bran saw eyes like green fire a flash of teeth fur as black as the pit around them Maester Luwin yelled and threw up his hands The torch went flying from his fingers caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark and tumbled to the statue’s feet the flames licking up his legs In the drunken shifting torchlight they saw Luwin struggling with the direwolf beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other

Summer Bran screamed

And Summer came shooting from the dimness behind them a leaping shadow He slammed into Shaggydog and knocked him back and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur snapping and biting at each other while Maester Luwin struggled to his knees his arm torn and bloody Osha propped Bran up against Lord Rickard’s stone wolf as she hurried to assist the maester In the light of the guttering torch shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought on the wall and roof

Shaggy a small voice called When Bran looked up his little brother was standing in the mouth of Father’s tomb With one final snap at Summer’s face Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon’s side You let my father be Rickon warned Luwin You let him be

Rickon Bran said softly Father’s not here

Yes he is I saw him Tears glistened on Rickon’s face I saw him last night

In your dream…

Rickon nodded You leave him You leave him be He’s coming home now like he promised He’s coming home

Bran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before Blood dripped down his arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath Osha the torch he said biting through his pain and she snatched it up before it went out Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle’s likeness That… that beast Luwin went on is supposed to be chained up in the kennels

Rickon patted Shaggydog’s muzzle damp with blood I let him loose He doesn’t like chains He licked at his fingers

Rickon Bran said would you like to come with me

No I like it here

It’s dark here And cold

I’m not afraid I have to wait for Father

You can wait with me Bran said We’ll wait together you and me and our wolves Both of the direwolves were licking wounds now and would bear close watching

Bran the maester said firmly I know you mean well but Shaggydog is too wild to run loose I’m the third man he’s savaged Give him the freedom of the castle and it’s only a question of time before he kills someone The truth is hard but the wolf has to be chained or… He hesitated

…or killed Bran thought but what he said was He was not made for chains We will wait in your tower all of us

That is quite impossible Maester Luwin said

Osha grinned The boy’s the lordling here as I recall She handed Luwin back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again The maester’s tower it is

Will you come Rickon

His brother nodded If Shaggy comes too he said running after Osha and Bran and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow keeping a wary eye on the wolves

Maester Luwin’s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door star charts hung from the walls shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes papers quills and pots of inks were everywhere and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters Their strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester’s wounds under Luwin’s terse instruction This is folly the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream yet when you stop to consider it it’s only natural You miss your lord father and you know that he is a captive Fear can fever a man’s mind and give him queer thoughts Rickon is too young to comprehend—

I’m four now Rickon said He was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the First Keep The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room licking their wounds and gnawing on bones

—too young and—ooh seven hells that burns no don’t stop more Too young as I say but you Bran you’re old enough to know that dreams are only dreams

Some are some aren’t Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash Luwin gasped The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming

Tears were streaming down the maester’s face yet he shook his head doggedly The children… live only in dreams Now Dead and gone Enough that’s enough Now the bandages Pads and then wrap and make it tight I’ll be bleeding

Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals Bran said She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it

And all this they did with magic Maester Luwin said distracted I wish they were here now A spell would heal my arm less painfully and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite He gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye Take a lesson Bran The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword As the children did Here let me show you something He stood abruptly crossed the room and returned with a green jar in his good hand Have a look at these he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads

Bran picked one up It’s made of glass Curious Rickon drifted closer to peer over the table

Dragonglass Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin bandagings in hand
