I’m sending Theon Good day Mother Grey Wind come Robb walked off briskly the direwolf padding beside him

Catelyn could only watch him go Her son and now her king How queer that felt Command she had told him back in Moat Cailin And so he did I am going to visit Father she announced abruptly Come with me Edmure

I need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training I’ll visit him later

If he still lives Catelyn thought but she said nothing Her brother would sooner face battle than that sickroom

The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood A wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past Autumn had come the Conclave had declared but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet For that Catelyn was duly grateful Autumn was always a fearful time with the specter of winter looming ahead Even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last

Hoster Tully Lord of Riverrun lay abed in his solar with its commanding view to the east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle He was sleeping when Catelyn entered his hair and beard as white as his featherbed his once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him

Beside the bed still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak sat her father’s brother the Blackfish His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud Does Robb know you are returned Uncle Ser Brynden Tully was Robb’s eyes and ears the commander of his scouts and outriders

No I came here straight from the stables when they told me the king was holding court His Grace will want to hear my tidings in private first I’d think The Blackfish was a tall lean man grey of hair and precise in his movements his clean-shaven face lined and windburnt How is he he asked and she knew he did not mean Robb

Much the same The maester gives him dreamwine and milk of the poppy for his pain so he sleeps most of the time and eats too little He seems weaker with each day that passes

Does he speak

Yes… but there is less and less sense to the things he says He talks of his regrets of unfinished tasks of people long dead and times long past Sometimes he does not know what season it is or who I am Once he called me by Mother’s name

He misses her still Ser Brynden answered You have her face I can see it in your cheekbones and your jaw…

You remember more of her than I do It has been a long time She seated herself on the bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her father’s face

Each time I ride out I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return Despite their quarrels there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once disowned

At least you made your peace with him

They sat for a time in silence until Catelyn raised her head You spoke of tidings that Robb needed to hear Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto his side almost as if he had heard

Brynden stood Come outside Best if we do not wake him

She followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted three-sided from the solar like the prow of a ship Her uncle glanced up frowning You can see it by day now My men call it the Red Messenger… but what is the message

Catelyn raised her eyes to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned Edmure thinks it’s an omen of victory for Riverrun—he sees a fish with a long tail in the Tully colors red against blue She sighed I wish I had their faith Crimson is a Lannister color

That thing’s not crimson Ser Brynden said Nor Tully red the mud red of the river That’s blood up there child smeared across the sky

Our blood or theirs

Was there ever a war where only one side bled Her uncle gave a shake of the head The riverlands are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye The fighting has spread south to the Blackwater and north across the Trident almost to the Twins Marq Piper and Karyl Vance have won some small victories and this southron lordling Beric Dondarrion has been raiding the raiders falling upon Lord Tywin’s foraging parties and vanishing back into the woods It’s said that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting that he’d slain Dondarrion until he led his column into one of Lord Beric’s traps and got every man of them killed

Some of Ned’s guard from King’s Landing are with this Lord Beric Catelyn recalled May the gods preserve them

Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves if the tales be true her uncle said but your father’s bannermen make a sadder tale Robb should never have let them go They’ve scattered like quail each man trying to protect his own and it’s folly Cat folly Jonos Bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of his castle and his nephew Hendry slain Tytos Blackwood’s swept the Lannisters off his lands but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left him nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert Darry men recaptured their lord’s keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole garrison to the sword even their lord

Catelyn was horrorstruck Darry was only a child

Aye and the last of his line as well The boy would have brought a fine ransom but what does gold mean to a frothing dog like Gregor Clegane That beast’s head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm I vow

Catelyn knew Ser Gregor’s evil reputation yet still…Don’t speak to me of heads Uncle Cersei has mounted Ned’s on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep and left it for the crows and flies Even now it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone Some nights she would wake in darkness half-asleep and for an instant expect to find him there beside her Clegane is no more than Lord Tywin’s catspaw For Tywin Lannister—Lord of Casterly Rock Warden of the West father to Queen Cersei Ser Jaime the Kingslayer and Tyrion the Imp and grandfather to Joffrey Baratheon the new-crowned boy king—was the true danger Catelyn believed

True enough Ser Brynden admitted And Tywin Lannister is no man’s fool He sits safe behind the walls of Harrenhal feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take Gregor is not the only dog he’s loosed Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well and some sellsword out of Qohor who’d sooner maim a man than kill him I’ve seen what they leave behind them Whole villages put to the torch women raped and mutilated butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs… it would sicken even the dead

When Edmure hears this he will rage

And that will be just as Lord Tywin desires Even terror has its purpose Cat Lannister wants to provoke us to battle

Robb is like to give him that wish Catelyn said fretful He is restless as a cat sitting here and Edmure and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on Her son had won two great victories smashing Jaime Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing his leaderless host outside the walls of Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps but from the way some of his bannermen spoke of him he might have been Aegon the Conqueror reborn

Brynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow More fool they My first rule of war Cat—never give the enemy his wish Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing He wants us to march on Harrenhal

Harrenhal Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal the vast fortress that King Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past when the Seven Kingdoms had been seven kingdoms and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands In his pride Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all Westeros Forty years it had taken rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake while Harren’s armies plundered his neighbors for stone lumber gold and workers Thousands of captives died in his quarries chained to his sledges or laboring on his five colossal towers Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer Weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream And when at last Harrenhal stood complete on the very day King Harren took up residence Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at King’s Landing

Catelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to her own children back at Winterfell And King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons the tale always ended For dragons fly Harren and all his line had perished in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress and every house that held Harrenhal since had come to misfortune Strong it might be but it was a dark place and cursed

I would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep Catelyn admitted Yet we must do something Uncle

And soon her uncle agreed I have not told you the worst of it child The men I sent west have brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock

Another Lannister army The thought made her ill Robb must be told at once Who will command

Ser Stafford Lannister it’s said He turned to gaze out over the rivers his red-and-blue cloak stirring in the breeze

Another nephew The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile house

Cousin Ser Brynden corrected Brother to Lord Tywin’s late wife so twice related An old man and a bit of a dullard but he has a son Ser Daven who is more formidable

Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field

We have some time yet before we must face them This lot will be sellswords freeriders and green boys from the stews of Lannisport Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle… and make no mistake Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer He will not rush in heedless He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal

Unless… said Catelyn

Yes Ser Brynden prompted

Unless he must leave Harrenhal she said to face some other threat

Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully Lord Renly

King Renly If she would ask help from the man she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself

Perhaps The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile He’ll want something though

He’ll want what kings always want she said Homage
