As you will Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre who had seated herself at his right hand in the place of high honor Lady Selyse was on his left flashing a smile as bright and brittle as her jewels

Too far Cressen thought dully looking at where Ser Davos was seated Half of the lords bannermen were between the smuggler and the high table I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her cup yet how

Patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth Here we eat fish the fool declared happily waving a cod about like a scepter Under the sea the fish eat us I know I know oh oh oh

Ser Davos moved aside to make room on the bench We all should be in motley tonight he said gloomily as Cressen seated himself for this is fool’s business we’re about The red woman has seen victory in her flames so Stannis means to press his claim no matter what the numbers Before she’s done we’re all like to see what Patchface saw I fear—the bottom of the sea

Cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth His fingers found the hard lumps the crystals made in the wool Lord Stannis

Stannis turned from the red woman but it was Lady Selyse who replied King Stannis You forget yourself Maester

He is old his mind wanders the king told her gruffly What is it Cressen Speak your mind

As you intend to sail it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn…

I make common cause with no one Stannis Baratheon said

No more than light makes common cause with darkness Lady Selyse took his hand

Stannis nodded The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom even as the Lannisters have stolen my throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights They are all usurpers and they are all my enemies

I have lost him Cressen thought despairing If only he could somehow approach Melisandre unseen… he needed but an instant’s access to her cup You are the rightful heir to your brother Robert the true Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and King of the Andals the Rhoynar and the First Men he said desperately but even so you cannot hope to triumph without allies

He has an ally Lady Selyse said R’hllor the Lord of Light the Heart of Fire the God of Flame and Shadow

Gods make uncertain allies at best the old man insisted and that one has no power here

You think not The ruby at Melisandre’s throat caught the light as she turned her head and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet If you will speak such folly Maester you ought to wear your crown again

Yes Lady Selyse agreed Patches’s helm It suits you well old man Put it on again I command you

Under the sea no one wears hats Patchface said I know I know oh oh oh

Lord Stannis’s eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently He always ground his teeth when he was angry Fool he growled at last my lady wife commands Give Cressen your helm

No the old maester thought this is not you not your way you were always just always hard yet never cruel never you did not understand mockery no more than you understood laughter

Patchface danced closer his cowbells ringing clang-a-lang ding-ding clink-clank-clink-clank The maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow Cressen bowed his head beneath the weight His bells clanged Perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth Lady Selyse said

You go too far woman Lord Stannis said He is an old man and he’s served me well

And I will serve you to the last my sweet lord my poor lonely son Cressen thought for suddenly he saw the way Ser Davos’s cup was before him still half-full of sour red He found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup Smooth motions deft I must not fumble now he prayed and the gods were kind In the blink of an eye his fingers were empty His hands had not been so steady for years nor half so fluid Davos saw but no one else he was certain Cup in hand he rose to his feet Mayhaps I have been a fool Lady Melisandre will you share a cup of wine with me A cup in honor of your god your Lord of Light A cup to toast his power 

The red woman studied him If you wish

He could feel them all watching him Davos clutched at him as he left the bench catching his sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened What are you doing he whispered

A thing that must be done Maester Cressen answered for the sake of the realm and the soul of my lord He shook off Davos’s hand spilling a drop of wine on the rushes

She met him beneath the high table with every man’s eyes upon them But Cressen saw only her Red silk red eyes the ruby red at her throat red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own around the cup Her skin felt hot feverish It is not too late to spill the wine Maester

No he whispered hoarsely No
