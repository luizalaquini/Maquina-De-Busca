1616 And it came to pass when Hushai the Archite Davids friend
was come unto Absalom that Hushai said unto Absalom God save the
king God save the king

1617 And Absalom said to Hushai Is this thy kindness to thy friend
why wentest thou not with thy friend  1618 And Hushai said unto
Absalom Nay but whom the LORD and this people and all the men of
Israel choose his will I be and with him will I abide

1619 And again whom should I serve should I not serve in the
presence of his son as I have served in thy fathers presence so
will I be in thy presence

1620 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel Give counsel among you what we
shall do

1621 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom Go in unto thy fathers
concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all Israel shall
hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all
that are with thee be strong

1622 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house and
Absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all
Israel

1623 And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counselled in those
days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God so was all
the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom

171 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom Let me now choose out
twelve thousand men and I will arise and pursue after David this
night 172 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak
handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him
shall flee and I will smite the king only 173 And I will bring back
all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned so all the people shall be in peace

174 And the saying pleased Absalom well and all the elders of
Israel

175 Then said Absalom Call now Hushai the Archite also and let us
hear likewise what he saith

176 And when Hushai was come to Absalom Absalom spake unto him
saying Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after
his saying if not speak thou

177 And Hushai said unto Absalom The counsel that Ahithophel hath
given is not good at this time

178 For said Hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they
be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of
her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not
lodge with the people

179 Behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it
will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that
whosoever heareth it will say There is a slaughter among the people
that follow Absalom

1710 And he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a
lion shall utterly melt for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a
mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men

1711 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
thee from Dan even to Beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person

1712 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so
much as one

1713 Moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all Israel
bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until
there be not one small stone found there

1714 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said The counsel of
Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel For the
LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel to the
intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom

1715 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests Thus
and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel and
thus and thus have I counselled

1716 Now therefore send quickly and tell David saying Lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over
lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him

1717 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel for they might not
be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and
they went and told king David

1718 Nevertheless a lad saw them and told Absalom but they went
both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in Bahurim which
had a well in his court whither they went down

1719 And the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth
and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known
