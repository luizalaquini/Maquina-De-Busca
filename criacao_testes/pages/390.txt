I might If I knew you’d steer me safe into port

Well I know which end of the oar goes in the sea and there’s no one better with ropes and knots One-handed she undid the lacing of his breeches then grinned and stepped lightly away from him A pity I’m a woman wed and new with child

Flustered Theon laced himself back up I need to start back to the castle if you do not come with me I may lose my way for grief and all the islands would be poorer

We couldn’t have that… but I have no horse my lord

You could take my squire’s mount

And leave your poor squire to walk all the way to Pyke

Share mine then

You’d like that well enough The smile again Now would I be behind you or in front

You would be wherever you liked

I like to be on top

Where has this wench been all my life My father’s hall is dim and dank It needs Esgred to make the fires blaze

The lordling has a honeyed tongue

Isn’t that where we began

She threw up her hands And where we end Esgred is yours sweet prince Take me to your castle Let me see your proud towers rising from the sea

I left my horse at the inn Come They walked down the strand together and when Theon took her arm she did not pull away He liked the way she walked there was a boldness to it part saunter and part sway that suggested she would be just as bold beneath the blankets

Lordsport was as crowded as he’d ever seen it swarming with the crews of the longships that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater Ironmen did not bend their knees often nor easily but Theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet as they passed and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head They have finally learned who I am he thought And past time too

Lord Goodbrother of Great Wyk had come in the night before with his main strength near forty longships His men were everywhere conspicuous in their striped goat’s hair sashes It was said about the inn that Otter Gimpknee’s whores were being fucked bowlegged by beardless boys in sashes The boys were welcome to them so far as Theon was concerned A poxier den of slatterns he hoped he’d never see His present companion was more to his taste That she was wed to his father’s shipwright and pregnant to boot only made her more intriguing

Has my lord prince begun choosing his crew Esgred asked as they made their way toward the stable Ho Bluetooth she shouted to a passing seafarer a tall man in bearskin vest and raven-winged helm How fares your bride

Fat with child and talking of twins

So soon Esgred smiled that wicked smile You got your oar in the water quickly

Aye and stroked and stroked and stroked roared the man

A big man Theon observed Bluetooth was it Should I choose him for my Sea Bitch

Only if you mean to insult him Bluetooth has a sweet ship of his own

I have been too long away to know one man from another Theon admitted He’d looked for a few of the friends he’d played with as a boy but they were gone dead or grown into strangers My uncle Victarion has loaned me his own steersman

Rymolf Stormdrunk A good man so long as he’s sober She saw more faces she knew and called out to a passing trio Uller Qarl Where’s your brother Skyte

The Drowned God needed a strong oarsman I fear replied the stocky man with the white streak in his beard

What he means is Eldiss drank too much wine and his fat belly burst said the pink-cheeked youth beside him
