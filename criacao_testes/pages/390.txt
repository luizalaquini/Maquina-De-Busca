228 And it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon
the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the
brethren of Ahaziah that ministered to Ahaziah he slew them

229 And he sought Ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in
Samaria and brought him to Jehu and when they had slain him they
buried him Because said they he is the son of Jehoshaphat who
sought the LORD with all his heart So the house of Ahaziah had no
power to keep still the kingdom

2210 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of
Judah

2211 But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the son
of Ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain
and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber So Jehoshabeath the
daughter of king Jehoram the wife of Jehoiada the priest for she
was the sister of Ahaziah hid him from Athaliah so that she slew
him not

2212 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years and
Athaliah reigned over the land

231 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took
the captains of hundreds Azariah the son of Jeroham and Ishmael the
son of Jehohanan and Azariah the son of Obed and Maaseiah the son of
Adaiah and Elishaphat the son of Zichri into covenant with him

232 And they went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all
the cities of Judah and the chief of the fathers of Israel and they
came to Jerusalem

233 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
house of God And he said unto them Behold the kings son shall
reign as the LORD hath said of the sons of David

234 This is the thing that ye shall do A third part of you entering
on the sabbath of the priests and of the Levites shall be porters of
the doors 235 And a third part shall be at the kings house and a
third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be
in the courts of the house of the LORD

236 But let none come into the house of the LORD save the priests
and they that minister of the Levites they shall go in for they are
holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD

237 And the Levites shall compass the king round about every man
with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the
house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he
cometh in and when he goeth out

238 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the
sabbath for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses

239 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king
Davids which were in the house of God

2310 And he set all the people every man having his weapon in his
hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the
temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about

2311 Then they brought out the kings son and put upon him the
crown and gave him the testimony and made him king And Jehoiada and
his sons anointed him and said God save the king

2312 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king she came to the people into the house of the LORD
2313 And she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the
people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the
singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise
Then Athaliah rent her clothes and said Treason Treason

2314 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the host and said unto them Have her forth of the
ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword For
the priest said Slay her not in the house of the LORD

2315 So they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the kings house they slew her there

2316 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the
people and between the king that they should be the LORDs people

2317 Then all the people went to the house of Baal and brake it
down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew Mattan
the priest of Baal before the altars

2318 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had distributed in the
house of the LORD to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD as it is
written in the law of Moses with rejoicing and with singing as it
was ordained by David

2319 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD
