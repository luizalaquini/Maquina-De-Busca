His face grew serious Yes I played you false in that… and in one other thing as well

Sansa’s stomach was aflutter What other thing

I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle I fear that was a lie as well Something else would please me more He stepped closer This

Sansa tried to step back but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her Feebly she tried to squirm but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him His mouth was on hers swallowing her words He tasted of mint For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss… before she turned her face away and wrenched free What are you doing

Petyr straightened his cloak Kissing a snow maid

You’re supposed to kiss her Sansa glanced up at Lysa’s balcony but it was empty now Your lady wife

I do Lysa has no cause for complaint He smiled I wish you could see yourself my lady You are so beautiful You’re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe How long have you been out here You must be very cold Let me warm you Sansa Take off those gloves give me your hands

I won’t He sounded almost like Marillion the night he’d gotten so drunk at the wedding Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her Ser Lothor was Petyr’s man You shouldn’t kiss me I might have been your own daughter…

Might have been he admitted with a rueful smile But you’re not are you You are Eddard Stark’s daughter and Cat’s But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was when she was your age

Petyr please Her voice sounded so weak Please…

A castle

The voice was loud shrill and childish Littleflnger turned away from her Lord Robert He sketched a bow Should you be out in the snow without your gloves

Did you make the snow castle Lord Littlefinger

Alayne did most of it my lord

Sansa said It’s meant to be Winterfell

Winterfell Robert was small for eight a stick of a boy with splotchy skin and eyes that were always runny Under one arm he clutched the threadbare cloth doll he carried everywhere

Winterfell is the seat of House Stark Sansa told her husband-to-be The great castle of the north

It’s not so great The boy knelt before the gatehouse Look here comes a giant to knock it down He stood his doll in the snow and moved it jerkily Tromp tromp I’m a giant I’m a giant he chanted Ho ho ho open your gates or I’ll mash them and smash them Swinging the doll by the legs he knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other

It was more than Sansa could stand Robert stop that Instead he swung the doll again and a foot of wall exploded She grabbed for his hand but she caught the doll instead There was a loud ripping sound as the thin cloth tore Suddenly she had the doll’s head Robert had the legs and body and the rag-and-sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow

Lord Robert’s mouth trembled You killlllllllllled him he wailed Then he began to shake It started with no more than a little shivering but within a few short heartbeats he had collapsed across the castle his limbs flailing about violently White towers and snowy bridges shattered and fell on all sides Sansa stood horrified but Petyr Baelish seized her cousin’s wrists and shouted for the maester

Guards and serving girls arrived within instants to help restrain the boy Maester Colemon a short time later Robert Arryn’s shaking sickness was nothing new to the people of the Eyrie and Lady Lysa had trained them all to come rushing at the boy’s first cry The maester held the little lord’s head and gave him half a cup of dreamwine murmuring soothing words Slowly the violence of the fit seemed to ebb away till nothing remained but a small shaking of the hands Help him to my chambers Colemon told the guards A leeching will help calm him

It was my fault Sansa showed them the doll’s head I ripped his doll in two I never meant to but…

His lordship was destroying the castle said Petyr

A giant the boy whispered weeping It wasn’t me it was a giant hurt the castle She killed him I hate her She’s a bastard and I hate her I don’t want to be leeched

My lord your blood needs thinning said Maester Colemon It is the bad blood that makes you angry and the rage that brings on the shaking Come now

They led the boy away My lord husband Sansa thought as she contemplated the ruins of Winterfell The snow had stopped and it was colder than before She wondered if Lord Robert would shake all through their wedding At least Joffrey was sound of body A mad rage seized hold of her She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn doll’s head down on top of it then pushed it down atop the shattered gatehouse of her snow castle The servants looked aghast but when Littlefinger saw what she’d done he laughed If the tales be true that’s not the first giant to end up with his head on Winterfell’s walls

Those are only stories she said and left him there
