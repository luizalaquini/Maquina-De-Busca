1311 And all Israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any
such wickedness as this is among you

1312 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the LORD thy
God hath given thee to dwell there saying 1313 Certain men the
children of Belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn
the inhabitants of their city saying Let us go and serve other gods
which ye have not known 1314 Then shalt thou enquire and make
search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing
certain that such abomination is wrought among you 1315 Thou shalt
surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword
destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle
thereof with the edge of the sword

1316 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil
thereof every whit for the LORD thy God and it shall be an heap for
ever it shall not be built again

1317 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand
that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee
mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath
sworn unto thy fathers 1318 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of
the LORD thy God to keep all his commandments which I command thee
this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God

141 Ye are the children of the LORD your God ye shall not cut
yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead

142 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God and the LORD
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the
nations that are upon the earth

143 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing

144 These are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and
the goat 145 The hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the
wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois

146 And every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft
into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall
eat

147 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or
of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and
the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore
they are unclean unto you

148 And the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the
cud it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh nor
touch their dead carcase

149 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have
fins and scales shall ye eat 1410 And whatsoever hath not fins and
scales ye may not eat it is unclean unto you

1411 Of all clean birds ye shall eat

1412 But these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle and the
ossifrage and the ospray 1413 And the glede and the kite and the
vulture after his kind 1414 And every raven after his kind 1415
And the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after
his kind 1416 The little owl and the great owl and the swan 1417
And the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant 1418 And the
stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat

1419 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they
shall not be eaten

1420 But of all clean fowls ye may eat

1421 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou shalt
give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or
thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art an holy people unto
the LORD thy God

Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milk

1422 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the
field bringeth forth year by year

1423 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God in the place which
he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy
wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy
flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always

1424 And if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able
to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the LORD thy
God shall choose to set his name there when the LORD thy God hath
blessed thee 1425 Then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up
the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the LORD
thy God shall choose 1426 And thou shalt bestow that money for
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for
wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and
thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God and thou shalt rejoice
thou and thine household 1427 And the Levite that is within thy
gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance
with thee

1428 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
