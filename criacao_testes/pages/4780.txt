He kissed me Sansa insisted again I never wanted—

Be quiet I haven’t given you leave to speak You enticed him just as your mother did that night in Riverrun with her smiles and her dancing You think I could forget That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort I bled but it was the sweetest hurt He told me he loved me then but he called me Cat just before he fell back to sleep Even so I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten Your mother did not deserve him She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon Stark I would have given him my favor I gave him everything He is mine now Not Catelyn’s and not yours

All of Sansa’s resolve had withered in the face of her aunt’s onslaught Lysa Arryn was frightening her as much as Queen Cersei ever had He’s yours my lady she said trying to sound meek and contrite May I have your leave to go

You may not Her aunt’s breath smelled of wine If you were anyone else I would banish you Send you down to Lord Nestor at the Gates of the Moon or back to the Fingers How would you like to spend your life on that bleak shore surrounded by slatterns and sheep pellets That was what my father meant for Petyr Everyone thought it was because of that stupid duel with Brandon Stark but that wasn’t so Father said I ought to thank the gods that so great a lord as Jon Arryn was willing to take me soiled but I knew it was only for the swords I had to marry Jon or my father would have turned me out as he did his brother but it was Petyr I was meant for I am telling you all this so you will understand how much we love each other how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another We made a baby together a precious little baby Lysa put her hands flat against her belly as if the child was still there When they stole him from me I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again Jon wished to send my sweet Robert to Dragonstone and that sot of a king would have given him to Cersei Lannister but I never let them    no more than I’ll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger Do you hear me Alayne or Sansa or whatever you call yourself Do you hear what I am telling you

Yes I swear I won’t ever kiss him again or    or entice him Sansa thought that was what her aunt wanted to hear

So you admit it now It was you just as I thought You are as wanton as your mother Lysa grabbed her by the wrist Come with me now There is something I want to show you

You’re hurting me Sansa squirmed Please Aunt Lysa I haven’t done anything I swear it

Her aunt ignored her protests Marillion she shouted I need you Marillion I need you

The singer had remained discreetly in the rear of the hall but at Lady Arryn’s shout he came at once My lady

Play us a song Play ‘The False and the Fair’

Marillion’s fingers brushed the strings The lord he came a-riding upon a rainy day hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey   

Lady Lysa pulled at Sansa’s arm It was either walk or be dragged so she chose to walk halfway down the hall and between a pair of pillars to a white weirwood door set in the marble wall The door was firmly closed with three heavy bronze bars to hold it in place but Sansa could hear the wind outside worrying at its edges When she saw the crescent moon carved in the wood she planted her feet The Moon Door She tried to yank free Why are you showing me the Moon Door

You squeak like a mouse now but you were bold enough in the garden weren’t you You were bold enough in the snow

The lady sat a-sewing upon a rainy day Marillion sang Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey

Open the door Lysa commanded Open it I say You will do it or I’ll send for my guards She shoved Sansa forward Your mother was brave at least Lift off the bars

If I do as she says she will let me go Sansa grabbed one of the bronze bars yanked it loose and tossed it down The second bar clattered to the marble then the third She had barely touched the latch when the heavy wooden door flew inward and slammed back against the wall with a bang Snow had piled up around the frame and it all came blowing in at them borne on a blast of cold air that left Sansa shivering She tried to step backward but her aunt was behind her Lysa seized her by the wrist and put her other hand between her shoulder blades propelling her forcefully toward the open door

Beyond was white sky falling snow and nothing else

Look down said Lady Lysa Look down

She tried to wrench free but her aunt’s fingers were digging into her arm like claws Lysa gave her another shove and Sansa shrieked Her left foot broke through a crust of snow and knocked it loose There was nothing in front of her but empty air and a waycastle six hundred feet below clinging to the side of the mountain Don’t Sansa screamed You’re scaring me Behind her Marillion was still playing his woodharp and singing Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey

Do you still want my leave to go Do you

No Sansa planted her feet and tried to squirm backward but her aunt did not budge Not this way Please    She put a hand up her fingers scrabbling at the doorframe but she could not get a grip and her feet were sliding on the wet marble floor Lady Lysa pressed her forward inexorably Her aunt outweighed her by three stone The lady lay a-kissing upon a mound of hay Marillion was singing Sansa twisted sideways hysterical with fear and one foot slipped out over the void She screamed Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey The wind flapped her skirts up and bit at her bare legs with cold teeth She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks Sansa flailed found Lysa’s thick auburn braid and clutched it tight My hair her aunt shrieked Let go of my hair She was shaking sobbing They teetered on the edge Far off she heard the guards pounding on the door with their spears demanding to be let in Marillion broke off his song

Lysa What’s the meaning of this The shout cut through the sobs and heavy breathing Footsteps echoed down the High Hall Get back from there Lysa what are you doing The guards were still beating at the door Littlefinger had come in the back way through the lords’ entrance behind the dais

As Lysa turned her grip loosened enough for Sansa to rip free She stumbled to her knees where Petyr Baelish saw her He stopped suddenly Alayne What is the trouble here

Her Lady Lysa grabbed a handful of Sansa’s hair She’s the trouble She kissed you

Tell her Sansa begged Tell her we were just building a castle   

Be quiet her aunt screamed I never gave you leave to speak No one cares about your castle

She’s a child Lysa Cat’s daughter What did you think you were doing

I was going to marry her to Robert She has no gratitude No    no decency You are not hers to kiss Not hers I was teaching her a lesson that was all

I see He stroked his chin I think she understands now Isn’t that so Alayne

Yes sobbed Sansa I understand

I don’t want her here Her aunt’s eyes were shiny with tears Why did you bring her to the Vale Petyr This isn’t her place She doesn’t belong here

We’ll send her away then Back to King’s Landing if you like He took a step toward them Let her up now Let her away from the door

NO Lysa gave Sansa’s head another wrench Snow eddied around them making their skirts snap noisily You can’t want her You can’t She’s a stupid empty-headed little girl She doesn’t love you the way I have I’ve always loved you I’ve proved it haven’t I Tears ran down her aunt’s puffy red face I gave you my maiden’s gift I would have given you a son too but they murdered him with moon tea with tansy and mint and wormwood a spoon of honey and a drop of pennyroyal It wasn’t me I never knew I only drank what Father gave me   

That’s past and done Lysa Lord Hoster’s dead and his old maester as well Littlefinger moved closer Have you been at the wine again You ought not to talk so much We don’t want Alayne to know more than she should do we Or Marillion

Lady Lysa ignored that Cat never gave you anything It was me who got you your first post who made Jon bring you to court so we could be close to one another You promised me you would never forget that

Nor have I We’re together just as you always wanted just as we always planned Just let go of Sansa’s hair   

I won’t I saw you kissing in the snow She’s just like her mother Catelyn kissed you in the godswood but she never meant it she never wanted you Why did you love her best It was me it was always meeee

I know love He took another step And I am here All you need to do is take my hand come on He held it out to her There’s no cause for all these tears

Tears tears tears she sobbed hysterically No need for tears    but that’s not what you said in King’s Landing You told me to put the tears in Jon’s wine and I did For Robert and for us And I wrote Catelyn and told her the Lannisters had killed my lord husband just as you said That was so clever    you were always clever I told Father that I said Petyr’s so clever he’ll rise high he will he will and he’s sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly    Why did you kiss her Why We’re together now we’re together after so long so very long why would you want to kiss herrrrrr

Lysa Petyr sighed after all the storms we’ve suffered you should trust me better I swear I shall never leave your side again for as long as we both shall live

Truly she asked weeping Oh truly

Truly Now unhand the girl and come give me a kiss

Lysa threw herself into Littlefinger’s arms sobbing As they hugged Sansa crawled from the Moon Door on hands and knees and wrapped her arms around the nearest pillar She could feel her heart pounding There was snow in her hair and her right shoe was missing It must have fallen She shuddered and hugged the pillar tighter

Littlefinger let Lysa sob against his chest for a moment then put his hands on her arms and kissed her lightly My sweet silly jealous wife he said chuckling I’ve only loved one woman I promise you

Lysa Arryn smiled tremulously Only one Oh Petyr do you swear it Only one

Only Cat He gave her a short sharp shove

Lysa stumbled backward her feet slipping on the wet marble And then she was gone She never screamed For the longest time there was no sound but the wind

Marillion gasped You    you   

The guards were shouting outside the door pounding with the butts of their heavy spears Lord Petyr pulled Sansa to her feet You’re not hurt When she shook her head he said Run let my guards in then Quick now there’s no time to lose This singer’s killed my lady wife
