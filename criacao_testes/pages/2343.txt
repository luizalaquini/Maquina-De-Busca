Not a prospect I would relish

Is that so Bronn grinned Admit it Imp Given a choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain you’d have your breeches down and cock up before a man could blink

He knows me too bloody well Tyrion tried a different tack I’d heard that Ser Gregor was wounded on the Red Fork and again at Duskendale The wounds are bound to slow him

Bronn looked annoyed He was never fast Only freakish big and freakish strong I’ll grant you he’s quicker than you’d expect for a man that size He has a monstrous long reach and doesn’t seem to feel blows the way a normal man would

Does he frighten you so much asked Tyrion hoping to provoke him

If he didn’t frighten me I’d be a bloody fool Bronn gave a shrug Might be I could take him Dance around him until he was so tired of hacking at me that he couldn’t lift his sword Get him off his feet somehow When they’re flat on their backs it don’t matter how tall they are Even so it’s chancy One misstep and I’m dead Why should I risk it I like you well enough ugly little whoreson that you are    but if I fight your battle I lose either way Either the Mountain spills my guts or I kill him and lose Stokeworth I sell my sword I don’t give it away I’m not your bloody brother

No said Tyrion sadly You’re not He waved a hand Begone then Run to Stokeworth and Lady Lollys May you find more joy in your marriage bed than I ever found in mine

Bronn hesitated at the door What will you do Imp

Kill Gregor myself Won’t that make for a jolly song

I hope I hear them sing it Bronn grinned one last time and walked out of the door the castle and his life

Pod shuffled his feet I’m sorry

Why Is it your fault that Bronn’s an insolent black-hearted rogue He’s always been an insolent black-hearted rogue That’s what I liked about him Tyrion poured himself a cup of wine and took it to the window seat Outside the day was grey and rainy but the prospect was still more cheerful than his He could send Podrick Payne questing after Shagga he supposed but there were so many hiding places in the deep of the kingswood that outlaws often evaded capture for decades And Pod sometimes has difficulty finding the kitchens when I sent him down for cheese Timett son of Timett would likely be back in the Mountains of the Moon by now And despite what he’d told Bronn going up against Ser Gregor Clegane in his own person would be a bigger farce than Joffrey’s jousting dwarfs He did not intend to die with gales of laughter ringing in his ears So much for trial by combat

Ser Kevan paid him another call later that day and again the day after Sansa had not been found his uncle informed him politely Nor the fool Ser Dontos who’d vanished the same night Did Tyrion have any more witnesses he wished to summon He did not How do I bloody well prove I didn’t poison the wine when a thousand people saw me fill Joff’s cup

He did not sleep at all that night

Instead he lay in the dark staring up at the canopy and counting his ghosts He saw Tysha smiling as she kissed him saw Sansa naked and shivering in fear He saw Joffrey clawing his throat the blood running down his neck as his face turned black He saw Cersei’s eyes Bronn’s wolfish smile Shae’s wicked grin Even thought of Shae could not arouse him He fondled himself thinking that perhaps if he woke his cock and satisfied it he might rest more easily afterward but it was no good

And then it was dawn and time for his trial to begin

It was not Ser Kevan who came for him that morning but Ser Addam Marbrand with a dozen gold cloaks Tyrion had broken his fast on boiled eggs burned bacon and fried bread and dressed in his finest Ser Addam he said I had thought my father might send the Kingsguard to escort me to trial I am still a member of the royal family am I not

You are my lord but I fear that most of the Kingsguard stand witness against you Lord Tywin felt it would not be proper for them to serve as your guards

Gods forbid we do anything improper Please lead on

He was to be tried in the throne room where Joffrey had died As Ser Addam marched him through the towering bronze doors and down the long carpet he felt the eyes upon him Hundreds had crowded in to see him judged At least he hoped that was why they had come For all I know they’re all witnesses against me He spied Queen Margaery up in the gallery pale and beautiful in her mourning Twice wed and twice widowed and only sixteen Her mother stood tall to one side of her her grandmother small on the other with her ladies in waiting and her father’s household knights packing the rest of the gallery

The dais still stood beneath the empty Iron Throne though all but one table had been removed Behind it sat stout Lord Mace Tyrell in a gold mantle over green and slender Prince Oberyn Martell in flowing robes of striped orange yellow and scarlet Lord Tywin Lannister sat between them Perhaps there’s hope for me yet The Dornishman and the Highgardener despised each other If I can find a way to use that   

The High Septon began with a prayer asking the Father Above to guide them to justice When he was done the father below leaned forward to say Tyrion did you kill King Joffrey

He would not waste a heartbeat No

Well that’s a relief said Oberyn Martell dryly

Did Sansa Stark do it then Lord Tyrell demanded

I would have if I’d been her Yet wherever Sansa was and whatever her part in this might have been she remained his wife He had wrapped the cloak of his protection about her shoulders though he’d had to stand on a fool’s back to do it The gods killed Joffrey He choked on his pigeon pie

Lord Tyrell reddened You would blame the bakers

Them or the pigeons Just leave me out of it Tyrion heard nervous laughter and knew he’d made a mistake Guard your tongue you little fool before it digs your grave

There are witnesses against you Lord Tywin said We shall hear them first Then you may present your own witnesses You are to speak only with our leave

There was naught that Tyrion could do but nod

Ser Addam had told it true the first man ushered in was Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard Lord Hand he began after the High Septon had sworn him to speak only truth I had the honor to fight beside your son on the bridge of ships He is a brave man for all his size and I will not believe he did this thing

A murmur went through the hall and Tyrion wondered what mad game Cersei was playing Why offer a witness that believes me innocent He soon learned Ser Balon spoke reluctantly of how he had pulled Tyrion away from Joffrey on the day of the riot He did strike His Grace that’s so It was a fit of wroth no more A summer storm The mob near killed us all

In the days of the Targaryens a man who struck one of the blood royal would lose the hand he struck him with observed the Red Viper of Dorne Did the dwarf regrow his little hand or did you White Swords forget your duty

He was of the blood royal himself Ser Balon answered And the King’s Hand beside

No Lord Tywin said He was acting Hand in my stead

Ser Meryn Trant was pleased to expand on Ser Balon’s account when he took his place as witness He knocked the king to the ground and began kicking him He shouted that it was unjust that His Grace had escaped unharmed from the mobs

Tyrion began to grasp his sister’s plan She began with a man known to be honest and milked him for all he would give Every witness to follow will tell a worse tale until I seem as bad as Maegor the Cruel and Aerys the Mad together with a pinch of Aegon the Unworthy for spice

Ser Meryn went on to relate how Tyrion had stopped Joffrey’s chastisement of Sansa Stark The dwarf asked His Grace if he knew what had happened to Aerys Targaryen When Ser Boros spoke up in defense of the king the Imp threatened to have him killed

Blount himself came next to echo that sorry tale Whatever mislike Ser Boros might harbor toward Cersei for dismissing him from the Kingsguard he said the words she wanted all the same

Tyrion could no longer hold his tongue Tell the judges what Joffrey was doing why don’t you

The big jowly man glared at him You told your savages to kill me if I opened my mouth that’s what I’ll tell them

Tyrion Lord Tywin said You are to speak only when we call upon you Take this for a warning

Tyrion subsided seething

The Kettleblacks came next all three of them in turn Osney and Osfryd told the tale of his supper with Cersei before the Battle of the Blackwater and of the threats he’d made

He told Her Grace that he meant to do her harm said Ser Osfryd To hurt her His brother Osney elaborated He said he would wait for a day when she was happy and make her joy turn to ashes in her mouth Neither mentioned Alayaya

Ser Osmund Kettleblack a vision of chivalry in immaculate scale armor and white wool cloak swore that King Joffrey had long known that his uncle Tyrion meant to murder him It was the day they gave me the white cloak my lords he told the judges That brave boy said to me ‘Good Ser Osmund guard me well for my uncle loves me not He means to be king in my place’

That was more than Tyrion could stomach Liar He took two steps forward before the gold cloaks dragged him back

Lord Tywin frowned Must we have you chained hand and foot like a common brigand

Tyrion gnashed his teeth A second mistake fool fool fool of a dwarf Keep your calm or you’re doomed No I beg your pardons my lords His lies angered me

His truths you mean said Cersei Father I beg you to put him in fetters for your own protection You see how he is
