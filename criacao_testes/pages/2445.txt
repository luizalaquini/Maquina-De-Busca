4728 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years so the
whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years

4729 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die and he called his
son Joseph and said unto him If now I have found grace in thy sight
put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly
with me bury me not I pray thee in Egypt 4730 But I will lie with
my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their
buryingplace And he said I will do as thou hast said

4731 And he said Swear unto me And he sware unto him And Israel
bowed himself upon the beds head

481 And it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph
Behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons
Manasseh and Ephraim

482 And one told Jacob and said Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto
thee and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed

483 And Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
in the land of Canaan and blessed me 484 And said unto me Behold
I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and I will make of thee
a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee
for an everlasting possession

485 And now thy two sons Ephraim and Manasseh which were born unto
thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt are
mine as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine

486 And thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their
inheritance

487 And as for me when I came from Padan Rachel died by me in the
land of Canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come
unto Ephrath and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath the same
is Bethlehem

488 And Israel beheld Josephs sons and said Who are these  489
And Joseph said unto his father They are my sons whom God hath given
me in this place And he said Bring them I pray thee unto me and I
will bless them

4810 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age so that he could not
see

And he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced
them

4811 And Israel said unto Joseph I had not thought to see thy face
and lo God hath shewed me also thy seed

4812 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed
himself with his face to the earth

4813 And Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israels left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israels
right hand and brought them near unto him

4814 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon
Ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon Manassehs
head guiding his hands wittingly for Manasseh was the firstborn

4815 And he blessed Joseph and said God before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did walk the God which fed me all my life long unto
this day 4816 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the
lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers
Abraham and Isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of
the earth

4817 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
head of Ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand
to remove it from Ephraims head unto Manassehs head

4818 And Joseph said unto his father Not so my father for this is
the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head

4819 And his father refused and said I know it my son I know it
he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly
his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall
become a multitude of nations

4820 And he blessed them that day saying In thee shall Israel
bless saying God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh and he set
Ephraim before Manasseh

4821 And Israel said unto Joseph Behold I die but God shall be
with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers

4822 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow

491 And Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves
together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days

492 Gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and
hearken unto Israel your father
