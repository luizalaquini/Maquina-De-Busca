and I will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of
bread 517 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts and they
shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee
and I will bring the sword upon thee I the LORD have spoken it

61 And the word of the LORD came unto me saying 62 Son of man set
thy face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them
63 And say Ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord GOD
Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains and to the hills to the
rivers and to the valleys Behold I even I will bring a sword upon
you and I will destroy your high places

64 And your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be
broken and I will cast down your slain men before your idols

65 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before
their idols and I will scatter your bones round about your altars

66 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the
high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and
made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images
may be cut down and your works may be abolished

67 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know
that I am the LORD

68 Yet will I leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall
escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through
the countries

69 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations
whither they shall be carried captives because I am broken with their
whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which
go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for
the evils which they have committed in all their abominations

610 And they shall know that I am the LORD and that I have not said
in vain that I would do this evil unto them

611 Thus saith the Lord GOD Smite with thine hand and stamp with
thy foot and say Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of
Israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence

612 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is
near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged
shall die by the famine thus will I accomplish my fury upon them

613 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD when their slain men shall
be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill
in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and
under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to
all their idols

614 So will I stretch out my hand upon them and make the land
desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath in
all their habitations and they shall know that I am the LORD

71 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 72 Also thou
son of man thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel An end
the end is come upon the four corners of the land

73 Now is the end come upon thee and I will send mine anger upon
thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense
upon thee all thine abominations

74 And mine eye shall not spare thee neither will I have pity but I
will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in
the midst of thee and ye shall know that I am the LORD

75 Thus saith the Lord GOD An evil an only evil behold is come

76 An end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it
is come

77 The morning is come unto thee O thou that dwellest in the land
the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding
again of the mountains

78 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine
anger upon thee and I will judge thee according to thy ways and will
recompense thee for all thine abominations

79 And mine eye shall not spare neither will I have pity I will
recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are
in the midst of thee and ye shall know that I am the LORD that
smiteth

710 Behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth
the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded

711 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall
remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall
there be wailing for them

712 The time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer
rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude
thereof

713 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold although
