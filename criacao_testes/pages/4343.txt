The word seems to be a sensibly-sized basic unit
Many applications use a rather limited vocabulary em 190 words
for the airline reservation system described in Chapter 1
Even at PCM data rates this will consume less than 05 Mbyte of
storage
Unfortunately coarticulation and prosodic factors now come into play
pp
Real speech is connected em there are few gaps between words
Coarticulation where sounds are affected by those on either side
naturally operates across word boundaries
And the time constants of coarticulation are associated with the
mechanics of the vocal tract and hence measure tens or hundreds
of msec  Thus the effects straddle several pitch periods 100 Hz pitch
has 10 msec period and cannot be simulated by simple interpolation of the
speech waveform
pp
Prosodic features em notably pitch and rhythm em span much longer
stretches of speech than single words  As far as most speech output
applications are concerned they operate at the utterance level of
a single sentence-sized information unit  They cannot be
accomodated if speech waveforms of individual words of
the utterance are stored
for it is rarely feasible to alter the fundamental
frequency or duration of a time waveform without changing all the formant
resonances as well
However both word-to-word coarticulation and the essential features
of rhythm and intonation can be incorporated if the stored words are
coded in source-filter form
pp
For more general applications of speech output the limitations of
word storage soon become apparent  Although peoples daily
vocabularies are not large most words have a variety
of inflected forms which need to be treated separately if a strict
policy is adopted of word storage  For instance in this book
there are 84000 words and 6500 8 different ones counting
inflected forms
In Chapter 1 alone there are 6800 words and 1700 25 different ones
pp
It seems crazy to treat a simple inflection like -s or its voiced
counterpart -z as in inflectionc
ul
sc

as a totally different word from the base form
But once you consider storing roots and endings separately
it becomes apparent
that there is a vast number of different endings and it is difficult to know
where to draw the line  It is natural to think instead of simply
using the syllable as the basic unit
pp
A generous estimate of the number of different syllables in English is 10000
At three a second only about an
hours storage is required for them all  But waveform storage
will certainly not do
Although coarticulation effects between words are needed to make
speech sound fluent coarticulation between syllables is necessary
for it even to be
ul
comprehensible
Adopting a source-filter form of representation is essential as is
some scheme of interpolation between syllables which simulates
coarticulation
Unfortunately a great deal of acoustic action occurs at syllable
boundaries em stops are exploded the sound source changes
between voicing and frication and so on  It may be more appropriate
to consider inverse syllables comprising a vowel-consonant-vowel sequence
instead of consonant-vowel-consonant
These have jokingly been dubbed lisibles
pp
There is again some considerable practical difficulty in creating
an inventory of syllables or lisibles
Now it is not so much the recording that is impractical but
the editing needed to ensure that the cuts between syllables are made
at exactly the right point  As units get smaller the exact
placement of the boundaries becomes ever more critical and several thousand
sensitive editing jobs is no easy task
pp
Since quite general effects of coarticulation must be accomodated
with syllable synthesis there will not necessarily be significant
deterioration if smaller demisyllable units are employed
This reduces the segment inventory to an estimated 1000-2000 entries
and the tedious job of editing each one individually becomes at
least feasible if not enviable
Alternatively the segment inventory could be created by artificial
means involving cut-and-try experiments with resonance parameters
pp
The ultimate in economy of inventory size of course is to use
phonemes as the basic unit  This makes the most critical
part of the task interpolation between units rather than their
construction or recording  With only about 40 phonemes
in English each one can be examined in many different contexts to
ascertain the best data to store
There is no need to record them directly from a human voice em it
would be difficult anyway for most cannot be produced in isolation
In fact a phoneme is an abstract unit not a particular sound
recall the discussion of phonology in Chapter 2 and so it is
most appropriate that data be abstracted from several different
realizations rather than an exact record made of any one
