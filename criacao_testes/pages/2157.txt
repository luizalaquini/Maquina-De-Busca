Her bedchamber was black as pitch Sansa barred the door and fumbled through the dark to the window When she ripped back the drapes her breath caught in her throat

The southern sky was aswirl with glowing shifting colors the reflections of the great fires that burned below Baleful green tides moved against the bellies of the clouds and pools of orange light spread out across the heavens The reds and yellows of common flame warred against the emeralds and jades of wildfire each color flaring and then fading birthing armies of short-lived shadows to die again an instant later Green dawns gave way to orange dusks in half a heartbeat The air itself smelled burnt the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if it was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away Embers drifted through the night air like swarms of fireflies

Sansa backed away from the window retreating toward the safety of her bed I’ll go to sleep she told herself and when I wake it will be a new day and the sky will be blue again The fighting will be done and someone will tell me whether I’m to live or die Lady she whimpered softly wondering if she would meet her wolf again when she was dead

Then something stirred behind her and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her wrist

Sansa opened her mouth to scream but another hand clamped down over her face smothering her His fingers were rough and callused and sticky with blood Little bird I knew you’d come The voice was a drunken rasp

Outside a swirling lance of jade light spit at the stars filling the room with green glare She saw him for a moment all black and green the blood on his face dark as tar his eyes glowing like a dog’s in the sudden glare Then the light faded and he was only a hulking darkness in a stained white cloak

If you scream I’ll kill you Believe that He took his hand from her mouth Her breath was coming ragged The Hound had a flagon of wine on her bedside table He took a long pull Don’t you want to ask who’s winning the battle little bird

Who she said too frightened to defy him

The Hound laughed I only know who’s lost Me

He is drunker than I’ve ever seen him He was sleeping in my bed What does he want here What have you lost

All The burnt half of his face was a mask of dried blood Bloody dwarf Should have killed him Years ago

He’s dead they say

Dead No Bugger that I don’t want him dead He cast the empty flagon aside I want him burned If the gods are good they’ll burn him but I won’t be here to see I’m going

Going She tried to wriggle free but his grasp was iron

The little bird repeats whatever she hears Going yes

Where will you go

Away from here Away from the fires Go out the Iron Gate I suppose North somewhere anywhere

You won’t get out Sansa said The queen’s closed up Maegor’s and the city gates are shut as well

Not to me I have the white cloak And I have this He patted the pommel of his sword The man who tries to stop me is a dead man Unless he’s on fire He laughed bitterly

Why did you come here

You promised me a song little bird Have you forgotten

She didn’t know what he meant She couldn’t sing for him now here with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands I can’t she said Let me go you’re scaring me

Everything scares you Look at me Look at me

The blood masked the worst of his scars but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again Sansa could smell him a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit and over it all the reek of blood blood blood

I could keep you safe he rasped They’re all afraid of me No one would hurt you again or I’d kill them He yanked her closer and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss her He was too strong to fight She closed her eyes wanting it to be over but nothing happened Still can’t bear to look can you she heard him say He gave her arm a hard wrench pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed I’ll have that song Florian and Jonquil you said His dagger was out poised at her throat Sing little bird Sing for your little life

Her throat was dry and tight with fear and every song she had ever known had fled from her mind Please don’t kill me she wanted to scream please don’t She could feel him twisting the point pushing it into her throat and she almost closed her eyes again but then she remembered It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil but it was a song Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

She had forgotten the other verses When her voice trailed off she feared he might kill her but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat never speaking

Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers The room was too dark for her to see him but she could feel the stickiness of the blood and a wetness that was not blood Little bird he said once more his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone Then he rose from the bed Sansa heard cloth ripping followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps

When she crawled out of bed long moments later she was alone She found his cloak on the floor twisted up tight the white wool stained by blood and fire The sky outside was darker by then with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars A chill wind was blowing banging the shutters Sansa was cold She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor shivering

How long she stayed there she could not have said but after a time she heard a bell ringing far off across the city The sound was a deep-throated bronze booming coming faster with each knell Sansa was wondering what it might mean when a second bell joined in and a third their voices calling across the hills and hollows the alleys and towers to every corner of King’s Landing She threw off the cloak and went to her window

The first faint hint of dawn was visible in the east and the Red Keep’s own bells were ringing now joining in the swelling river of sound that flowed from the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor They had rung the bells when King Robert died she remembered but this was different no slow dolorous death knell but a joyful thunder She could hear men shouting in the streets as well and something that could only be cheers

It was Ser Dontos who brought her the word He staggered through her open door wrapped her in his flabby arms and whirled her around and around the room whooping so incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of it He was as drunk as the Hound had been but in him it was a dancing happy drunk She was breathless and dizzy when he let her down What is it She clutched at a bedpost What’s happened Tell me

It’s done Done Done The city is saved Lord Stannis is dead Lord Stannis is fled no one knows no one cares his host is broken the danger’s done Slaughtered scattered or gone over they say Oh the bright banners The banners Jonquil the banners Do you have any wine We ought to drink to this day yes It means you’re safe don’t you see

Tell me what’s happened Sansa shook him

Ser Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other almost falling They came up through the ashes while the river was burning The river Stannis was neck deep in the river and they took him from the rear Oh to be a knight again to have been part of it His own men hardly fought they say Some ran but more bent the knee and went over shouting for Lord Renly What must Stannis have thought when he heard that I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same and the gold cloaks as well We’re delivered sweetling They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank through all the fields Stannis had burned the ashes puffing up around their boots and turning all their armor grey but oh the banners must have been bright the golden rose and golden lion and all the others the Marbrand tree and the Rowan Tarly’s huntsman and Redwyne’s grapes and Lady Oakheart’s leaf All the westermen all the power of Highgarden and Casterly Rock Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side of the river with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left but the vanguard won the fight They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin every man of them howling like some demon in steel And do you know who led the vanguard Do you Do you Do you

Robb It was too much to be hoped but   

It was Lord Renly Lord Renly in his green armor with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand They say he killed Ser Guyard Morrigen himself in single combat and a dozen other great knights as well It was Renly it was Renly it was Renly Oh the banners darling Sansa Oh to be a knight





DAENERYS

She was breaking her fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought her a Qartheen gown an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls Take it away Dany said The docks are no place for lady’s finery

If the Milk Men thought her such a savage she would dress the part for them When she went to the stables she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki fashion and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid I have won no victories she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly
