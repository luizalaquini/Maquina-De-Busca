Ay ever since I was a boy Yes -- mother was
concerned to her heart about it -- yes But twas all
nought
Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it
Joseph Poorgrass  
Oh ay tried all sorts o company They took me
to Greenhill Fair and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble
show where there were women-folk riding round --
standing upon horses with hardly anything on but their
smocks but it didnt cure me a morsel And then I
was put errand-man at the Womens Skittle Alley at the
back of the Tailors Arms in Casterbridge Twas a
horrible sinful situation and a very curious place for a
good man I had to stand and look bady people in
the face from morning till night but twas no use -- I
was just as-bad as ever after all Blushes hev been
in the family for generations There tis a happy pro+
vidence that I be no worse
 True said Jacob Smallbury deepening his thoughts
to a profounder view of the subject Tis a thought
to look at that ye might have been worse but even
as you be tis a very bad affliction for ee Joseph For
ye see shepherd though tis very well for a woman
dang it all tis awkward for a man like him poor
feller  
 Tis -- tis said Gabriel recovering from a medita+
tion  Yes very awkward for the man
 Ay and hes very timid too observed Jan Coggan
Once he had been working late at Yalbury Bottom
and had had a drap of drink and lost his way as he was
coming home-along through Yalbury Wood didnt ye
Master Poorgrass  
 No no no  not that story  expostulated the
modest man forcing a laugh to bury his concern
P 108
 --  --  And so a lost himself quite continued Mr
Coggan with an impassive face implying that a true
narrative like time and tide must run its course and
would respect no man And as he was coming along
in the middle of the night much afeared and not able
to find his way out of the trees nohow a cried out
 Man-a-lost man-a-lost  A owl in a tree happened
to be crying Whoo-whoo-whoo  as owls do you
know shepherd  Gabriel nodded  and Joseph all
in a tremble said  Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury
sir
No no now -- thats too much  said the timid
man becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden
I didnt say sir Ill tike my oath I didnt say  Joseph
Poorgrass o Weatherbury sir No no  whats right
is right and I never said sir to the bird knowing very
well that no man of a gentlemans rank would be
hollering there at that time o night  Joseph Poor+
grass of Weatherbury  -- thats every word I said and
I shouldnt ha said that if t hadnt been for Keeper
Days metheglin There twas a merciful thing it
ended where it did
The question of which was right being tacitly waived
by the company Jan went on meditatively  --
And hes the fearfullest man baint ye Joseph
Ay another time ye were lost by Lambing-Down Gate
werent ye Joseph  
I was replied Poorgrass as if there were some
conditions too serious even for modesty to remember
itself under this being one
 Yes  that were the middle of the night too The
gate would not open try how he would and knowing
there was the Devils hand in it he kneeled down
Ay said Joseph acquiring confidence from the
warmth of the fire the cider and a perception of the
narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to
 My heart died within me that time but I kneeled
down and said the Lords Prayer and then the Belie
THE CHAT
right through and then the Ten Commandments in
earnest prayer But no the gate wouldnt open and
then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren and
thinks I this makes four and tis all I know out of
book and if this dont do it nothing will and Im a
lost man Well when I got to
P 109
Saying After Me I
rose from my knees and found the gate would open
 -- yes neighbours the gate opened the same as ever
  A meditation on the obvious inference wsas indulged
in by all and during its continuance each directed his
vision into the ashpit which glowed like a desert in
the tropics under a vertical sun shaping their eyes long
and liny partly because of the light partly from the
depth of the subject discussed
  Gabriel broke the silence What sort of a place
is this to live at and what sort of a misess is she to
work under Gabriels bosom thrilled gently as he
thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner+
most subject of his heart
  We d know little of her -- nothing She only
showed herself a few days ago Her uncle was took
bad and the doctor was called with his world-wide
skill but he couldnt save the man As I take it
shes going to keep on the farm
