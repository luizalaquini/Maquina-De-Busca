Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door I can stand here all night if I must

The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him Wait in the library There’s wood Start a fire I won’t have the maester catching a chill on account of you

Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon The old man was clad in his bed robe but around his throat was the chain collar of his order A maester did not remove it even to sleep The chair beside the fire would be pleasant he said when he felt the warmth on his face When he was settled comfortably Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door

I am sorry to have woken you Maester Jon Snow said

You did not wake me Maester Aemon replied I find I need less sleep as I grow older and I am grown very old I often spend half the night with ghosts remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion So tell me Jon Snow why have you come calling at this strange hour

To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night’s Watch

This is no concern of Maester Aemon Chett complained

Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne the maester said gently Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow as you surely know Why then come to me

The Lord Commander listens to you Jon told him And the wounded and the sick of the Night’s Watch are in your charge

And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick

He will be Jon promised unless you help

He told them all of it even the part where he’d set Ghost at Rast’s throat Maester Aemon listened silently blind eyes fixed on the fire but Chett’s face darkened with each word Without us to keep him safe Sam will have no chance Jon finished He’s hopeless with a sword My sister Arya could tear him apart and she’s not yet ten If Ser Alliser makes him fight it’s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed

Chett could stand no more I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall he said He is a pig and a hopeless craven as well if what you say is true

Maybe it is so Maester Aemon said Tell me Chett what would you have us do with such a boy

Leave him where he is Chett said The Wall is no place for the weak Let him train until he is ready no matter how many years that takes Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him as the gods will

That’s stupid Jon said He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat

Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly his bony wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links Go on

He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve Jon said remembering I asked why each link was a different metal A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes I said Maester Luwin laughed A maester forges his chain with study he told me The different metals are each a different kind of learning gold for the study of money and accounts silver for healing iron for warcraft And he said there were other meanings as well The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves isn’t that so Lords are gold and knights steel but two links can’t make a chain You also need silver and iron and lead tin and copper and bronze and all the rest and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like A chain needs all sorts of metals and a land needs all sorts of people

Maester Aemon smiled And so

The Night’s Watch needs all sorts too Why else have rangers and stewards and builders Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior and Ser Alliser won’t either You can’t hammer tin into iron no matter how hard you beat it but that doesn’t mean tin is useless Why shouldn’t Sam be a steward

Chett gave an angry scowl I’m a steward You think it’s easy work fit for cowards The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive We hunt and farm tend the horses milk the cows gather firewood cook the meals Who do you think makes your clothing Who brings up supplies from the south The stewards

Maester Aemon was gentler Is your friend a hunter

He hates hunting Jon had to admit

Can he plow a field the maester asked Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship Could he butcher a cow

No

Chett gave a nasty laugh I’ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they’re put to work Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed Give them an axe to split logs and they cut off their own foot

I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone

Yes Maester Aemon prompted

Jon glanced warily at Chett standing beside the door his boils red and angry He could help you he said quickly He can do sums and he knows how to read and write I know Chett can’t read and Clydas has weak eyes Sam read every book in his father’s library He’d be good with the ravens too Animals seem to like him Ghost took to him straight off There’s a lot he could do besides fighting The Night’s Watch needs every man Why kill one to no end Make use of him instead

Maester Aemon closed his eyes and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep Finally he said Maester Luwin taught you well Jon Snow Your mind is as deft as your blade it would seem

Does that mean…

It means I shall think on what you have said the maester told him firmly And now I believe I am ready to sleep Chett show our young brother to the door





TYRION

They had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road Tyrion was gathering deadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream He stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined it critically Will this do I am not practiced at starting fires Morrec did that for me

A fire Bronn said spitting Are you so hungry to die dwarf Or have you taken leave of your senses A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around I mean to survive this journey Lannister

And how do you hope to do that Tyrion asked He tucked the branch under his arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth looking for more His back ached from the effort of bending they had been riding since daybreak when a stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the Bloody Gate and commanded them never to return

We have no chance of fighting our way back Bronn said but two can cover more ground than ten and attract less notice The fewer days we spend in these mountains the more like we are to reach the riverlands Ride hard and fast I say Travel by night and hole up by day avoid the road where we can make no noise and light no fires

Tyrion Lannister sighed A splendid plan Bronn Try it as you like… and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you

You think to outlive me dwarf The sellsword grinned He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen’s shield had cracked a tooth in half

Tyrion shrugged Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy I know you love the taste of horse Bronn but if our mounts die under us this time we’ll be trying to saddle shadowcats… and if truth be told I think the clans will find us no matter what we do Their eyes are all around us He swept a gloved hand over the high wind-carved crags that surrounded them

Bronn grimaced Then we’re dead men Lannister

If so I prefer to die comfortable Tyrion replied We need a fire The nights are cold up here and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits Do you suppose there’s any game to be had Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef hard cheese and stale bread but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester

I can find meat Beneath a fall of black hair Bronn’s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously I should leave you here with your fool’s fire If I took your horse I’d have twice the chance to make it through What would you do then dwarf

Die most like Tyrion stooped to get another stick

You don’t think I’d do it

You’d do it in an instant if it meant your life You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly Bronn had yanked back the man’s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound

He was good as dead Bronn said and his moaning was bringing them down on us Chiggen would have done the same for me… and he was no friend only a man I rode with Make no mistake dwarf I fought for you but I do not love you

It was your blade I needed Tyrion said not your love He dumped his armful of wood on the ground
