my maiden to my husband and she called his name Issachar

3019 And Leah conceived again and bare Jacob the sixth son

3020 And Leah said God hath endued me with a good dowry now will my
husband dwell with me because I have born him six sons and she
called his name Zebulun

3021 And afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name Dinah

3022 And God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened
her womb

3023 And she conceived and bare a son and said God hath taken away
my reproach 3024 And she called his name Joseph and said The LORD
shall add to me another son

3025 And it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph that Jacob
said unto Laban Send me away that I may go unto mine own place and
to my country

3026 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee
and let me go for thou knowest my service which I have done thee

3027 And Laban said unto him I pray thee if I have found favour in
thine eyes tarry for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath
blessed me for thy sake

3028 And he said Appoint me thy wages and I will give it

3029 And he said unto him Thou knowest how I have served thee and
how thy cattle was with me

3030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came and it is now
increased unto a multitude and the LORD hath blessed thee since my
coming and now when shall I provide for mine own house also  3031
And he said What shall I give thee And Jacob said Thou shalt not
give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me I will again
feed and keep thy flock

3032 I will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence
all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among
the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such
shall be my hire

3033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it
shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled
and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be
counted stolen with me

3034 And Laban said Behold I would it might be according to thy
word

3035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and
every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the
sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons

3036 And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob and
Jacob fed the rest of Labans flocks

3037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and
chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white
appear which was in the rods

3038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that
they should conceive when they came to drink

3039 And the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth
cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted

3040 And Jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of
Laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto
Labans cattle

3041 And it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did
conceive that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in
the gutters that they might conceive among the rods

3042 But when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the
feebler were Labans and the stronger Jacobs

3043 And the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and
maidservants and menservants and camels and asses

311 And he heard the words of Labans sons saying Jacob hath taken
away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers
hath he gotten all this glory

312 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was
not toward him as before

313 And the LORD said unto Jacob Return unto the land of thy
fathers and to thy kindred and I will be with thee

314 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
flock 315 And said unto them I see your fathers countenance that
it is not toward me as before but the God of my father hath been with
