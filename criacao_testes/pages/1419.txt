The word hung in the air A frightful word thought Davos Was he being asked to condemn his cellmate Or himself perchance Kings know the penalty for treason better than any man Treason he finally managed weakly

What else would you call it to deny your king and seek to steal his rightful throne I ask you again—what is the penalty for treason under the law

Davos had no choice but to answer Death he said The penalty is death Your Grace

It has always been so I am not… I am not a cruel man Ser Davos You know me Have known me long This is not my decree It has always been so since Aegon’s day and before Daemon Blackfyre the brothers Toyne the Vulture King Grand Maester Hareth… traitors have always paid with their lives… even Rhaenyra Targaryen She was daughter to one king and mother to two more yet she died a traitor’s death for trying to usurp her brother’s crown It is law Law Davos Not cruelty

Yes Your Grace He does not speak of me Davos felt a moment’s pity for his cellmate down in the dark He knew he should keep silent but he was tired and sick of heart and he heard himself say Sire Lord Florent meant no treason

Do smugglers have another name for it I made him Hand and he would have sold my rights for a bowl of pease porridge He would even have given them Shireen Mine only child he would have wed to a bastard born of incest The king’s voice was thick with anger My brother had a gift for inspiring loyalty Even in his foes At Summerhall he won three battles in a single day and brought Lords Grandison and Cafferen back to Storm’s End as prisoners He hung their banners in the hall as trophies Cafferen’s white fawns were spotted with blood and Grandison’s sleeping lion was torn near in two Yet they would sit beneath those banners of a night drinking and feasting with Robert He even took them hunting ‘These men meant to deliver you to Aerys to be burned’ I told him after I saw them throwing axes in the yard ‘You should not be putting axes in their hands’ Robert only laughed I would have thrown Grandison and Cafferen into a dungeon but he turned them into friends Lord Cafferen died at Ashford Castle cut down by Randyll Tarly whilst fighting for Robert Lord Grandison was wounded on the Trident and died of it a year after My brother made them love him but it would seem that I inspire only betrayal Even in mine own blood and kin Brother grandfather cousins good uncle…

Your Grace said Ser Axell I beg you give me the chance to prove to you that not all Florents are so feeble

Ser Axell would have me resume the war King Stannis told Davos The Lannisters think I am done and beaten and my sworn lords have forsaken me near every one Even Lord Estermont my own mother’s father has bent his knee to Joffrey The few loyal men who remain to me are losing heart They waste their days drinking and gambling and lick their wounds like beaten curs

Battle will set their hearts ablaze once more Your Grace Ser Axell said Defeat is a disease and victory is the cure

Victory The king’s mouth twisted There are victories and victories ser But tell your plan to Ser Davos I would hear his views on what you propose

Ser Axell turned to Davos with a look on his face much like the look that proud Lord Belgrave must have worn the day King Baelor the Blessed had commanded him to wash the beggar’s ulcerous feet Nonetheless he obeyed

The plan Ser Axell had devised with Salladhor Saan was simple A few hours’ sail from Dragonstone lay Claw Isle ancient sea-girt seat of House Celtigar Lord Ardrian Celtigar had fought beneath the flery heart on the Blackwater but once taken he had wasted no time in going over to Joffrey He remained in King’s Landing even now Too frightened of His Grace’s wrath to come near Dragonstone no doubt Ser Axell declared And wisely so The man has betrayed his rightful king

Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan’s fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater—Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone more than half of them Florents—to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar’s defection Claw Isle was but lightly garrisoned its castle reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets Volantene glass gold and silver plate jeweled cups magnificent hawks an axe of Valyrian steel a horn that could summon monsters from the deep chests of rubies and more wines than a man could drink in a hundred years Though Celtigar had shown the world a niggardly face he had never stinted on his own comforts Put his castle to the torch and his people to the sword I say Ser Axell concluded Leave Claw Isle a desolation of ash and bone fit only for carrion crows so the realm might see the fate of those who bed with Lannisters

Stannis listened to Ser Axell’s recitation in silence grinding his jaw slowly from side to side When it was done he said It could be done I believe The risk is small Joffrey has no strength at sea until Lord Redwyne sets sail from the Arbor The plunder might serve to keep that Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan loyal for a time By itself Claw Isle is worthless but its fall would serve notice to Lord Tywin that my cause is not yet done The king turned back to Davos Speak truly ser What do you make of Ser Axell’s proposal

Speak truly ser Davos remembered the dark cell he had shared with Lord Alester remembered Lamprey and Porridge He thought of the promises that Ser Axell had made on the bridge above the yard A ship or a shove what shall it be But this was Stannis asking Your Grace he said slowly I make it folly… aye and cowardice

Cowardice Ser Axell all but shouted No man calls me craven before my king

Silence Stannis commanded Ser Davos speak on I would hear your reasons

Davos turned to face Ser Axell You say we ought show the realm we are not done Strike a blow Make war aye… but on what enemy You will find no Lannisters on Claw Isle

We will find traitors said Ser Axell though it may be I could find some closer to home Even in this very room

Davos ignored the jibe I don’t doubt Lord Celtigar bent the knee to the boy Joffrey He is an old done man who wants no more than to end his days in his castle drinking his fine wine out of his jeweled cups He turned back to Stannis Yet he came when you called sire Came with his ships and swords He stood by you at Storm’s End when Lord Renly came down on us and his ships sailed up the Blackwater His men fought for you killed for you burned for you Claw Isle is weakly held yes Held by women and children and old men And why is that Because their husbands and sons and fathers died on the Blackwater that’s why Died at their oars or with swords in their hands fighting beneath our banners Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind to rape their widows and put their children to the sword These smallfolk are no traitors…

They are insisted Ser Axell Not all of Celtigar’s men were slain on the Blackwater Hundreds were taken with their lord and bent the knee when he did

When he did Davos repeated They were his men His sworn men What choice were they given

Every man has choices They might have refused to kneel Some did and died for it Yet they died true men and loyal

Some men are stronger than others It was a feeble answer and Davos knew it Stannis Baratheon was a man of iron will who neither understood nor forgave weakness in others I am losing he thought despairing

It is every man’s duty to remain loyal to his rightful king even if the lord he serves proves false Stannis declared in a tone that brooked no argument

A desperate folly took hold of Davos a recklessness akin to madness As you remained loyal to King Aerys when your brother raised his banners he blurted

Shocked silence followed until Ser Axell cried Treason and snatched his dagger from its sheath Your Grace he speaks his infamy to your face

Davos could hear Stannis grinding his teeth A vein bulged blue and swollen in the king’s brow Their eyes met Put up your knife Ser Axell And leave us

As it please Your Grace—

It would please me for you to leave said Stannis Take yourself from my presence and send me Melisandre

As you command Ser Axell slid the knife away bowed and hurried toward the door His boots rang against the floor angry

You have always presumed on my forbearance Stannis warned Davos when they were alone I can shorten your tongue as easy as I did your fingers smuggler

I am your man Your Grace So it is your tongue to do with as you please

It is he said calmer And I would have it speak the truth Though the truth is a bitter draught at times Aerys If you only knew… that was a hard choosing My blood or my liege My brother or my king He grimaced Have you ever seen the Iron Throne The barbs along the back the ribbons of twisted steel the jagged ends of swords and knives all tangled up and melted It is not a comfortable seat ser Aerys cut himself so often men took to calling him King Scab and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair By that chair to hear some tell it It is not a seat where a man can rest at ease Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted it so desperately

Why would you want it then Davos asked him

It is not a question of wanting The throne is mine as Robert’s heir That is law After me it must pass to my daughter unless Selyse should finally give me a son He ran three fingers lightly down the table over the layers of smooth hard varnish dark with age I am king Wants do not enter into it I have a duty to my daughter To the realm Even to Robert He loved me but little I know yet he was my brother The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him She may have murdered him as well as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark For such crimes there must be justice Starting with Cersei and her abominations But only starting I mean to scour that court clean As Robert should have done after the Trident Ser Barristan once told me that the rot in King Aerys’s reign began with Varys The eunuch should never have been pardoned No more than the Kingslayer At the least Robert should have stripped the white cloak from Jaime and sent him to the Wall as Lord Stark urged He listened to Jon Arryn instead I was still at Storm’s End under siege and unconsulted He turned abruptly to give Davos a hard shrewd look The truth now Why did you wish to murder Lady Melisandre

So he does know Davos could not lie to him Four of my sons burned on the Blackwater She gave them to the flames

You wrong her Those fires were no work of hers Curse the Imp curse the pyromancers curse that fool of Florent who sailed my fleet into the jaws of a trap Or curse me for my stubborn pride for sending her away when I needed her most But not Melisandre She remains my faithful servant

Maester Cressen was your faithful servant She slew him as she killed Ser Cortnay Penrose and your brother Renly

Now you sound a fool the king complained She saw Renly’s end in the flames yes but she had no more part in it than I did The priestess was with me Your Devan would tell you so Ask him if you doubt me She would have spared Renly if she could It was Melisandre who urged me to meet with him and give him one last chance to amend his treason And it was Melisandre who told me to send for you when Ser Axell wished to give you to R’hllor He smiled thinly Does that surprise you

Yes She knows I am no friend to her or her red god

But you are a friend to me She knows that as well He beckoned Davos closer The boy is sick Maester Pylos has been leeching him

The boy His thoughts went to his Devan the king’s squire My son sire

Devan A good boy He has much of you in him It is Robert’s bastard who is sick the boy we took at Storm’s End

Edric Storm I spoke with him in Aegon’s Garden

As she wished As she saw Stannis sighed Did the boy charm you He has that gift He got it from his father with the blood He knows he is a king’s son but chooses to forget that he is bastard-born And he worships Robert as Renly did when he was young My royal brother played the fond father on his visits to Storm’s End and there were gifts… swords and ponies and fur-trimmed cloaks The eunuch’s work every one The boy would write the Red Keep full of thanks and Robert would laugh and ask Varys what he’d sent this year Renly was no better He left the boy’s upbringing to castellans and maesters and every one fell victim to his charm Penrose chose to die rather than give him up The king ground his teeth together It still angers me How could he think I would hurt the boy I chose Robert did I not When that hard day came I chose blood over honor

He does not use the boy’s name That made Davos very uneasy I hope young Edric will recover soon

Stannis waved a hand dismissing his concern It is a chill no more He coughs he shivers he has a fever Maester Pylos will soon set him right By himself the boy is nought you understand but in his veins flows my brother’s blood There is power in a king’s blood she says

Davos did not have to ask who she was

Stannis touched the Painted Table Look at it onion knight My realm by rights My Westeros He swept a hand across it This talk of Seven Kingdoms is a folly Aegon saw that three hundred years ago when he stood where we are standing They painted this table at his command Rivers and bays they painted hills and mountains castles and cities and market towns lakes and swamps and forests… but no borders It is all one One realm for one king to rule alone
