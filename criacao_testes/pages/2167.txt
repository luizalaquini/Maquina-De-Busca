The flayed man of the Dreadfort Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before his capture Theon recalled It was hard to believe that a vile creature like him could sway the Boltons to change their allegiance but nothing else made sense I’ll see this for myself Theon said

Maester Luwin trailed after him By the time they reached the battlements dead men and dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates He saw no battle lines only a swirling chaos of banners and blades Shouts and screams rang through the cold autumn air Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers but the Dreadfort men were better led and had taken the others unawares Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the houses He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified trumpeting of a maimed horse The inn was burning he saw

Black Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time The sun was low in the west painting the fields and houses all a glowing red A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over the walls and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses Theon watched a wounded man drag himself painfully across the ground smearing his life’s blood in the dirt as he struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square He died before he got there He wore a leather jerkin and conical halfhelm but no badge to tell which side he’d fought on

The crows came in the blue dusk with the evening stars The Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead Theon said Maester Luwin had told him that a long time ago

Dothraki

The horselords across the narrow sea

Oh Them Black Lorren frowned through his beard Savages believe all manner of foolish things

As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke At their head was a knight in dark armor His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders Outside the main gate he reined up and one of his men shouted for the castle to open

Are you friend or foe Black Lorren bellowed down

Would a foe bring such fine gifts Red Helm waved a hand and three corpses were dumped in front of the gates A torch was waved above the bodies so the defenders upon the walls might see the faces of the dead

The old castellan said Black Lorren

With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay turned away from the battlements and fell to his knees sick

The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor or we would have brought him as well shouted Red Helm

I am saved Theon thought So why did he feel so empty This was victory sweet victory the deliverance he had prayed for He glanced at Maester Luwin To think how close I came to yielding and taking the black   

Open the gates for our friends Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what his dreams might bring

The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard Pale red pennons trailed from the ends of a few lances but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters How many men did you lose Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted

Twenty or thirty The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man’s face and shoulders skinless and bloody mouth open in a silent howl of anguish

Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one

Aye but he thought us friends A common mistake When the old fool gave me his hand I took half his arm instead Then I let him see my face The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head holding it in the crook of his arm

Reek Theon said disquieted How did a serving man get such fine armor

The man laughed The wretch is dead He stepped closer The girl’s fault If she had not run so far his horse would not have lamed and we might have been able to flee I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge I was done with her by then and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands—calfskin boots and velvet doublet silver-chased swordbelt even my sable cloak Ride for the Dreadfort I told him bring all the help you can Take my horse he’s swifter and here wear the ring my father gave me so they’ll know you came from me He’d learned better than to question me By the time they put that arrow through his back I’d smeared myself with the girl’s filth and dressed in his rags They might have hanged me anyway but it was the only chance I saw He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth And now my sweet prince there was a woman promised me if I brought two hundred men Well I brought three times as many and no green boys nor fieldhands neither but my father’s own garrison

Theon had given his word This was not the time to flinch Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later Harrag he said go to the kennels and bring Palla out for    

Ramsay There was a smile on his plump lips but none in those pale pale eyes Snow my wife called me before she ate her fingers but I say Bolton His smile curdled So you’d offer me a kennel girl for my good service is that the way of it

There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like no more than he liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at him She was what was promised

She smells of dogshit I’ve had enough of bad smells as it happens I think I’ll have your bedwarmer instead What do you call her Kyra

Are you mad Theon said angrily I’ll have you—

The Bastard’s backhand caught him square and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel The world vanished in a red roar of pain

Sometime later Theon found himself on the ground He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood Close the gates he tried to shout but it was too late The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned and more were pouring through a river of mail and sharp swords There was a ringing in his ears and horror all around him Black Lorren had his sword out but there were already four of them pressing in on him He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders then swung back to ride over him Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables Save me the Freys the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward and burn the rest Burn it burn it all

The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze screaming rearing   





TYRION

He dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh The air was full of acrid smoke Men were groaning and whimpering all around him and from time to time a scream would pierce the air thick with pain When he tried to move he found that he had fouled his own bedding The smoke in the air made his eyes water Am I crying He must not let his father see He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock A lion I must be a lion live a lion die a lion He hurt so much though Too weak to groan he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy monotonous voice He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying After a time the room faded

He found himself outside the city walking through a world without color Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps White maggots burrowed through black corruption The wolves were grey and so were the silent sisters together they stripped the flesh from the fallen There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields The sun was a hot white penny shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes My work thought Tyrion Lannister They died at my command

At first there was no sound in the world but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead soft and terrible They wept and moaned they begged for an end to pain they cried for help and wanted their mothers Tyrion had never known his mother He wanted Shae but she was not there He walked alone amidst grey shadows trying to remember   

The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain they were garbed in shades of white and grey and their blood was black and crusty He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon pulled by two tall black horses

So many dead so very many Their corpses hung limply their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas unrecognizable hardly human The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts grey lions dead flowers and pale ghostly stags Their armor was all dented and gashed the chainmail riven broken slashed Why did I kill them all He had known once but somehow he had forgotten

He would have asked one of the silent sisters but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth The discovery terrified him How could he live without a mouth He began to run The city was not far He would be safe inside the city away from all these dead He did not belong with the dead He had no mouth but he was still a living man No a lion a lion and alive But when he reached the city walls the gates were shut against him

It was dark when he woke again At first he could see nothing but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him The drapes were drawn but he could see the shape of carved bedposts and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed and the pillow beneath his head was goose down My own bed I am in my own bed in my own bedchamber

It was warm inside the drapes under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him He was sweating Fever he thought groggily He felt so weak and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand He gave up the effort His head felt enormous as big as the bed too heavy to raise from the pillow His body he could scarcely feel at all How did I come here He tried to remember The battle came back in fits and flashes The fight along the river the knight who’d offered up his gauntlet the bridge of ships   

Ser Mandon He saw the dead empty eyes the reaching hand the green fire shining against the white enamel plate Fear swept over him in a cold rush beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go He would have cried out if he’d had a mouth No that was the dream he thought his head pounding Help me someone help me Jaime Shae Mother someone    Tysha   

No one heard No one came Alone in the dark he fell back into piss-scented sleep He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed with their lord father beside her frowning It had to be a dream since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away fighting Robb Stark in the west Others came and went as well Varys looked down on him and sighed but Littlefinger made a quip Bloody treacherous bastard Tyrion thought venomously we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another but he did not understand the words Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt

He wanted to ask if they’d won the battle We must have else I’d be a head on a spike somewhere If I live we won He did not know what pleased him more the victory or the fact he had been able to reason it out His wits were coming back to him however slowly That was good His wits were all he had

The next time he woke the draperies had been pulled back and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off No don’t go help me help he tried to call but the best he could do was a muffled moan I have no mouth He raised a hand to his face his every movement pained and fumbling His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh lips teeth Linen The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding

A short while later Pod reappeared This time a stranger was with him a maester chained and robed My lord you must be still the man murmured You are grievous hurt You will do yourself great injury Are you thirsty

He managed an awkward nod The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat Tyrion swallowed scarcely tasting Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth he was already spiraling back to sleep

This time he dreamed he was at a feast a victory feast in some great hall He had a high seat on the dais and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero Marillion was there the singer who’d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon He played his woodharp and sang of the Imp’s daring deeds Even his father was smiling with approval When the song was over Jaime rose from his place commanded Tyrion to kneel and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword and he rose up a knight Shae was waiting to embrace him She took him by the hand laughing and teasing calling him her giant of Lannister

He woke in darkness to a cold empty room The draperies had been drawn again Something felt wrong turned around though he could not have said what He was alone once more Pushing back the blankets he tried to sit but the pain was too much and he soon subsided breathing raggedly His face was the least part of it His right side was one huge ache and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm What’s happened to me Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it I was hurt more badly than I knew Ser Mandon   

The memory frightened him but Tyrion made himself hold it turn it in his head stare at it hard He tried to kill me no mistake That part was not a dream He would have cut me in half if Pod had not    Pod where’s Pod

Gritting his teeth he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down half on the rushes and half on him Even that small effort had dizzied him The room whirled around him all bare walls and dark shadows with a single narrow window He saw a chest he’d owned an untidy pile of his clothing his battered armor This is not my bedchamber he realized Not even the Tower of the Hand Someone had moved him His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan They have moved me here to die he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more The room was dank and cold and he was burning
