He tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door They walked down a long dim hallway Summer padding easily beside them The wolf glanced up from time to time eyes smoldering like liquid gold Bran would have liked to touch him but he was riding too high for his hand to reach

The godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become Hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels to the still pool beside the heart tree He stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood humming Bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out of his seat drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker basket He hung for a moment dangling the dark red leaves brushing against his face until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water I want to be by myself for a while he said You go soak Go to the pools

Hodor Hodor stomped through the trees and vanished Across the godswood beneath the windows of the Guest House an underground hot spring fed three small ponds Steam rose from the water day and night and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss Hodor hated cold water and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface

Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran’s side He rubbed the wolf under the jaw and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace Bran had always liked the godswood even before but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him yet somehow he took comfort from that now The gods were looking over him he told himself the old gods gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest his father’s gods He felt safe in their sight and the deep silence of the trees helped him think Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall thinking and dreaming and talking with the gods

Please make it so Robb won’t go away he prayed softly He moved his hand through the cold water sending ripples across the pool Please make him stay Or if he has to go bring him home safe with Mother and Father and the girls And make it… make it so Rickon understands

His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was riding off to war weeping and angry by turns He’d refused to eat cried and screamed for most of a night even punched Old Nan when she tried to sing him to sleep and the next day he’d vanished Robb had set half the castle searching for him and when at last they’d found him down in the crypts Rickon had slashed at them with a rusted iron sword he’d snatched from a dead king’s hand and Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon The wolf was near as wild as Rickon he’d bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken’s thigh It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring him to bay Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now and Rickon cried all the more for being without him

Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell and Bran pleaded with him too for his own sake as much as Rickon’s but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said I don’t want to go I have to

It was only half a lie Someone had to go to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters Bran could understand that but it did not have to be Robb His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy or to one of his lords bannermen Maester Luwin urged him to do just that but Robb would not hear of it My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell he said all Robb the Lord

Robb seemed half a stranger to Bran now transformed a lord in truth though he had not yet seen his sixteenth name day Even their father’s bannermen seemed to sense it Many tried to test him each in his own way Roose Bolton and Robett Glover both demanded the honor of battle command the first brusquely the second with a smile and a jest Stout grey-haired Maege Mormont dressed in mail like a man told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson and had no business giving her commands… but as it happened she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry Soft-spoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him a plump homely maid of thirty years who sat at her father’s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate Jovial Lord Hornwood had no daughters but he did bring gifts a horse one day a haunch of venison the next a silver-chased hunting horn the day after and he asked nothing in return… nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather and hunting rights north of a certain ridge and leave to dam the White Knife if it please the lord

Robb answered each of them with cool courtesy much as Father might have and somehow he bent them to his will

And when Lord Umber who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march Robb told him he was welcome to do so And when we are done with the Lannisters he promised scratching Grey Wind behind the ear we will march back north root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker Cursing the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him he knocked him to the floor kicked over a table and unsheathed the biggest ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen All along the benches his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet grabbing for their steel

Yet Robb only said a quiet word and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on his back his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord Robb said but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat Bran’s bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise sucking at the red stumps of fingers… but then astonishingly the huge man laughed Your meat he roared is bloody tough

And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb’s right hand his staunchest champion loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark after all and they’d damn well better bend their knees if they didn’t fancy having them chewed off

Yet that very night his brother came to Bran’s bedchamber pale and shaken after the fires had burned low in the Great Hall I thought he was going to kill me Robb confessed Did you see the way he threw down Hal like he was no bigger than Rickon Gods I was so scared And the Greatjon’s not the worst of them only the loudest Lord Roose never says a word he only looks at me and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies

That’s just one of Old Nan’s stories Bran said A note of doubt crept into his voice Isn’t it

I don’t know He gave a weary shake of his head Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us To cook for him he says Theon is certain I’ll find the girl in my bedroll one night I wish… I wish Father was here…

That was the one thing they could agree on Bran and Rickon and Robb the Lord they all wished Father was here But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues away a captive in some dungeon a hunted fugitive running for his life or even dead No one seemed to know for certain every traveler told a different tale each more terrifying than the last The heads of Father’s guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the Red Keep impaled on spikes King Robert was dead at Father’s hands The Baratheons had laid siege to King’s Landing Lord Eddard had fled south with the king’s wicked brother Renly Arya and Sansa had been murdered by the Hound Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of Riverrun Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie burning and slaughtering as he went One wine-sodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim his father’s throne

When the raven came bearing a letter marked with Father’s own seal and written in Sansa’s hand the cruel truth seemed no less incredible Bran would never forget the look on Robb’s face as he stared at their sister’s words She says Father conspired at treason with the king’s brothers he read King Robert is dead and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey She says we must be loyal and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father’s life His fingers closed into a fist crushing Sansa’s letter between them And she says nothing of Arya nothing not so much as a word Damn her What’s wrong with the girl

Bran felt all cold inside She lost her wolf he said weakly remembering the day when four of his father’s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady’s bones Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge in voices drawn and desolate Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard its headstones spotted with pale lichen where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants It was there they buried Lady while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows She had gone south and only her bones had returned

Their grandfather old Lord Rickard had gone as well with his son Brandon who was Father’s brother and two hundred of his best men None had ever returned And Father had gone south with Arya and Sansa and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone and they hadn’t come back either And now Robb meant to go Not to King’s Landing and not to swear fealty but to Riverrun with a sword in his hand And if their lord father were truly a prisoner that could mean his death for a certainty It frightened Bran more than he could say

If Robb has to go watch over him Bran entreated the old gods as they watched him with the heart tree’s red eyes and watch over his men Hal and Quent and the rest and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords And Theon too I suppose Watch them and keep them safe if it please you gods Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home

A faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered Summer bared his teeth You hear them boy a voice asked

Bran lifted his head Osha stood across the pool beneath an ancient oak her face shadowed by leaves Even in irons the wildling moved quiet as a cat Summer circled the pool sniffed at her The tall woman flinched

Summer to me Bran called The direwolf took one final sniff spun and bounded back Bran wrapped his arms around him What are you doing here He had not seen Osha since they’d taken her captive in the wolfswood though he knew she’d been set to working in the kitchens

They are my gods too Osha said Beyond the Wall they are the only gods Her hair was growing out brown and shaggy It made her look more womanly that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they’d given her when they took her mail and leather Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time when I feel the need and I let him do as he likes under my skirt when he feels the need It’s nothing to me I like the smell of flour on his hands and he’s gentler than Stiv She gave an awkward bow I’ll leave you There’s pots that want scouring

No stay Bran commanded her Tell me what you meant about hearing the gods

Osha studied him You asked them and they’re answering Open your ears listen you’ll hear
