live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it

3114 And the LORD said unto Moses Behold thy days approach that
thou must die call Joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle
of the congregation that I may give him a charge And Moses and
Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation

3115 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle

3116 And the LORD said unto Moses Behold thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods
of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and
will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them

3117 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and I
will forsake them and I will hide my face from them and they shall
be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that
they will say in that day Are not these evils come upon us because
our God is not among us  3118 And I will surely hide my face in that
day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are
turned unto other gods

3119 Now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the
children of Israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a
witness for me against the children of Israel

3120 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall
have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn
unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my
covenant

3121 And it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are
befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for I
know their imagination which they go about even now before I have
brought them into the land which I sware

3122 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the
children of Israel

3123 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge and said Be strong
and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of Israel
into the land which I sware unto them and I will be with thee

3124 And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the
words of this law in a book until they were finished 3125 That
Moses commanded the Levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the
LORD saying 3126 Take this book of the law and put it in the side
of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God that it may be there
for a witness against thee

3127 For I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while I am
yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the LORD
and how much more after my death  3128 Gather unto me all the elders
of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words in
their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them

3129 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you
and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil
in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to anger through the work of
your hands

3130 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
the words of this song until they were ended

321 Give ear O ye heavens and I will speak and hear O earth the
words of my mouth

322 My doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the
dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon
the grass 323 Because I will publish the name of the LORD ascribe
ye greatness unto our God

324 He is the Rock his work is perfect for all his ways are
judgment a God of truth and without iniquity just and right is he

325 They have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his
children they are a perverse and crooked generation

326 Do ye thus requite the LORD O foolish people and unwise is not
he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and
established thee  327 Remember the days of old consider the years
of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy
elders and they will tell thee

328 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance when
he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel

329 For the LORDs portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance

3210 He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling
wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the
apple of his eye
