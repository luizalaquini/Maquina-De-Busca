Even so some were getting away A river’s current was a tricky thing and the wildfire was not spreading as evenly as he had hoped The main channel was all aflame but a good many of the Myrmen had made for the south bank and looked to escape unscathed and at least eight ships had landed under the city walls Landed or wrecked but it comes to the same thing they’ve put men ashore Worse a good part of the south wing of the enemy’s first two battle lines had been well upstream of the inferno when the hulks went up Stannis would be left with thirty or forty galleys at a guess more than enough to bring his whole host across once they had regained their courage

That might take a bit of time even the bravest would be dismayed after watching a thousand or so of his fellows consumed by wildfire Hallyne said that sometimes the substance burned so hot that flesh melted like tallow Yet even so…

Tyrion had no illusions where his own men were concerned If the battle looks to be going sour they’ll break and they’ll break bad Jacelyn Bywater had warned him so the only way to win was to make certain the battle stayed sweet start to finish

He could see dark shapes moving through the charred ruins of the riverfront wharfs Time for another sortie he thought Men were never so vulnerable as when they first staggered ashore He must not give the foe time to form up on the north bank

He scrambled down off the merlon Tell Lord Jacelyn we’ve got enemy on the riverfront he said to one of the runners Bywater had assigned him To another he said Bring my compliments to Ser Arneld and ask him to swing the Whores thirty degrees west The angle would allow them to throw farther if not as far out into the water

Mother promised I could have the Whores Joffrey said Tyrion was annoyed to see that the king had lifted the visor of his helm again Doubtless the boy was cooking inside all that heavy steel… but the last thing he needed was some stray arrow punching through his nephew’s eye

He clanged the visor shut Keep that closed Your Grace your sweet person is precious to us all And you don’t want to spoil that pretty face either The Whores are yours It was as good a time as any flinging more firepots down onto burning ships seemed pointless Joff had the Antler Men trussed up naked in the square below antlers nailed to their heads When they’d been brought before the Iron Throne for justice he had promised to send them to Stannis A man was not as heavy as a boulder or a cask of burning pitch and could be thrown a deal farther Some of the gold cloaks had been wagering on whether the traitors would fly all the way across the Blackwater Be quick about it Your Grace he told Joffrey We’ll want the trebuchets throwing stones again soon enough Even wildfire does not burn forever

Joffrey hurried off happy escorted by Ser Meryn but Tyrion caught Ser Osmund by the wrist before he could follow Whatever happens keep him safe and keep him there is that understood

As you command Ser Osmund smiled amiably

Tyrion had warned Trant and Kettleblack what would happen to them should any harm come to the king And Joffrey had a dozen veteran gold cloaks waiting at the foot of the steps I’m protecting your wretched bastard as well as I can Cersei he thought bitterly See you do the same for Alayaya

No sooner was Joff off than a runner came panting up the steps My lord hurry He threw himself to one knee They’ve landed men on the tourney grounds hundreds They’re bringing a ram up to the King’s Gate

Tyrion cursed and made for the steps with a rolling waddle Podrick Payne waited below with their horses They galloped off down River Row Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming hard behind him The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow but there was no traffic to get in their way Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear so the defenders could move quickly from one gate to the next Even so by the time they reached the King’s Gate he could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told him the battering ram had been brought into play The groaning of the great hinges sounded like the moans of a dying giant The gatehouse square was littered with the wounded but he saw lines of horses as well not all of them hurt and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column Form up he shouted as he leapt to the ground The gate moved under the impact of another blow Who commands here You’re going out

No A shadow detached itself from the shadow of the wall to become a tall man in dark grey armor Sandor Clegane wrenched off his helm with both hands and let it fall to the ground The steel was scorched and dented the left ear of the snarling hound sheared off A gash above one eye had sent a wash of blood down across the Hound’s old burn scars masking half his face

Yes Tyrion faced him

Clegane’s breath came ragged Bugger that And you

A sellsword stepped up beside him We been out Three times Half our men are killed or hurt Wildfire bursting all around us horses screaming like men and men like horses—

Did you think we hired you to fight in a tourney Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and a bowl of raspberries No Then get on your fucking horse You too dog

The blood on Clegane’s face glistened red but his eyes showed white He drew his longsword

He is afraid Tyrion realized shocked The Hound is frightened He tried to explain their need They’ve taken a ram to the gate you can hear them we need to disperse them—

Open the gates When they rush inside surround them and kill them The Hound thrust the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel swaying I’ve lost half my men Horse as well I’m not taking more into that fire

Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion’s side immaculate in his enameled white plate The King’s Hand commands you

Bugger the King’s Hand Where the Hound’s face was not sticky with blood it was pale as milk Someone bring me a drink A gold cloak officer handed him a cup Clegane took a swallow spit it out flung the cup away Water Fuck your water Bring me wine

He is dead on his feet Tyrion could see it now The wound the fire… he’s done I need to find someone else but who Ser Mandon He looked at the men and knew it would not do Clegane’s fear had shaken them Without a leader they would refuse as well and Ser Mandon… a dangerous man Jaime said yes but not a man other men would follow

In the distance Tyrion heard another great crash Above the walls the darkening sky was awash with sheets of green and orange light How long could the gate hold

This is madness he thought but sooner madness than defeat Defeat is death and shame Very well I’ll lead the sortie

If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor he was wrong Clegane only laughed You

Tyrion could see the disbelief on their faces Me Ser Mandon you’ll bear the king’s banner Pod my helm The boy ran to obey The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-streaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes Ser Mandon helped Tyrion mount up again Form up he shouted
