They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed His friends were not allowed to see him but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost so he was not utterly alone

My father is no traitor he told the direwolf when the rest had gone Ghost looked at him in silence Jon slumped against the wall hands around his knees and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed The flame flickered and swayed the shadows moved around him the room seemed to grow darker and colder I will not sleep tonight Jon thought

Yet he must have dozed When he woke his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out Ghost stood on his hind legs scrabbling at the door Jon was startled to see how tall he’d grown Ghost what is it he called softly The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him baring his fangs in a silent snarl Has he gone mad Jon wondered It’s me Ghost he murmured trying not to sound afraid Yet he was trembling violently When had it gotten so cold

Ghost backed away from the door There were deep gouges where he’d raked the wood Jon watched him with mounting disquiet There’s someone out there isn’t there he whispered Crouching the direwolf crept backward white fur rising on the back of his neck The guard he thought they left a man to guard my door Ghost smells him through the door that’s all it is

Slowly Jon pushed himself to his feet He was shivering uncontrollably wishing he still had a sword Three quick steps brought him to the door He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward The creak of the hinges almost made him jump

His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps looking up at him Looking up at him even though he was lying on his stomach His head had been twisted completely around

It can’t be Jon told himself This is the Lord Commander’s Tower it’s guarded day and night this couldn’t happen it’s a dream I’m having a nightmare

Ghost slid past him out the door The wolf started up the steps stopped looked back at Jon That was when he heard it the soft scrape of a boot on stone the sound of a latch turning The sounds came from above From the Lord Commander’s chambers

A nightmare this might be yet it was no dream

The guard’s sword was in its sheath Jon knelt and worked it free The heft of steel in his fist made him bolder He moved up the steps Ghost padding silently before him Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair Jon crept up warily probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword

Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont’s raven Corn the bird was screaming Corn corn corn corn corn corn Ghost bounded ahead and Jon came scrambling after The door to Mormont’s solar was wide open The direwolf plunged through Jon stopped in the doorway blade in hand giving his eyes a moment to adjust Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows and the darkness was black as ink Who’s there he called out

Then he saw it a shadow in the shadows sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont’s sleeping cell a man-shape all in black cloaked and hooded… but beneath the hood its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance…

Ghost leapt Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl rolling smashing into a chair knocking over a table laden with papers Mormont’s raven was flapping overhead screaming Corn corn corn corn Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon Keeping the wall to his back he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain Moonlight flooded the solar He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf’s throat Ghost was twisting and snapping legs flailing in the air but he could not break free

Jon had no time to be afraid He threw himself forward shouting bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone yet the sound was wrong somehow The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged He saw arm and hand on the floor black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away red tongue lolling from his mouth

The hooded man lifted his pale moon face and Jon slashed at it without hesitation The sword laid the intruder open to the bone taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes eyes eyes like blue stars burning Jon knew that face Othor he thought reeling back Gods he’s dead he’s dead I saw him dead

He felt something scrabble at his ankle Black fingers clawed at his calf The arm was crawling up his leg ripping at wool and flesh Shouting with revulsion Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away It lay writhing fingers opening and closing

The corpse lurched forward There was no blood One-armed face cut near in half it seemed to feel nothing Jon held the longsword before him Stay away he commanded his voice gone shrill Corn screamed the raven corn corn The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve a pale snake with a black five-fingered head Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth Finger bones crunched Jon hacked at the corpse’s neck felt the steel bite deep and hard

Dead Othor slammed into him knocking him off his feet

Jon’s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades The sword where was the sword He’d lost the damned sword When he opened his mouth to scream the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon’s mouth Gagging he tried to shove it off but the dead man was too heavy Its hand forced itself farther down his throat icy cold choking him Its face was against his own filling the world Frost covered its eyes sparkling blue Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing’s legs He tried to bite tried to punch tried to breathe…

And suddenly the corpse’s weight was gone its fingers ripped from his throat It was all Jon could do to roll over retching and shaking

Ghost had it again He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight’s gut and began to rip and tear He watched only half conscious for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword…

… and saw Lord Mormont naked and groggy from sleep standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand Gnawed and fingerless the arm thrashed on the floor wriggling toward him

Jon tried to shout but his voice was gone Staggering to his feet he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear’s fingers The flame flickered and almost died Burn the raven cawed Burn burn burn

Spinning Jon saw the drapes he’d ripped from the window He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands Metal crunched glass shattered oil spewed and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known Ghost he shouted

The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly Jon plunged his hand into the flames grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes and whipped them at the dead man Let it burn he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse gods please please let it burn
