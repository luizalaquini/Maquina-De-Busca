The queen will not kill me Ned said His head swam the wine was strong and it had been too long since he’d eaten Cat… Cat holds her brother…

The wrong brother Varys sighed And lost to her in any case She let the Imp slip through her fingers I expect he is dead by now somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon

If that is true slit my throat and have done with it He was dizzy from the wine tired and heartsick

Your blood is the last thing I desire

Ned frowned When they slaughtered my guard you stood beside the queen and watched and said not a word

And would again I seem to recall that I was unarmed unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords The eunuch looked at him curiously tilting his head When I was a young boy before I was cut I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities They taught me that each man has a role to play in life as well as mummery So it is at court The King’s Justice must be fearsome the master of coin must be frugal the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiant… and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple A courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight He took the wineskin back and drank

Ned studied the eunuch’s face searching for truth beneath the mummer’s scars and false stubble He tried some more wine This time it went down easier Can you free me from this pit

I could… but will I No Questions would be asked and the answers would lead back to me

Ned had expected no more You are blunt

A eunuch has no honor and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples my lord

Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me

That would depend on the message I will gladly provide you with paper and ink if you like And when you have written what you will I will take the letter and read it and deliver it or not as best serves my own ends

Your own ends What ends are those Lord Varys

Peace Varys replied without hesitation If there was one soul in King’s Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive it was me He sighed For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies but I could not protect him from his friends What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey’s birth

The madness of mercy Ned admitted

Ah said Varys To be sure You are an honest and honorable man Lord Eddard Ofttimes I forget that I have met so few of them in my life He glanced around the cell When I see what honesty and honor have won you I understand why

Ned Stark laid his head back against the damp stone wall and closed his eyes His leg was throbbing The king’s wine… did you question Lancel

Oh indeed Cersei gave him the wineskins and told him it was Robert’s favorite vintage The eunuch shrugged A hunter lives a perilous life If the boar had not done for Robert it would have been a fall from a horse the bite of a wood adder an arrow gone astray… the forest is the abbatoir of the gods It was not wine that killed the king It was your mercy

Ned had feared as much Gods forgive me

If there are gods Varys said I expect they will The queen would not have waited long in any case Robert was becoming unruly and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers They are quite a pair Stannis and Renly The iron gauntlet and the silk glove He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand You have been foolish my lord You ought to have heeded Littlefinger when he urged you to support Joffrey’s succession

How… how could you know of that

Varys smiled I know that’s all that need concern you I also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit

Slowly Ned raised his eyes Why

Cersei is frightened of you my lord… but she has other enemies she fears even more Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie ringed in stone and steel and there is no love lost between her and the queen In Dorne the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and her babes And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back

Robb is only a boy Ned said aghast

A boy with an army Varys said Yet only a boy as you say The king’s brothers are the ones giving Cersei sleepless nights… Lord Stannis in particular His claim is the true one he is known for his prowess as a battle commander and he is utterly without mercy There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone but I will wager you that he’s gathered more swords than seashells So here is Cersei’s nightmare while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys Lord Stannis will land proclaim himself king and lop off her son’s curly blond head… and her own in the bargain though I truly believe she cares more about the boy

Stannis Baratheon is Robert’s true heir Ned said The throne is his by rights I would welcome his ascent
