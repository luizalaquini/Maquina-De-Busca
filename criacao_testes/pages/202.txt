Ekron with her towns and her villages 1546 From Ekron even unto the
sea all that lay near Ashdod with their villages 1547 Ashdod with
her towns and her villages Gaza with her towns and her villages unto
the river of Egypt and the great sea and the border thereof 1548
And in the mountains Shamir and Jattir and Socoh 1549 And Dannah
and Kirjathsannah which is Debir 1550 And Anab and Eshtemoh and
Anim 1551 And Goshen and Holon and Giloh eleven cities with their
villages 1552 Arab and Dumah and Eshean 1553 And Janum and
Bethtappuah and Aphekah 1554 And Humtah and Kirjatharba which is
Hebron and Zior nine cities with their villages 1555 Maon Carmel
and Ziph and Juttah 1556 And Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah
1557 Cain Gibeah and Timnah ten cities with their villages 1558
Halhul Bethzur and Gedor 1559 And Maarath and Bethanoth and
Eltekon six cities with their villages 1560 Kirjathbaal which is
Kirjathjearim and Rabbah two cities with their villages 1561 In
the wilderness Betharabah Middin and Secacah 1562 And Nibshan
and the city of Salt and Engedi six cities with their villages

1563 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem the children
of Judah could not drive them out but the Jebusites dwell with the
children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day

161 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
Jericho unto the water of Jericho on the east to the wilderness that
goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel 162 And goeth out from
Bethel to Luz and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth
163 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti unto the coast
of Bethhoron the nether and to Gezer and the goings out thereof are
at the sea

164 So the children of Joseph Manasseh and Ephraim took their
inheritance

165 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east
side was Atarothaddar unto Bethhoron the upper 166 And the border
went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side and the
border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh and passed by it on the
east to Janohah 167 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and to
Naarath and came to Jericho and went out at Jordan

168 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah
and the goings out thereof were at the sea This is the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families

169 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
the inheritance of the children of Manasseh all the cities with their
villages

1610 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer but
the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day and serve
under tribute

171 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh for he was the
firstborn of Joseph to wit for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh the
father of Gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had Gilead
and Bashan

172 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
their families for the children of Abiezer and for the children of
Helek and for the children of Asriel and for the children of
Shechem and for the children of Hepher and for the children of
Shemida these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by
their families

173 But Zelophehad the son of Hepher the son of Gilead the son of
Machir the son of Manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are
the names of his daughters Mahlah and Noah Hoglah Milcah and
Tirzah

174 And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua
the son of Nun and before the princes saying The LORD commanded
Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren Therefore
according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance
among the brethren of their father

175 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh beside the land of
Gilead and Bashan which were on the other side Jordan 176 Because
the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the
rest of Manassehs sons had the land of Gilead

177 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah that
lieth before Shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto
the inhabitants of Entappuah

178 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah but Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim 179 And the coast
descended unto the river Kanah southward of the river these cities
of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh the coast of Manasseh
also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were
at the sea 1710 Southward it was Ephraims and northward it was
Manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in Asher
on the north and in Issachar on the east

1711 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns and Ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns even three countries
