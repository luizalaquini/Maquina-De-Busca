other pleasures put together and that you would give
them all up for me and now wont you give up this
one which is more a worry than a pleasure Do
Frank Come let me fascinate you by all I can do
 -- by pretty words and pretty looks and everything I
can think of -- to stay at home Say yes to your wife --
say yes
The tenderest and softest phases of Bathshebas
nature were prominent now -- advanced impulsively for
his acceptance without any of the disguises and defences
which the wariness of her character when she was cool
too frequently threw
P 330
over them Few men could have
resisted the arch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful
face thrown a little back and sideways in the weli
known attitude that expresses more than the words it
accompanies and which seems to have heen designed
for these special occasions Had the woman not been
his wife Troy would have succumbed instantly  as it
was he thought he would not deceive her longer
The money is not wanted for racing debts at all
he said
 What is it for  she asked  You worry me a great
deal by these mysterious responsibilities Frank
Troy hesitated He did not now love her enough
to allow himself to be carried too far by her ways Yet
it was necessary to be civil You wrong me by such
a suspicious manner he said  Such strait-waistcoating
as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a
date
I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I
pay she said with features between a smile and a
pout
Exactly and the former being done suppose we
proceed to the latter Bathsheba fun is all very well
but dont go too far or you may have cause to regret
something
She reddened  I do that already she said quickly
 What do you regret  
SUSPICION
That my romance has come to an end
 All romances end at marriage
I wish you wouldnt talk like that You grieve me
to my soul by being smart at my expense
 You are dull enough at mine I believe you hate
me
 Not you -- only your faults I do hate them
Twould be much more becoming if you set your+
self to cure them Come lets strike a balance with
the twenty pounds and be friends
She gave a sigh of resignation I have about that
sum here for household expenses If you must have it
take it
Very good Thank you I expect I shall have
gone away before you are in to breakfast to-morrow
And must you go  Ah  there was a time Frank
when it would have taken a good many promises to
other people to drag you away from me You used to
call me darling then
P 331
But it doesnt matter to you how
my days are passed now
I must go in spite of sentiment Troy as he
spoke looked at his watch and apparently actuated by
1non lucendo1 principles opened the case at the back
revealing snugly stowed within it a small coil of hair
Bathshebas eyes had been accidentally lifted at that
moment and she saw the action and saw the hair She
flushed in pain and surprise and some words escaped
her before she had thought whether or not it was wise
to utter them A womans curl of hair  she said
O Frank whose is that 
Troy had instantly closed his watch He carelessly
replied as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight
had stirred  Why yours of course Whose should it
be  I had quite forgotten that I had it
 What a dreadful fib Frank
 I tell you I had forgotten it he said loudly
I dont mean that -- it was yellow hair
Nonsense
Thats insulting me I know it was yellow Now
whose was it  I want to know
Very weliill tell you so make no more ado It
is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry
before I knew you
 You ought to tell me her name then
I cannot do that
Is she married yet
No
Is she alive
 Yes
Is she pretty 
 Yes
It is wonderful how she can be poor thing under
such an awful affliction
 Affliction -- what affliction   he inquired quickly
 Having hair of that dreadful colour
 Oh -- ho-i like that said Troy recovering him+
self Why her hair has been admired by everybody
