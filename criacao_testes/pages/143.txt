2312 And he answered and said Must I not take heed to speak that
which the LORD hath put in my mouth  2313 And Balak said unto him
Come I pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest
see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not
see them all and curse me them from thence

2314 And he brought him into the field of Zophim to the top of
Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on
every altar

2315 And he said unto Balak Stand here by thy burnt offering while
I meet the LORD yonder

2316 And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said
Go again unto Balak and say thus

2317 And when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering
and the princes of Moab with him And Balak said unto him What hath
the LORD spoken  2318 And he took up his parable and said Rise up
Balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of Zippor 2319 God is not
a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should
repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and
shall he not make it good  2320 Behold I have received commandment
to bless and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it

2321 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen
perverseness in Israel the LORD his God is with him and the shout of
a king is among them

2322 God brought them out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength
of an unicorn

2323 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob neither is there
any divination against Israel according to this time it shall be said
of Jacob and of Israel What hath God wrought  2324 Behold the
people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young
lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the
blood of the slain

2325 And Balak said unto Balaam Neither curse them at all nor bless
them at all

2326 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak Told not I thee
saying All that the LORD speaketh that I must do  2327 And Balak
said unto Balaam Come I pray thee I will bring thee unto another
place peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them
from thence

2328 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor that looketh
toward Jeshimon

2329 And Balaam said unto Balak Build me here seven altars and
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams

2330 And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bullock and a
ram on every altar

241 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel he
went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his
face toward the wilderness

242 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes and the spirit of God came upon him

243 And he took up his parable and said Balaam the son of Beor hath
said and the man whose eyes are open hath said 244 He hath said
which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the Almighty
falling into a trance but having his eyes open 245 How goodly are
thy tents O Jacob and thy tabernacles O Israel  246 As the
valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the
trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted and as cedar trees
beside the waters

247 He shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be
in many waters and his king shall be higher than Agag and his
kingdom shall be exalted

248 God brought him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and
shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows

249 He couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall
stir him up Blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that
curseth thee

2410 And Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam and he smote his
hands together and Balak said unto Balaam I called thee to curse
mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these
three times

2411 Therefore now flee thou to thy place I thought to promote thee
unto great honour but lo the LORD hath kept thee back from honour

2412 And Balaam said unto Balak Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me saying 2413 If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the commandment of
the LORD to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the LORD
saith that will I speak  2414 And now behold I go unto my people
come therefore and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to
thy people in the latter days
