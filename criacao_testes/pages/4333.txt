Procedure 63  Pascal algorithm for producing reflection coefficients
from filter coefficients
TE
pp
Although we will not go into the theoretical details here
reflection coefficients are bounded by +-1 for stable filters
and hence form a useful test for stability  Having a limited
range makes them easy to quantize for transmission and in fact
they behave better under quantization than do the filter coefficients
One could resynthesize speech from reflection coefficients by first
converting them to filter coefficients and using the synthesis
method described above  However it is natural to seek a single-stage
procedure which can regenerate speech directly from reflection
coefficients
pp
Such a procedure does exist and is called a
ul
lattice filter
Figure 68 shows one form of lattice for speech synthesis

The error signal whether transmitted or synthesized
enters at the upper left-hand corner passes along the top forward
signal path being modified on the way to give the output signal
at the right-hand side
