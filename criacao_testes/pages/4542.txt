Not that I wanted him to stay mind you I had Grand Maester Pycelle and an army of midwives and I had my brother When they told Jaime he was not allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which of them proposed to keep him out

Joffrey will show you no such devotion I fear You could thank your sister for that if she weren’t dead He’s never been able to forget that day on the Trident when you saw her shame him so he shames you in turn You’re stronger than you seem though I expect you’ll survive a bit of humiliation I did You may never love the king but you’ll love his children

I love His Grace with all my heart Sansa said

The queen sighed You had best learn some new lies and quickly Lord Stannis will not like that one I promise you

The new High Septon said that the gods will never permit Lord Stannis to win since Joffrey is the rightful king

A half smile flickered across the queen’s face Robert’s trueborn son and heir Though Joff would cry whenever Robert picked him up His Grace did not like that His bastards had always gurgled at him happily and sucked his finger when he put it in their little baseborn mouths Robert wanted smiles and cheers always so he went where he found them to his friends and his whores Robert wanted to be loved My brother Tyrion has the same disease Do you want to be loved Sansa

Everyone wants to be loved

I see flowering hasn’t made you any brighter said Cersei Sansa permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day Love is poison A sweet poison yes but it will kill you all the same





JON

It was dark in the Skirling Pass The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day so they rode in shadow the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen but there was no grass and they were above the trees now

The track was as steep as it was narrow wending its way ever upward Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file Squire Dalbridge would take the lead scanning the heights as he went his longbow ever close to hand It was said he had the keenest eyes in the Night’s Watch

Ghost padded restlessly by Jon’s side From time to time he would stop and turn his ears pricked as if he heard something behind them Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men not unless they were starving but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so

A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass Here the way broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater Qhorin decreed that they would rest here until the shadows began to grow again Shadows are friends to men in black he said

Jon saw the sense of that It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones but they dared not Where there were three watchers there might be others waiting to sound the alarm

Stonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once Jon shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses Qhorin Halfhand sat with his back to a rock honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes Jon watched the ranger for a few moments then summoned his courage and went to him My lord he said you never asked me how it went With the girl

I am no lord Jon Snow Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his two-fingered hand

She told me Mance would take me if I ran with her

She told you true

She even claimed we were kin She told me a story   

   of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell So Stonesnake told me It happens I know the song Mance would sing it of old when he came back from a ranging He had a passion for wildling music Aye and for their women as well

You knew him

We all knew him His voice was sad

They were friends as well as brothers Jon realized and now they are sworn foes Why did he desert

For a wench some say For a crown others would have it Qhorin tested the edge of his sword with the ball of his thumb He liked women Mance did and he was not a man whose knees bent easily that’s true But it was more than that He loved the wild better than the Wall It was in his blood He was wildling born taken as a child when some raiders were put to the sword When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again

Was he a good ranger

He was the best of us said the Halfhand and the worst as well Only fools like Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings They are as brave as we are Jon As strong as quick as clever But they have no discipline They name themselves the free folk and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester Mance was the same He never learned how to obey

No more than me said Jon quietly

Qhorin’s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him So you let her go He did not sound the least surprised

You know

Now Tell me why you spared her

It was hard to put into words My father never used a headsman He said he owed it to men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words And when I looked into Ygritte’s eyes I    Jon stared down at his hands helplessly I know she was an enemy but there was no evil in her

No more than in the other two

It was their lives or ours Jon said If they had seen us if they had sounded that horn   

The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us true enough

Stonesnake has the horn now though and we took Ygritte’s knife and axe She’s behind us afoot unarmed   

And not like to be a threat Qhorin agreed If I had needed her dead I would have left her with Ebben or done the thing myself

Then why did you command it of me

I did not command it I told you to do what needed to be done and left you to decide what that would be Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard When I want a mountain scaled I call on Stonesnake Should I need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield I summon Squire Dalbridge Ebben can make any man give up his secrets To lead men you must know them Jon Snow I know more of you now than I did this morning

And if I had slain her asked Jon

She would be dead and I would know you better than I had before But enough talk You ought be sleeping We have leagues to go and dangers to face You will need your strength

Jon did not think sleep would come easily but he knew the Halfhand was right He found a place out of the wind beneath an overhang of rock and took off his cloak to use it for a blanket Ghost he called Here To me He always slept better with the great white wolf beside him there was comfort in the smell of him and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur This time though Ghost did no more than look at him Then he turned away and padded around the garrons and quick as that he was gone He wants to hunt Jon thought Perhaps there were goats in these mountains The shadowcats must live on something Just don’t try and bring down a ’cat he muttered Even for a direwolf that would be dangerous He tugged his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock

When he closed his eyes he dreamed of direwolves

There were five of them when there should have been six and they were scattered each apart from the others He felt a deep ache of emptiness a sense of incompleteness The forest was vast and cold and they were so small so lost His brothers were out there somewhere and his sister but he had lost their scent He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the darkening sky and his cry echoed through the forest a long lonely mournful sound As it died away he pricked up his ears listening for an answer but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow

Jon

The call came from behind him softer than a whisper but strong too Can a shout be silent He turned his head searching for his brother for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees but there was nothing only   

A weirwood

It seemed to sprout from solid rock its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen no more than a sapling yet it was growing as he watched its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky Wary he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face Red eyes looked at him Fierce eyes they were yet glad to see him The weirwood had his brother’s face Had his brother always had three eyes

Not always came the silent shout Not before the crow
