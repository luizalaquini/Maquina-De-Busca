day that he heard them

3015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
them then he shall bear her iniquity

3016 These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses between
a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in
her youth in her fathers house

311 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 312 Avenge the children
of Israel of the Midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy
people

313 And Moses spake unto the people saying Arm some of yourselves
unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the
LORD of Midian

314 Of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of Israel
shall ye send to the war

315 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a
thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war

316 And Moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war with the holy
instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand

317 And they warred against the Midianites as the LORD commanded
Moses and they slew all the males

318 And they slew the kings of Midian beside the rest of them that
were slain namely Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba five
kings of Midian Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword

319 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives
and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all
their flocks and all their goods

3110 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all
their goodly castles with fire

3111 And they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and
of beasts

3112 And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto
Moses and Eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the
children of Israel unto the camp at the plains of Moab which are by
Jordan near Jericho

3113 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the
congregation went forth to meet them without the camp

3114 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the
captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from
the battle

3115 And Moses said unto them Have ye saved all the women alive
3116 Behold these caused the children of Israel through the counsel
of Balaam to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor
and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD

3117 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill
every woman that hath known man by lying with him

3118 But all the women children that have not known a man by lying
with him keep alive for yourselves

3119 And do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath
killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both
yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day

3120 And purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and
all work of goats hair and all things made of wood

3121 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
the battle This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded
Moses 3122 Only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the
tin and the lead 3123 Every thing that may abide the fire ye shall
make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it
shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth
not the fire ye shall make go through the water

3124 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall
be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp

3125 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3126 Take the sum of the
prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and Eleazar the
priest and the chief fathers of the congregation 3127 And divide
the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who
went out to battle and between all the congregation 3128 And levy a
tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle one
soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of
the asses and of the sheep 3129 Take it of their half and give it
unto Eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the LORD

3130 And of the children of Israels half thou shalt take one
portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of
the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the Levites
which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD
