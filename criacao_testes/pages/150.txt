How many men were there in this raiding party Ned asked

A hundred at the least Joss answered in the same instant as the bandaged smith said Fifty and the grandmother behind him Hunnerds and hunnerds m’lord an army they was

You are more right than you know goodwoman Lord Eddard told her You say they flew no banners What of the armor they wore Did any of you note ornaments or decorations devices on shield or helm

The brewer Joss shook his head It grieves me m’lord but no the armor they showed us was plain only… the one who led them he was armored like the rest but there was no mistaking him all the same It was the size of him m’lord Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one I swear Big as an ox he was and a voice like stone breaking

The Mountain Ser Marq said loudly Can any man doubt it This was Gregor Clegane’s work

Ned heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall Even in the galley nervous whispers were exchanged High lords and smallfolk alike knew what it could mean if Ser Marq was proved right Ser Gregor Clegane stood bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister

He studied the frightened faces of the villagers Small wonder they had been so fearful they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed butcher before a king who was his son by marriage He wondered if the knights had given them a choice

Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table his chain of office clinking Ser Marq with respect you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor There are many large men in the realm

As large as the Mountain That Rides Ser Karyl said I have never met one

Nor has any man here Ser Raymun added hotly Even his brother is a pup beside him My lords open your eyes Do you need to see his seal on the corpses It was Gregor

Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand Pycelle asked By the grace of his liege lord he holds a stout keep and lands of his own The man is an anointed knight

A false knight Ser Marq said Lord Tywin’s mad dog

My lord Hand Pycelle declared in a stiff voice I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen

Thank you Grand Maester Pycelle Ned said I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out

From his vantage point atop the throne he could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall Hares going to ground he supposed… or rats off to nibble the queen’s cheese He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery with his daughter Sansa beside her Ned felt a flash of anger this was no place for a girl But the septa could not have known that today’s court would be anything but the usual tedious business of hearing petitions settling disputes between rival holdfasts and adjudicating the placement of boundary stones

At the council table below Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward Ser Marq Ser Karyl Ser Raymun—perhaps I might ask you a question These holdfasts were under your protection Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on

Ser Karyl Vance answered I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth as was Ser Marq When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king

Ser Raymun Darry spoke up Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength I was camped across the river from his walls awaiting his commands when the word reached me By the time I could return to my own lands Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork riding for Lannister’s hills

Littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully And if they come again ser

If they come again we’ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt Ser Marq Piper declared hotly

Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day’s ride of the border Ser Karyl explained The next raider will not have such an easy time of it

And that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants Ned thought to himself to bleed off strength from Riverrun goad the boy into scattering his swords His wife’s brother was young and more gallant than wise He would try to hold every inch of his soil to defend every man woman and child who named him lord and Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that

If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm Lord Petyr was saying what then do you ask of the throne

The lords of the Trident keep the king’s peace Ser Raymun Darry said The Lannisters have broken it We ask leave to answer them steel for steel We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford

Edmure agrees we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin Ser Marq declared but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king’s leave before we strike

Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster then Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion If indeed he’d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage—and Ned did not doubt that he had—he’d taken care to see that he rode under cover of night without banners in the guise of a common brigand Should Riverrun strike back Cersei and her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who broke the king’s peace not the Lannisters The gods only knew what Robert would believe

Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again My lord Hand if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint These crimes are no concern of the throne Let them seek Lord Tywin’s justice
