Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly emerged from Maegor’s Holdfast Lord Eddard he called after Ned a moment if you would be so kind

Ned stopped As you wish

Renly walked to his side Send your men away They met in the center of the bridge the dry moat beneath them Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined its bed

Ned gestured Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them That letter He leaned close Was it the regency Has my brother named you Protector He did not wait for a reply My lord I have thirty men in my personal guard and other friends beside knights and lords Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords in your hand

And what should I do with a hundred swords my lord

Strike Now while the castle sleeps Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand Protector or no the man who holds the king holds the kingdom We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well Once we have her children Cersei will not dare oppose us The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward

Ned regarded him coldly Robert is not dead yet The gods may spare him If not I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds

Lord Renly took a step back taut as a bowstring Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies it may be too late… for both of us

Then we should pray that Robert does not die

Small chance of that said Renly

Sometimes the gods are merciful

The Lannisters are not Lord Renly turned away and went back across the moat to the tower where his brother lay dying

By the time Ned returned to his chambers he felt weary and heartsick yet there was no question of his going back to sleep not now When you play the game of thrones you win or you die Cersei Lannister had told him in the godswood He found himself wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly’s offer He had no taste for these intrigues and there was no honor in threatening children and yet… if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee he might well have need of Renly’s hundred swords and more besides

I want Littlefinger he told Cayn If he’s not in his chambers take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King’s Landing until you find him Bring him to me before break of day Cayn bowed and took his leave and Ned turned to Tomard The Wind Witch sails on the evening tide Have you chosen the escort

Ten men with Porther in command

Twenty and you will command Ned said Porther was a brave man but headstrong He wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his daughters

As you wish m’lord Tom said Can’t say I’ll be sad to see the back of this place I miss the wife

You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north I need you to deliver a letter for me

Tom looked apprehensive To Dragonstone m’lord The island fortress of House Targaryen had a sinister repute

Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island They may be wary of unexpected visitors If he is reluctant offer him whatever it takes I will give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon No one else Not his steward nor the captain of his guard nor his lady wife but only Lord Stannis himself

As you command m’lord

When Tomard had left him Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside him on the table For a moment his grief overwhelmed him He wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of Robert Baratheon who had been more than a brother to him Men would whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his king’s friendship and disinherited his sons he could only hope that the gods would know better and that Robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave

Ned took out the king’s last letter A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden wax a few short words and a smear of blood How small the difference between victory and defeat between life and death

He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot To His Grace Stannis of the House Baratheon he wrote By the time you receive this letter your brother Robert our King these past fifteen years will be dead He was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood…

The letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly they would fight rather than flee No doubt Lord Stannis was wary after the murder of Jon Arryn but it was imperative that he sail for King’s Landing at once with all his power before the Lannisters could march

Ned chose each word with care When he was done he signed the letter Eddard Stark Lord of Winterfell Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm blotted the paper folded it twice and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame

His regency would be a short one he reflected as the wax softened The new king would choose his own Hand Ned would be free to go home The thought of Winterfell brought a wan smile to his face He wanted to hear Bran’s laughter once more to go hawking with Robb to watch Rickon at play He wanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in his own bed with his arms wrapped tight around his lady Catelyn
