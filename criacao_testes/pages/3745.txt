They walked the rest of the way past more cookflres and more tents with Ghost following at their heels Jon had never seen so many wildlings He wondered if anyone ever had The camp goes on forever he reflected but it’s more a hundred camps than one and each more vulnerable than the last Stretched out over long leagues the wildlings had no defenses to speak of no pits nor sharpened stakes only small groups of outriders patrolling their perimeters Each group or clan or village had simply stopped where they wanted as soon as they saw others stopping or found a likely spot The free folk If his brothers were to catch them in such disarray many of them would pay for that freedom with their life’s blood They had numbers but the Night’s Watch had discipline and in battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten his father had once told him

There was no doubting which tent was the king’s It was thrice the size of the next largest he’d seen and he could hear music drifting from within Like many of the lesser tents it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on but Mance Rayder’s hides were the shaggy white pelts of snow bears The peaked roof was crowned with a huge set of antlers from one of the giant elks that had once roamed freely throughout the Seven Kingdoms in the times of the First Men

Here at least they found defenders two guards at the flap of the tent leaning on tall spears with round leather shields strapped to their arms When they caught sight of Ghost one of them lowered his spearpoint and said That beast stays here

Ghost stay Jon commanded The direwolf sat

Longspear watch the beast Rattleshirt yanked open the tent and gestured Jon and Ygritte inside

The tent was hot and smoky Baskets of burning peat stood in all four corners filling the air with a dim reddish light More skins carpeted the ground Jon felt utterly alone as he stood there in his blacks awaiting the pleasure of the turncloak who called himself King-beyond-the-Wall When his eyes had adjusted to the smoky red gloom he saw six people none of whom paid him any mind A dark young man and a pretty blonde woman were sharing a horn of mead A pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens while a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat crosslegged on a pillow playing a lute and singing





The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun

and her kisses were warmer than spring

But the Dornishman’s blade was made of black steel

and its kiss was a terrible thing





Jon knew the song though it was strange to hear it here in a shaggy hide tent beyond the Wall ten thousand leagues from the red mountains and warm winds of Dorne

Rattleshirt took off his yellowed helm as he waited for the song to end Beneath his bone-and-leather armor he was a small man and the face under the giant’s skull was ordinary with a knobby chin thin mustache and sallow pinched cheeks His eyes were close-set one eyebrow creeping all the way across his forehead dark hair thinning back from a sharp widow’s peak





The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed

in a voice that was sweet as a peach

But the Dornishman’s blade had a song of its own

and a bite sharp and cold as a leech





Beside the brazier a short but immensely broad man sat on a stool eating a hen off a skewer Hot grease was running down his chin and into his snow-white beard but he smiled happily all the same Thick gold bands graven with runes bound his massive arms and he wore a heavy shirt of black ringmail that could only have come from a dead ranger A few feet away a taller leaner man in a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales stood frowning over a map a two-handed greatsword slung across his back in a leather sheath He was straight as a spear all long wiry muscle clean-shaved bald with a strong straight nose and deepset grey eyes He might even have been comely if he’d had ears but he had lost both along the way whether to frostbite or some enemy’s knife Jon could not tell Their lack made the man’s head seem narrow and pointed

Both the white-bearded man and the bald one were warriors that was plain to Jon at a glance These two are more dangerous than Rattleshirt by far He wondered which was Mance Rayder





As he lay on the ground with the darkness around

and the taste of his blood on his tongue

His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer

and he smiled and he laughed and he sung

Brothers oh brothers my days here are done

the Dornishman’s taken my life

But what does it matter for all men must die

and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife





As the last strains of The Dornishman’s Wife faded the bald earless man glanced up from his map and scowled ferociously at Rattleshirt and Ygritte with Jon between them What’s this he said A crow

The black bastard what gutted Orell said Rattleshirt and a bloody warg as well

You were to kill them all

This one come over explained Ygritte He slew Qhorin Halfhand with his own hand

This boy The earless man was angered by the news The Halfhand should have been mine Do you have a name crow

Jon Snow Your Grace He wondered whether he was expected to bend the knee as well

Your Grace The earless man looked at the big white-bearded one You see He takes me for a king

The bearded man laughed so hard he sprayed bits of chicken everywhere He rubbed the grease from his mouth with the back of a huge hand A blind boy must be Who ever heard of a king without ears Why his crown would fall straight down to his neck Har He grinned at Jon wiping his fingers clean on his breeches Close your beak crow Spin yourself around might be you’d find who you’re looking for

Jon turned

The singer rose to his feet I’m Mance Rayder he said as he put aside the lute And you are Ned Stark’s bastard the Snow of Winterfell 

Stunned Jon stood speechless for a moment before he recovered enough to say How… how could you know…

That’s a tale for later said Mance Rayder How did you like the song lad
