Those who cannot are culled in training along with those who cannot run all day in full pack scale a mountain in the black of night walk across a bed of coals or slay an infant

Dany’s mouth surely twisted at that Did he see or is he blind as well as cruel She turned away quickly trying to keep her face a mask until she heard the translation Only then did she allow herself to say Whose infants do they slay

To win his spiked cap an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find some wailing newborn and kill it before its mother’s eyes In this way we make certain that there is no weakness left in them

She was feeling faint The heat she tried to tell herself You take a babe from its mother’s arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin

When the translation was made for him Kraznys mo Nakloz laughed aloud What a soft mewling fool this one is Tell the whore of Westeros that the mark is for the child’s owner not the mother The Unsullied are not permitted to steal He tapped his whip against his leg Tell her that few ever fail that test The dogs are harder for them it must be said We give each boy a puppy on the day that he is cut At the end of the first year he is required to strangle it Any who cannot are killed and fed to the surviving dogs It makes for a good strong lesson we find

Arstan Whitebeard tapped the end of his staff on the bricks as he listened to that Tap tap tap Slow and steady Tap tap tap Dany saw him turn his eyes away as if he could not bear to look at Kraznys any longer

The Good Master has said that these eunuchs cannot be tempted with coin or flesh Dany told the girl but if some enemy of mine should offer them freedom for betraying me…

They would kill him out of hand and bring her his head tell her that the slaver answered Other slaves may steal and hoard up silver in hopes of buying freedom but an Unsullied would not take it if the little mare offered it as a gift They have no life outside their duty They are soldiers and that is all

It is soldiers I need Dany admitted

Tell her it is well she came to Astapor then Ask her how large an army she wishes to buy

How many Unsullied do you have to sell

Eight thousand fully trained and available at present We sell them only by the unit she should know By the thousand or the century Once we sold by the ten as household guards but that proved unsound Ten is too few They mingle with other slaves even freemen and forget who and what they are Kraznys waited for that to be rendered in the Common Tongue and then continued This beggar queen must understand such wonders do not come cheaply In Yunkai and Meereen slave swordsmen can be had for less than the price of their swords but Unsullied are the finest foot in all the world and each represents many years of training Tell her they are like Valyrian steel folded over and over and hammered for years on end until they are stronger and more resilient than any metal on earth

I know of Valyrian steel said Dany Ask the Good Master if the Unsullied have their own officers

You must set your own officers over them We train them to obey not to think If it is wits she wants let her buy scribes

And their gear

Sword shield spear sandals and quilted tunic are included said Kraznys And the spiked caps to be sure They will wear such armor as you wish but you must provide it

Dany could think of no other questions She looked at Arstan You have lived long in the world Whitebeard Now that you have seen them what do you say

I say no Your Grace the old man answered at once

Why she asked Speak freely Dany thought she knew what he would say but she wanted the slave girl to hear so Kraznys mo Nakloz might hear later

My queen said Arstan there have been no slaves in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years The old gods and the new alike hold slavery to be an abomination Evil If you should land in Westeros at the head of a slave army many good men will oppose you for no other reason than that You will do great harm to your cause and to the honor of your House

Yet I must have some army Dany said The boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking politely

When the day comes that you raise your banners half of Westeros will be with you Whitebeard promised Your brother Rhaegar is still remembered with great love

And my father Dany said

The old man hesitated before saying King Aerys is also remembered He gave the realm many years of peace Your Grace you have no need of slaves Magister Illyrio can keep you safe while your dragons grow and send secret envoys across the narrow sea on your behalf to sound out the high lords for your cause

Those same high lords who abandoned my father to the Kingslayer and bent the knee to Robert the Usurper

Even those who bent their knees may yearn in their hearts for the return of the dragons

May said Dany That was such a slippery word may In any language She turned back to Kraznys mo Nakloz and his slave girl I must consider carefully
