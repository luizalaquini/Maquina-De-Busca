Tavern wenches said Ser Cleos Frey This was an inn I remember it now Some men of my escort spent the night here when we last returned to Riverrun Nothing remained of the building but the stone foundation and a tangle of collapsed beams charred black Smoke still rose from the ashes

Jaime left brothels and whores to his brother Tyrion Cersei was the only woman he had ever wanted The girls pleasured some of my lord father’s soldiers it would seem Perhaps served them food and drink That’s how they earned their traitors’ collars with a kiss and a cup of ale He glanced up and down the river to make certain they were quite alone This is Bracken land Lord Jonos might have ordered them killed My father burned his castle I fear he loves us not

It might be Marq Piper’s work said Ser Cleos Or that wisp o’ the wood Beric Dondarrion though I’d heard he kills only soldiers Perhaps a band of Roose Bolton’s northmen

Bolton was defeated by my father on the Green Fork

But not broken said Ser Cleos He came south again when Lord Tywin marched against the fords The word at Riverrun was that he’d taken Harrenhal from Ser Amory Lorch

Jaime liked the sound of that not at all Brienne he said granting her the courtesy of the name in the hopes that she might listen if Lord Bolton holds Harrenhal both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely watched

He thought he saw a touch of uncertainty in her big blue eyes You are under my protection They’d need to kill me

I shouldn’t think that would trouble them

I am as good a fighter as you she said defensively I was one of King Renly’s chosen seven With his own hands he cloaked me with the striped silk of the Rainbow Guard

The Rainbow Guard You and six other girls was it A singer once said that all maids are fair in silk… But he never met you did he

The woman turned red We have graves to dig She went to climb the tree

The lower limbs of the oak were big enough for her to stand upon once she’d gotten up the trunk She walked amongst the leaves dagger in hand cutting down the corpses Flies swarmed around the bodies as they fell and the stench grew worse with each one she dropped This is a deal of trouble to take for whores Ser Cleos complained What are we supposed to dig with We have no spades and I will not use my sword I—

Brienne gave a shout She jumped down rather than climbing To the boat Be quick There’s a sail

They made what haste they could though Jaime could hardly run and had to be pulled back up into the skiff by his cousin Brienne shoved off with an oar and raised sail hurriedly Ser Cleos I’ll need you to row as well

He did as she bid The skiff began to cut the water a bit faster current wind and oars all worked for them Jaime sat chained peering upriver Only the top of the other sail was visible With the way the Red Fork looped it looked to be across the fields moving north behind a screen of trees while they moved south but he knew that was deceptive He lifted both hands to shade his eyes Mud red and watery blue he announced

Brienne’s big mouth worked soundlessly giving her the look of a cow chewing its cud Faster ser

The inn soon vanished behind them and they lost sight of the top of the sail as well but that meant nothing Once the pursuers swung around the loop they would become visible again We can hope the noble Tullys will stop to bury the dead whores I suppose The prospect of returning to his cell did not appeal to Jaime Tyrion could think of something clever now but all that occurs to me is to go at them with a sword

For the good part of an hour they played peek-and-seek with the pursuers sweeping around bends and between small wooded isles Just when they were starting to hope that somehow they might have left behind the pursuit the distant sail became visible again Ser Cleos paused in his stroke The Others take them He wiped sweat from his brow

Row Brienne said

That is a river galley coming after us Jaime announced after he’d watched for a while With every stroke it seemed to grow a little larger Nine oars on each side which means eighteen men More if they crowded on fighters as well as rowers And larger sails than ours We cannot outrun her

Ser Cleos froze at his oars Eighteen you said

Six for each of us I’d want eight but these bracelets hinder me somewhat Jaime held up his wrists Unless the Lady Brienne would be so kind as to unshackle me

She ignored him putting all her effort into her stroke

We had half a night’s start on them Jaime said They’ve been rowing since dawn resting two oars at a time They’ll be exhausted Just now the sight of our sail has given them a burst of strength but that will not last We ought to be able to kill a good many of them

Ser Cleos gaped But… There are eighteen

At the least More likely twenty or twenty-five

His cousin groaned We can’t hope to defeat eighteen
