Nor has any man here Ser Raymun added hotly Even his brother is a pup beside him My lords open your eyes Do you need to see his seal on the corpses It was Gregor

Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand Pycelle asked By the grace of his liege lord he holds a stout keep and lands of his own The man is an anointed knight

A false knight Ser Marq said Lord Tywin’s mad dog

My lord Hand Pycelle declared in a stiff voice I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen

Thank you Grand Maester Pycelle Ned said I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out

From his vantage point atop the throne he could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall Hares going to ground he supposed… or rats off to nibble the queen’s cheese He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery with his daughter Sansa beside her Ned felt a flash of anger this was no place for a girl But the septa could not have known that today’s court would be anything but the usual tedious business of hearing petitions settling disputes between rival holdfasts and adjudicating the placement of boundary stones

At the council table below Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward Ser Marq Ser Karyl Ser Raymun—perhaps I might ask you a question These holdfasts were under your protection Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on

Ser Karyl Vance answered I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth as was Ser Marq When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king

Ser Raymun Darry spoke up Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength I was camped across the river from his walls awaiting his commands when the word reached me By the time I could return to my own lands Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork riding for Lannister’s hills

Littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully And if they come again ser

If they come again we’ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt Ser Marq Piper declared hotly

Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day’s ride of the border Ser Karyl explained The next raider will not have such an easy time of it

And that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants Ned thought to himself to bleed off strength from Riverrun goad the boy into scattering his swords His wife’s brother was young and more gallant than wise He would try to hold every inch of his soil to defend every man woman and child who named him lord and Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that

If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm Lord Petyr was saying what then do you ask of the throne

The lords of the Trident keep the king’s peace Ser Raymun Darry said The Lannisters have broken it We ask leave to answer them steel for steel We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford

Edmure agrees we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin Ser Marq declared but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king’s leave before we strike

Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster then Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion If indeed he’d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage—and Ned did not doubt that he had—he’d taken care to see that he rode under cover of night without banners in the guise of a common brigand Should Riverrun strike back Cersei and her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who broke the king’s peace not the Lannisters The gods only knew what Robert would believe

Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again My lord Hand if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint These crimes are no concern of the throne Let them seek Lord Tywin’s justice

It is all the king’s justice Ned told him North south east or west all we do we do in Robert’s name

The king’s justice Grand Maester Pycelle said So it is and so we should defer this matter until the king—

The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days Lord Eddard said Robert bid me to sit here in his place to listen with his ears and to speak with his voice I mean to do just that… though I agree that he must be told He saw a familiar face beneath the tapestries Ser Robar

Ser Robar Royce stepped forward and bowed My lord

Your father is hunting with the king Ned said Will you bring them word of what was said and done here today

At once my lord

Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor then Marq Piper asked the throne

Vengeance Ned said I thought we were speaking of justice Burning Clegane’s fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king’s peace only your injured pride He glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest and addressed the villagers People of Sherrer I cannot give you back your homes or your crops nor can I restore your dead to life But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice in the name of our king Robert

Every eye in the hall was fixed on him waiting Slowly Ned struggled to his feet pushing himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms his shattered leg screaming inside its cast He did his best to ignore the pain it was no moment to let them see his weakness The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword and in the north we hold to that still I mislike sending another to do my killing… yet it seems I have no choice He gestured at his broken leg

Lord Eddard The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of a boy strode forth boldly Out of his armor Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than his sixteen years He wore pale blue silk his belt a linked chain of golden roses the sigil of his House I beg you the honor of acting in your place Give this task to me my lord and I swear I shall not fail you

Littlefinger chuckled Ser Loras if we send you off alone Ser Gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours The Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man’s justice

I do not fear Gregor Clegane Ser Loras said haughtily

Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon’s misshapen throne His eyes searched the faces along the wall Lord Beric he called out Thoros of Myr Ser Gladden Lord Lothar The men named stepped forward one by one Each of you is to assemble twenty men to bring my word to Gregor’s keep Twenty of my own guards shall go with you Lord Beric Dondarrion you shall have the command as befits your rank

The young lord with the red-gold hair bowed As you command Lord Eddard

Ned raised his voice so it carried to the far end of the throne room In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon the First of his Name King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm by the word of Eddard of the House Stark his Hand I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king’s flag and there bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and to all those who shared in his crimes I denounce him and attaint him and strip him of all rank and titles of all lands and incomes and holdings and do sentence him to death May the gods take pity on his soul

When the echo of his words had died away the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed Lord Eddard what of me

Ned looked down on him From on high Loras Tyrell seemed almost as young as Robb No one doubts your valor Ser Loras but we are about justice here and what you seek is vengeance He looked back to Lord Beric Ride at first light These things are best done quickly He held up a hand The throne will hear no more petitions today

Alyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down As they made their descent he could feel Loras Tyrell’s sullen stare but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room

At the base of the Iron Throne Varys was gathering papers from the council table Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave You are a bolder man than I my lord the eunuch said softly

How so Lord Varys Ned asked brusquely His leg was throbbing and he was in no mood for word games

Had it been me up there I should have sent Ser Loras He so wanted to go… and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends

Ser Loras is young said Ned I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment

And Ser Ilyn The eunuch stroked a plump powdered cheek He is the King’s Justice after all Sending other men to do his office… some might construe that as a grave insult

No slight was intended In truth Ned did not trust the mute knight though perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners I remind you the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty

Very prudent no doubt Varys said Still I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall staring at us with those pale eyes of his and I must say he did not look pleased though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well He does so love his work…





SANSA

He wouldn’t send Ser Loras Sansa told Jeyne Poole that night as they shared a cold supper by lamplight I think it was because of his leg

Lord Eddard had taken his supper in his bedchamber with Alyn Harwin and Vayon Poole the better to rest his broken leg and Septa Mordane had complained of sore feet after standing in the gallery all day Arya was supposed to join them but she was late coming back from her dancing lesson

His leg Jeyne said uncertainly She was a pretty dark-haired girl of Sansa’s own age Did Ser Loras hurt his leg

Not his leg Sansa said nibbling delicately at a chicken leg Father’s leg silly It hurts him ever so much it makes him cross Otherwise I’m certain he would have sent Ser Loras
