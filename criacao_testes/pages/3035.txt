2319 Behold a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury even a
grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the
wicked

2320 The anger of the LORD shall not return until he have executed
and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter
days ye shall consider it perfectly

2321 I have not sent these prophets yet they ran I have not spoken
to them yet they prophesied

2322 But if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to
hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way
and from the evil of their doings

2323 Am I a God at hand saith the LORD and not a God afar off
2324 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him
saith the LORD Do not I fill heaven and earth saith the LORD

2325 I have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my
name saying I have dreamed I have dreamed

2326 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own
heart 2327 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers
have forgotten my name for Baal

2328 The prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that
hath my word let him speak my word faithfully What is the chaff to
the wheat saith the LORD

2329 Is not my word like as a fire saith the LORD and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces  2330 Therefore behold I am
against the prophets saith the LORD that steal my words every one
from his neighbour

2331 Behold I am against the prophets saith the LORD that use
their tongues and say He saith

2332 Behold I am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the
LORD and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and
by their lightness yet I sent them not nor commanded them therefore
they shall not profit this people at all saith the LORD

2333 And when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask
thee saying What is the burden of the LORD thou shalt then say unto
them What burden I will even forsake you saith the LORD

2334 And as for the prophet and the priest and the people that
shall say The burden of the LORD I will even punish that man and his
house

2335 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to
his brother What hath the LORD answered and What hath the LORD
spoken  2336 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more
for every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the
words of the living God of the LORD of hosts our God

2337 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet What hath the LORD answered
thee and What hath the LORD spoken  2338 But since ye say The
burden of the LORD therefore thus saith the LORD Because ye say this
word The burden of the LORD and I have sent unto you saying Ye
shall not say The burden of the LORD 2339 Therefore behold I
even I will utterly forget you and I will forsake you and the city
that I gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence
2340 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a
perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten

241 The LORD shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set
before the temple of the LORD after that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah and the princes of Judah with the carpenters and smiths from
Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon

242 One basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first
ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be
eaten they were so bad

243 Then said the LORD unto me What seest thou Jeremiah And I
said Figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that
cannot be eaten they are so evil

244 Again the word of the LORD came unto me saying 245 Thus saith
the LORD the God of Israel Like these good figs so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah whom I have
sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good

246 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good and I will bring
them again to this land and I will build them and not pull them
down and I will plant them and not pluck them up

247 And I will give them an heart to know me that I am the LORD and
they shall be my people and I will be their God for they shall
return unto me with their whole heart

248 And as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil
surely thus saith the LORD So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah
and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem that remain in this
land and them that dwell in the land of Egypt 249 And I will
