The Blackfish looked at him shrewdly You know that for a certainty That this will make young Karstark your enemy

What else would he be I am about to kill his father he’s not like to thank me

He might There are sons who hate their fathers and in a stroke you will make him Lord of Karhold

Robb shook his head Even if Harrion were that sort he could never openly forgive his father’s killer His own men would turn on him These are northmen Uncle The north remembers

Pardon him then urged Edmure Tully

Robb stared at him in frank disbelief

Under that gaze Edmure’s face reddened Spare his life I mean I don’t like the taste of it any more than you sire He slew my men as well Poor Delp had only just recovered from the wound Ser Jaime gave him Karstark must be punished certainly Keep him in chains I say

A hostage said Catelyn It might be best   

Yes a hostage Her brother seized on her musing as agreement Tell the son that so long as he remains loyal his father will not be harmed Otherwise    we have no hope of the Freys now not if I offered to marry all Lord Walder’s daughters and carry his litter besides If we should lose the Karstarks as well what hope is there

What hope    Robb let out a breath pushed his hair back from his eyes and said We’ve had naught from Ser Rodrik in the north no response from Walder Frey to our new offer only silence from the Eyrie He appealed to his mother Will your sister never answer us How many times must I write her I will not believe that none of the birds have reached her

Her son wanted comfort Catelyn realized he wanted to hear that it would be all right But her king needed truth The birds have reached her Though she may tell you they did not if it ever comes to that Expect no help from that quarter Robb

Lysa was never brave When we were girls together she would run and hide whenever she’d done something wrong Perhaps she thought our lord father would forget to be wroth with her if he could not find her It is no different now She ran from King’s Landing for fear to the safest place she knows and she sits on her mountain hoping everyone will forget her

The knights of the Vale could make all the difference in this war said Robb but if she will not fight so be it I’ve asked only that she open the Bloody Gate for us and provide ships at Gulltown to take us north The high road would be hard but not so hard as fighting our way up the Neck If I could land at White Harbor I could flank Moat Cailin and drive the ironmen from the north in half a year

It will not happen sire said the Blackfish Cat is right Lady Lysa is too fearful to admit an army to the Vale Any army The Bloody Gate will remain closed

The Others can take her then Robb cursed in a fury of despair Bloody Rickard Karstark as well And Theon Greyjoy Walder Frey Tywin Lannister and all the rest of them Gods be good why would any man ever want to be king When everyone was shouting King in the North King in the North I told myself    swore to myself    that I would be a good king as honorable as Father strong just loyal to my friends and brave when I faced my enemies    now I can’t even tell one from the other How did it all get so confused Lord Rickard’s fought at my side in half a dozen battles His sons died for me in the Whispering Wood Tion Frey and Willem Lannister were my enemies Yet now I have to kill my dead friends’ father for their sakes He looked at them all Will the Lannisters thank me for Lord Rickard’s head Will the Freys

No said Brynden Blackfish blunt as ever

All the more reason to spare Lord Rickard’s life and keep him hostage Edmure urged

Robb reached down with both hands lifted the heavy bronze-and-iron crown and set it back atop his head and suddenly he was a king again Lord Rickard dies

But why said Edmure You said yourself—

I know what I said Uncle It does not change what I must do The swords in his crown stood stark and black against his brow In battle I might have slain Tion and Willem myself but this was no battle They were asleep in their beds naked and unarmed in a cell where I put them Rickard Karstark killed more than a Frey and a Lannister He killed my honor I shall deal with him at dawn

When day broke grey and chilly the storm had diminished to a steady soaking rain yet even so the godswood was crowded River lords and northmen highborn and low knights and sellswords and stableboys they stood amongst the trees to see the end of the night’s dark dance Edmure had given commands and a headsman’s block had been set up before the heart tree Rain and leaves fell all around them as the Greatjon’s men led Lord Rickard Karstark through the press hands still bound His men already hung from Riverrun’s high walls slumping at the end of long ropes as the rain washed down their darkening faces

Long Lew waited beside the block but Robb took the poleaxe from his hand and ordered him to step aside This is my work he said He dies at my word He must die by my hand

Lord Rickard Karstark dipped his head stiffly For that much I thank you But for naught else He had dressed for death in a long black wool surcoat emblazoned with the white sunburst of his House The blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours boy You would do well to remember that I was named for your grandfather I raised my banners against King Aerys for your father and against King Joffrey for you At Oxcross and the Whispering Wood and in the Battle of the Camps I rode beside you and I stood with Lord Eddard on the Trident We are kin Stark and Karstark

This kinship did not stop you from betraying me Robb said And it will not save you now Kneel my lord

Lord Rickard had spoken truly Catelyn knew The Karstarks traced their descent to Karlon Stark a younger son of Winterfell who had put down a rebel lord a thousand years ago and been granted lands for his valor The castle he built had been named Karl’s Hold but that soon became Karhold and over the centuries the Karhold Starks had become Karstarks

Old gods or new it makes no matter Lord Rickard told her son no man is so accursed as the kinslayer

Kneel traitor Robb said again Or must I have them force your head onto the block

Lord Karstark knelt The gods shall judge you as you have judged me He laid his head upon the block

Rickard Karstark Lord of Karhold Robb lifted the heavy axe with both hands Here in sight of gods and men I judge you guilty of murder and high treason In mine own name I condemn you With mine own hand I take your life Would you speak a final word

Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine

The axe crashed down Heavy and well-honed it killed at a single blow but it took three to sever the man’s head from his body and by the time it was done both living and dead were drenched in blood Robb flung the poleaxe down in disgust and turned wordless to the heart tree He stood shaking with his hands half-clenched and the rain running down his cheeks Gods forgive him Catelyn prayed in silence He is only a boy and he had no other choice

That was the last she saw of her son that day The rain continued all through the morning lashing the surface of the rivers and turning the godswood grass into mud and puddles The Blackfish assembled a hundred men and rode out after Karstarks but no one expected he would bring back many I only pray I do not need to hang them he said as he departed When he was gone Catelyn retreated to her father’s solar to sit once more beside Lord Hoster’s bed

It will not be much longer Maester Vyman warned her when he came that afternoon His last strength is going though still he tries to fight

He was ever a fighter she said A sweet stubborn man

Yes the maester said but this battle he cannot win It is time he lay down his sword and shield Time to yield

To yield she thought to make a peace Was it her father the maester was speaking of or her son

At evenfall Jeyne Westerling came to see her The young queen entered the solar timidly Lady Catelyn I do not mean to disturb you   

You are most welcome here Your Grace Catelyn had been sewing but she put the needle aside now

Please Call me Jeyne I don’t feel like a Grace

You are one nonetheless Please come sit Your Grace

Jeyne She sat by the hearth and smoothed her skirt out anxiously

As you wish How might I serve you Jeyne

It’s Robb the girl said He’s so miserable so    so angry and disconsolate I don’t know what to do

It is a hard thing to take a man’s life

I know I told him he should use a headsman When Lord Tywin sends a man to die all he does is give the command It’s easier that way don’t you think

Yes said Catelyn but my lord husband taught his sons that killing should never be easy

Oh Queen Jeyne wet her lips Robb has not eaten all day I had Rollam bring him a nice supper boar’s ribs and stewed onions and ale but he never touched a bite of it He spent all morning writing a letter and told me not to disturb him but when the letter was done he burned it Now he is sitting and looking at maps I asked him what he was looking for but he never answered I don’t think he ever heard me He wouldn’t even change out of his clothes They were damp all day and bloody I want to be a good wife to him I do but I don’t know how to help To cheer him or comfort him I don’t know what he needs Please my lady you’re his mother tell me what I should do

Tell me what I should do Catelyn might have asked the same if her father had been well enough to ask But Lord Hoster was gone or near enough Her Ned as well Bran and Rickon too and Mother and Brandon so long ago Only Robb remained to her Robb and the fading hope of her daughters

Sometimes Catelyn said slowly the best thing you can do is nothing When I first came to Winterfell I was hurt whenever Ned went to the godswood to sit beneath his heart tree Part of his soul was in that tree I knew a part I would never share Yet without that part I soon realized he would not have been Ned Jeyne child you have wed the north as I did    and in the north the winters will come She tried to smile Be patient Be understanding He loves you and he needs you and he will come back to you soon enough This very night perhaps Be there when he does That is all I can tell you

The young queen listened raptly I will she said when Catelyn was done I’ll be there She got to her feet I should go back He might have missed me I’ll see But if he’s still at his maps I’ll be patient
