Tyrion was scarcely reassured Mace Tyrell had been Joffrey’s good-father however briefly and the Red Viper was    well a snake Will I be allowed to demand trial by battle

I would not advise that

Why not It had saved him in the Vale why not here Answer me Uncle Will I be allowed a trial by battle and a champion to prove my innocence

Certainly if such is your wish However you had best know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor Clegane as her champion in the event of such a trial

The bitch checks my moves before I make them A pity she didn’t choose a Kettleblack Bronn would make short work of any of the three brothers but the Mountain That Rides was a kettle of a different color I shall need to sleep on this I need to speak with Bronn and soon He didn’t want to think about what this was like to cost him Bronn had a lofty notion of what his skin was worth Does Cersei have witnesses against me

More every day

Then I must have witnesses of my own

Tell me who you would have and Ser Addam will send the Watch to bring them to the trial

I would sooner find them myself

You stand accused of regicide and kinslaying Do you truly imagine you will be allowed to come and go as you please Ser Kevan waved at the table You have quill ink and parchment Write the names of such witnesses as you require and I shall do all in my power to produce them you have my word as a Lannister But you shall not leave this tower except to go to trial

Tyrion would not demean himself by begging Will you permit my squire to come and go The boy Podrick Payne

Certainly if that is your wish I shall send him to you

Do so Sooner would be better than later and now would be better than sooner He waddled to the writing table But when he heard the door open he turned back and said Uncle

Ser Kevan paused Yes

I did not do this

I wish I could believe that Tyrion

When the door closed Tyrion Lannister pulled himself up into the chair sharpened a quill and pulled a blank parchment Who will speak for me He dipped his quill in the inkpot

The sheet was still maiden when Podrick Payne appeared sometime later My lord the boy said

Tyrion put down the quill Find Bronn and bring him at once Tell him there’s gold in it more gold than he’s ever dreamt of and see that you don’t return without him

Yes my lord I mean no I won’t Return He went

He had not returned by sunset nor by moonrise Tyrion fell asleep in the window seat to wake stiff and sore at dawn A serving man brought porridge and apples to break his fast with a horn of ale He ate at the table the blank parchment before him An hour later the serving man returned for the bowl Have you seen my squire Tyrion asked him The man shook his head

Sighing he turned back to the table and dipped the quill again Sansa he wrote upon the parchment He sat staring at the name his teeth clenched so hard they hurt

Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of food which even Tyrion found hard to swallow Sansa must have poisoned him Joff practically put his cup down in her lap and he’d given her ample reason Any doubts Tyrion might have had vanished when his wife did One flesh one heart one soul His mouth twisted She wasted no time proving how much those vows meant to her did she Well what did you expect dwarf

And yet    where would Sansa have gotten poison He could not believe the girl had acted alone in this Do I really want to find her Would the judges believe that Tyrion’s child bride had poisoned a king without her husband’s knowledge I wouldn’t Cersei would insist that they had done the deed together

Even so he gave the parchment to his uncle the next day Ser Kevan frowned at it Lady Sansa is your only witness

I will think of others in time

Best think of them now The judges mean to begin the trial three days hence

That’s too soon You have me shut up here under guard how am I to find witnesses to my innocence

Your sister’s had no difficulty finding witnesses to your guilt Ser Kevan rolled up the parchment Ser Addam has men hunting for your wife Varys has offered a hundred stags for word of her whereabouts and a hundred dragons for the girl herself If the girl can be found she will be found and I shall bring her to you I see no harm in husband and wife sharing the same cell and giving comfort to one another

You are too kind Have you seen my squire

I sent him to you yesterday Did he not come

He came Tyrion admitted and then he went

I shall send him to you again

But it was the next morning before Podrick Payne returned He stepped inside the room hesitantly with fear written all over his face Bronn came in behind him The sellsword knight wore a jerkin studded with silver and a heavy riding cloak with a pair of fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through his swordbelt

One look at Bronn’s face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach It took you long enough

The boy begged or I wouldn’t have come at all I am expected at Castle Stokeworth for supper

Stokeworth Tyrion hopped from the bed And pray what is there for you in Stokeworth

A bride Bronn smiled like a wolf contemplating a lost lamb I’m to wed Lollys the day after next

Lollys Perfect bloody perfect Lady Tanda’s lackwit daughter gets a knightly husband and a father of sorts for the bastard in her belly and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater climbs another rung It had Cersei’s stinking fingers all over it My bitch sister has sold you a lame horse The girl’s dim-witted

If I wanted wits I’d marry you

Lollys is big with another man’s child

And when she pops him out I’ll get her big with mine

She’s not even heir to Stokeworth Tyrion pointed out She has an elder sister Falyse A married sister

Married ten years and still barren said Bronn Her lord husband shuns her bed It’s said he prefers virgins

He could prefer goats and it wouldn’t matter The lands will still pass to his wife when Lady Tanda dies

Unless Falyse should die before her mother

Tyrion wondered whether Cersei had any notion of the sort of serpent she’d given Lady Tanda to suckle And if she does would she care Why are you here then

Bronn shrugged You once told me that if anyone ever asked me to sell you out you’d double the price

Yes Is it two wives you want or two castles

One of each would serve But if you want me to kill Gregor Clegane for you it had best be a damned big castle
