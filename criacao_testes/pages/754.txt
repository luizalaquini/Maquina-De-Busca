There is no need The Night’s Watch is a pack of thieves killers and baseborn churls but it occurs to me that they could prove otherwise given proper discipline If Mormont is indeed dead the black brothers must choose a new Lord Commander

Pycelle gave Tyrion a sly glance An excellent thought my lord I know the very man Janos Slynt

Tyrion liked that notion not at all The black brothers choose their own commander he reminded them Lord Slynt is new to the Wall I know I sent him there Why should they pick him over a dozen more senior men

Because his father said in a tone that suggested Tyrion was quite the simpleton if they do not vote as they are told their Wall will melt before it sees another man

Yes that would work Tyrion hitched forward Janos Slynt is the wrong man Father We’d do better with the commander of the Shadow Tower Or Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

The commander of the Shadow Tower is a Mallister of Seagard Eastwatch is held by an ironman Neither would serve his purposes Lord Tywin’s tone said clear enough

Janos Slynt is a butcher’s son Tyrion reminded his father forcefully You yourself told me—

I recall what I told you Castle Black is not Harrenhal however The Night’s Watch is not the king’s council There is a tool for every task and a task for every tool

Tyrion’s anger flashed Lord Janos is a hollow suit of armor who will sell himself to the highest bidder

I count that a point in his favor Who is like to bid higher than us He turned to Pycelle Send a raven Write that King Joffrey was deeply saddened to hear of Lord Commander Mormont’s death but regrets that he can spare no men just now whilst so many rebels and usurpers remain in the field Suggest that matters might be quite different once the throne is secure… provided the king has full confidence in the leadership of the Watch In closing ask Marsh to pass along His Grace’s fondest regards to his faithful friend and servant Lord Janos Slynt

Yes my lord Pycelle bobbed his withered head once more I shall write as the Hand commands With great pleasure

I should have trimmed his head not his beard Tyrion reflected And Slynt should have gone for a swim with his dear friend Allar Deem At least he had not made the same foolish mistake with Symon Silver Tongue See there Father he wanted to shout See how fast I learn my lessons





Samwell


Up in the loft a woman was giving birth noisily while below a man lay dying by the fire Samwell Tarly could not say which frightened him more

They’d covered poor Bannen with a pile of furs and stoked the fire high yet all he could say was I’m cold Please I’m so cold Sam was trying to feed him onion broth but he could not swallow The broth dribbled over his lips and down his chin as fast as Sam could spoon it in

That one’s dead Craster eyed the man with indifference as he worried at a sausage Be kinder to stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat you ask me

I don’t recall as we did Giant was no more than five feet tall—his true name was Bedwyck—but a fierce little man for all that Slayer did you ask Craster for his counsel

Sam cringed at the name but shook his head He filled another spoon brought it to Bannen’s mouth and tried to ease it between his lips

Food and fire Giant was saying that was all we asked of you And you grudge us the food

Be glad I didn’t grudge you fire too Craster was a thick man made thicker by the ragged smelly sheepskins he wore day and night He had a broad flat nose a mouth that drooped to one side and a missing ear And though his matted hair and tangled beard might be grey going white his hard knuckly hands still looked strong enough to hurt I fed you what I could but you crows are always hungry I’m a godly man else I would have chased you off You think I need the likes of him dying on my floor You think I need all your mouths little man The wildling spat Crows When did a black bird ever bring good to a man’s hall I ask you Never Never

More broth ran from the corner of Bannen’s mouth Sam dabbed it away with a corner of his sleeve The ranger’s eyes were open but unseeing I’m cold he said again so faintly A maester might have known how to save him but they had no maester Kedge Whiteye had taken Bannen’s mangled foot off nine days past in a gout of pus and blood that made Sam sick but it was too little too late I’m so cold the pale lips repeated

About the hall a ragged score of black brothers squatted on the floor or sat on rough-hewn benches drinking cups of the same thin onion broth and gnawing on chunks of hardbread A couple were wounded worse than Bannen to look at them Fornio had been delirious for days and Ser Byam’s shoulder was oozing a foul yellow pus When they’d left Castle Black Brown Bernarr had been carrying bags of Myrish fire mustard salve ground garlic tansy poppy kingscopper and other healing herbs Even sweetsleep which gave the gift of painless death But Brown Bernarr had died on the Fist and no one had thought to search for Maester Aemon’s medicines Hake had known some herblore as well being a cook but Hake was also lost So it was left to the surviving stewards to do what they could for the wounded which was little enough At least they are dry here with a fire to warm them They need more food though

They all needed more food The men had been grumbling for days Clubfoot Karl kept saying how Craster had to have a hidden larder and Garth of Oldtown had begun to echo him when he was out of the Lord Commander’s hearing Sam had thought of begging for something more nourishing for the wounded men at least but he did not have the courage Craster’s eyes were cold and mean and whenever the wildling looked his way his hands twitched a little as if they wanted to curl up into fists Does he know I spoke to Gilly the last time we were here he wondered Did she tell him I said we’d take her Did he beat it out of her

I’m cold said Bannen Please I’m cold
