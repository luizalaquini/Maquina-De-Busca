Let me hazard a wild stab One is for Robb Stark the others for Lords Stannis and Renly Would that be right

Yes my lord

My nephew is thirteen years old today Vylarr Try and recall that I’ll have the heads down on the morrow or one of those empty spikes may have a different lodger Do you take my meaning Captain

I’ll see that they’re taken down myself my lord

Good Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted away leaving the red cloaks to follow as best they could

He had told Cersei he intended to take the measure of the city That was not entirely a lie Tyrion Lannister was not pleased by much of what he saw The streets of King’s Landing had always been teeming and raucous and noisy but now they reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past visits A naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the Street of Looms being torn at by a pack of feral dogs yet no one seemed to care Watchmen were much in evidence moving in pairs through the alleys in their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail iron cudgels never far from their hands The markets were crowded with ragged men selling their household goods for any price they could get… and conspicuously empty of farmers selling food What little produce he did see was three times as costly as it had been a year ago One peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer Fresh rats he cried loudly fresh rats Doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats The frightening thing was the rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling On the Street of Flour Tyrion saw guards at every other shop door When times grew lean even bakers found sellswords cheaper than bread he reflected

There is no food coming in is there he said to Vylarr

Little enough the captain admitted With the war in the riverlands and Lord Renly raising rebels in Highgarden the roads are closed to south and west

And what has my good sister done about this

She is taking steps to restore the king’s peace Vylarr assured him Lord Slynt has tripled the size of the City Watch and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our defenses The stonemasons are strengthening the walls carpenters are building scorpions and catapults by the hundred fletchers are making arrows the smiths are forging blades and the Alchemists’ Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of wildfire

Tyrion shifted uncomfortably in his saddle He was pleased that Cersei had not been idle but wildfire was treacherous stuff and ten thousand jars were enough to turn all of King’s Landing into cinders Where has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this It was no secret that King Robert had left the crown vastly in debt and alchemists were seldom mistaken for altruists

Lord Littlefinger always finds a way my lord He has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city

Yes that would work Tyrion said thinking Clever Clever and cruel Tens of thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of King’s Landing He had seen them on the kingsroad troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war… though they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire

The inn beneath the sign of the broken anvil stood within sight of those walls near the Gate of the Gods where they had entered that morning As they rode into its courtyard a boy ran out to help Tyrion down from his horse Take your men back to the castle he told Vylarr I’ll be spending the night here

The captain looked dubious Will you be safe my lord

Well as to that Captain when I left the inn this morning it was full of Black Ears One is never quite safe when Chella daughter of Cheyk is about Tyrion waddled toward the door leaving Vylarr to puzzle at his meaning

A gust of merriment greeted him as he shoved into the inn’s common room He recognized Chella’s throaty chuckle and the lighter music of Shae’s laughter The girl was seated by the hearth sipping wine at a round wooden table with three of the Black Ears he’d left to guard her and a plump man whose back was to him The innkeeper he assumed… until Shae called Tyrion by name and the intruder rose My good lord I am so pleased to see you he gushed a soft eunuch’s smile on his powdered face

Tyrion stumbled Lord Varys I had not thought to see you here The Others take him how did he find them so quickly

Forgive me if I intrude Varys said I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady

Young lady Shae repeated savoring the words You’re half right m’lord I’m young

Eighteen Tyrion thought Eighteen and a whore but quick of wit nimble as a cat between the sheets with large dark eyes and fine black hair and a sweet soft hungry little mouth… and mine Damn you eunuch I fear I’m the intruder Lord Varys he said with forced courtesy When I came in you were in the midst of some merriment

M’lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a fine necklace Shae explained It grated on him to hear her call Varys m’lord in that tone that was what she called him in their pillow play And Chella told him only cowards kill the vanquished

Braver to leave the man alive with a chance to cleanse his shame by winning back his ear explained Chella a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less than forty-six dried wrinkled ears Tyrion had counted them once Only so can you prove you do not fear your enemies

Shae hooted And then m’lord says if he was a Black Ear he’d never sleep for dreams of one-eared men

A problem I will never need face Tyrion said I’m terrified of my enemies so I kill them all

Varys giggled Will you take some wine with us my lord

I’ll take some wine Tyrion seated himself beside Shae He understood what was happening here if Chella and the girl did not Varys was delivering a message When he said I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady what he meant was You tried to hide her but I knew where she was and who she was and here I am He wondered who had betrayed him The innkeeper that boy in the stable a guard on the gate… or one of his own

I always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods Varys told Shae as he filled the wine cups The carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite they make me weep each time I see them The eyes… so expressive don’t you think They almost seem to follow you as you ride beneath the portcullis

I never noticed m’lord Shae replied I’ll look again on the morrow if it please you

Don’t bother sweetling Tyrion thought swirling the wine in the cup He cares not a whit about carvings The eyes he boasts of are his own What he means is that he was watching that he knew we were here the moment we passed through the gates

Do be careful child Varys urged King’s Landing is not wholly safe these days I know these streets well and yet I almost feared to come today alone and unarmed as I was Lawless men are everywhere in this dark time oh yes Men with cold steel and colder hearts Where I can come alone and unarmed others can come with swords in their fists he was saying

Shae only laughed If they try and bother me they’ll be one ear short when Chella runs them off

Varys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard but there was no laughter in his eyes when he turned them on Tyrion Your young lady has an amiable way to her I should take very good care of her if I were you

I intend to Any man who tries to harm her—well I’m too small to be a Black Ear and I make no claims to courage See I speak the same tongue you do eunuch Hurt her and I’ll have your head

I will leave you Varys rose I know how weary you must be I only wished to welcome you my lord and tell you how very pleased I am by your arrival We have dire need of you on the council Have you seen the comet

I’m short not blind Tyrion said Out on the kingsroad it had seemed to cover half the sky outshining the crescent moon

In the streets they call it the Red Messenger Varys said They say it comes as a herald before a king to warn of fire and blood to follow The eunuch rubbed his powdered hands together May I leave you with a bit of a riddle Lord Tyrion He did not wait for an answer In a room sit three great men a king a priest and a rich man with his gold Between them stands a sellsword a little man of common birth and no great mind Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two ‘Do it’ says the king ‘for I am your lawful ruler’ ‘Do it’ says the priest ‘for I command you in the names of the gods’ ‘Do it’ says the rich man ‘and all this gold shall be yours’ So tell me—who lives and who dies Bowing deeply the eunuch hurried from the common room on soft slippered feet

When he was gone Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up her pretty face The rich man lives Doesn’t he

Tyrion sipped at his wine thoughtful Perhaps Or not That would depend on the sellsword it seems He set down his cup Come let’s go upstairs

She had to wait for him at the top of the steps for her legs were slim and supple while his were short and stunted and full of aches But she was smiling when he reached her Did you miss me she teased as she took his hand

Desperately Tyrion admitted Shae only stood a shade over five feet yet still he must look up to her… but in her case he found he did not mind She was sweet to look up at

You’ll miss me all the time in your Red Keep she said as she led him to her room All alone in your cold bed in your Tower of the Hand

Too true Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him but his lord father had forbidden it You will not take the whore to court Lord Tywin had commanded Bringing her to the city was as much defiance as he dared All his authority derived from his father the girl had to understand that You won’t be far he promised You’ll have a house with guards and servants and I’ll visit as often as I’m able

Shae kicked shut the door Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window he could make out the Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya’s Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a different sight Bending Shae took her gown by the hem drew it over her head and tossed it aside She did not believe in smallclothes You’ll never be able to rest she said as she stood before him pink and nude and lovely one hand braced on her hip You’ll think of me every time you go to bed Then you’ll get hard and you’ll have no one to help you and you’ll never be able to sleep unless you—she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well—is that why they call it the Tower of the Hand m’lord

Be quiet and kiss me he commanded

He could taste the wine on her lips and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches My lion she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress My sweet lord my giant of Lannister Tyrion pushed her toward the bed When he entered her she screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb and her nails left gouges in his back He’d never had a pain he liked half so well

Fool he thought to himself afterward as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets Will you never learn dwarf She’s a whore damn you it’s your coin she loves not your cock Remember Tysha Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple it stiffened at the touch and he could see the mark on her breast where he’d bitten her in his passion

So what will you do m’lord now that you’re the Hand of the King Shae asked him as he cupped that warm sweet flesh

Something Cersei will never expect Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck I’ll do… justice
