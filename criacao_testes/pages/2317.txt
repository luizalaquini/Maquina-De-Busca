This might serve our purpose Pylos passed him a letter

Davos flattened down the little square of crinkled parchment and squinted at the tiny crabbed letters Reading was hard on the eyes that much he had learned early Sometimes he wondered if the Citadel offered a champion’s purse to the maester who wrote the smallest hand Pylos had laughed at the notion but   

To the    five kings read Davos hesitating briefly over five which he did not often see written out The king    be    the king    beware

Beyond the maester corrected

Davos grimaced The King beyond the Wall comes    comes south He leads a    a    fast   

Vast

   a vast host of wil    wild    wildlings Lord M    Mmmor    Mormont sent a    raven from the    ha    ha   

Haunted The haunted forest Pylos underlined the words with the point of his finger

   the haunted forest He is    under a    attack

Yes

Pleased he plowed onward Oth    other birds have come since with no words We    fear    Mormont slain with all    with all his    stench    no strength We fear Mormont slain with all his strength    Davos suddenly realized just what he was reading He turned the letter over and saw that the wax that had sealed it had been black This is from the Night’s Watch Maester has King Stannis seen this letter

I brought it to Lord Alester when it first arrived He was the Hand then I believed he discussed it with the queen When I asked him if he wished to send a reply he told me not to be a fool ‘His Grace lacks the men to fight his own battles he has none to waste on wildlings’ he said to me

That was true enough And this talk of five kings would certainly have angered Stannis Only a starving man begs bread from a beggar he muttered

Pardon my lord

Something my wife said once Davos drummed his shortened fingers against the tabletop The first time he had seen the Wall he had been younger than Devan serving aboard the Cobblecat under Roro Uhoris a Tyroshi known up and down the narrow sea as the Blind Bastard though he was neither blind nor baseborn Roro had sailed past Skagos into the Shivering Sea visiting a hundred little coves that had never seen a trading ship before He brought steel swords axes helms good chainmail hauberks to trade for furs ivory amber and obsidian When the Cobblecat turned back south her holds were stuffed but in the Bay of Seals three black galleys came out to herd her into Eastwatch They lost their cargo and the Bastard lost his head for the crime of trading weapons to the wildlings

Davos had traded at Eastwatch in his smuggling days The black brothers made hard enemies but good customers for a ship with the right cargo But while he might have taken their coin he had never forgotten how the Blind Bastard’s head had rolled across the Cobblecat’s deck I met some wildlings when I was a boy he told Maester Pylos They were fair thieves but bad hagglers One made off with our cabin girl All in all they seemed men like any other men some fair some foul

Men are men Maester Pylos agreed Shall we return to our reading my lord Hand

I am the Hand of the King yes Stannis might be the King of Westeros in name but in truth he was the King of the Painted Table He held Dragonstone and Storm’s End and had an ever-more-uneasy alliance with Salladhor Saan but that was all How could the Watch have looked to him for help They may not know how weak he is how lost his cause King Stannis never saw this letter you are quite certain Nor Melisandre

No Should I bring it to them Even now

No Davos said at once You did your duty when you brought it to Lord Alester If Melisandre knew of this letter    What was it she had said One whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power Davos Seaworth Soon comes the cold and the night that never ends    And Stannis had seen a vision in the flames a ring of torches in the snow with terror all around

My lord are you unwell asked Pylos

I am frightened Maester he might have said Davos was remembering a tale Salladhor Saan had told him of how Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer by thrusting it through the heart of the wife he loved He slew his wife to fight the dark If Stannis is Azor Ahai come again does that mean Edric Storm must play the part of Nissa Nissa I was thinking Maester My pardons What harm if some wildling king conquers the north It was not as though Stannis held the north His Grace could scarcely be expected to defend people who refused to acknowledge him as king Give me another letter he said abruptly This one is too   

   difficult suggested Pylos

Soon comes the cold whispered Melisandre and the night that never ends Troubling said Davos Too    troubling A different letter please





JON

They woke to the smoke of Mole’s Town burning

Atop the King’s Tower Jon Snow leaned on the padded crutch that Maester Aemon had given him and watched the grey plume rise Styr had lost all hope of taking Castle Black unawares when Jon escaped him yet even so he need not have warned of his approach so bluntly You may kill us he reflected but no one will be butchered in their beds That much I did at least

His leg still hurt like blazes when he put his weight on it He’d needed Clydas to help him don his fresh-washed blacks and lace up his boots that morning and by the time they were done he’d wanted to drown himself in the milk of the poppy Instead he had settled for half a cup of dreamwine a chew of willow bark and the crutch The beacon was burning on Weatherback Ridge and the Night’s Watch had need of every man

I can fight he insisted when they tried to stop him

Your leg’s healed is it Noye snorted You won’t mind me giving it a little kick then

I’d sooner you didn’t It’s stiff but I can hobble around well enough and stand and fight if you have need of me

I have need of every man who knows which end of the spear to stab into the wildlings

The pointy end Jon had told his little sister something like that once he remembered

Noye rubbed the bristle on his chin Might be you’ll do We’ll put you on a tower with a longbow but if you bloody well fall off don’t come crying to me

He could see the kingsroad wending its way south through stony brown fields and over windswept hills The Magnar would be coming up that road before the day was done his Thenns marching behind him with axes and spears in their hands and their bronze-and-leather shields on their backs Grigg the Goat Quort Big Boil and the rest will be coming as well And Ygritte The wildlings had never been his friends he had not allowed them to be his friends but her   

He could feel the throb of pain where her arrow had gone through the meat and muscle of his thigh He remembered the old man’s eyes too and the black blood rushing from his throat as the storm cracked overhead But he remembered the grotto best of all the look of her naked in the torchlight the taste of her mouth when it opened under his Ygritte stay away Go south and raid go hide in one of those roundtowers you liked so well You’ll find nothing here but death

Across the yard one of the bowmen on the roof of the old Flint Barracks had unlaced his breeches and was pissing through a crenel Mully he knew from the man’s greasy orange hair Men in black cloaks were visible on other roofs and tower tops as well though nine of every ten happened to be made of straw The scarecrow sentinels Donal Noye called them Only we’re the crows Jon mused and most of us were scared enough

Whatever you called them the straw soldiers had been Maester Aemon’s notion They had more breeches and jerkins and tunics in the storerooms than they’d had men to fill them so why not stuff some with straw drape a cloak around their shoulders and set them to standing watches Noye had placed them on every tower and in half the windows Some were even clutching spears or had crossbows cocked under their arms The hope was that the Thenns would see them from afar and decide that Castle Black was too well defended to attack

Jon had six scarecrows sharing the roof of the King’s Tower with him along with two actual breathing brothers Deaf Dick Follard sat in a crenel methodically cleaning and oiling the mechanism of his crossbow to make sure the wheel turned smoothly while the Oldtown boy wandered restlessly around the parapets fussing with the clothes on straw men Maybe he thinks they will fight better if they’re posed just right Or maybe this waiting is fraying his nerves the way it’s fraying mine

The boy claimed to be eighteen older than Jon but he was green as summer grass for all that Satin they called him even in the wool and mail and boiled leather of the Night’s Watch the name he’d gotten in the brothel where he’d been born and raised He was pretty as a girl with his dark eyes soft skin and raven’s ringlets Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up his hands however and Noye said he was passable with a crossbow Whether he had the courage to face what was coming though   

Jon used the crutch to limp across the tower top The King’s Tower was not the castle’s tallest—the high slim crumbling Lance held that honor though Othell Yarwyck had been heard to say it might topple any day Nor was the King’s Tower strongest—the Tower of Guards beside the kingsroad would be a tougher nut to crack But it was tall enough strong enough and well placed beside the Wall overlooking the gate and the foot of the wooden stair

The first time he had seen Castle Black with his own eyes Jon had wondered why anyone would be so foolish as to build a castle without walls How could it be defended

It can’t his uncle told him That is the point The Night’s Watch is pledged to take no part in the quarrels of the realm Yet over the centuries certain Lords Commander more proud than wise forgot their vows and near destroyed us all with their ambitions Lord Commander Runcel Hightower tried to bequeathe the Watch to his bastard son Lord Commander Rodrik Flint thought to make himself King-beyond-the-Wall Tristan Mudd Mad Marq Rankenfell Robin Hill    did you know that six hundred years ago the commanders at Snowgate and the Nightfort went to war against each other And when the Lord Commander tried to stop them they joined forces to murder him The Stark in Winterfell had to take a hand    and both their heads Which he did easily because their strongholds were not defensible The Night’s Watch had nine hundred and ninety-six Lords Commander before Jeor Mormont most of them men of courage and honor    but we have had cowards and fools as well our tyrants and our madmen We survive because the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms know that we pose no threat to them no matter who should lead us Our only foes are to the north and to the north we have the Wall

Only now those foes have gotten past the Wall to come up from the south Jon reflected and the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms have forgotten us We are caught between the hammer and the anvil Without a wall Castle Black could not be held Donal Noye knew that as well as any The castle does them no good the armorer told his little garrison Kitchens common hall stables even the towers    let them take it all We’ll empty the armory and move what stores we can to the top of the Wall and make our stand around the gate

So Castle Black had a wall of sorts at last a crescent-shaped barricade ten feet high made of stores casks of nails and barrels of salt mutton crates bales of black broadcloth stacked logs sawn timbers fire-hardened stakes and sacks and sacks of grain The crude rampart enclosed the two things most worth defending the gate to the north and the foot of the great wooden switchback stair that clawed and climbed its way up the face of the Wall like a drunken thunderbolt supported by wooden beams as big as tree trunks driven deep into the ice

The last few moles were still making the long climb Jon saw urged on by his brothers Grenn was carrying a little boy in his arms while Pyp two flights below let an old man lean upon his shoulder The oldest villagers still waited below for the cage to make its way back down to them He saw a mother pulling along two children one on either hand as an older boy ran past her up the steps Two hundred feet above them Sky Blue Su and Lady Meliana who was no lady all her friends agreed stood on a landing looking south They had a better view of the smoke than he did no doubt Jon wondered about the villagers who had chosen not to flee There were always a few too stubborn or too stupid or too brave to run a few who preferred to fight or hide or bend the knee Maybe the Thenns would spare them

The thing to do would be to take the attack to them he thought With fifty rangers well mounted we could cut them apart on the road They did not have fifty rangers though nor half as many horses The garrison had not returned and there was no way to know just where they were or even whether the riders that Noye had sent out had reached them

We are the garrison Jon told himself and look at us The brothers Bowen Marsh had left behind were old men cripples and green boys just as Donal Noye had warned him He could see some wrestling barrels up the steps others on the barricade stout old Kegs as slow as ever Spare Boot hopping along briskly on his carved wooden leg half-mad Easy who fancied himself Florian the Fool reborn Dornish Dilly Red Alyn of the Rosewood Young Henly well past fifty Old Henly well past seventy Hairy Hal Spotted Pate of Maidenpool A couple of them saw Jon looking down from atop the King’s Tower and waved up at him Others turned away They still think me a turncloak That was a bitter draft to drink but Jon could not blame them He was a bastard after all Everyone knew that bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature having been born of lust and deceit And he had made as many enemies as friends at Castle Black    Rast for one Jon had once threatened to have Ghost rip his throat out unless he stopped tormenting Samwell Tarly and Rast did not forget things like that He was raking dry leaves into piles under the stairs just now but every so often he stopped long enough to give Jon a nasty look
