When the fiery ladder stood forty feet high the mage leapt forward and began to climb it scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey Each rung he touched dissolved behind him leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke When he reached the top the ladder was gone and so was he

A fine trick announced Jhogo with admiration

No trick a woman said in the Common Tongue

Dany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd yet there she stood eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask What mean you my lady

Half a year gone that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass He had some small skill with powders and wildfire sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets

Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood Even the smoke was gone now and the crowd was breaking up each man going about his business In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty And now

And now his powers grow Khaleesi And you are the cause of it

Me She laughed How could that be

The woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany’s wrist You are the Mother of Dragons are you not

She is and no spawn of shadows may touch her Jhogo brushed Quaithe’s fingers away with the handle of his whip

The woman took a step backward You must leave this city soon Daenerys Targaryen or you will never be permitted to leave it at all

Dany’s wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched her Where would you have me go she asked

To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Asshai Dany thought She would have me go to Asshai Will the Asshai’i give me an army she demanded Will there be gold for me in Asshai Will there be ships What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth

Truth said the woman in the mask And bowing she faded back into the crowd

Rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios Khaleesi better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows who dare not show their face beneath the sun It is known

It is known Aggo agreed

Xaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions When Dany climbed back into the palanquin beside him he said Your savages are wiser than they know Such truths as the Asshai’i hoard are not like to make you smile Then he pressed another cup of wine on her and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse

In the quiet of her chambers Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk Her dragons were hungry so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier They are growing she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the blackened flesh They must weigh twice what they had in Vaes Tolorro Even so it would be years before they were large enough to take to war And they must be trained as well or they will lay my kingdom waste For all her Targaryen blood Dany had not the least idea of how to train a dragon

Ser Jorah Mormont came to her as the sun was going down The Pureborn refused you

As you said they would Come sit give me your counsel Dany drew him down to the cushions beside her and Jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine

You will get no help in this city Khaleesi Ser Jorah took an onion between thumb and forefinger Each day I am more convinced of that than the day before The Pureborn see no farther than the walls of Qarth and Xaro   

He asked me to marry him again

Yes and I know why When the knight frowned his heavy black brows joined together above his deep-set eyes

He dreams of me day and night She laughed

Forgive me my queen but it is your dragons he dreams of

Xaro assures me that in Qarth man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed The dragons are mine She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her

He tells it true as far as it goes but there’s one thing he failed to mention The Qartheen have a curious wedding custom my queen On the day of their union a wife may ask a token of love from her husband Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods he must grant And he may ask the same of her One thing only may be asked but whatever is named may not be denied

One thing she repeated And it may not be denied

With one dragon Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city but one ship will further our cause but little

Dany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men We passed through the bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones she told Ser Jorah Quaithe was there She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder and what the woman in the red mask had told her

I would be glad to leave this city if truth be told the knight said when she was done But not for Asshai

Where then

East he said

I am half a world away from my kingdom even here If I go any farther east I may never find my way home to Westeros

If you go west you risk your life

House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities she reminded him Truer friends than Xaro or the Pureborn

If you mean Illyrio Mopatis I wonder For sufficient gold Illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would a slave

My brother and I were guests in Illyrio’s manse for half a year If he meant to sell us he could have done it then

He did sell you Ser Jorah said To Khal Drogo

Dany flushed He had the truth of it but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it Illyrio protected us from the Usurper’s knives and he believed in my brother’s cause

Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio Gluttons are greedy men as a rule and magisters are devious Illyrio Mopatis is both What do you truly know of him

I know that he gave me my dragon eggs

He snorted If he’d known they were like to hatch he’d would have sat on them himself

That made her smile despite herself Oh I have no doubt of that ser I know Illyrio better than you think I was a child when I left his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars but I was neither deaf nor blind And I am no child now

Even if Illyrio is the friend you think him the knight said stubbornly he is not powerful enough to enthrone you by himself no more than he could your brother

He is rich she said Not so rich as Xaro perhaps but rich enough to hire ships for me and men as well

Sellswords have their uses Ser Jorah admitted but you will not win your father’s throne with sweepings from the Free Cities Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil

I am their rightful queen Dany protested

You are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the Common Tongue The lords of Westeros do not know you and have every reason to fear and mistrust you You must win them over before you sail A few at least
