Slaves Dany thought Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver’s Bay She wanted to cry but she told herself that she must be strong This is war this is what it looks like this is the price of the Iron Throne

I’ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen Ser Jorah said They’ll pay a better price than he’d get from a slaving caravan Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls and triple for boys under ten If enough children survive the journey the gold will buy us all the ships we need and hire men to sail them

Behind them the girl being raped made a heartrending sound a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins and she turned the silver’s head Make them stop she commanded Ser Jorah

Khaleesi The knight sounded perplexed

You heard my words she said Stop them She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki Jhogo Quaro you will aid Ser Jorah I want no rape

The warriors exchanged a baffled look

Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer Princess he said you have a gentle heart but you do not understand This is how it has always been Those men have shed blood for the khal Now they claim their reward

Across the road the girl was still crying her high singsong tongue strange to Dany’s ears The first man was done with her now and a second had taken his place

She is a lamb girl Quaro said in Dothraki She is nothing Khaleesi The riders do her honor The Lamb Men lay with sheep it is known

It is known her handmaid Irri echoed

It is known agreed Jhogo astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him If her wailing offends your ears Khaleesi Jhogo will bring you her tongue He drew his arakh

I will not have her harmed Dany said I claim her Do as I command you or Khal Drogo will know the reason why

Ai Khaleesi Jhogo replied kicking his horse Quaro and the others followed his lead the bells in their hair chiming

Go with them she commanded Ser Jorah

As you command The knight gave her a curious look You are your brother’s sister in truth

Viserys She did not understand

No he answered Rhaegar He galloped off

Dany heard Jhogo shout The rapers laughed at him One man shouted back Jhogo’s arakh flashed and the man’s head went tumbling from his shoulders Laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for weapons but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there She saw Aggo point across the road to where she sat upon her silver The riders looked at her with cold black eyes One spat The others scattered to their mounts muttering

All the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of her so intent on his pleasure that he seemed unaware of what was going on around him Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched him off with a mailed hand The Dothraki went sprawling in the mud bounced up with a knife in hand and died with Aggo’s arrow through his throat Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in his blood-spattered cloak He led her across the road to Dany What do you want done with her

The girl was trembling her eyes wide and vague Her hair was matted with blood Doreah see to her hurts You do not have a rider’s look perhaps she will not fear you The rest with me She urged the silver through the broken wooden gate

It was worse inside the town Many of the houses were afire and the jaqqa rhan had been about their grisly work Headless corpses filled the narrow twisty lanes They passed other women being raped Each time Dany reined up sent her khas to make an end to it and claimed the victim as slave One of them a thick-bodied flat-nosed woman of forty years blessed Dany haltingly in the Common Tongue but from the others she got only flat black stares They were suspicious of her she realized with sadness afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate

You cannot claim them all child Ser Jorah said the fourth time they stopped while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her

I am khaleesi heir to the Seven Kingdoms the blood of the dragon Dany reminded him It is not for you to tell me what I cannot do Across the city a building collapsed in a great gout of fire and smoke and she heard distant screams and the wailing of frightened children

They found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and a bulbous dome like some immense brown onion Beside him was a pile of heads taller than he was One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his upper arm and blood covered the left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint His three bloodriders were with him

Jhiqui helped Dany dismount she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier She knelt before the khal My sun-and-stars is wounded The arakh cut was wide but shallow his left nipple was gone and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag

Is scratch moon of life from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue I kill him for it and Ogo too He turned his head the bells in his braid ringing softly Is Ogo you hear and Fogo his khalakka who was khal when I slew him

No man can stand before the sun of my life Dany said the father of the stallion who mounts the world

A mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle He spoke to Haggo a stream of angry Dothraki too fast for Dany to understand The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turned to his khal This one is Mago who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo He says the khaleesi has taken his spoils a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount

Khal Drogo’s face was still and hard but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany Tell me the truth of this moon of my life he commanded in Dothraki

Dany told him what she had done in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better her words simple and direct

When she was done Drogo was frowning This is the way of war These women are our slaves now to do with as we please

It pleases me to hold them safe Dany said wondering if she had dared too much If your warriors would mount these women let them take them gently and keep them for wives Give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons

Qotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders It was he who laughed Does the horse breed with the sheep

Something in his tone reminded her of Viserys Dany turned on him angrily The dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike

Khal Drogo smiled See how fierce she grows he said It is my son inside her the stallion who mounts the world filling her with his fire Ride slowly Qotho… if the mother does not burn you where you sit the son will trample you into the mud And you Mago hold your tongue and find another lamb to mount These belong to my khaleesi He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys but as he lifted his arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head

Dany could almost feel his agony The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led her to believe Where are the healers she demanded The khalasar had two sorts barren women and eunuch slaves The herbwomen dealt in potions and spells the eunuchs in knife needle and fire Why do they not attend the khal

The khal sent the hairless men away Khaleesi old Cohollo assured her Dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself a deep gash in his left shoulder

Many riders are hurt Khal Drogo said stubbornly Let them be healed first This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son

Dany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away A trickle of blood ran from the arrow that pierced his arm It is not for Khal Drogo to wait she proclaimed Jhogo seek out these eunuchs and bring them here at once

Silver Lady a woman’s voice said behind her I can help the Great Rider with his hurts

Dany turned her head The speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed the heavy flat-nosed woman who had blessed her

The khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep barked Qotho Aggo cut out her tongue

Aggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat

Dany lifted a hand No She is mine Let her speak

Aggo looked from her to Qotho He lowered his knife

I meant no wrong fierce riders The woman spoke Dothraki well The robes she wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens rich with embroidery but now they were mud-caked and bloody and ripped She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts I have some small skill in the healing arts

Who are you Dany asked her

I am named Mirri Maz Duur I am godswife of this temple

Maegi grunted Haggo fingering his arakh His look was dark Dany remembered the word from a terrifying story that Jhiqui had told her one night by the cookfire A maegi was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries a vile thing evil and soulless who came to men in the dark of night and sucked life and strength from their bodies

I am a healer Mirri Maz Duur said
