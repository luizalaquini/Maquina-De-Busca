297 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire

298 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness the LORD shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh

299 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth
the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory

2910 The LORD sitteth upon the flood yea the LORD sitteth King for
ever

2911 The LORD will give strength unto his people the LORD will bless
his people with peace



301 I will extol thee O LORD for thou hast lifted me up and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me

302 O LORD my God I cried unto thee and thou hast healed me

303 O LORD thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast
kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit

304 Sing unto the LORD O ye saints of his and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness

305 For his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life
weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning

306 And in my prosperity I said I shall never be moved

307 LORD by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong
thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled

308 I cried to thee O LORD and unto the LORD I made supplication

309 What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit
Shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth

3010 Hear O LORD and have mercy upon me LORD be thou my helper

3011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put
off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness

3012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be
silent

O LORD my God I will give thanks unto thee for ever



311 In thee O LORD do I put my trust let me never be ashamed
deliver me in thy righteousness

312 Bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong
rock for an house of defence to save me

313 For thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy names
sake lead me and guide me

314 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for
thou art my strength

315 Into thine hand I commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me O LORD
God of truth

316 I have hated them that regard lying vanities but I trust in the
LORD

317 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered
my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities

318 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set
my feet in a large room

319 Have mercy upon me O LORD for I am in trouble mine eye is
consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly

3110 For my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my
strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed

3111 I was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my
neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me
without fled from me

3112 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken
vessel

3113 For I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side
while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away
my life

3114 But I trusted in thee O LORD I said Thou art my God

3115 My times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies and from them that persecute me

3116 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy
