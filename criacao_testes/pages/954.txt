She was no whore I never bought her for you That was a lie that Father commanded me to tell Tysha was… she was what she seemed to be A crofter’s daughter chance met on the road

Tyrion could hear the faint sound of his own breath whistling hollowly through the scar of his nose Jaime could not meet his eyes Tysha He tried to remember what she had looked like A girl she was only a girl no older than Sansa My wife he croaked She wed me

For your gold Father said She was lowborn you were a Lannister of Casterly Rock All she wanted was the gold which made her no different from a whore so… so it would not be a lie not truly and… he said that you required a sharp lesson That you would learn from it and thank me later…

Thank you Tyrion’s voice was choked He gave her to his guards A barracks full of guards He made me… watch Aye and more than watch I took her too… my wife…

I never knew he would do that You must believe me

Oh must I Tyrion snarled Why should I believe you about anything ever She was my wife

Tyrion—

He hit him It was a slap backhanded but he put all his strength into it all his fear all his rage all his pain Jaime was squatting unbalanced The blow sent him tumbling backward to the floor I… I suppose I earned that

Oh you’ve earned more than that Jaime You and my sweet sister and our loving father yes I can’t begin to tell you what you’ve earned But you’ll have it that I swear to you A Lannister always pays his debts Tyrion waddled away almost stumbling over the turnkey again in his haste Before he had gone a dozen yards he bumped up against an iron gate that closed the passage Oh gods It was all he could do not to scream

Jaime came up behind him I have the gaoler’s keys

Then use them Tyrion stepped aside

Jaime unlocked the gate pushed it open and stepped through He looked back over his shoulder Are you coming

Not with you Tyrion stepped through Give me the keys and go I will find Varys on my own He cocked his head and stared up at his brother with his mismatched eyes Jaime can you flght left-handed

Rather less well than you Jaime said bitterly

Good Then we will be well matched if we should ever meet again The cripple and the dwarf

Jaime handed him the ring of keys I gave you the truth You owe me the same Did you do it Did you kill him

The question was another knife twisting in his guts Are you sure you want to know asked Tyrion Joffrey would have been a worse king than Aerys ever was He stole his father’s dagger and gave it to a footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark did you know that

I… I thought he might have

Well a son takes after his father Joff would have killed me as well once he came into his power For the crime of being short and ugly of which I am so conspicuously guilty

You have not answered my question

You poor stupid blind crippled fool Must I spell every little thing out for you Very well Cersei is a lying whore she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know And I am the monster they all say I am Yes I killed your vile son He made himself grin It must have been a hideous sight to see there in the torchlit gloom

Jaime turned without a word and walked away

Tyrion watched him go striding on his long strong legs and part of him wanted to call out to tell him that it wasn’t true to beg for his forgiveness But then he thought of Tysha and he held his silence He listened to the receding footsteps until he could hear them no longer then waddled off to look for Varys

The eunuch was lurking in the dark of a twisting turnpike stair garbed in a moth-eaten brown robe with a hood that hid the paleness of his face You were so long I feared that something had gone amiss he said when he saw Tyrion

Oh no Tyrion assured him in poisonous tones What could possibly have gone amiss He twisted his head back to stare up I sent for you during my trial

I could not come The queen had me watched night and day I dared not help you

You’re helping me now
