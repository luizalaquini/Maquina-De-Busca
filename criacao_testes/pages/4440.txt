Stannis Baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle His squires stepped up to attend him Davos watched as his son Devan pulled a long padded glove over the king’s right hand The boy wore a cream-colored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around His Grace’s neck Behind Davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells Under the sea smoke rises in bubbles and flames burn green and blue and black Patchface sang somewhere I know I know oh oh oh

The king plunged into the fire with his teeth clenched holding the leather cloak before him to keep off the flames He went straight to the Mother grasped the sword with his gloved hand and wrenched it free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk Then he was retreating the sword held high jade-green flames swirling around cherry-red steel Guards rushed to beat out the cinders that clung to the king’s clothing

A sword of fire shouted Queen Selyse Ser Axell Florent and the other queen’s men took up the cry A sword of fire It burns It burns A sword of fire

Melisandre lifted her hands above her head Behold A sign was promised and now a sign is seen Behold Lightbringer Azor Ahai has come again All hail the Warrior of Light All hail the Son of Fire

A ragged wave of shouts gave answer just as Stannis’s glove began to smolder Cursing the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against his leg

Lord cast your light upon us Melisandre called out

For the night is dark and full of terrors Selyse and her queen’s men replied Should I speak the words as well Davos wondered Do I owe Stannis that much Is this fiery god truly his own His shortened fingers twitched

Stannis peeled off the glove and let it fall to the ground The gods in the pyre were scarcely recognizable anymore The head fell off the Smith with a puff of ash and embers Melisandre sang in the tongue of Asshai her voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea Stannis untied his singed leather cape and listened in silence Thrust in the ground Lightbringer still glowed ruddy hot but the flames that clung to the sword were dwindling and dying

By the time the song was done only charwood remained of the gods and the king’s patience had run its course He took the queen by the elbow and escorted her back into Dragonstone leaving Lightbringer where it stood The red woman remained a moment to watch as Devan knelt with Byren Farring and rolled up the burnt and blackened sword in the king’s leather cloak The Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess thought Davos

A few of the lords lingered to speak in quiet voices upwind of the fire They fell silent when they saw Davos looking at them Should Stannis fall they will pull me down in an instant Neither was he counted one of the queen’s men that group of ambitious knights and minor lordlings who had given themselves to this Lord of Light and so won the favor and patronage of Lady—no Queen remember—Selyse

The fire had started to dwindle by the time Melisandre and the squires departed with the precious sword Davos and his sons joined the crowd making its way down to the shore and the waiting ships Devan acquitted himself well he said as they went

He fetched the glove without dropping it yes said Dale

Allard nodded That badge on Devan’s doublet the fiery heart what was that The Baratheon sigil is a crowned stag

A lord can choose more than one badge Davos said

Dale smiled A black ship and an onion Father

Allard kicked at a stone The Others take our onion    and that flaming heart It was an ill thing to burn the Seven

When did you grow so devout Davos said What does a smuggler’s son know of the doings of gods

I’m a knight’s son Father If you won’t remember why should they

A knight’s son but not a knight said Davos Nor will you ever be if you meddle in affairs that do not concern you Stannis is our rightful king it is not for us to question him We sail his ships and do his bidding That is all

As to that Father Dale said I mislike these water casks they’ve given me for Wraith Green pine The water will spoil on a voyage of any length

I got the same for Lady Marya said Allard The queen’s men have laid claim to all the seasoned wood

I will speak to the king about it Davos promised Better it come from him than from Allard His sons were good fighters and better sailors but they did not know how to talk to lords They were lowborn even as I was but they do not like to recall that When they look at our banner all they see is a tall black ship flying on the wind They close their eyes to the onion

The port was as crowded as Davos had ever known it Every dock teemed with sailors loading provisions and every inn was packed with soldiers dicing or drinking or looking for a whore    a vain search since Stannis permitted none on his island Ships lined the strand war galleys and fishing vessels stout carracks and fat-bottomed cogs The best berths had been taken by the largest vessels Stannis’s flagship Fury rocking between Lord Steffon and Stag of the Sea Lord Velaryon’s silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark and her three sisters Lord Celtigar’s ornate Red Claw the ponderous Swordfish with her long iron prow Out to sea at anchor rode Salladhor Saan’s great Valyrian amongst the striped hulls of two dozen smaller Lysene galleys

A weathered little inn sat on the end of the stone pier where Black Betha Wraith and Lady Marya shared mooring space with a half-dozen other galleys of one hundred oars or less Davos had a thirst He took his leave of his sons and turned his steps toward the inn Out front squatted a waist-high gargoyle so eroded by rain and salt that his features were all but obliterated He and Davos were old friends though He gave a pat to the stone head as he went in Luck he murmured

Across the noisy common room Salladhor Saan sat eating grapes from a wooden bowl When he spied Davos he beckoned him closer Ser knight come sit with me Eat a grape Eat two They are marvelously sweet The Lyseni was a sleek smiling man whose flamboyance was a byword on both sides of the narrow sea Today he wore flashing cloth-of-silver with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor His buttons were carved jade monkeys and atop his wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers

Davos threaded his way through the tables to a chair In the days before his knighthood he had often bought cargoes from Salladhor Saan The Lyseni was a smuggler himself as well as a trader a banker a notorious pirate and the self-styled Prince of the Narrow Sea When a pirate grows rich enough they make him a prince It had been Davos who had made the journey to Lys to recruit the old rogue to Lord Stannis’s cause

You did not see the gods burn my lord he asked

The red priests have a great temple on Lys Always they are burning this and burning that crying out to their R’hllor They bore me with their fires Soon they will bore King Stannis too it is to be hoped He seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear him eating his grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto his lip flicking them off with a finger My Bird of Thousand Colors came in yesterday good ser She is not a warship no but a trader and she paid a call on King’s Landing Are you sure you will not have a grape Children go hungry in the city it is said He dangled the grapes before Davos and smiled

It’s ale I need and news

The men of Westeros are ever rushing complained Salladhor Saan What good is this I ask you He who hurries through life hurries to his grave He belched The Lord of Casterly Rock has sent his dwarf to see to King’s Landing Perhaps he hopes that his ugly face will frighten off attackers eh Or that we will laugh ourselves dead when the Imp capers on the battlements who can say The dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks and put in his place a knight with an iron hand He plucked a grape and squeezed it between thumb and forefinger until the skin burst Juice ran down between his fingers

A serving girl pushed her way through swatting at the hands that groped her as she passed Davos ordered a tankard of ale turned back to Saan and said How well is the city defended

The other shrugged The walls are high and strong but who will man them They are building scorpions and spitfires oh yes but the men in the golden cloaks are too few and too green and there are no others A swift strike like a hawk plummeting at a hare and the great city will be ours Grant us wind to fill our sails and your king could sit upon his Iron Throne by evenfall on the morrow We could dress the dwarf in motley and prick his little cheeks with the points of our spears to make him dance for us and mayhaps your goodly king would make me a gift of the beautiful Queen Cersei to warm my bed for a night I have been too long away from my wives and all in his service

Pirate said Davos You have no wives only concubines and you have been well paid for every day and every ship

Only in promises said Salladhor Saan mournfully Good ser it is gold I crave not words on papers He popped a grape into his mouth

You’ll have your gold when we take the treasury in King’s Landing No man in the Seven Kingdoms is more honorable than Stannis Baratheon He will keep his word Even as Davos spoke he thought This world is twisted beyond hope when lowborn smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings

So he has said and said And so I say let us do this thing Even these grapes could be no more ripe than that city my old friend

The serving girl returned with his ale Davos gave her a copper Might be we could take King’s Landing as you say he said as he lifted the tankard but how long would we hold it Tywin Lannister is known to be at Harrenhal with a great host and Lord Renly   

Ah yes the young brother said Salladhor Saan That part is not so good my friend King Renly bestirs himself No here he is Lord Renly my pardons So many kings my tongue grows weary of the word The brother Renly has left Highgarden with his fair young queen his flowered lords and shining knights and a mighty host of foot He marches up your road of roses toward the very same great city we were speaking of

He takes his bride

The other shrugged He did not tell me why Perhaps he is loath to part with the warm burrow between her thighs even for a night Or perhaps he is that certain of his victory

The king must be told

I have attended to it good ser Though His Grace frowns so whenever he does see me that I tremble to come before him Do you think he would like me better if I wore a hair shirt and never smiled Well I will not do it I am an honest man he must suffer me in silk and samite Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved That sword was not Lightbringer my friend

The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy Sword

A sword plucked from fire yes Men tell me things it is my pleasant smile How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis

A burning sword corrected Davos

Burnt said Salladhor Saan and be glad of that my friend Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer I shall tell it to you It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world To oppose it the hero must have a hero’s blade oh like none that had ever been And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple forging a blade in the sacred fires Heat and hammer and fold heat and hammer and fold oh yes until the sword was done Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder

Being a hero it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these so again he began The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights and this sword seemed even finer than the first Azor Ahai captured a lion to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast’s red heart but once more the steel shattered and split Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then for he knew what he must do

A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires he summoned his wife ‘Nissa Nissa’ he said to her for that was her name ‘bare your breast and know that I love you best of all that is in this world’ She did this thing why I cannot say and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer the Red Sword of Heroes

Now do you see my meaning Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire Too much light can hurt the eyes my friend and fire burns Salladhor Saan finished the last grape and smacked his lips When do you think the king will bid us sail good ser

Soon I think said Davos if his god wills it
