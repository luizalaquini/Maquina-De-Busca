the border of the children of Ammon was strong

2125 And Israel took all these cities and Israel dwelt in all the
cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof

2126 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites who
had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out
of his hand even unto Arnon

2127 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say Come into Heshbon
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared 2128 For there is a fire
gone out of Heshbon a flame from the city of Sihon it hath consumed
Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places of Arnon

2129 Woe to thee Moab thou art undone O people of Chemosh he hath
given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto
Sihon king of the Amorites

2130 We have shot at them Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon and
we have laid them waste even unto Nophah which reacheth unto Medeba

2131 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites

2132 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer and they took the villages
thereof and drove out the Amorites that were there

2133 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan and Og the
king of Bashan went out against them he and all his people to the
battle at Edrei

2134 And the LORD said unto Moses Fear him not for I have delivered
him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at
Heshbon

2135 So they smote him and his sons and all his people until there
was none left him alive and they possessed his land

221 And the children of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains
of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho

222 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites

223 And Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many
and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel

224 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian Now shall this company
lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field

And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time

225 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his
people to call him saying Behold there is a people come out from
Egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over
against me 226 Come now therefore I pray thee curse me this
people for they are too mighty for me peradventure I shall prevail
that we may smite them and that I may drive them out of the land for
I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest
is cursed

227 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto Balaam and
spake unto him the words of Balak

228 And he said unto them Lodge here this night and I will bring
you word again as the LORD shall speak unto me and the princes of
Moab abode with Balaam

229 And God came unto Balaam and said What men are these with thee
2210 And Balaam said unto God Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab
hath sent unto me saying 2211 Behold there is a people come out of
Egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them
peradventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out

2212 And God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not go with them thou
shalt not curse the people for they are blessed

2213 And Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of
Balak Get you into your land for the LORD refuseth to give me leave
to go with you

2214 And the princes of Moab rose up and they went unto Balak and
said Balaam refuseth to come with us

2215 And Balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than
they

2216 And they came to Balaam and said to him Thus saith Balak the
son of Zippor Let nothing I pray thee hinder thee from coming unto
me 2217 For I will promote thee unto very great honour and I will
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore I pray thee curse
me this people

2218 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak If
Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go
beyond the word of the LORD my God to do less or more
