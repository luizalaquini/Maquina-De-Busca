I would but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river I’ll command the Three Whores though I’m going to see to the traitors myself The prospect made Joff smile His plump pink lips always made him look pouty Sansa had liked that once but now it made her sick

They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest she said recklessly Though he’s older than Your Grace to be sure A man grown

That made him frown I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle I’ll gut him with Hearteater you’ll see He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left the gold cloaks following four abreast The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear The guards saw them off with off with shouts and cheers When the last was gone a sudden stillness settled over the yard like the hush before a storm

Through the quiet the singing pulled at her Sansa turned toward the sept Two stableboys followed and one of the guards whose watch was ended Others fell in behind them

Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded nor so brightly lit great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows and candles burned on every side their little flames twinkling like stars The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s swam in light but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face… for what was Stannis Baratheon if not the Stranger come to judge them Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn lighting a candle at each altar and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight’s son The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus the boy’s small and soft but it was good to have someone to hold on to The air was hot and heavy smelling of incense and sweat crystal-kissed and candle-bright it made her dizzy to breathe it

She knew the hymn her mother had taught it to her once a long time ago in Winterfell She joined her voice to theirs

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

Across the city thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill and they would be singing too their voices swelling out over the city across the river and up into the sky Surely the gods must hear us she thought

Sansa knew most of the hymns and followed along on those she did not know as best she could She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives with serving girls and soldiers cooks and falconers knights and knaves squires and spit boys and nursing mothers She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without sang with all the city She sang for mercy for the living and the dead alike for Bran and Rickon and Robb for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow away off on the Wall She sang for her mother and her father for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully for her friend Jeyne Poole for old drunken King Robert for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today and for the children and the wives who would mourn them and finally toward the end she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound He is no true knight but he saved me all the same she told the Mother Save him if you can and gentle the rage inside him

But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king Sansa got to her feet The aisles were jammed with people She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword and shield the Warrior to give him courage the Father to defend him in his need Let his sword break and his shield shatter Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors let his courage fail him and every man desert him

A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements but otherwise the castle seemed empty Sansa stopped and listened Away off she could hear the sounds of battle The singing almost drowned them out but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear the deep moan of warhorns the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones the splashes and splinterings the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts… and beneath it all the cries of dying men

It was another sort of song a terrible song Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe At the foot of the drawbridge she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge but Lollys clung to her maid sobbing I don’t want to I don’t want to I don’t want to

The battle is begun Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice

I don’t want to I don’t want to

There was no way Sansa could avoid them She greeted them courteously May I be of help

Lady Tanda flushed with shame No my lady but we thank you kindly You must forgive my daughter she has not been well

I don’t want to Lollys clutched at her maid a slender pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat onto those iron spikes Please please I don’t want to

Sansa spoke to her gently We’ll all be thrice protected inside and there’s to be food and drink and song as well

Lollys gaped at her mouth open She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears I don’t want to

You have to her sister Falyse said sharply and that is the end of it Shae help me They each took an elbow and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge Sansa followed with their mother She’s been sick Lady Tanda said If a babe can be termed a sickness Sansa thought It was common gossip that Lollys was with child

The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords Another sat at the foot of the stair—a real guard would have been standing not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside

The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand but it could still seat a hundred and it made up in grace what it lacked in space Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce so the torches burned twice as bright the walls were paneled in richly carved wood and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle A line of arched windows ran along the south wall but they had been closed off with heavy draperies Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike It makes no matter Sansa thought The war is with us

Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables along with a handful of old men and young boys The women were wives daughters mothers and sisters Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis Many would not return The air was heavy with the knowledge As Joffrey’s betrothed Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail and held his sword before him her father’s greatsword Ice near as tall as he was Its point rested on the floor and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip Sansa’s breath caught in her throat Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare He turned his gaunt pox-ravaged face toward her

What is he doing here she asked Osfryd Kettleblack He captained the queen’s new red cloak guard

Osfryd grinned Her Grace expects she’ll have need of him before the night’s done

Ser Ilyn was the King’s Justice There was only one service he might be needed for Whose head does she want

All rise for Her Grace Cersei of House Lannister Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm the royal steward cried

Cersei’s gown was snowy linen white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds The white made her look strangely innocent almost maidenly but there were points of color on her cheeks

Be seated the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais and be welcome Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair a page performed the same service for Sansa You look pale Sansa Cersei observed Is your red flower still blooming

Yes

How apt The men will bleed out there and you in here The queen signaled for the first course to be served

Why is Ser Ilyn here Sansa blurted out

The queen glanced at the mute headsman To deal with treason and to defend us if need be He was a knight before he was a headsman She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred When the axes smash down those doors you may be glad of him

I would be gladder if it were the Hound Sansa thought Harsh as he was she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her Won’t your guards protect us

And who will protect us from my guards The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off They’ll steal what they can and flee along with the serving men washer women and stableboys all out to save their own worthless hides Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked Sansa No you wouldn’t would you All you know of life you learned from singers and there’s such a dearth of good sacking songs

True knights would never harm women and children The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them

True knights The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing No doubt you’re right So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you sweetling I’m sure it won’t be very long now





DAVOS

Blackwater Bay was rough and choppy whitecaps everywhere Black Betha rode the flood tide her sail cracking and snapping at each shift of wind Wraith and Lady Marya sailed beside her no more than twenty yards between their hulls His sons could keep a line Davos took pride in that

Across the sea warhorns boomed deep throaty moans like the calls of monstrous serpents repeated ship to ship Bring down the sail Davos commanded Lower mast Oarsmen to your oars His son Matthos relayed the commands The deck of Black Betha churned as crewmen ran to their tasks pushing through the soldiers who always seemed to be in the way no matter where they stood Ser Imry had decreed that they would enter the river on oars alone so as not to expose their sails to the scorpions and spitfires on the walls of King’s Landing

Davos could make out Fury well to the southeast her sails shimmering golden as they came down the crowned stag of Baratheon blazoned on the canvas From her decks Stannis Baratheon had commanded the assault on Dragonstone sixteen years before but this time he had chosen to ride with his army trusting Fury and the command of his fleet to his wife’s brother Ser Imry who’d come over to his cause at Storm’s End with Lord Alester and all the other Florents
