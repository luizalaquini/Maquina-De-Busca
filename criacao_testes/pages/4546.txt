He made his way back to the Tower of the Hand with a thousand armored feet marching through his skull I ought to have seen this coming the first time I slipped through the back of Chataya’s wardrobe Perhaps he had not wanted to see His legs were aching badly by the time he had made the climb He sent Pod for a flagon of wine and pushed his way into his bedchamber

Shae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of her breasts a chain of linked golden hands each clasping the next

Tyrion had not expected her What are you doing here

Laughing she stroked the chain I wanted some hands on my titties    but these little gold ones are cold

For a moment he did not know what to say How could he tell her that another woman had taken the beating meant for her and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey He wiped Alayaya’s blood from his brow with the heel of his hand The Lady Lollys—

She’s asleep Sleep’s all she ever wants to do the great cow She sleeps and she eats Sometimes she falls asleep while she’s eating The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it and I have to clean her She made a disgusted face All they did was fuck her

Her mother says she’s sick

She has a baby in her belly that’s all

Tyrion gazed around the room Everything seemed much as he left it How did you enter Show me the hidden door

She gave a shrug Lord Varys made me wear a hood I couldn’t see except    there was one place I got a peep at the floor out the bottom of the hood It was all tiles you know the kind that make a picture

A mosaic

Shae nodded They were colored red and black I think the picture was a dragon Otherwise everything was dark We went down a ladder and walked a long ways until I was all twisted around Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate I brushed against it when we went through The dragon was past the gate Then we went up another ladder with a tunnel at the top I had to stoop and I think Lord Varys was crawling

Tyrion made a round of the bedchamber One of the sconces looked loose He stood on his toes and tried to turn it It revolved slowly scraping against the stone wall When it was upside down the stub of the candle fell out The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance Doesn’t m’lord want to bed me asked Shae

In a moment Tyrion threw open his wardrobe shoved the clothing aside and pushed against the rear panel What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well    but no the wood was solid unyielding A stone beside the window seat drew his eye but all his tugging and prodding went for naught He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed

Shae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck Your shoulders feel as hard as rocks she murmured Hurry I want to feel you inside me Yet as her legs locked around his waist his manhood left him When she felt him go soft Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in her mouth but even that could not rouse him

After a few moments he stopped her What’s wrong she asked All the sweet innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face

Innocence Fool she’s a whore Cersei was right you think with your cock fool fool

Just go to sleep sweetling he urged stroking her hair Yet long after Shae had taken his advice Tyrion himself still lay awake his fingers cupped over one small breast as he listened to her breathing





CATELYN

The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper Deep shadows draped the walls One of the torches had guttered out leaving only three Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue Brienne was across from her Between them her father’s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall Even the servants were gone She had given them leave to join the celebration

The walls of the keep were thick yet even so they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure’s imminent return and Robb’s conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale

I cannot blame them Catelyn thought They do not know And if they did why should they care They never knew my sons Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one never heard him laugh never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers She stared at the supper set before her trout wrapped in bacon salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass pease and onions and hot bread Brienne was eating methodically as if supper were another chore to be accomplished I am become a sour woman Catelyn thought I take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings There is an empty place within me where my heart was once

The sound of the other woman’s eating had become intolerable to her Brienne I am no fit company Go join the revels if you would Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund’s harping

I am not made for revels my lady Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were If you command it I   

Catelyn could sense her discomfort I only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine

I’m well content The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout had been fried in

There was another bird this morning Catelyn did not know why she said it The maester woke me at once That was dutiful but not kind Not kind at all She had not meant to tell Brienne No one knew but her and Maester Vyman and she had meant to keep it that way until    until   

Until what Foolish woman will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true If you never tell never speak of it will it become only a dream less than a dream a nightmare half-remembered Oh if only the gods would be so good

Is it news of King’s Landing asked Brienne

Would that it was The bird came from Castle Cerwyn from Ser Rodrik my castellan Dark wings dark words He has gathered what power he could and is marching on Winterfell to take the castle back How unimportant all that sounded now But he said    he wrote    he told me he   

My lady what is it Is it some news of your sons

Such a simple question that was would that the answer could be as simple When Catelyn tried to speak the words caught in her throat I have no sons but Robb She managed those terrible words without a sob and for that much she was glad

Brienne looked at her with horror My lady

Bran and Rickon tried to escape but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water Theon Greyjoy has mounted their heads on the walls of Winterfell Theon Greyjoy who ate at my table since he was a boy of ten I have said it gods forgive me I have said it and made it true

Brienne’s face was a watery blur She reached across the table but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn’s as if the touch might be unwelcome I    there are no words my lady My good lady Your sons they    they’re with the gods now

Are they Catelyn said sharply What god would let this happen Rickon was only a baby How could he deserve such a death And Bran    when I left the north he had not opened his eyes since his fall I had to go before he woke Now I can never return to him or hear him laugh again She showed Brienne her palms her fingers These scars    they sent a man to cut Bran’s throat as he lay sleeping He would have died then and me with him but Bran’s wolf tore out the man’s throat That gave her a moment’s pause I suppose Theon killed the wolves too He must have elsewise    I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with them Like Robb with his Grey Wind But my daughters have no wolves now

The abrupt shift of topic left Brienne bewildered Your daughters   

Sansa was a lady at three always so courteous and eager to please She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor Men would say she had my look but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was you can see that I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself She had auburn hair lighter than mine and so thick and soft    the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper

And Arya well    Ned’s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced Arya was a trial it must be said Half a boy and half a wolf pup Forbid her anything and it became her heart’s desire She had Ned’s long face and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it I despaired of ever making a lady of her She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls and would say anything that came into her head I think she must be dead too When she said that it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest I want them all dead Brienne Theon Greyjoy first then Jaime Lannister and Cersei and the Imp every one every one But my girls    my girls will   

The queen    she has a little girl of her own Brienne said awkwardly And sons too of an age with yours When she hears perhaps she    she may take pity and   

Send my daughters back unharmed Catelyn smiled sadly There is a sweet innocence about you child I could wish    but no Robb will avenge his brothers Ice can kill as dead as fire Ice was Ned’s greatsword Valyrian steel marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings so sharp I feared to touch it Robb’s blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice It will not be easy for him to get Theon’s head off I fear The Starks do not use headsmen Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade though he never took any joy in the duty But I would oh yes She stared at her scarred hands opened and closed them then slowly raised her eyes I’ve sent him wine

Wine Brienne was lost Robb Or    Theon Greyjoy

The Kingslayer The ploy had served her well with Cleos Frey I hope you’re thirsty Jaime I hope your throat is dry and tight I would like you to come with me

I am yours to command my lady

Good Catelyn rose abruptly Stay finish your meal in peace I will send for you later At midnight

So late my lady

The dungeons are windowless One hour is much like another down there and for me all hours are midnight Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall As she climbed to Lord Hoster’s solar she could hear them outside shouting Tully and A cup A cup to the brave young lord My father is not dead she wanted to shout down at them My sons are dead but my father lives damn you all and he is your lord still

Lord Hoster was deep in sleep He had a cup of dreamwine not so long ago my lady Maester Vyman said For the pain He will not know you are here
