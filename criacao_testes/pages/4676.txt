It is every man’s duty to remain loyal to his rightful king even if the lord he serves proves false Stannis declared in a tone that brooked no argument

A desperate folly took hold of Davos a recklessness akin to madness As you remained loyal to King Aerys when your brother raised his banners he blurted

Shocked silence followed until Ser Axell cried Treason and snatched his dagger from its sheath Your Grace he speaks his infamy to your face

Davos could hear Stannis grinding his teeth A vein bulged blue and swollen in the king’s brow Their eyes met Put up your knife Ser Axell And leave us

As it please Your Grace—

It would please me for you to leave said Stannis Take yourself from my presence and send me Melisandre

As you command Ser Axell slid the knife away bowed and hurried toward the door His boots rang against the floor angry

You have always presumed on my forbearance Stannis warned Davos when they were alone I can shorten your tongue as easy as I did your fingers smuggler

I am your man Your Grace So it is your tongue to do with as you please

It is he said calmer And I would have it speak the truth Though the truth is a bitter draught at times Aerys If you only knew    that was a hard choosing My blood or my liege My brother or my king He grimaced Have you ever seen the Iron Throne The barbs along the back the ribbons of twisted steel the jagged ends of swords and knives all tangled up and melted It is not a comfortable seat ser Aerys cut himself so often men took to calling him King Scab and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair By that chair to hear some tell it It is not a seat where a man can rest at ease Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted it so desperately

Why would you want it then Davos asked him

It is not a question of wanting The throne is mine as Robert’s heir That is law After me it must pass to my daughter unless Selyse should finally give me a son He ran three fingers lightly down the table over the layers of smooth hard varnish dark with age I am king Wants do not enter into it I have a duty to my daughter To the realm Even to Robert He loved me but little I know yet he was my brother The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him She may have murdered him as well as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark For such crimes there must be justice Starting with Cersei and her abominations But only starting I mean to scour that court clean As Robert should have done after the Trident Ser Barristan once told me that the rot in King Aerys’s reign began with Varys The eunuch should never have been pardoned No more than the Kingslayer At the least Robert should have stripped the white cloak from Jaime and sent him to the Wall as Lord Stark urged He listened to Jon Arryn instead I was still at Storm’s End under siege and unconsulted He turned abruptly to give Davos a hard shrewd look The truth now Why did you wish to murder Lady Melisandre

So he does know Davos could not lie to him Four of my sons burned on the Blackwater She gave them to the flames

You wrong her Those fires were no work of hers Curse the Imp curse the pyromancers curse that fool of Florent who sailed my fleet into the jaws of a trap Or curse me for my stubborn pride for sending her away when I needed her most But not Melisandre She remains my faithful servant

Maester Cressen was your faithful servant She slew him as she killed Ser Cortnay Penrose and your brother Renly

Now you sound a fool the king complained She saw Renly’s end in the flames yes but she had no more part in it than I did The priestess was with me Your Devan would tell you so Ask him if you doubt me She would have spared Renly if she could It was Melisandre who urged me to meet with him and give him one last chance to amend his treason And it was Melisandre who told me to send for you when Ser Axell wished to give you to R’hllor He smiled thinly Does that surprise you

Yes She knows I am no friend to her or her red god

But you are a friend to me She knows that as well He beckoned Davos closer The boy is sick Maester Pylos has been leeching him

The boy His thoughts went to his Devan the king’s squire My son sire

Devan A good boy He has much of you in him It is Robert’s bastard who is sick the boy we took at Storm’s End

Edric Storm I spoke with him in Aegon’s Garden

As she wished As she saw Stannis sighed Did the boy charm you He has that gift He got it from his father with the blood He knows he is a king’s son but chooses to forget that he is bastard-born And he worships Robert as Renly did when he was young My royal brother played the fond father on his visits to Storm’s End and there were gifts    swords and ponies and fur-trimmed cloaks The eunuch’s work every one The boy would write the Red Keep full of thanks and Robert would laugh and ask Varys what he’d sent this year Renly was no better He left the boy’s upbringing to castellans and maesters and every one fell victim to his charm Penrose chose to die rather than give him up The king ground his teeth together It still angers me How could he think I would hurt the boy I chose Robert did I not When that hard day came I chose blood over honor

He does not use the boy’s name That made Davos very uneasy I hope young Edric will recover soon

Stannis waved a hand dismissing his concern It is a chill no more He coughs he shivers he has a fever Maester Pylos will soon set him right By himself the boy is nought you understand but in his veins flows my brother’s blood There is power in a king’s blood she says

Davos did not have to ask who she was

Stannis touched the Painted Table Look at it onion knight My realm by rights My Westeros He swept a hand across it This talk of Seven Kingdoms is a folly Aegon saw that three hundred years ago when he stood where we are standing They painted this table at his command Rivers and bays they painted hills and mountains castles and cities and market towns lakes and swamps and forests    but no borders It is all one One realm for one king to rule alone

One king agreed Davos One king means peace

I shall bring justice to Westeros A thing Ser Axell understands as little as he does war Claw Isle would gain me naught    and it was evil just as you said Celtigar must pay the traitor’s price himself in his own person And when I come into my kingdom he shall Every man shall reap what he has sown from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers I promise you They have made my kingdom bleed and I do not forget that King Stannis turned from the table On your knees Onion Knight

Your Grace

For your onions and fish I made you a knight once For this I am of a mind to raise you to lord

This Davos was lost I am content to be your knight Your Grace I would not know how to begin being lordly

Good To be lordly is to be false I have learned that lesson hard Now kneel Your king commands

Davos knelt and Stannis drew his longsword Lightbringer Melisandre had named it the red sword of heroes drawn from the fires where the seven gods were consumed The room seemed to grow brighter as the blade slid from its scabbard The steel had a glow to it now orange now yellow now red The air shimmered around it and no jewel had ever sparkled so brilliantly But when Stannis touched it to Davos’s shoulder it felt no different than any other longsword Ser Davos of House Seaworth the king said are you my true and honest liege man now and forever

I am Your Grace

And do you swear to serve me loyally all your days to give me honest counsel and swift obedience to defend my rights and my realm against all foes in battles great and small to protect my people and punish my enemies

I do Your Grace

Then rise again Davos Seaworth and rise as Lord of the Rainwood Admiral of the Narrow Sea and Hand of the King

For a moment Davos was too stunned to move I woke this morning in his dungeon Your Grace you cannot    I am no fit man to be a King’s Hand

There is no man fitter Stannis sheathed Lightbringer gave Davos his hand and pulled him to his feet

I am lowborn Davos reminded him An upjumped smuggler Your lords will never obey me

Then we will make new lords

But    I cannot read    nor write   

Maester Pylos can read for you As to writing my last Hand wrote the head off his shoulders All I ask of you are the things you’ve always given me Honesty Loyalty Service

Surely there is someone better    some great lord   

Stannis snorted Bar Emmon that boy My faithless grandfather Celtigar has abandoned me the new Velaryon is six years old and the new Sunglass sailed for Volantis after I burned his brother He made an angry gesture A few good men remain it’s true Ser Gilbert Farring holds Storm’s End for me still with two hundred loyal men Lord Morrigen the Bastard of Nightsong young Chyttering my cousin Andrew    but I trust none of them as I trust you my lord of Rainwood You will be my Hand It is you I want beside me for the battle

Another battle will be the end of all of us thought Davos Lord Alester saw that much true enough Your Grace asked for honest counsel In honesty then    we lack the strength for another battle against the Lannisters

It is the great battle His Grace is speaking of said a woman’s voice rich with the accents of the east Melisandre stood at the door in her red silks and shimmering satins holding a covered silver dish in her hands These little wars are no more than a scuffle of children before what is to come The one whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power Davos Seaworth a power fell and evil and strong beyond measure Soon comes the cold and the night that never ends She placed the silver dish on the Painted Table Unless true men find the courage to fight it Men whose hearts are fire

Stannis stared at the silver dish She has shown it to me Lord Davos In the flames

You saw it sire It was not like Stannis Baratheon to lie about such a thing

With mine own eyes After the battle when I was lost to despair the Lady Melisandre bid me gaze into the hearthfire The chimney was drawing strongly and bits of ash were rising from the fire I stared at them feeling half a fool but she bid me look deeper and    the ashes were white rising in the updraft yet all at once it seemed as if they were falling Snow I thought Then the sparks in the air seemed to circle to become a ring of torches and I was looking through the fire down on some high hill in a forest The cinders had become men in black behind the torches and there were shapes moving through the snow For all the heat of the fire I felt a cold so terrible I shivered and when I did the sight was gone the fire but a fire once again But what I saw was real I’d stake my kingdom on it
