Is it her friendship you require or her swords

Both

Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard Lysa has woes of her own Clansmen raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon in greater numbers than ever before… and better armed

Distressing said Tyrion Lannister who had armed them I could help her with that A word from me…

And what would this word cost her

I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king to swear fealty and to—

—make war on the Starks and Tullys Littlefinger shook his head There’s the roach in your pudding Lannister Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun

Nor would I ask it We have no lack of enemies I’ll use her power to oppose Lord Renly or Lord Stannis should he stir from Dragonstone In return I will give her justice for Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East as his father was before him I want to see him fly a boy’s voice whispered faintly in memory And to seal the bargain I will give her my niece

He had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish’s grey-green eyes Myrcella

When she comes of age she can wed little Lord Robert Until such time she’ll be Lady Lysa’s ward at the Eyrie

And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy When Tyrion shrugged Littlefinger burst into laughter I thought not You’re a dangerous little man Lannister Yes I could sing this song to Lysa Again the sly smile the mischief in his glance If I cared to

Tyrion nodded waiting knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence

So Lord Petyr continued after a pause utterly unabashed what’s in your pot for me

Harrenhal

It was interesting to watch his face Lord Petyr’s father had been the smallest of small lords his grandfather a landless hedge knight by birth he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms its lands broad and rich and fertile its great castle as formidable as any in the realm… and so large as to dwarf Riverrun where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to Lord Hoster’s daughter

Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat’s eyes I have him he knew Harrenhal is cursed Lord Petyr said after a moment trying to sound bored

Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself You’ll have no lack of coin I mean to make you liege lord of the Trident These river lords have proven they cannot be trusted Let them do you fealty for their lands

Even the Tullys

If there are any Tullys left when we are done

Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb He was trying to watch for bees but the honey was so sweet Harrenhal and all its lands and incomes he mused With a stroke you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm Not that I’m ungrateful my lord but—why

You served my sister well in the matter of the succession

As did Janos Slynt On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed—only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use

Tyrion laughed You have me my lord What can I say I need you to deliver the Lady Lysa I did not need Janos Slynt He gave a crooked shrug I’d sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne What could be plainer

What indeed You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage

I have little doubt you’ll be equal to the task

I once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into Tyrion’s mismatched eyes Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown

That will do nicely
