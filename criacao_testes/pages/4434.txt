If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe we should pay it willingly Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in his cell If he should die while he’s your prisoner men will say—

—that he well deserved it Robb finished

And your sisters Catelyn asked sharply Will they deserve their deaths as well I promise you if any harm comes to her brother Cersei will pay us back blood for blood—

Lannister won’t die Robb said No one so much as speaks to him without my warrant He has food water clean straw more comfort than he has any right to But I won’t free him not even for Arya and Sansa

Her son was looking down at her Catelyn realized Was it war that made him grow so fast she wondered or the crown they had put on his head Are you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field again is that the truth of it

Grey Wind growled as if he sensed Robb’s anger and Edmure Tully put a brotherly hand on Catelyn’s shoulder Cat don’t The boy has the right of this

Don’t call me the boy Robb said rounding on his uncle his anger spilling out all at once on poor Edmure who had only meant to support him I’m almost a man grown and a king—your king ser And I don’t fear Jaime Lannister I defeated him once I’ll defeat him again if I must only    He pushed a fall of hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head I might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for Father but   

   but not for the girls Her voice was icy quiet Girls are not important enough are they

Robb made no answer but there was hurt in his eyes Blue eyes Tully eyes eyes she had given him She had wounded him but he was too much his father’s son to admit it

That was unworthy of me she told herself Gods be good what is to become of me He is doing his best trying so hard I know it I see it and yet    I have lost my Ned the rock my life was built on I could not bear to lose the girls as well   

I’ll do all I can for my sisters Robb said If the queen has any sense she’ll accept my terms If not I’ll make her rue the day she refused me Plainly he’d had enough of the subject Mother are you certain you will not consent to go to the Twins You would be farther from the fighting and you could acquaint yourself with Lord Frey’s daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done

He wants me gone Catelyn thought wearily Kings are not supposed to have mothers it would seem and I tell him things he does not want to hear You’re old enough to decide which of Lord Walder’s girls you prefer without your mother’s help Robb

Then go with Theon He leaves on the morrow He’ll help the Mallisters escort that lot of captives to Seagard and then take ship for the Iron Islands You could find a ship as well and be back at Winterfell with a moon’s turn if the winds are kind Bran and Rickon need you

And you do not is that what you mean to say My lord father has little enough time remaining him So long as your grandfather lives my place is at Riverrun with him

I could command you to go As king I could

Catelyn ignored that I’ll say again I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke and kept Theon close to you

Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son

Jason Mallister offered Catelyn Tytos Blackwood Stevron Frey Anyone    but not Theon

Her son squatted beside Grey Wind ruffling the wolf’s fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes Theon’s fought bravely for us I told you how he saved Bran from those wildlings in the wolfswood If the Lannisters won’t make peace I’ll have need of Lord Greyjoy’s longships

You’ll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage

He’s been a hostage half his life

For good reason Catelyn said Balon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted He wore a crown himself remember if only for a season He may aspire to wear one again

Robb stood I will not grudge him that If I’m King in the North let him be King of the Iron Islands if that’s his desire I’ll give him a crown gladly so long as he helps us bring down the Lannisters

Robb—

I’m sending Theon Good day Mother Grey Wind come Robb walked off briskly the direwolf padding beside him

Catelyn could only watch him go Her son and now her king How queer that felt Command she had told him back in Moat Cailin And so he did I am going to visit Father she announced abruptly Come with me Edmure

I need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training I’ll visit him later

If he still lives Catelyn thought but she said nothing Her brother would sooner face battle than that sickroom

The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood A wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past Autumn had come the Conclave had declared but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet For that Catelyn was duly grateful Autumn was always a fearful time with the specter of winter looming ahead Even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last

Hoster Tully Lord of Riverrun lay abed in his solar with its commanding view to the east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle He was sleeping when Catelyn entered his hair and beard as white as his featherbed his once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him

Beside the bed still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak sat her father’s brother the Blackfish His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud Does Robb know you are returned Uncle Ser Brynden Tully was Robb’s eyes and ears the commander of his scouts and outriders

No I came here straight from the stables when they told me the king was holding court His Grace will want to hear my tidings in private first I’d think The Blackfish was a tall lean man grey of hair and precise in his movements his clean-shaven face lined and windburnt How is he he asked and she knew he did not mean Robb

Much the same The maester gives him dreamwine and milk of the poppy for his pain so he sleeps most of the time and eats too little He seems weaker with each day that passes

Does he speak

Yes    but there is less and less sense to the things he says He talks of his regrets of unfinished tasks of people long dead and times long past Sometimes he does not know what season it is or who I am Once he called me by Mother’s name

He misses her still Ser Brynden answered You have her face I can see it in your cheekbones and your jaw   

You remember more of her than I do It has been a long time She seated herself on the bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her father’s face

Each time I ride out I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return Despite their quarrels there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once disowned

At least you made your peace with him

They sat for a time in silence until Catelyn raised her head You spoke of tidings that Robb needed to hear Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto his side almost as if he had heard

Brynden stood Come outside Best if we do not wake him

She followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted three-sided from the solar like the prow of a ship Her uncle glanced up frowning You can see it by day now My men call it the Red Messenger    but what is the message

Catelyn raised her eyes to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned Edmure thinks it’s an omen of victory for Riverrun—he sees a fish with a long tail in the Tully colors red against blue She sighed I wish I had their faith Crimson is a Lannister color

That thing’s not crimson Ser Brynden said Nor Tully red the mud red of the river That’s blood up there child smeared across the sky

Our blood or theirs

Was there ever a war where only one side bled Her uncle gave a shake of the head The riverlands are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye The fighting has spread south to the Blackwater and north across the Trident almost to the Twins Marq Piper and Karyl Vance have won some small victories and this southron lordling Beric Dondarrion has been raiding the raiders falling upon Lord Tywin’s foraging parties and vanishing back into the woods It’s said that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting that he’d slain Dondarrion until he led his column into one of Lord Beric’s traps and got every man of them killed

Some of Ned’s guard from King’s Landing are with this Lord Beric Catelyn recalled May the gods preserve them

Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves if the tales be true her uncle said but your father’s bannermen make a sadder tale Robb should never have let them go They’ve scattered like quail each man trying to protect his own and it’s folly Cat folly Jonos Bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of his castle and his nephew Hendry slain Tytos Blackwood’s swept the Lannisters off his lands but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left him nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert Darry men recaptured their lord’s keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole garrison to the sword even their lord

Catelyn was horrorstruck Darry was only a child

Aye and the last of his line as well The boy would have brought a fine ransom but what does gold mean to a frothing dog like Gregor Clegane That beast’s head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm I vow
