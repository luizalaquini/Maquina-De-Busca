failed thereof

2315 Therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are
come upon you which the LORD your God promised you so shall the LORD
bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off
this good land which the LORD your God hath given you

2316 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God
which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed
yourselves to them then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled
against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which
he hath given unto you

241 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and
called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their
judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before
God

242 And Joshua said unto all the people Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time
even Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nachor and they
served other gods

243 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood
and led him throughout all the land of Canaan and multiplied his
seed and gave him Isaac

244 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Esau mount
Seir to possess it but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt

245 I sent Moses also and Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to
that which I did among them and afterward I brought you out

246 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt and ye came unto the
sea and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the Red sea

247 And when they cried unto the LORD he put darkness between you
and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them
and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season

248 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites which dwelt on
the other side Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into
your hand that ye might possess their land and I destroyed them from
before you

249 Then Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab arose and warred
against Israel and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse
you 2410 But I would not hearken unto Balaam therefore he blessed
you still so I delivered you out of his hand

2411 And you went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of
Jericho fought against you the Amorites and the Perizzites and the
Canaanites and the Hittites and the Girgashites the Hivites and
the Jebusites and I delivered them into your hand

2412 And I sent the hornet before you which drave them out from
before you even the two kings of the Amorites but not with thy
sword nor with thy bow

2413 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour and
cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat

2414 Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in
truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other
side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the LORD

2415 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD choose you this
day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served
that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites
in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the
LORD

2416 And the people answered and said God forbid that we should
forsake the LORD to serve other gods 2417 For the LORD our God he
it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt
from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our
sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all
the people through whom we passed 2418 And the LORD drave out from
before us all the people even the Amorites which dwelt in the land
therefore will we also serve the LORD for he is our God

2419 And Joshua said unto the people Ye cannot serve the LORD for
he is an holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins

2420 If ye forsake the LORD and serve strange gods then he will
turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you
good

2421 And the people said unto Joshua Nay but we will serve the
LORD

2422 And Joshua said unto the people Ye are witnesses against
yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD to serve him And they
said We are witnesses

2423 Now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are
