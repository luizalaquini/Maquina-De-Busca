Tyrion could hear the faint sound of his own breath whistling hollowly through the scar of his nose Jaime could not meet his eyes Tysha He tried to remember what she had looked like A girl she was only a girl no older than Sansa My wife he croaked She wed me

For your gold Father said She was lowborn you were a Lannister of Casterly Rock All she wanted was the gold which made her no different from a whore so… so it would not be a lie not truly and… he said that you required a sharp lesson That you would learn from it and thank me later…

Thank you Tyrion’s voice was choked He gave her to his guards A barracks full of guards He made me… watch Aye and more than watch I took her too… my wife…

I never knew he would do that You must believe me

Oh must I Tyrion snarled Why should I believe you about anything ever She was my wife

Tyrion—

He hit him It was a slap backhanded but he put all his strength into it all his fear all his rage all his pain Jaime was squatting unbalanced The blow sent him tumbling backward to the floor I… I suppose I earned that

Oh you’ve earned more than that Jaime You and my sweet sister and our loving father yes I can’t begin to tell you what you’ve earned But you’ll have it that I swear to you A Lannister always pays his debts Tyrion waddled away almost stumbling over the turnkey again in his haste Before he had gone a dozen yards he bumped up against an iron gate that closed the passage Oh gods It was all he could do not to scream

Jaime came up behind him I have the gaoler’s keys

Then use them Tyrion stepped aside

Jaime unlocked the gate pushed it open and stepped through He looked back over his shoulder Are you coming

Not with you Tyrion stepped through Give me the keys and go I will find Varys on my own He cocked his head and stared up at his brother with his mismatched eyes Jaime can you flght left-handed

Rather less well than you Jaime said bitterly

Good Then we will be well matched if we should ever meet again The cripple and the dwarf

Jaime handed him the ring of keys I gave you the truth You owe me the same Did you do it Did you kill him

The question was another knife twisting in his guts Are you sure you want to know asked Tyrion Joffrey would have been a worse king than Aerys ever was He stole his father’s dagger and gave it to a footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark did you know that

I… I thought he might have

Well a son takes after his father Joff would have killed me as well once he came into his power For the crime of being short and ugly of which I am so conspicuously guilty

You have not answered my question

You poor stupid blind crippled fool Must I spell every little thing out for you Very well Cersei is a lying whore she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know And I am the monster they all say I am Yes I killed your vile son He made himself grin It must have been a hideous sight to see there in the torchlit gloom

Jaime turned without a word and walked away

Tyrion watched him go striding on his long strong legs and part of him wanted to call out to tell him that it wasn’t true to beg for his forgiveness But then he thought of Tysha and he held his silence He listened to the receding footsteps until he could hear them no longer then waddled off to look for Varys

The eunuch was lurking in the dark of a twisting turnpike stair garbed in a moth-eaten brown robe with a hood that hid the paleness of his face You were so long I feared that something had gone amiss he said when he saw Tyrion

Oh no Tyrion assured him in poisonous tones What could possibly have gone amiss He twisted his head back to stare up I sent for you during my trial

I could not come The queen had me watched night and day I dared not help you

You’re helping me now

Am I Ah Varys giggled It seemed strangely out of place in this place of cold stone and echoing darkness Your brother can be most persuasive

Varys you are as cold and slimy as a slug has anyone ever told you You did your best to kill me Perhaps I ought to return the favor

The eunuch sighed The faithful dog is kicked and no matter how the spider weaves he is never loved But if you slay me here I fear for you my lord You may never find your way back to daylight His eyes glittered in the shifting torchlight dark and wet These tunnels are full of traps for the unwary

Tyrion snorted Unwary I’m the wariest man who ever lived you helped see to that He rubbed at his nose So tell me wizard where is my innocent maiden wife

I have found no trace of Lady Sansa in King’s Landing sad to say Nor of Ser Dontos Hollard who by rights should have turned up somewhere drunk by now They were seen together on the serpentine steps the night she vanished After that nothing There was much confusion that night My little birds are silent Varys gave a gentle tug at the dwarf’s sleeve and pulled him into the stair My lord we must away Your path is down

That’s no lie at least Tyrion waddled along in the eunuch’s wake his heels scraping against the rough stone as they descended It was very cold within the stairwell a damp bone-chilling cold that set him to shivering at once What part of the dungeons are these he asked

Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle Varys replied On the upper level there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together They have narrow windows set high in the walls The second level has the smaller cells where highborn captives are held They have no windows but torches in the halls cast light through the bars On the third level the cells are smaller and the doors are wood The black cells men call them That was where you were kept and Eddard Stark before you But there is a level lower still Once a man is taken down to the fourth level he never sees the sun again nor hears a human voice nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain Maegor had the cells on the fourth level built for torment They had reached the bottom of the steps An unlighted door opened before them This is the fourth level Give me your hand my lord It is safer to walk in darkness here There are things you would not wish to see

Tyrion hung back a moment Varys had already betrayed him once Who knew what game the eunuch was playing And what better place to murder a man than down in the darkness in a place that no one knew existed His body might never be found

On the other hand what choice did he have To go back up the steps and walk out the main gate No that would not serve

Jaime would not be afraid he thought before he remembered what Jaime had done to him He took the eunuch by the hand and let himself be led through the black following the soft scrape of leather on stone Varys walked quickly from time to time whispering Careful there are three steps ahead or The tunnel slopes downward here my lord I arrived here a King’s Hand riding through the gates at the head of my own sworn men Tyrion reflected and I leave like a rat scuttling through the dark holding hands with a spider

A light appeared ahead of them too dim to be daylight and grew as they hurried toward it After a while he could see it was an arched doorway closed off by another iron gate Varys produced a key They stepped through into a small round chamber Five other doors opened off the room each barred in iron There was an opening in the ceiling as well and a series of rungs set in the wall below leading upward An ornate brazier stood to one side fashioned in the shape of a dragon’s head The coals in the beast’s yawning mouth had burnt down to embers but they still glowed with a sullen orange light Dim as it was the light was welcome after the blackness of the tunnel

The juncture was otherwise empty but on the floor was a mosaic of a three-headed dragon wrought in red and black tiles Something niggled at Tyrion for a moment Then it came to him This is the place Shae told me of when Varys first led her to my bed We are below the Tower of the Hand

Yes Frozen hinges screamed in protest as Varys pulled open a long-closed door Flakes of rust drifted to the floor This will take us out to the river

Tyrion walked slowly to the ladder ran his hand across the lowest rung This will take me up to my bedchamber

Your lord father’s bedchamber now

He looked up the shaft How far must I climb

My lord you are too weak for such follies and there is besides no time We must go

I have business above How far

Two hundred and thirty rungs but whatever you intend—

Two hundred and thirty rungs and then

The tunnel to the left but hear me—

How far along to the bedchamber Tyrion lifted a foot to the lowest rung of the ladder

No more than sixty feet Keep one hand on the wall as you go You will feel the doors The bedchamber is the third He sighed This is folly my lord Your brother has given you your life back Would you cast it away and mine with it

Varys the only thing I value less than my life just now is yours Wait for me here He turned his back on the eunuch and began to climb counting silently as he went
