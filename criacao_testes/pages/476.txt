Her steps took her to the sept a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst her mother’s gardens and filled with rainbow light It was crowded when they entered Catelyn was not alone in her need for prayer She knelt before the painted marble image of the Warrior and lit a scented candle for Edmure and another for Robb off beyond the hills Keep them safe and help them to victory she prayed and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those they leave behind

The septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at her prayers so Catelyn lingered for the celebration She did not know this septon an earnest young man close to Edmure’s age He performed his office well enough and his voice was rich and pleasant when he sang the praises to the Seven but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd long dead Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what she had seen and felt in Renly’s pavilion and he might have known what it meant as well and what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams Osmynd my father Uncle Brynden old Maester Kym they always seemed to know everything but now there is only me and it seems I know nothing not even my duty How can I do my duty if I do not know where it lies

Catelyn’s knees were stiff by the time she rose though she felt no wiser Perhaps she would go to the godswood tonight and pray to Ned’s gods as well They were older than the Seven

Outside she found song of a very different sort Rymund the Rhymer sat by the brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners his deep voice ringing as he sang of Lord Deremond at the Bloody Meadow

And there he stood with sword in hand

the last of Darry’s ten…

Brienne paused to listen for a moment broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against her chest A mob of ragged boys raced by screeching and flailing at each other with sticks Why do boys so love to play at war Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer The singer’s voice swelled as he neared the end of his song

And red the grass beneath his feet

and red his banners bright

and red the glow of setting sun

that bathed him in its light

Come on come on the great lord called

my sword is hungry still

And with a cry of savage rage

They swarmed across the rill…

Fighting is better than this waiting Brienne said You don’t feel so helpless when you fight You have a sword and a horse sometimes an axe When you’re armored it’s hard for anyone to hurt you

Knights die in battle Catelyn reminded her

Brienne looked at her with those blue and beautiful eyes As ladies die in childbed No one sings songs about them

Children are a battle of a different sort Catelyn started across the yard A battle without banners or warhorns but no less fierce Carrying a child bringing it into the world… your mother will have told you of the pain…

I never knew my mother Brienne said My father had ladies… a different lady every year but…

Those were no ladies Catelyn said As hard as birth can be Brienne what comes after is even harder At times I feel as though I am being torn apart Would that there were five of me one for each child so I might keep them all safe

And who would keep you safe my lady

Her smile was wan and tired Why the men of my House Or so my lady mother taught me My lord father my brother my uncle my husband they will keep me safe… but while they are away from me I suppose you must fill their place Brienne

Brienne bowed her head I shall try my lady

Later that day Maester Vyman brought a letter She saw him at once hoping for some word from Robb or from Ser Rodrik in Winterfell but the message proved to be from one Lord Meadows who named himself castellan of Storm’s End It was addressed to her father her brother her son or whoever now holds Riverrun Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead the man wrote and Storm’s End had opened its gate to Stannis Baratheon the trueborn and rightful heir The castle garrison had sworn their swords to his cause one and all and no man of them had suffered harm

Save Cortnay Penrose Catelyn murmured She had never met the man yet she grieved to hear of his passing Robb should know of this at once she said Do we know where he is

At last word he was marching toward the Crag the seat of House Westerling said Maester Vyman If I dispatched a raven to Ashemark it may be that they could send a rider after him
