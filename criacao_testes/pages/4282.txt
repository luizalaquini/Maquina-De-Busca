 em although segmental aspects play a part here too for the vowel
qualities differ in each pair of words
Nevertheless if you make a mistake when assigning stress to words
like these in conversation you are very likely to be queried as
to what you actually said

Intonation has a big effect on meaning too
Pitch often em but by no means always em rises on a question
the extent and abruptness of the rise depending on features like whether
a genuine information-bearing reply or merely confirmation is expected
A distinctive pitch pattern accompanies the introduction of a new topic
In conjunction with rhythm intonation can be used to bring out contrasts
as in
LB
NI
He didnt have a
ul
red
car he had a
ul
black
one
LE
In general the intonation patterns used by a reader depend not only on
the text itself but on his interpretation of it and also on his
expectation of the listeners interpretation of it
For example
LB
NI
He had a
ul
red
car I think you thought it was black
NI
He had a red
ul
bic
cycle I think you thought it was a car
LE

In natural speech prosodic features are significantly influenced by
whether the utterance is generated spontaneously or read aloud
The variations in spontaneous speech are enormous
There are all sorts of emotions which are plainly audible in
everyday speech  sarcasm excitement rudeness disagreement
sadness fright love
Variations in voice quality certainly play a part here
Even with ordinary cooperative friendly conversation the need to find
words and somehow fit them into an overall utterance produces great
diversity of prosodic structures
Applications for speech output from computers do not however call for
spontaneous conversation but for a controlled delivery which is
like that when reading aloud
Here the speaker is articulating utterances which have been set out for
him reducing his cognitive load to one of understanding and interpreting
the text rather than generating it
Unfortunately for us linguists are quite rightly
primarily interested in living
spontaneous speech rather than pre-prepared readings
pp
Nevertheless the richness of prosody in speech even when reading from
a book should not be underestimated
Read aloud to an audience and listen to the contrasts in voice dynamics
deliberately introduced for varietys sake
If stories are to be read there is even a case for controlling voice

quality
to cope with quotations and affective imitations

We saw earlier that the source-filter model is particularly
helpful in distinguishing prosodic features which are largely
properties of the source from segmental ones which belong to
the filter
Pitch and amplitude are primarily source properties
Rhythm and speed of speaking are not but neither are they filter
properties for they belong to the source-filter system as a whole
and not specifically to either part of it
The difficult notion of stress is from an acoustic point of view
a combination of pitch rhythm and amplitude
Even some features of voice quality can be attributed to the source
like laryngitis although others em cleft palate badly-fitting
dentures em affect segmental features as well
