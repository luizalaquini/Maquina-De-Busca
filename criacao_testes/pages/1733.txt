some womans -- hand had travelled softly over the
paper bearing his name  her unrevealed eyes had
watched every curve as she formed it  her brain had
seen him in imagination the while Why should
she have imagined him  Her mouth -- were the lips
red or pale plump or creased -- had curved itself to a
certain expression as the pen went on -- the corners had
moved with all their natural tremulousness  what had
been the expression 
The vision of the woman writing as a supplement to
the words written had no individuality She was a
misty shape and well she might be considering that
her original was at that moment sound asleep and
oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky
Whenever Boldwood dozed she took a form and com+
paratively ceased to be a vision  when he awoke there
was the letter justifying the dream
The moon shone to-night and its light was not of
a customary kind His window admitted only a
reflection of its rays and the pale sheen had that
reversed direction which snow gives coming upward
and lighting up his ceiling in an unnatural way casting
shadows in strange places and putting lights where
shadows had used to be
The substance of the epistle had occupied him but
little in comparison with the fact of its arrival He
suddenly wondered if anything more might be found in
the envelope than what he had withdrawn He jumped
out of bed in the weird light took the letter pulled out
the flimsy sheet shook the envelope -- searched it
Nothing more was there Boldwood looked as he

had a hundred times the preceding day at the insistent red
seal   Marry me he said aloud
The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the
letter and stuck it in the frame of the glass In doing
so he caught sight of his reflected features wan in
expression and insubstantial in form He saw how
closely compressed was his mouth and that his eyes
were wide-spread and vacant Feeling uneasy and dis+
satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability he
returned to bed
Then the dawn drew on The full power of the
clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at
noon when Boldwood arose and dressed himself He
descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of
a field to the east leaning over which he paused and
looked around
It was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of
the year and the sky pure violet in the zenith was
leaden to the northward and murky to the east where
over the snowy down or ewe-lease on Weatherbury
Upper Farm and apparently resting upon the ridge the
only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless like a red
and flameless fire shining over a white hearthstone
The whole effect resembled a sunset as childhood
resembles age
In other directions the fields and sky were so much
of one colour by the snow that it was difficult in a
hasty glance to tell whereabouts the horizon occurred 
and in general there was here too that before-mentioned
preternatural inversion of light and shade which attends
the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in
the sky is found on the earth and the shades of earth
are in the sky Over the west hung the wasting moon
now dull and greenish-yellow like tarnished brass
Boldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had
hardened and glazed the surface of the snow till it
shone in the red eastern light wit-h the polish of marble
how in some portions of the slope withered grass-bents
encased in icicles bristled through the smooth wan
coverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old
Venetian glass and how the footprints of a few birds
which had hopped over the snow whilst it lay in the
state of a soft fleece were now frozen to a short perma+

nency A half-muffled noise of light wheels interrupted
him Boldwood turned back into the road It was
the mail-cart -- a crazy two-wheeled vehicle hardly
heavy enough to resist a puff of wind The driver held
out a letter Boldwood seized it and opened it ex+
pecting another anonymous one -- so greatly are peoples
ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent will
repeat itself
I dont think it is for you sir said the man when
he saw Boldwoods action Though there is no name
I think it is for your shepherd
Boldwood looked then at the address --
To the New Shepherd
Weatherbury Farm
Near Casterbridge
Oh -- what a mistake  -- it is not mine Nor is it
for my shepherd It is for Miss Everdenes You had
better take it on to him -- Gabriel Oak -- and say I opencd
it in mistake
At this moment on the ridge up against the blazing
sky a figure was visible like the black snuff in the
midst of a candle-flame Then it moved and began to
bustle about vigorously from place to place carrying
square skeleton masses which were riddled by the same
