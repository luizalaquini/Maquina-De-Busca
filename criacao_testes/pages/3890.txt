By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine and said When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne so long ago he left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear This Tyrell moved with his tail from keep to keep chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent He would arrive in force take a castle for his own stay a moon’s turn and ride on to the next castle It was his custom to turn the lords out of their own chambers and take their beds for himself One night he found himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy A sash hung down near the pillows should he wish to summon a wench He had a taste for Dornish women this Lord Tyrell and who can blame him So he pulled upon the sash and when he did the canopy above him split open and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon his head His death lit a fire that soon swept across Dorne undoing all the Young Dragon’s victories in a fortnight The kneeling men stood up and we were free again

I know the tale said Tyrion What of it

Just this If I should ever find a sash beside my own bed and pull on it I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty

Tyrion grinned We have that much in common then

To be sure I have much to thank your sister for If not for her accusation at the feast it might well be you judging me instead of me judging you The prince’s eyes were dark with amusement Who knows more of poison than the Red Viper of Dorne after all Who has better reason to want to keep the Tyrells far from the crown And with Joffrey in his grave by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his sister Myrcella who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew thanks to you

Dornish law does not apply Tyrion had been so ensnared in his own troubles that he’d never stopped to consider the succession My father will crown Tommen count on that

He may indeed crown Tommen here in King’s Landing Which is not to say that my brother may not crown Myrcella down in Sunspear Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your nephew Will your sister He gave a shrug Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all on the condition that she support her daughter over her son Do you think she would

Never Tyrion wanted to say but the word caught in his throat Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of her sex If Dornish law applied in the west she would be the heir to Casterly Rock in her own right She and Jaime were twins but Cersei had come first into the world and that was all it took By championing Myrcella’s cause she would be championing her own I do not know how my sister would choose between Tommen and Myrcella he admitted It makes no matter My father will never give her that choice

Your father said Prince Oberyn may not live forever

Something about the way he said it made the hairs on the back of Tyrion’s neck bristle Suddenly he was mindful of Elia again and all that Oberyn had said as they crossed the field of ashes He wants the head that spoke the words not just the hand that swung the sword It is not wise to speak such treasons in the Red Keep my prince The little birds are listening

Let them Is it treason to say a man is mortal Valar morghulis was how they said it in Valyria of old All men must die And the Doom came and proved it true The Dornishman went to the window to gaze out into the night It is being said that you have no witnesses for us

I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be enough to persuade you all of my innocence

You are mistaken my lord The Fat Flower of Highgarden is quite convinced of your guilt and determined to see you die His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too as he has reminded us half a hundred times

And you said Tyrion

Men are seldom as they appear You look so very guilty that I am convinced of your innocence Still you will likely be condemned Justice is in short supply this side of the mountains There has been none for Elia Aegon or Rhaenys Why should there be any for you Perhaps Joffrey’s real killer was eaten by a bear That seems to happen quite often in King’s Landing Oh wait the bear was at Harrenhal now I remember

Is that the game we are playing Tyrion rubbed at his scarred nose He had nothing to lose by telling Oberyn the truth There was a bear at Harrenhal and it did kill Ser Amory Lorch

How sad for him said the Red Viper And for you Do all noseless men lie so badly I wonder

I am not lying Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her father’s bed and stabbed her to death He had some men-at-arms with him but I do not know their names He leaned forward It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon’s head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his hands

What is this now Truth from a Lannister Oberyn smiled coldly Your father gave the commands yes

No He spoke the lie without hesitation and never stopped to ask himself why he should

The Dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow Such a dutiful son And such a very feeble lie It was Lord Tywin who presented my sister’s children to King Robert all wrapped up in crimson Lannister cloaks

Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father He was there I was at the Rock and still so young that I thought the thing between my legs was only good for pissing

Yes but you are here now and in some difficulty I would say Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face but it will not save you No more than your father will The Dornish prince smiled But I might

You Tyrion studied him You are one judge in three How could you save me

Not as your judge As your champion





Jaime


A white book sat on a white table in a white room

The room was round its walls of whitewashed stone hung with white woolen tapestries It formed the first floor of White Sword Tower a slender structure of four stories built into an angle of the castle wall overlooking the bay The undercroft held arms and armor the second and third floors the small spare sleeping cells of the six brothers of the Kingsguard

One of those cells had been his for eighteen years but this morning he had moved his things to the topmost floor which was given over entirely to the Lord Commander’s apartments Those rooms were spare as well though spacious and they were above the outer walls which meant he would have a view of the sea I will like that he thought The view and all the rest

As pale as the room Jaime sat by the book in his Kingsguard whites waiting for his Sworn Brothers A longsword hung from his hip From the wrong hip Before he had always wom his sword on his left and drawn it across his body when he unsheathed He had shifted it to his right hip this morning so as to be able to draw it with his left hand in the same manner but the weight of it felt strange there and when he had tried to pull the blade from the scabbard the whole motion seemed clumsy and unnatural His clothing fit badly as well He had donned the winter raiment of the Kingsguard a tunic and breeches of bleached white wool and a heavy white cloak but it all seemed to hang loose on him

Jaime had spent his days at his brother’s trial standing well to the back of the hall Either Tyrion never saw him there or he did not know him but that was no surprise Half the court no longer seemed to know him I am a stranger in my own House His son was dead his father had disowned him and his sister… she had not allowed him to be alone with her once after that first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles Even when they bore him across the city to his tomb in the Great Sept of Baelor Cersei kept a careful distance

He looked about the Round Room once more White wool hangings covered the walls and there was a white shield and two crossed longswords mounted above the hearth The chair behind the table was old black oak with cushions of blanched cowhide the leather worn thin Worn by the bony arse of Barristan the Bold and Ser Gerold Hightower before him by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight Ser Ryam Redwyne and the Demon of Darry by Ser Duncan the Tall and the Pale Griffin Alyn Connington How could the Kingslayer belong in such exalted company

Yet here he was

The table itself was old weirwood pale as bone carved in the shape of a huge shield supported by three white stallions By tradition the Lord Commander sat at the top of the shield and the brothers three to a side on the rare occasions when all seven were assembled The book that rested by his elbow was massive two feet tall and a foot and a half wide a thousand pages thick fine white vellum bound between covers of bleached white leather with gold hinges and fastenings The Book of the Brothers was its formal name but more often it was simply called the White Book

Within the White Book was the history of the Kingsguard Every knight who’d ever served had a page to record his name and deeds for all time On the top left-hand corner of each page was drawn the shield the man had carried at the time he was chosen inked in rich colors Down in the bottom right corner was the shield of the Kingsguard snow-white empty pure The upper shields were all different the lower shields were all the same In the space between were written the facts of each man’s life and service The heraldic drawings and illuminations were done by septons sent from the Great Sept of Baelor three times a year but it was the duty of the Lord Commander to keep the entries up to date

My duty now Once he learned to write with his left hand that is The White Book was well behind The deaths of Ser Mandon Moore and Ser Preston Greenfield needed to be entered and the brief bloody Kingsguard service of Sandor Clegane as well New pages must be started for Ser Balon Swann Ser Osmund Kettleblack and the Knight of Flowers I will need to summon a septon to draw their shields

Ser Barristan Selmy had preceded Jaime as Lord Commander The shield atop his page showed the arms of House Selmy three stalks of wheat yellow on a brown field Jaime was amused though unsurprised to find that Ser Barristan had taken the time to record his own dismissal before leaving the castle





Ser Barristan of House Selmy Firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy of Harvest Hall Served as squire to Ser Manfred Swann Named the Bold in his 10th year when he donned borrowed armor to appear as a mystery knight in the tourney at Blackhaven where he was defeated and unmasked by Duncan Prince of Dragonflies Knighted in his 16th year by King Aegon V Targaryen after performing great feats of prowess as a mystery knight in the winter tourney at King’s Landing defeating Prince Duncan the Small and Ser Duncan the Tall Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Slew Maelys the Monstrous last of the Blackfyre Pretenders in single combat during the War of the Ninepenny Kings Defeated Lormelle Long Lance and Cedrik Storm the Bastard of Bronzegate Named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year by Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower Defended the passage against all challengers in the tourney of the Silver Bridge Victor in the mêlée at Maidenpool Brought King Aerys II to safety during the Defiance of Duskendale despite an arrow wound in the chest Avenged the murder of his Sworn Brother Ser Gwayne Gaunt Rescued Lady Jeyne Swann and her septa from the Kingswood Brotherhood defeating Simon Toyne and the Smiling Knight and slaying the former In the Oldtown tourney defeated and unmasked the mystery knight Blackshield revealing him as the Bastard of Uplands Sole champion of Lord Steffon’s tourney at Storm’s End whereat he unhorsed Lord Robert Baratheon Prince Oberyn Martell Lord Leyton Hightower Lord Jon Connington Lord Jason Mallister and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen Wounded by arrow spear and sword at the Battle of the Trident whilst fighting beside his Sworn Brothers and Rhaegar Prince of Dragonstone Pardoned and named Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by King Robert I Baratheon Served in the honor guard that brought Lady Cersei of House Lannister to King’s Landing to wed King Robert Led the attack on Old Wyk during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion Champion of the tourney at King’s Landing in his 57th year Dismissed from service by King Joffrey I Baratheon in his 61st year for reasons of advanced age





The earlier part of Ser Barristan’s storied career had been entered by Ser Gerold Hightower in a big forceful hand Selmy’s own smaller and more elegant writing took over with the account of his wounding on the Trident

Jaime’s own page was scant by comparison





Ser Jaime of House Lannister Firstborn son of Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna of Casterly Rock Served against the Kingswood Brotherhood as squire to Lord Sumner Crakehall Knighted in his 15th year by Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard for valor in the field Chosen for the Kingsguard in his 15th year by King Aerys II Targaryen During the Sack of King’s Landing slew King Aerys II at the foot of the Iron Throne Thereafter known as the Kingslayer Pardoned for his crime by King Robert I Baratheon Served in the honor guard that brought his sister the Lady Cersei Lannister to King’s Landing to wed King Robert Champion in the tourney held at King’s Landing on the occasion of their wedding
