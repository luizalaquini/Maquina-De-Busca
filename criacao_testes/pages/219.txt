Shae shook her head lost Her eyes were wide and white

Groaning Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside shouting for his squire Wisps of pale fog drifted through the night long white fingers off the river Men and horses blundered through the predawn chill saddles were being cinched wagons loaded fires extinguished The trumpets blew again hurry hurry hurry Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as they ran When he found Pod the boy was snoring softly Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe My armor he said and be quick about it Bronn came trotting out of the mists already armored and ahorse wearing his battered halfhelm Do you know what’s happened Tyrion asked him

The Stark boy stole a march on us Bronn said He crept down the kingsroad in the night and now his host is less than a mile north of here forming up in battle array

Hurry the trumpets called hurry hurry hurry

See that the clansmen are ready to ride Tyrion ducked back inside his tent Where are my clothes he barked at Shae There No the leather damn it Yes Bring me my boots

By the time he was dressed his squire had laid out his armor such that it was Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body Alas it was safe at Casterly Rock and he was not He had to make do with oddments assembled from Lord Lefford’s wagons mail hauberk and coif a dead knight’s gorget lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots Some of it was ornate some plain not a bit of it matched or fit as it should His breastplate was meant for a bigger man for his oversize head they found a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike

Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps If I die weep for me Tyrion told the whore

How will you know You’ll be dead

I’ll know

I believe you would Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head and Pod fastened it to his gorget Tyrion buckled on his belt heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk By then his groom had brought up his mount a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was He needed help to mount he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone Pod handed him up his shield a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel Lastly they gave him his battle-axe Shae stepped back and looked him over M’lord looks fearsome

M’lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor Tyrion answered sourly but I thank you for the kindness Podrick should the battle go against us see the lady safely home He saluted her with his axe wheeled his horse about and trotted off His stomach was a hard knot so tight it pained him Behind his servants hurriedly began to strike his tent Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun broke over the horizon The western sky was a deep purple speckled with stars Tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise he would ever see… and whether wondering was a mark of cowardice Did his brother Jaime ever contemplate death before a battle

A warhorn sounded in the far distance a deep mournful note that chilled the soul The clansmen climbed onto their scrawny mountain horses shouting curses and rude jokes Several appeared to be drunk The rising sun was burning off the drifting tendrils of fog as Tyrion led them off What grass the horses had left was heavy with dew as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth The mountain men fell in behind him each clan arrayed behind its own leaders

In the dawn light the army of Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron rose thorns gleaming

His uncle would lead the center Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad Quivers hanging from their belts the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines to east and west of the road and stood calmly stringing their bows Between them pikemen formed squares behind were rank on rank of men-at-arms with spear and sword and axe Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser Kevan and the lords bannermen Lefford Lydden and Serrett with all their sworn retainers

The right wing was all cavalry some four thousand men heavy with the weight of their armor More than three quarters of the knights were there massed together like a great steel fist Ser Addam Marbrand had the command Tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out a burning tree orange and smoke Behind him flew Ser Flement’s purple unicorn the brindled boar of Crakehall the bantam rooster of Swyft and more

His lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept Around him the reserve assembled a huge force half mounted and half foot five thousand strong Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the reserve he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him committing his forces when and where they were needed most

Even from afar his lord father was resplendent Tywin Lannister’s battle armor put his son Jaime’s gilded suit to shame His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth-of-gold so heavy that it barely stirred even when he charged so large that its drape covered most of his stallion’s hindquarters when he took the saddle No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight so the greatcloak was held in place by a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on his shoulders as if poised to spring Their mate a male with a magnificent mane reclined atop Lord Tywin’s greathelm one paw raking the air as he roared All three lions were wrought in gold with ruby eyes His armor was heavy steel plate enameled in a dark crimson greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork His rondels were golden sunbursts all his fastenings were gilded and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone like fire in the light of the rising sun

Tyrion could hear the rumble of the foemen’s drums now He remembered Robb Stark as he had last seen him in his father’s high seat in the Great Hall of Winterfell a sword naked and shining in his hands He remembered how the direwolves had come at him out of the shadows and suddenly he could see them again snarling and snapping teeth bared in his face Would the boy bring his wolves to war with him The thought made him uneasy

The northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march Tyrion wondered what the boy had been thinking Did he think to take them unawares while they slept Small chance of that whatever else might be said of him Tywin Lannister was no man’s fool

The van was massing on the left He saw the standard first three black dogs on a yellow field Ser Gregor sat beneath it mounted on the biggest horse Tyrion had ever seen Bronn took one look at him and grinned Always follow a big man into battle

Tyrion threw him a hard look And why is that

They make such splendid targets That one he’ll draw the eyes of every bowman on the field

Laughing Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes I confess I had not considered it in that light

Clegane had no splendor about him his armor was steel plate dull grey scarred by hard use and showing neither sigil nor ornament He was pointing men into position with his blade a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger Any man runs I’ll cut him down myself he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion Imp Take the left Hold the river If you can

The left of the left To turn their flank the Starks would need horses that could run on water Tyrion led his men toward the riverbank Look he shouted pointing with his axe The river A blanket of pale mist still clung to the surface of the water the murky green current swirling past underneath The shallows were muddy and choked with reeds That river is ours Whatever happens keep close to the water Never lose sight of it Let no enemy come between us and our river If they dirty our waters hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes

Shagga had an axe in either hand He smashed them together and made them ring Halfman he shouted Other Stone Crows picked up the cry and the Black Ears and Moon Brothers as well The Burned Men did not shout but they rattled their swords and spears Halfman Halfman Halfman

Tyrion turned his courser in a circle to look over the field The ground was rolling and uneven here soft and muddy near the river rising in a gentle slope toward the kingsroad stony and broken beyond it to the cast A few trees spotted the hillsides but most of the land had been cleared and planted His heart pounded in his chest in time to the drums and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with sweat He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line shouting and gesticulating This wing too was all cavalry but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers the vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west mounted archers in leather jerkins a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords fieldhands on plow horses armed with scythes and their fathers’ rusted swords half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport… and Tyrion and his mountain clansmen
