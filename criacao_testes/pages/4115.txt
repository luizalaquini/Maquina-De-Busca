traneous matter about the outside especially in the
crevices of the handles the innermost curves of which
may not have seen daylight for several years by reason
of this encrustation thereon -- formed of ashes accident+
ally wetted with cider and baked hard but to the mind
of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that
being incontestably clean on the inside and about the
rim It may be observed that such a class of mug is
called a God-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity
for uncertain reasons  probably because its size makes
any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees
its bottom in drinking it empty
Jacob on receiving the order to see if the liquor was
warm enough placidly dipped his forefinger into it by
way of thermometer and having pronounced it nearly
of the proper degree raised the cup and very civilly
attempted to dust some of the
P 105
ashes from the bottom
with the skirt of his smock-frock because Shepherd Oak
was a stranger
A clane cup for the shepherd said the maltster
commandingly
No -- not at all said Gabriel in a reproving tone
of considerateness I never fuss about dirt in its pure
state and when I know what sort it is Taking the
mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its
contents and duly passed it to the next man
wouldnt think of giving such trouble to neighbours in
washing up when theres so much work to be done in
the world already continued Oak in a moister tone
after recovering from the stoppage of breath which is
occasioned by pulls at large mugs
 A right sensible man said Jacob
 True true  it cant be gainsaid observed a brisk
young man -- Mark Clark by name a genial and pleasant
gentleman whom to meet anywhcre in your travels was
to know to know was to drink with and to drink with
was unfortunately to pay for
And heres a mouthful of bread and bacon that
misess have sent shepherd The cider will go down
better with a bit of victuals Dont ye chaw quite close
shepherd for I let the bacon fall in the road outside as
I was bringing it along and may be tis rather gritty
There tis clane dirt and we all know what that is
as you say and you baint a particular man we see
shepherd
 True true -- not at all said the friendly Oak
Dont let your teeth quite meet and you wont feel
the sandiness at all Ah  tis wonderful what can be
done by contrivance  
 My own mind exactly neighbour
 Ah hes his grandfers own grandson  -- his grandfer
were just such a nice unparticular man  said the maltster
 Drink Henry Fray -- drink magnanimously said
Jan Coggan a person who held Saint-Simonian notions
of share and share alike where liquor was concerned as
the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual
revolution among them
Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
gaze
P 106
into mid-air Henry did not refuse He was a man
of more than middle age with eyebrows high up in his
forehead who laid it down that the law of the world
was bad with a long-suffering look through his listeners
at the world alluded to as it presented itself to his
imagination He always signed his name Henery --
strenuously insisting upon that spelling and if any
passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second
e was superfluous and old-fashioned he received the
reply that  H-e-n-e-r-y was the name he was christened
and the name he would stick to -- in the tone of one
to whom orthographical differences were matters which
had a great deal to do with personal character
Mr Jan Coggan who had passed the cup to Henery
was a crimson man with a spacious countenance and
private glimmer in his eye whose name had appeared
on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbour+
ing parishes as best man and chief witness in countless
unions of the previous twenty years he also very
frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms
of the subtly-jovial kind
 Come Mark Clark -- come Thers plenty more
in the barrel said Jan
Ay -- that I will tis my only doctor replied Mr
Clark who twenty years younger than Jan Coggan
revolved in the same orbit He secreted mirth on all
occasions for special discharge at popular parties
 Why Joseph Poorgrass ye hant had a drop  said
Mr Coggan to a self-conscious man in the background
thrusting the cup towards him
 Such a modest man as he is   said Jacob Smallbury
 Why yeve hardly had strength of eye enough to look
in our young misesss face so I hear Joseph 
All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach
 No -- Ive hardly looked at her at all simpered
Joseph reducing his body smaller whilst talking
apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence
And when I seed her twas nothing but blushes with
