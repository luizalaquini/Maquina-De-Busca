She smells of dogshit I’ve had enough of bad smells as it happens I think I’ll have your bedwarmer instead What do you call her Kyra

Are you mad Theon said angrily I’ll have you—

The Bastard’s backhand caught him square and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel The world vanished in a red roar of pain

Sometime later Theon found himself on the ground He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood Close the gates he tried to shout but it was too late The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned and more were pouring through a river of mail and sharp swords There was a ringing in his ears and horror all around him Black Lorren had his sword out but there were already four of them pressing in on him He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders then swung back to ride over him Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables Save me the Freys the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward and burn the rest Burn it burn it all

The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze screaming rearing…





TYRION

He dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh The air was full of acrid smoke Men were groaning and whimpering all around him and from time to time a scream would pierce the air thick with pain When he tried to move he found that he had fouled his own bedding The smoke in the air made his eyes water Am I crying He must not let his father see He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock A lion I must be a lion live a lion die a lion He hurt so much though Too weak to groan he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy monotonous voice He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying After a time the room faded

He found himself outside the city walking through a world without color Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps White maggots burrowed through black corruption The wolves were grey and so were the silent sisters together they stripped the flesh from the fallen There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields The sun was a hot white penny shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes My work thought Tyrion Lannister They died at my command

At first there was no sound in the world but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead soft and terrible They wept and moaned they begged for an end to pain they cried for help and wanted their mothers Tyrion had never known his mother He wanted Shae but she was not there He walked alone amidst grey shadows trying to remember…

The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain they were garbed in shades of white and grey and their blood was black and crusty He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon pulled by two tall black horses

So many dead so very many Their corpses hung limply their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas unrecognizable hardly human The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts grey lions dead flowers and pale ghostly stags Their armor was all dented and gashed the chainmail riven broken slashed Why did I kill them all He had known once but somehow he had forgotten

He would have asked one of the silent sisters but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth The discovery terrified him How could he live without a mouth He began to run The city was not far He would be safe inside the city away from all these dead He did not belong with the dead He had no mouth but he was still a living man No a lion a lion and alive But when he reached the city walls the gates were shut against him

It was dark when he woke again At first he could see nothing but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him The drapes were drawn but he could see the shape of carved bedposts and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed and the pillow beneath his head was goose down My own bed I am in my own bed in my own bedchamber

It was warm inside the drapes under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him He was sweating Fever he thought groggily He felt so weak and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand He gave up the effort His head felt enormous as big as the bed too heavy to raise from the pillow His body he could scarcely feel at all How did I come here He tried to remember The battle came back in fits and flashes The fight along the river the knight who’d offered up his gauntlet the bridge of ships…

Ser Mandon He saw the dead empty eyes the reaching hand the green fire shining against the white enamel plate Fear swept over him in a cold rush beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go He would have cried out if he’d had a mouth No that was the dream he thought his head pounding Help me someone help me Jaime Shae Mother someone… Tysha…

No one heard No one came Alone in the dark he fell back into piss-scented sleep He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed with their lord father beside her frowning It had to be a dream since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away fighting Robb Stark in the west Others came and went as well Varys looked down on him and sighed but Littlefinger made a quip Bloody treacherous bastard Tyrion thought venomously we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another but he did not understand the words Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt

He wanted to ask if they’d won the battle We must have else I’d be a head on a spike somewhere If I live we won He did not know what pleased him more the victory or the fact he had been able to reason it out His wits were coming back to him however slowly That was good His wits were all he had

The next time he woke the draperies had been pulled back and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off No don’t go help me help he tried to call but the best he could do was a muffled moan I have no mouth He raised a hand to his face his every movement pained and fumbling His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh lips teeth Linen The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding

A short while later Pod reappeared This time a stranger was with him a maester chained and robed My lord you must be still the man murmured You are grievous hurt You will do yourself great injury Are you thirsty

He managed an awkward nod The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat Tyrion swallowed scarcely tasting Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth he was already spiraling back to sleep

This time he dreamed he was at a feast a victory feast in some great hall He had a high seat on the dais and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero Marillion was there the singer who’d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon He played his woodharp and sang of the Imp’s daring deeds Even his father was smiling with approval When the song was over Jaime rose from his place commanded Tyrion to kneel and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword and he rose up a knight Shae was waiting to embrace him She took him by the hand laughing and teasing calling him her giant of Lannister

He woke in darkness to a cold empty room The draperies had been drawn again Something felt wrong turned around though he could not have said what He was alone once more Pushing back the blankets he tried to sit but the pain was too much and he soon subsided breathing raggedly His face was the least part of it His right side was one huge ache and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm What’s happened to me Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it I was hurt more badly than I knew Ser Mandon…

The memory frightened him but Tyrion made himself hold it turn it in his head stare at it hard He tried to kill me no mistake That part was not a dream He would have cut me in half if Pod had not… Pod where’s Pod

Gritting his teeth he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down half on the rushes and half on him Even that small effort had dizzied him The room whirled around him all bare walls and dark shadows with a single narrow window He saw a chest he’d owned an untidy pile of his clothing his battered armor This is not my bedchamber he realized Not even the Tower of the Hand Someone had moved him His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan They have moved me here to die he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more The room was dank and cold and he was burning

He dreamed of a better place a snug little cottage by the sunset sea The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth but he had always been warm there even when they let the fire go out She used to tease me about that he remembered I never thought to feed the fire that had always been a servant’s task We have no servants she would remind me and I would say You have me I’m your servant and she would say A lazy servant What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock my lord and he would tell her They kiss them That would always make her giggle They do not neither They beat them I bet she would say but he would insist No they kiss them just like this He would show her how They kiss their fingers first every one and they kiss their wrists yes and inside their elbows Then they kiss their funny ears all our servants have funny ears Stop laughing And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them there so like that and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips their… mmmm… mouths… so…
