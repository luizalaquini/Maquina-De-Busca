sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall make an atonement
for him as concerning his sin and it shall be forgiven him

427 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance while
he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
concerning things which ought not to be done and be guilty 428 Or
if his sin which he hath sinned come to his knowledge then he shall
bring his offering a kid of the goats a female without blemish for
his sin which he hath sinned

429 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and
slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering

430 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger
and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall
pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar

431 And he shall take away all the fat thereof as the fat is taken
away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall
burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD and the
priest shall make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him

432 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering he shall bring it a
female without blemish

433 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and
slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
offering

434 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with
his finger and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar
435 And he shall take away all the fat thereof as the fat of the
lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar according to the offerings made
by fire unto the LORD and the priest shall make an atonement for his
sin that he hath committed and it shall be forgiven him

51 And if a soul sin and hear the voice of swearing and is a
witness whether he hath seen or known of it if he do not utter it
then he shall bear his iniquity

52 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing whether it be a carcase of
an unclean beast or a carcase of unclean cattle or the carcase of
unclean creeping things and if it be hidden from him he also shall
be unclean and guilty

53 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man whatsoever uncleanness it
be that a man shall be defiled withal and it be hid from him when he
knoweth of it then he shall be guilty

54 Or if a soul swear pronouncing with his lips to do evil or to do
good whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath and it
be hid from him when he knoweth of it then he shall be guilty in one
of these

55 And it shall be when he shall be guilty in one of these things
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing 56 And he
shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he
hath sinned a female from the flock a lamb or a kid of the goats
for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for him
concerning his sin

57 And if he be not able to bring a lamb then he shall bring for his
trespass which he hath committed two turtledoves or two young
pigeons unto the LORD one for a sin offering and the other for a
burnt offering

58 And he shall bring them unto the priest who shall offer that
which is for the sin offering first and wring off his head from his
neck but shall not divide it asunder 59 And he shall sprinkle of
the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar and the rest
of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar it is a
sin offering

510 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to
the manner and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
which he hath sinned and it shall be forgiven him

511 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves or two young
pigeons then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth
part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering he shall put no oil
upon it neither shall he put any frankincense thereon for it is a
sin offering

512 Then shall he bring it to the priest and the priest shall take
his handful of it even a memorial thereof and burn it on the altar
according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD it is a sin
offering

513 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
sin that he hath sinned in one of these and it shall be forgiven him
and the remnant shall be the priests as a meat offering

514 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 515 If a soul commit a
trespass and sin through ignorance in the holy things of the LORD
then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without
blemish out of the flocks with thy estimation by shekels of silver
after the shekel of the sanctuary for a trespass offering
