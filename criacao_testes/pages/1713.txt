Gabriel did not pause in his walk and in another
moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone The noise
was enough to disturb the motionless stranger who
started and assumed a careless position
It was a slim girl rather thinly clad
 Good-night to you said Gabriel heartily
 Good-night said the girl to Gabriel
The voice was unexpectedly attractive  it was the
low and
P 100
dulcet note suggestive of romance  common in
descriptions rare in experience
Ill thank you to tell me if Im in the way for
Warrens Malthouse   Gabriel resumed primarily to gain
the information indirectly to get more of the music
Quite right Its at the bottom of the hill And
do you know --  --  The girl hesitated and then went
on again Do you know how late they keep open
the Bucks Head Inn She seemed to be won by
Gabriels heartiness as Gabriel had been won by her
modulations
 I dont know where the Bucks Head is or anything
about it Do you think of going there to-night 
 Yes --  --  The woman again paused There was
no necessity for any continuance of speech and the fact
that she did add more seemed to proceed from an
unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a
remark which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they
are acting by stealth  You are not a Weatherbury man  
she said timorously
 I am not I am the new shepherd -- just arrived
Only a shepherd -- and you seem almost a farmer by
your ways
 Only a shepherd Gabriel repeated in a dull cadence
of finality  His thoughts were directed to the past his
eyes to the feet of the girl and for the first time he
saw lying there a bundle of some sort She may have
perceived the direction of his face for she said
coaxingly --
 You wont say anything in the parish about having
seen me here will you -- at least not for a day or two 
I wont if you wish me not to said Oak
Thank you indeed the other repliedI am
rather poor and I dont want people to know anything
about me  Then she was silent and shivered
You ought to have a cloak on such a cold night
Gabriel observed  I would advise ee to get indoors
O no Would you mind going on and leaving
me  I thank you much for what you have told me
 I will go on he said  adding hesitatingly --  Since
you are
P 101
not very well off perhaps you would accept this
trifle from me It is only a shilling butit is all I have
to spare
 Yes I will take it said the stranger gratefully
She extended her hand  Gabriel his In feeling for
each others palm in the gloom before the money could
be passed a minute incident occurred which told much
Gabriels fingers alighted on the young womans wrist
It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity He had
frequently felt the same quick hard beat in the femoral
artery of -- his lambs when overdriven It suggested a
consumption too great of a vitality which to judge from
her figure and stature was already too little
What is the matter 
 Nothing
But there is
 No no no  Let your having seen me be asecret  
 Very well  I will Good-night again
 Good-night
The young girl remained motionless by the tree and
Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury or
Lower Longpuddle as it was sometimes called He
fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a
very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile
creature But wisdom lies in moderating mere impres+
sions and Gabriel endeavoured to think little of this

THE MALTHOUSE -- THE CHAT -- NEWS
WARRENS Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall
inwrapped with ivy and though not much of the exterior
was visible at this hour the character and purposes of
the building were clearly enough shown by its outline
upon the sky From the walls an overhanging thatched
roof sloped up to a point in the centre upon which rose
a small wooden lantern fitted with louvre-boards on all
the four sides and from these openings a mist was dimly
perceived to be escaping into the night air There was
no window in front  but a square hole in the door was
glazed with a single pane through which red comfortable
rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front
Voices were to be heard inside
Oaks hand skimmed the surface of the door with
fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Somerer pattern till
he found a leathern strap which he pulled This lifted
a wooden latch and the door swung open
The room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow
from the kiln mouth which shone over the floor with
