…don’t want to wake the dragon do you

Ser Jorah’s face was drawn and sorrowful Rhaegar was the last dragon he told her He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals One moment he was there and the next he was fading his flesh colorless less substantial than the wind The last dragon he whispered thin as a wisp and was gone She felt the dark behind her and the red door seemed farther away than ever

…don’t want to wake the dragon do you

Viserys stood before her screaming The dragon does not beg slut You do not command the dragon I am the dragon and I will be crowned The molten gold trickled down his face like wax burning deep channels in his flesh I am the dragon and I will be crowned he shrieked and his fingers snapped like snakes biting at her nipples pinching twisting even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks

…don’t want to wake the dragon…

The red door was so far ahead of her and she could feel the icy breath behind sweeping up on her If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death howling forever alone in the darkness She began to run

…don’t want to wake the dragon…

She could feel the heat inside her a terrible burning in her womb Her son was tall and proud with Drogo’s copper skin and her own silver-gold hair violet eyes shaped like almonds And he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out She saw his heart burning through his chest and in an instant he was gone consumed like a moth by a candle turned to ash She wept for her child the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin

…want to wake the dragon…

Ghosts lined the hallway dressed in the faded raiment of kings In their hands were swords of pale fire They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white and their eyes were opal and amethyst tourmaline and jade Faster they cried faster faster She raced her feet melting the stone wherever they touched Faster the ghosts cried as one and she screamed and threw herself forward A great knife of pain ripped down her back and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings And Daenerys Targaryen flew

…wake the dragon…

The door loomed before her the red door so close so close the hall was a blur around her the cold receding behind And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea high and higher the green rippling beneath and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings She could smell home she could see it there just beyond that door green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm there She threw open the door

…the dragon…

And saw her brother Rhaegar mounted on a stallion as black as his armor Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm The last dragon Ser Jorah’s voice whispered faintly The last the last Dany lifted his polished black visor The face within was her own

After that for a long time there was only the pain the fire within her and the whisperings of stars

She woke to the taste of ashes

No she moaned no please

Khaleesi Jhiqui hovered over her a frightened doe

The tent was drenched in shadow still and close Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier and Dany followed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above Flying she thought I had wings I was flying But it was only a dream Help me she whispered struggling to rise Bring me… Her voice was raw as a wound and she could not think what she wanted Why did she hurt so much It was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps I want…

Yes Khaleesi Quick as that Jhiqui was gone bolting from the tent shouting Dany needed… something… someone… what It was important she knew It was the only thing in the world that mattered She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her fighting the blanket tangled about her legs It was so hard to move The world swam dizzily I have to…

They found her on the carpet crawling toward her dragon eggs Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks while she struggled feebly against him Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur I must she tried to tell them I have to…

…sleep Princess Ser Jorah said

No Dany said Please Please

Yes He covered her with silk though she was burning Sleep and grow strong again Khaleesi Come back to us And then Mirri Maz Duur was there the maegi tipping a cup against her lips She tasted sour milk and something else something thick and bitter Warm liquid ran down her chin Somehow she swallowed The tent grew dimmer and sleep took her again This time she did not dream She floated serene and at peace on a black sea that knew no shore

After a time—a night a day a year she could not say—she woke again The tent was dark its silken walls flapping like wings when the wind gusted outside This time Dany did not attempt to rise Irri she called Jhiqui Doreah They were there at once My throat is dry she said so dry and they brought her water It was warm and flat yet Dany drank it eagerly and sent Jhiqui for more Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow I have been sick Dany said The Dothraki girl nodded How long The cloth was soothing but Irri seemed so sad it frightened her Long she whispered When Jhiqui returned with more water Mirri Maz Duur came with her eyes heavy from sleep Drink she said lifting Dany’s head to the cup once more but this time it was only wine Sweet sweet wine Dany drank and lay back listening to the soft sound of her own breathing She could feel the heaviness in her limbs as sleep crept in to fill her up once more Bring me… she murmured her voice slurred and drowsy Bring… I want to hold…

Yes the maegi asked What is it you wish Khaleesi

Bring me… egg… dragon’s egg… please… Her lashes turned to lead and she was too weary to hold them up
