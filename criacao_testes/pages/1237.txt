Roose Bolton may not agree Not with land at issue Ser Rodrik looked unhappy Would that I could take this serving man’s head off as well he’s as bad as his master But I fear I must keep him alive until Robb returns from his wars He is the only witness to the worst of the Bastard’s crimes Perhaps when Lord Bolton hears his tale he will abandon his claim but meantime we have Manderly knights and Dreadfort men killing one another in Hornwood forests and I lack the strength to stop them The old knight turned in his seat and gave Bran a stern look And what have you been about while I’ve been away my lord prince Commanding our guardsmen not to wash Do you want them smelling like this Reek is that it

The sea is coming here Bran said Jojen saw it in a green dream Alebelly is going to drown

Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar The Reed boy believes he sees the future in his dreams Ser Rodrik I’ve spoken to Bran about the uncertainty of such prophecies but if truth be told there is trouble along the Stony Shore Raiders in longships plundering fishing villages Raping and burning Leobald Tallhart has sent his nephew Benfred to deal with them but I expect they’ll take to their ships and flee at the first sight of armed men

Aye and strike somewhere else The Others take all such cowards They would never dare no more than the Bastard of Bolton if our main strength were not a thousand leagues south Ser Rodrik looked at Bran What else did the lad tell you

He said the water would flow over our walls He saw Alebelly drowned and Mikken and Septon Chayle too

Ser Rodrik frowned Well should it happen that I need to ride against these raiders myself I shan’t take Alebelly then He didn’t see me drowned did he No Good

It heartened Bran to hear that Maybe they won’t drown then he thought If they stay away from the sea

Meera thought so too later that night when she and Joien met Bran in his room to play a three-sided game of tiles but her brother shook his head The things I see in green dreams can’t be changed

That made his sister angry Why would the gods send a warning if we can’t heed it and change what’s to come

I don’t know Joien said sadly

If you were Alebelly you’d probably jump into the well to have done with it He should fight and Bran should too

Me Bran felt suddenly afraid What should I fight Am I going to drown too

Meera looked at him guiltily I shouldn’t have said…

He could tell that she was hiding something Did you see me in a green dream he asked Jojen nervously Was I drowned

Not drowned Jojen spoke as if every word pained him I dreamed of the man who came today the one they call Reek You and your brother lay dead at his feet and he was skinning off your faces with a long red blade

Meera rose to her feet If I went to the dungeon I could drive a spear right through his heart How could he murder Bran if he was dead

The gaolers will stop you Joien said The guards And if you tell them why you want him dead they’ll never believe

I have guards too Bran reminded them Alebelly and Poxy Tym and Hayhead and the rest

Jojen’s mossy eyes were full of pity They won’t be able to stop him Bran I couldn’t see why but I saw the end of it I saw you and Rickon in your crypts down in the dark with all the dead kings and their stone wolves

No Bran thought No If I went away… to Greywater or to the crow someplace far where they couldn’t find me…

It will not matter The dream was green Bran and the green dreams do not lie





TYRION

Vrys stood over the brazier warming his soft hands It would appear Renly was murdered most fearfully in the very midst of his army His throat was opened from ear to ear by a blade that passed through steel and bone as if they were soft cheese

Murdered by whose hand Cersei demanded

Have you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all My informers are not always as highly placed as we might like When a king dies fancies sprout like mushrooms in the dark A groom says that Renly was slain by a knight of his own Rainbow Guard A washerwoman claims Stannis stole through the heart of his brother’s army with his magic sword Several men-at-arms believe a woman did the fell deed but cannot agree on which woman A maid that Renly had spurned claims one A camp follower brought in to serve his pleasure on the eve of battle says a second The third ventures that it might have been the Lady Catelyn Stark

The queen was not pleased Must you waste our time with every rumor the fools care to tell

You pay me well for these rumors my gracious queen

We pay you for the truth Lord Varys Remember that or this small council may grow smaller still

Varys tittered nervously You and your noble brother will leave His Grace with no council at all if you continue

I daresay the realm could survive a few less councillors said Littlefinger with a smile

Dear dear Petyr said Varys are you not concerned that yours might be the next name on the Hand’s little list

Before you Varys I should never dream of it

Mayhaps we will be brothers on the Wall together you and I Varys giggled again

Sooner than you’d like if the next words out of your mouth are not something useful eunuch From the look of her eyes Cersei was prepared to castrate Varys all over again

Might this be some ruse asked Littlefinger

If so it is a ruse of surpassing cleverness said Varys It has certainly hoodwinked me

Tyrion had heard enough Joff will be so disappointed he said He was saving such a nice spike for Renly’s head But whoever did the deed we must assume Stannis was behind it The gain is clearly his He did not like this news he had counted on the brothers Baratheon decimating each other in bloody battle He could feel his elbow throbbing where the morningstar had laid it open It did that sometimes in the damp He squeezed it uselessly in his hand and asked What of Renly’s host

The greater part of his foot remains at Bitterbridge Varys abandoned the brazier to take his seat at the table Most of the lords who rode with Lord Renly to Storm’s End have gone over banner-and-blade to Stannis with all their chivalry

Led by the Florents I’d wager said Littlefinger

Varys gave him a simpering smile You would win my lord Lord Alester was indeed the first to bend the knee Many others followed

Many Tyrion said pointedly but not all

Not all agreed the eunuch Not Loras Tyrell nor Randyll Tarly nor Mathis Rowan And Storm’s End itself has not yielded Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly’s name and will not believe his liege is dead He demands to see the mortal remains before he opens his gates but it seems that Renly’s corpse has unaccountably vanished Carried away most likely A fifth of Renly’s knights departed with Ser Loras rather than bend the knee to Stannis It’s said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw his king’s body and slew three of Renly’s guards in his wrath among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce

A pity he stopped at three thought Tyrion

Ser Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge Varys went on His sister is there Renly’s queen as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless Which side will they take now A ticklish question Many serve the lords who remained at Storm’s End and those lords now belong to Stannis

Tyrion leaned forward There is a chance here it seems to me Win Loras Tyrell to our cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well They may have sworn their swords to Stannis for the moment yet they cannot love the man or they would have been his from the start

Is their love for us any greater asked Cersei

Scarcely said Tyrion They loved Renly clearly but Renly is slain Perhaps we can give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer Joffrey to Stannis… if we move quickly

What sort of reasons do you mean to give them
