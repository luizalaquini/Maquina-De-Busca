He is not a bold man this one Catelyn thought More of a Frey than a Lannister in truth His cousin the Kingslayer would have been a much different matter They would never have gotten that honorific through Ser Jaime Lannister’s perfect teeth

I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in King’s Landing You’ll travel under a peace banner with thirty of my best men to escort you

Ser Cleos was visibly relieved Then I should be most glad to bring His Grace’s message to the queen

Understand Robb said I am not giving you your freedom Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged me his support and that of House Frey Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering Wood but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner That makes you a Lannister not a Frey I want your pledge on your honor as a knight that after you deliver my message you’ll return with the queen’s reply and resume your captivity

Ser Cleos answered at once I do so vow

Every man in this hall has heard you warned Catelyn’s brother Ser Edmure Tully who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father If you do not return the whole realm will know you forsworn

I will do as I pledged Ser Cleos replied stiffly What is this message

An offer of peace Robb stood longsword in hand Grey Wind moved to his side The hall grew hushed Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms I will sheath this sword and make an end to the war between us

In the back of the hall Catelyn glimpsed the tall gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark shove through a rank of guards and out the door No one else moved Robb paid the disruption no mind Olyvar the paper he commanded The squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment

Robb unrolled it First the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King’s Landing to White Harbor It is to be understood that Sansa’s betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon is at an end When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell I will release the queen’s cousins the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey and give them safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered

Catelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips

Secondly my lord father’s bones will be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell as he would have wished The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King’s Landing must also be returned

Living men had gone south and cold bones would return Ned had the truth of it she thought His place was at Winterfell he said as much but would I hear him No Go I told him you must be Robert’s Hand for the good of our House for the sake of our children    my doing mine no other   

Third my father’s greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand here at Riverrun

She watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt his face as still as stone

Fourth the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident Once he does so I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps save Jaime Lannister alone who will remain my hostage for his father’s good behavior

She studied Theon Greyjoy’s sly smile wondering what it meant That young man had a way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to Catelyn had never liked it

Lastly King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north Henceforth we are no part of their realm but a free and independent kingdom as of old Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east

THE KING IN THE NORTH boomed Greatjon Umber a ham-sized fist hammering at the air as he shouted Stark Stark The King in the North

Robb rolled up the parchment again Maester Vyman has drawn a map showing the borders we claim You shall have a copy for the queen Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond these borders and cease his raiding burning and pillage The Queen Regent and her son shall make no claims to taxes incomes nor service from my people and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty vows pledges debts and obligations owed to the Iron Throne and the Houses Baratheon and Lannister Additionally the Lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages to be mutually agreed upon as a pledge of peace These I will treat as honored guests according to their station So long as the terms of this pact are abided with faithfully I shall release two hostages every year and return them safely to their families Robb tossed the rolled parchment at the knight’s feet There are the terms If she meets them I’ll give her peace If not—he whistled and Grey Wind moved forward snarling—I’ll give her another Whispering Wood

Stark the Greatjon roared again and now other voices took up the cry Stark Stark King in the North The direwolf threw back his head and howled

Ser Cleos had gone the color of curdled milk The queen shall hear your message my—Your Grace

Good Robb said Ser Robin see that he has a good meal and clean clothing He’s to ride at first light

As you command Your Grace Ser Robin Ryger replied

Then we are done The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as Robb turned to leave Grey Wind at his heels Olyvar Frey scrambled ahead to open the door Catelyn followed them out her brother at her side

You did well she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall though that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king

Robb scratched Grey Wind behind the ear Did you see the look on his face Mother he asked smiling

What I saw was Lord Karstark walking out

As did I Robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to Olyvar Take this thing back to my bedchamber

At once Your Grace The squire hurried off

I’ll wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark her brother Edmure declared How can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father’s domains stealing his crops and slaughtering his people I say again we ought to be marching on Harrenhal

We lack the strength Robb said though unhappily

Edmure persisted Do we grow stronger sitting here Our host dwindles every day

And whose doing is that Catelyn snapped at her brother It had been at Edmure’s insistence that Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning each to defend his own lands Ser Marq Piper and Lord Karyl Vance had been the first to go Lord Jonos Bracken had followed vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced his intent to return to his seat at Seagard still mercifully untouched by the fighting

You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to the sword Ser Edmure said but Lord Karstark is a northman It would be an ill thing if he were to leave us

I’ll speak with him said Robb He lost two sons in the Whispering Wood Who can blame him if he does not want to make peace with their killers    with my father’s killers   

More bloodshed will not bring your father back to us or Lord Rickard’s sons Catelyn said An offer had to be made—though a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms

Any sweeter and I would have gagged Her son’s beard had grown in redder than his auburn hair Robb seemed to think it made him look fierce royal    older But bearded or no he was still a youth of fifteen and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark It had been no easy thing to convince him to make even this offer poor as it was

Cersei Lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of cousins It’s her brother she’ll want as you know full well She had told him as much before but Catelyn was finding that kings do not listen half so attentively as sons

I can’t release the Kingslayer not even if I wanted to My lords would never abide it

Your lords made you their king

And can unmake me just as easy

If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe we should pay it willingly Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in his cell If he should die while he’s your prisoner men will say—

—that he well deserved it Robb finished

And your sisters Catelyn asked sharply Will they deserve their deaths as well I promise you if any harm comes to her brother Cersei will pay us back blood for blood—

Lannister won’t die Robb said No one so much as speaks to him without my warrant He has food water clean straw more comfort than he has any right to But I won’t free him not even for Arya and Sansa

Her son was looking down at her Catelyn realized Was it war that made him grow so fast she wondered or the crown they had put on his head Are you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field again is that the truth of it

Grey Wind growled as if he sensed Robb’s anger and Edmure Tully put a brotherly hand on Catelyn’s shoulder Cat don’t The boy has the right of this

Don’t call me the boy Robb said rounding on his uncle his anger spilling out all at once on poor Edmure who had only meant to support him I’m almost a man grown and a king—your king ser And I don’t fear Jaime Lannister I defeated him once I’ll defeat him again if I must only    He pushed a fall of hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head I might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for Father but   

   but not for the girls Her voice was icy quiet Girls are not important enough are they
