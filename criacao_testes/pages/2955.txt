causeless shall not come

263 A whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the
fools back

264 Answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like
unto him

265 Answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own
conceit

266 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
feet and drinketh damage

267 The legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth
of fools

268 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth
honour to a fool

269 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable
in the mouths of fools

2610 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool
and rewardeth transgressors

2611 As a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his
folly

2612 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of
a fool than of him

2613 The slothful man saith There is a lion in the way a lion is in
the streets

2614 As the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon
his bed

2615 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to
bring it again to his mouth

2616 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
render a reason

2617 He that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to
him is like one that taketh a dog by the ears

2618 As a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and death 2619 So
is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith Am not I in sport
2620 Where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no
talebearer the strife ceaseth

2621 As coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a
contentious man to kindle strife

2622 The words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly

2623 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
silver dross

2624 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceit
within him 2625 When he speaketh fair believe him not for there
are seven abominations in his heart

2626 Whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be
shewed before the whole congregation

2627 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a
stone it will return upon him

2628 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a
flattering mouth worketh ruin

271 Boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day
may bring forth

272 Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger
and not thine own lips

273 A stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is
heavier than them both

274 Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand
before envy  275 Open rebuke is better than secret love

276 Faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful

277 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet

278 As a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that
wandereth from his place

279 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of
a mans friend by hearty counsel

2710 Thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neither
go into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity for better is
