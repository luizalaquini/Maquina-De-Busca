thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow

5222 And a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round about all of brass The second pillar also and the
pomegranates were like unto these

5223 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and all
the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about

5224 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and
Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 5225
He took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the
men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person
which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host
who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people
of the land that were found in the midst of the city

5226 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah

5227 And the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death in
Riblah in the land of Hamath Thus Judah was carried away captive out
of his own land

5228 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in
the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty 5229 In
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons 5230 In the three and
twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons
all the persons were four thousand and six hundred

5231 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah in the twelfth month in the
five and twentieth day of the month that Evilmerodach king of Babylon
in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king
of Judah and brought him forth out of prison

5232 And spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that were with him in Babylon 5233 And changed his
prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the
days of his life

5234 And for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the
king of Babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all
the days of his life




The Lamentations of Jeremiah


11 How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how is
she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and
princess among the provinces how is she become tributary  12 She
weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all
her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt
treacherously with her they are become her enemies

13 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of
great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits

14 The ways of Zion do mourn because none come to the solemn feasts
all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins are
afflicted and she is in bitterness

15 Her adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the LORD
hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her
children are gone into captivity before the enemy

16 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed her
princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone
without strength before the pursuer

17 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old when
her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her the
adversaries saw her and did mock at her sabbaths

18 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is removed all
that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness
yea she sigheth and turneth backward

19 Her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end
therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter O LORD
behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself

110 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
things for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary
whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy
congregation

111 All her people sigh they seek bread they have given their
pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul see O LORD and
consider for I am become vile

112 Is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if
