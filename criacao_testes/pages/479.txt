them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out

443 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword
neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine
arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour
unto them

444 Thou art my King O God command deliverances for Jacob

445 Through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will
we tread them under that rise up against us

446 For I will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me

447 But thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to
shame that hated us

448 In God we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever

Selah

449 But thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth
with our armies

4410 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate
us spoil for themselves

4411 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast
scattered us among the heathen

4412 Thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy
wealth by their price

4413 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a
derision to them that are round about us

4414 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head
among the people

4415 My confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face
hath covered me

4416 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason
of the enemy and avenger

4417 All this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant

4418 Our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined
from thy way

4419 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and
covered us with the shadow of death

4420 If we have forgotten the name of our God or stretched out our
hands to a strange god

4421 Shall not God search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the
heart

4422 Yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter

4423 Awake why sleepest thou O Lord arise cast us not off for
ever

4424 Wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction
and our oppression

4425 For our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto
the earth

4426 Arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake



451 My heart is inditing a good matter I speak of the things which I
have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer

452 Thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into
thy lips therefore God hath blessed thee for ever

453 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh O most mighty with thy glory and
thy majesty

454 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee
terrible things

455 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies
whereby the people fall under thee

456 Thy throne O God is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy
kingdom is a right sceptre

457 Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore God
thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows

458 All thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of
