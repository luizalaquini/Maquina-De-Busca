Brienne said I remember a woman… she came from some place across the narrow sea I could not even say what language she sang in but her voice was as lovely as she was She had eyes the color of plums and her waist was so tiny my father could put his hands around it His hands were almost as big as mine She closed her long thick fingers as if to hide them

Did you sing for your father Catelyn asked

Brienne shook her head staring down at her trencher as if to find some answer in the gravy

For Lord Renly

The girl reddened Never I… his fool he made cruel japes sometimes and I…

Someday you must sing for me

I… please I have no gift Brienne pushed back from the table Forgive me my lady Do I have your leave to go

Catelyn nodded The tall ungainly girl left the hall with long strides almost unnoticed amidst the revelry May the gods go with her she thought as she returned listlessly to her supper

It was three days later when the hammer blow that Brienne had foretold fell and five days before they heard of it Catelyn was sitting with her father when Edmure’s messenger arrived The man’s armor was dinted his boots dusty and he had a ragged hole in his surcoat but the look on his face as he knelt was enough to tell her that the news was good Victory my lady He handed her Edmure’s letter Her hand trembled as she broke the seal

Lord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords her brother wrote but every thrust had been thrown back Lord Lefford had been drowned the Crakehall knight called Strongboar taken captive Ser Addam Marbrand thrice forced to retreat… but the fiercest battle had been fought at Stone Mill where Ser Gregor Clegane had led the assault So many of his men had fallen that their dead horses threatened to dam the flow In the end the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank but Edmure had thrown his reserve at them and they had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten Ser Gregor himself had lost his horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around him They shall not cross Cat Edmure scrawled Lord Tywin is marching to the southeast A feint perhaps or full retreat it matters not They shall not cross

Ser Desmond Grell had been elated Oh if only I might have been with him the old knight said when she read him the letter Where is that fool Rymund There’s a song in this by the gods and one that even Edmure will want to hear The mill that ground the Mountain down I could almost make the words myself had I the singer’s gift

I’ll hear no songs until the fighting’s done Catelyn said perhaps too sharply Yet she allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word and agreed when he suggested breaking open some casks in honor of Stone Mill The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber they would all be better for a little drink and hope

That night the castle rang to the sounds of celebration Riverrun the smallfolk shouted and Tully Tully They’d come frightened and helpless and her brother had taken them in when most lords would have closed their gates Their voices floated in through the high windows and seeped under the heavy redwood doors Rymund played his harp accompanied by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes Catelyn listened to girlish laughter and the excited chatter of the green boys her brother had left her for a garrison Good sounds… and yet they did not touch her She could not share their happiness

In her father’s solar she found a heavy leatherbound book of maps and opened it to the riverlands Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced it by flickering candlelight Marching to the southeast she thought By now they had likely reached the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush she decided

She closed the book even more uneasy than before The gods had granted them victory after victory At Stone Mill at Oxcross in the Battle of the Camps at the Whispering Wood…

But if we are winning why am I so afraid





BRAN

The sound was the faintest of clinks a scraping of steel over stone He lifted his head from his paws listening sniffing at the night

The evening’s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong again Grass and thorns blackberries broken on the ground mud worms rotting leaves a rat creeping through the bush He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother’s coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he’d killed Other squirrels moved through the branches above smelling of wet fur and fear their little claws scratching at the bark The noise had sounded something like that

And he heard it again clink and scrape It brought him to his feet His ears pricked and his tail rose He howled a long deep shivery cry a howl to wake the sleepers but the piles of man-rock were dark and dead A still wet night a night to drive men into their holes The rain had stopped but the men still hid from the damp huddled by the fires in their caves of piled stone

His brother came sliding through the trees moving almost as quiet as another brother he remembered dimly from long ago the white one with the eyes of blood This brother’s eyes were pools of shadow but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling He had heard the sounds as well and known they meant danger

This time the clink and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of skinfeet on stone The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know Stranger Danger Death

He ran toward the sound his brother racing beside him The stone dens rose before them walls slick and wet He bared his teeth but the man-rock took no notice A gate loomed up a black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post When he crashed against it the gate shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held Through the bars he could look down the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond but there was no way through He could force his muzzle between the bars but no more Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth but they would not break They had tried to dig under but there were great flat stones beneath half-covered by earth and blown leaves

Snarling he paced back and forth in front of the gate then threw himself at it once more It moved a little and slammed him back Locked something whispered Chained The voice he did not hear the scent without a smell The other ways were closed as well Where doors opened in the walls of man-rock the wood was thick and strong There was no way out

There is the whisper came and it seemed as if he could see the shadow of a great tree covered in needles slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man Yet when he looked about it was not there The other side of the godswood the sentinel hurry hurry…
