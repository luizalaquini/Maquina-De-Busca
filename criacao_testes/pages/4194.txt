the unconscious promptness of a medium
Gabriel let go his head and it dropped upon the
floor like a bowl He then went to Susan Talls
husband
 wheres the key of the granary  
No answer The question was repeated with the
same result To be shouted to at night was evidently
less of a novelty to Susan Talls husband than to
Matthew Moon Oak flung down Talls head into the
corner again and turned away
To be just the men were not greatly to blame for
this painful and demoralizing termination to the
evenings entertainment Sergeant Troy had so strenu+
ously insisted glass in hand that drinking should be
the bond of their union that those who wished to refuse
hardly liked to be so unmannerly under the circum+
stances Having from their youth up been entirely un+
accustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild
ale it was no wonder that they had succumbed one
and all with extraordinary uniformity after the lapse of
about an hour
Gabriel was greatly depressed This debauch boded
ill for that wilful and fascinating mistress whom the
faithful man even now felt within him as the embodi+
ment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless
He put out the expiring lights that the barn might
not be endangered closed the door upon the men in
their deep and oblivious sleep and went again into the
lone night A hot breeze as if breathed from the
parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe
fanned him from the south while directly opposite in
the north rose a grim misshapen body of

cloud in the
very teeth of the wind So unnaturally did it rise that
one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below
Meanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the
south-east corner of the sky as if in terror of the large
cloud like a young brood gazed in upon by some
monster
Going on to the village Oak flung a small stone
against the window of Laban Talls bedroom expecting
Susan to open it  but nobody stirred He went round
to the back door which had been left unfastened for
Labans entry and passed in to the foot of the stair+
case
Mrs Tall Ive come for the key of the granary
to get at the rick-cloths said Oak in a stentorian
voice
Is that you   said Mrs Susan Tall half awake
 Yes said Gabriel
Come along to bed do you drawlatching rogue --
keeping a body awake like this 
It isnt Laban -- tis Gabriel Oak I want the key
of the granary
Gabriel what in the name of fortune did you
pretend to be Laban for 
 I didnt I thought you meant --  -- 
yes you did  what do you want here 
The key of the granary
Take it then Tis on the nail People coming
disturbing women at this time of night ought --  -- 
Gabriel took the key without waiting to hear the
conclusion of the tirade Ten minutes later his lonely
figure might have been seen dragging four large water+
proof coverings across the yard and soon two of these
heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug -- two cloths
to each Two hundred pounds were secured Three
wheat-stacks remained open and there were no more
cloths Oak looked under the staddles and found a
fork He mounted the third pile of wealth and began
operating adopting the plan of sloping the upper
sheaves one over the other and in addition filling
the interstices with the material of some untied sheaves
So far all was well By this hurried contrivance

property in wheat was safe for at any rate
a week or two provided always that there was not
much wind
Next came the barley This it was only possible to
protect by systematic thatching Time went on and
the moon vanished not to reappear It was the
farewell of the ambassador previous to war The
night had a haggard look like a sick thing and there
came finally an utter expiration of air from the whole
heaven in the form of a slow breeze which might have
been likened to a death And now nothing was heard
in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove
in the spars and the rustle of thatch in the intervals
THE STORM

THE STORM -- THE TWO TOGETHER
A LIGHT flapped over the scene as if reflected from
phosphorescent wings crossing the sky and a rumble
filled the air It was the first move of the approaching
storm
The second peal was noisy with comparatively little
visible lightning Gabriel saw a candle shining in Bath+
