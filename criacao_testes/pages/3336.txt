115 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles

116 But though I be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have
been throughly made manifest among you in all things

117 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
exalted because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely
118 I robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service

119 And when I was present with you and wanted I was chargeable to
no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from
Macedonia supplied and in all things I have kept myself from being
burdensome unto you and so will I keep myself

1110 As the truth of Christ is in me no man shall stop me of this
boasting in the regions of Achaia

1111 Wherefore because I love you not God knoweth

1112 But what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from
them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found
even as we

1113 For such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ

1114 And no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
light

1115 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be
according to their works

1116 I say again Let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a
fool receive me that I may boast myself a little

1117 That which I speak I speak it not after the Lord but as it
were foolishly in this confidence of boasting

1118 Seeing that many glory after the flesh I will glory also

1119 For ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise

1120 For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour
you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you
on the face

1121 I speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold
also

1122 Are they Hebrews so am I Are they Israelites so am I Are
they the seed of Abraham so am I

1123 Are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more in
labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more
frequent in deaths oft

1124 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one

1125 Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned thrice I
suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deep 1126
In journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in
perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in
the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils
among false brethren 1127 In weariness and painfulness in watchings
often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness

1128 Beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me
daily the care of all the churches

1129 Who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not
1130 If I must needs glory I will glory of the things which concern
mine infirmities

1131 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed
for evermore knoweth that I lie not

1132 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of
the Damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me 1133 And
through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall and escaped
his hands

121 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord

122 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the
body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God
knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven

123 And I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body
I cannot tell God knoweth 124 How that he was caught up into
paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a
man to utter

125 Of such an one will I glory yet of myself I will not glory but
in mine infirmities

126 For though I would desire to glory I shall not be a fool for I
