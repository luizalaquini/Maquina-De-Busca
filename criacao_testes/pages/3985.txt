Not bright orange But soft Like the sunset I say At
least thats what you told me once
Oh He closes his eyes briefly maybe trying to
conjure up that sunset then nods his head Thank you
But more words tumble out Youre a painter Youre a
baker You like to sleep with the windows open You never
take sugar in your tea And you always double-knot your
shoelaces
Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid
like cry
In the morning Gale Finnick and I go out to shoot
some glass off the buildings for the camera crew When we
get back to camp Peetas sitting in a circle with the
soldiers from 13 who are armed but talking openly with
him Jackson has devised a game called Real or Not
Real to help Peeta He mentions something he thinks
happened and they tell him if its true or imagined usually
followed by a brief explanation
Most of the people from Twelve were killed in the fire
Real Less than nine hundred of you made it to
Thirteen alive
The fire was my fault
Not real President Snow destroyed Twelve the way
he did Thirteen to send a message to the rebels
This seems like a good idea until I realize that Ill be the
only one who can confirm or deny most of what weighs on
him Jackson breaks us up into watches She matches up
Finnick Gale and me each with a soldier from 13 This
way Peeta will always have access to someone who knows
him more personally Its not a steady conversation Peeta
spends a long time considering even small pieces of
information like where people bought their soap back
home Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about 12 Finnick is
the expert on both of Peetas Games as he was a mentor
in the first and a tribute in the second But since Peetas
greatest confusion centers around me--and not everything
can be explained simply--our exchanges are painful and
loaded even though we touch on only the most superficial
of details The color of my dress in 7 My preference for
cheese buns The name of our math teacher when we were
little Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciating
Perhaps it isnt even possible after what Snow did to him
But it does feel right to help him try
The next afternoon were notified that the whole squad
is needed to stage a fairly complicated propo Peetas
been right about one thing Coin and Plutarch are unhappy
with the quality of footage theyre getting from the Star
Squad Very dull Very uninspiring The obvious response
is that they never let us do anything but playact with our
guns However this is not about defending ourselves its
about coming up with a usable product So today a special
block has been set aside for filming It even has a couple of
active pods on it One unleashes a spray of gunfire The
other nets the invader and traps them for either
interrogation or execution depending on the captors
preference But its still an unimportant residential block
with nothing of strategic consequence
The television crew means to provide a sense of
heightened jeopardy by releasing smoke bombs and
adding gunfire sound effects We suit up in heavy protective
gear even the crew as if were heading into the heart of
battle Those of us with specialty weapons are allowed to
take them along with our guns Boggs gives Peeta back his
gun too although he makes sure to tell him in a loud voice
that its only loaded with blanks
Peeta just shrugs Im not much of a shot anyway He
seems preoccupied with watching Pollux to the point
where its getting a little worrisome when he finally puzzles
it out and begins to speak with agitation Youre an Avox
arent you I can tell by the way you swallow There were
two Avoxes with me in prison Darius and Lavinia but the
guards mostly called them the redheads Theyd been our
servants in the Training Center so they arrested them too I
watched them being tortured to death She was lucky They
used too much voltage and her heart stopped right off It
took days to finish him off Beating cutting off parts They
kept asking him questions but he couldnt speak he just
made these horrible animal sounds They didnt want
information you know They wanted me to see it
Peeta looks around at our stunned faces as if waiting
for a reply When none is forthcoming he asks Real or not
real The lack of response upsets him more Real or not
real he demands
Real says Boggs At least to the best of my
knowledgereal
Peeta sags I thought so There was nothingshiny
about it He wanders away from the group muttering
something about fingers and toes
I move to Gale press my forehead into the body armor
where his chest should be feel his arm tighten around me
We finally know the name of the girl who we watched the
Capitol abduct from the woods of 12 the fate of the
Peacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive This is no
time to call up happy moments of remembrance They lost
their lives because of me I add them to my personal list of
kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands
When I look up I see it has taken Gale differently His
expression says that there are not enough mountains to
crush enough cities to destroy It promises death
With Peetas grisly account fresh in our minds we
