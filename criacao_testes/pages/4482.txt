As to this of my cousins Tyrion went on we offer Harrion Karstark and Ser Wylis Manderly for Willem Lannister and Lord Cerwyn and Ser Donnel Locke for your brother Tion Tell Stark that two Lannisters are worth four northmen in any season He waited for the laughter to die His father’s bones he shall have as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith

Lord Stark asked for his sisters and his father’s sword as well Ser Cleos reminded him

Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute the hilt of Eddard Stark’s greatsword rising over one shoulder Ice said Tyrion He’ll have that when he makes his peace with us not before

As you say And his sisters

Tyrion glanced toward Sansa and felt a stab of pity as he said Until such time as he frees my brother Jaime unharmed they shall remain here as hostages How well they are treated depends on him And if the gods are good Bywater will find Arya alive before Robb learns she’s gone missing

I shall bring him your message my lord

Tyrion plucked at one of the twisted blades that sprang from the arm of the throne And now the thrust Vylarr he called

My lord

The men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddard’s bones but a Lannister should have a Lannister escort Tyrion declared Ser Cleos is the queen’s cousin and mine We shall sleep more easily if you would see him safely back to Riverrun

As you command How many men should I take

Why all of them

Vylarr stood like a man made of stone It was Grand Maester Pycelle who rose gasping My lord Hand that cannot    your father Lord Tywin himself he sent these good men to our city to protect Queen Cersei and her children   

The Kingsguard and the City Watch protect them well enough The gods speed you on your way Vylarr

At the council table Varys smiled knowingly Littlefinger sat feigning boredom and Pycelle gaped like a fish pale and confused A herald stepped forward If any man has other matters to set before the King’s Hand let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence

I will be heard A slender man all in black pushed his way between the Redwyne twins

Ser Alliser Tyrion exclaimed Why I had no notion that you’d come to court You should have sent me word

I have as well you know Thorne was as prickly as his name a spare sharp-featured man of fifty hard-eyed and hard-handed his black hair streaked with grey I have been shunned ignored and left to wait like some baseborn servant

Truly Bronn this was not well done Ser Alliser and I are old friends We walked the Wall together

Sweet Ser Alliser murmured Varys you must not think too harshly of us So many seek our Joffrey’s grace in these troubled and tumultuous times

More troubled than you know eunuch

To his face we call him Lord Eunuch quipped Littlefinger

How may we be of help to you good brother Grand Maester Pycelle asked in soothing tones

The Lord Commander sent me to His Grace the king Thorne answered The matter is too grave to be left to servants

The king is playing with his new crossbow Tyrion said Ridding himself of Joffrey had required only an ungainly Myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time and nothing would do but that he try it at once You can speak to servants or hold your silence

As you will Ser Alliser said displeasure in every word I am sent to tell you that we found two rangers long missing They were dead yet when we brought the corpses back to the Wall they rose again in the night One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander

Distantly Tyrion heard someone snigger Does he mean to mock me with this folly He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys Littlefinger and Pycelle wondering if one of them had a role in this A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him he was doomed And yet    and yet   

Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he’d stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world gazing out at the trackless dark beyond He had felt—what—something to be sure a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind A wolf had howled off in the night and the sound had sent a shiver through him

Don’t be a fool he told himself A wolf a wind a dark forest it meant nothing And yet    He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black I trust that the Old Bear survived this attack

He did

And that your brothers killed these ah dead men

We did

You’re certain that they are dead this time Tyrion asked mildly When Bronn choked on a snort of laughter he knew how he must proceed Truly truly dead

They were dead the first time Ser Alliser snapped Pale and cold with black hands and feet I brought Jared’s hand torn from his corpse by the bastard’s wolf

Littlefinger stirred And where is this charming token

Ser Alliser frowned uncomfortably It    rotted to pieces while I waited unheard There’s naught left to show but bones

Titters echoed through the hall Lord Baelish Tyrion called down to Littlefinger buy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him

Spades Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously

If you bury your dead they won’t come walking Tyrion told him and the court laughed openly Spades will end your troubles with some strong backs to wield them Ser Jacelyn see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons

Ser Jacelyn Bywater said As you will my lord but the cells are near empty Yoren took all the likely men

Arrest some more then Tyrion told him Or spread the word that there’s bread and turnips on the Wall and they’ll go of their own accord The city had too many mouths to feed and the Night’s Watch a perpetual need of men At Tyrion’s signal the herald cried an end and the hall began to empty

Ser Alliser Thorne was not so easily dismissed He was waiting at the foot of the Iron Throne when Tyrion descended Do you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to be mocked by the likes of you he fumed blocking the way This is no jape I saw it with my own eyes I tell you the dead walk

You should try to kill them more thoroughly Tyrion pushed past Ser Alliser made to grab his sleeve but Preston Greenfield thrust him back No closer ser

Thorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the Kingsguard You are a fool Imp he shouted at Tyrion’s back

The dwarf turned to face him Me Truly Then why were they laughing at you I wonder He smiled wanly You came for men did you not

The cold winds are rising The Wall must be held

And to hold it you need men which I’ve given you    as you might have noted if your ears heard anything but insults Take them thank me and begone before I’m forced to take a crab fork to you again Give my warm regards to Lord Mormont    and to Jon Snow as well Bronn seized Ser Alliser by the elbow and marched him forcefully from the hall

Grand Maester Pycelle had already scuttled off but Varys and Littlefinger had watched it all start to finish I grow ever more admiring of you my lord confessed the eunuch You appease the Stark boy with his father’s bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke You give that black brother the men he seeks rid the city of some hungry mouths yet make it all seem mockery so none may say that the dwarf fears snarks and grumkins Oh deftly done

Littlefinger stroked his beard Do you truly mean to send away all your guards Lannister

No I mean to send away all my sister’s guards

The queen will never allow that
