Aye lad said Tom Sevenstrings and more’s the pity He plucked a sad chord from his harp

Arya didn’t think they were king’s men at all They looked more like outlaws all tattered and ragged They didn’t even have horses to ride King’s men would have had horses

But Hot Pie piped up eagerly We’re looking for Riverrun he said How many days’ ride is it do you know

Arya could have killed him You be quiet or I’ll stuff rocks in your big stupid mouth

Riverrun is a long way upstream said Tom A long hungry way Might be you’d like a hot meal before you set out There’s an inn not far ahead kept by some friends of ours We could share some ale and a bite of bread instead of fighting one another

An inn The thought of hot food made Arya’s belly rumble but she didn’t trust this Tom Not everyone who spoke you friendly was really your friend It’s near you say

Two miles upstream said Tom A league at most

Gendry looked as uncertain as she felt What do you mean friends he asked warily

Friends Have you forgotten what friends are

Sharna is the innkeep’s name Tom put in She has a sharp tongue and a fierce eye I’ll grant you that but her heart’s a good one and she’s fond of little girls

I’m not a little girl she said angrily Who else is there You said friends

Sharna’s husband and an orphan boy they took in They won’t harm you There’s ale if you think you’re old enough Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat Tom glanced toward the cottage And whatever you stole from Old Pate’s garden besides

We never stole said Arya

Are you Old Pate’s daughter then A sister A wife Tell me no lies Squab I buried Old Pate myself right there under that willow where you were hiding and you don’t have his look He drew a sad sound from his harp We’ve buried many a good man this past year but we’ve no wish to bury you I swear it on my harp Archer show her

The archer’s hand moved quicker than Arya would have believed His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried itself in the trunk of the willow behind her By then the bowman had a second arrow notched and drawn She’d thought she understood what Syrio meant by quick as a snake and smooth as summer silk but now she knew she hadn’t The arrow thrummed behind her like a bee You missed she said

More fool you if you think so said Anguy They go where I send them

That they do agreed Lem Lemoncloak

There were a dozen steps between the archer and the point of her sword We have no chance Arya realized wishing she had a bow like his and the skill to use it Glumly she lowered her heavy longsword till the point touched the ground We’ll come see this inn she conceded trying to hide the doubt in her heart behind bold words You walk in front and we’ll ride behind so we can see what you’re doing

Tom Sevenstrings bowed deeply and said Before behind it makes no matter Come along lads let’s show them the way Anguy best pull up those arrows we won’t be needing them here

Arya sheathed her sword and crossed the road to where her friends sat on their horses keeping her distance from the three strangers Hot Pie get those cabbages she said as she vaulted into her saddle And the carrots too

For once he did not argue They set off as she had wanted walking their horses slowly down the rutted road a dozen paces behind the three on foot But before very long somehow they were riding right on top of them Tom Sevenstrings walked slowly and liked to strum his woodharp as he went Do you know any songs he asked them I’d dearly love someone to sing with that I would Lem can’t carry a tune and our longbow lad only knows marcher ballads every one of them a hundred verses long

We sing real songs in the marches Anguy said mildly

Singing is stupid said Arya Singing makes noise We heard you a long way off We could have killed you

Tom’s smile said he did not think so There are worse things than dying with a song on your lips

If there were wolves hereabouts we’d know it groused Lem Or lions These are our woods

You never knew we were there said Gendry

Now lad you shouldn’t be so certain of that said Tom Sometimes a man knows more than he says

Hot Pie shifted his seat I know the song about the bear he said Some of it anyhow

Tom ran his fingers down his strings Then let’s hear it pie boy He threw back his head and sang A bear there was a bear a bear All black and brown and covered with hair   

Hot Pie joined in lustily even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes Arya stared at him in astonishment He had a good voice and he sang well He never did anything well except bake she thought to herself

A small brook flowed into the Trident a little farther on As they waded across their singing flushed a duck from among the reeds Anguy stopped where he stood unslung his bow notched an arrow and brought it down The bird fell in the shallows not far from the bank Lem took off his yellow cloak and waded in knee-deep to retrieve it complaining all the while Do you think Sharna might have lemons down in that cellar of hers said Anguy to Tom as they watched Lem splash around cursing A Dornish girl once cooked me duck with lemons He sounded wistful

Tom and Hot Pie resumed their song on the other side of the brook with the duck hanging from Lem’s belt beneath his yellow cloak Somehow the singing made the miles seem shorter It was not very long at all until the inn appeared before them rising from the riverbank where the Trident made a great bend to the north Arya squinted at it suspiciously as they neared It did not look like an outlaws’ lair she had to admit it looked friendly even homey with its whitewashed upper story and slate roof and the smoke curling up lazy from its chimney Stables and other outbuildings surrounded it and there was an arbor in back and apple trees a small garden The inn even had its own dock thrusting out into the river and   

Gendry she called her voice low and urgent They have a boat We could sail the rest of the way up to Riverrun It would be faster than riding I think

He looked dubious Did you ever sail a boat

You put up the sail she said and the wind pushes it

What if the wind is blowing the wrong way

Then there’s oars to row

Against the current Gendry frowned Wouldn’t that be slow And what if the boat tips over and we fall into the water It’s not our boat anyway it’s the inn’s

We could take it Arya chewed her lip and said nothing They dismounted in front of stables There were no other horses to be seen but Arya noticed fresh manure in many of the stalls One of us should watch the horses she said wary

Tom overheard her There’s no need for that Squab Come eat they’ll be safe enough

I’ll stay Gendry said ignoring the singer You can come get me after you’ve had some food

Nodding Arya set off after Hot Pie and Lem Her sword was still in its sheath across her back and she kept a hand close to the hilt of the dagger she had stolen from Roose Bolton in case she didn’t like whatever they found within

The painted sign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees Inside was the common room where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her hands on her hips glaring Don’t just stand there boy she snapped Or are you a girl Either one you’re blocking my door Get in or get out Lem what did I tell you about my floor You’re all mud

We shot a duck Lem held it out like a peace banner

The woman snatched it from his hand Anguy shot a duck is what you’re meaning Get your boots off are you deaf or just stupid She turned away Husband she called loudly Get up here the lads are back Husband

Up the cellar steps came a man in a stained apron grumbling He was a head shorter than the woman with a lumpy face and loose yellowish skin that still showed the marks of some pox I’m here woman quit your bellowing What is it now

Hang this she said handing him the duck

Anguy shuffled his feet We were thinking we might eat it Sharna With lemons If you had some

Lemons And where would we get lemons Does this look like Dorne to you you freckled fool Why don’t you hop out back to the lemon trees and pick us a bushel and some nice olives and pomegranates too She shook a finger at him Now I suppose I could cook it with Lem’s cloak if you like but not till it’s hung for a few days You’ll eat rabbit or you won’t eat Roast rabbit on a spit would be quickest if you’ve got a hunger Or might be you’d like it stewed with ale and onions

Arya could almost taste the rabbit We have no coin but we brought some carrots and cabbages we could trade you
