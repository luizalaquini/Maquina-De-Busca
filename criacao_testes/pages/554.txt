And your own House Beth is the last of your blood

The old knight drew himself up straight I offer myself in my daughter’s place Release her and take me as your hostage Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a child

Not to me A valiant gesture old man but I am not that great a fool Not to Lord Manderly or Leobald Tallhart either I’d wager Your sorry old skin is worth no more to them than any other man’s No I’ll keep the girl… and keep her safe so long as you do as I’ve commanded you Her life is in your hands

Gods be good Theon how can you do this You know I must attack have sworn…

If this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets Beth will hang said Theon Another hostage will follow her to the grave at first light and another at sunset Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death until you are gone I have no lack of hostages He did not wait for a reply but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle He went slowly at first but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter The small heads watched him come from their spikes their tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard between them stood little Beth Cassel noosed and crying Theon put his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop Smiler’s hooves clattered on the drawbridge like drumbeats

In the yard he dismounted and handed his reins to Wex It may stay them he told Black Lorren We’ll know by sunset Take the girl in till then and keep her somewhere safe Under the layers of leather steel and wool he was slick with sweat I need a cup of wine A vat of wine would do even better

A fire had been laid in Ned Stark’s bedchamber Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults a wine as sour as his mood They will attack he thought gloomily staring at the flames Ser Rodrik loves his daughter but he is still castellan and most of all a knight Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without the warhorns would already have sounded the attack he had no doubt He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff though he was not certain they would prove soft enough

If not if the old man gave the command to storm the castle regardless Winterfell would fall Theon entertained no delusions on that count His seventeen might kill three four five times their own number but in the end they would be overwhelmed

Theon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet brooding on the injustice of it all I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood he muttered He had been frightened that night but not like this It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends and another to perish alone and despised Mercy he thought miserably

When the wine brought no solace Theon sent Wex to fetch his bow and took himself to the old inner ward There he stood loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round I saved Bran’s life with this bow he reminded himself Would that I could save my own Women came to the well but did not linger whatever they saw on Theon’s face sent them away quickly

Behind him the broken tower stood its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago As the sun moved the shadow of the tower moved as well gradually lengthening a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy By the time the sun touched the wall he was in its grasp If I hang the girl the northmen will attack at once he thought as he loosed a shaft If I do not hang her they will know my threats are empty He knocked another arrow to his bow There is no way out none

If you had a hundred archers as good as yourself you might have a chance to hold the castle a voice said softly

When he turned Maester Luwin was behind him Go away Theon told him I have had enough of your counsel

And life Have you had enough of that my lord prince

He raised the bow One more word and I’ll put this shaft through your heart

You won’t

Theon bent the bow drawing the grey goose feathers back to his cheek Care to make a wager

I am your last hope Theon

I have no hope he thought Yet he lowered the bow half an inch and said I will not run

I do not speak of running Take the black

The Night’s Watch Theon let the bow unbend slowly and pointed the arrow at the ground

Ser Rodrik has served House Stark all his life and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch He will not deny you Open your gates lay down your arms accept his terms and he must let you take the black

A brother of the Night’s Watch It meant no crown no sons no wife… but it meant life and life with honor Ned Stark’s own brother had chosen the Watch and Jon Snow as well

I have black garb aplenty once I tear the krakens off Even my horse is black I could rise high in the Watch—chief of rangers likely even Lord Commander Let Asha keep the bloody islands they’re as dreary as she is If I served at Eastwatch I could command my own ship and there’s fine hunting beyond the Wall As for women what wildling woman wouldn’t want a prince in her bed A slow smile crept across his face A black cloak can’t be turned I’d be as good as any man…

PRINCE THEON The sudden shout shattered his daydream Kromm was loping across the ward The northmen—

He felt a sudden sick sense of dread Is it the attack

Maester Luwin clutched his arm There’s still time Raise a peace banner—
