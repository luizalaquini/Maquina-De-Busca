That was why they’d needed the wayn and the pickled pigs’ feet I’m not going to be dragged before your brother in chains the Hound had told her and I’d just as soon not have to cut through his men to get to him So we play a little game

A farmer chance-met on the kingsroad had provided them with wayn horses garb and casks though not willingly The Hound had taken them at swordpoint When the farmer cursed him for a robber he said No a forager Be grateful you get to keep your smallclothes Now take those boots off Or I’ll take your legs off Your choice The farmer was as big as Clegane but all the same he chose to give up his boots and keep his legs

Evenfall found them still trudging toward the Green Fork and Lord Frey’s twin castles I am almost there Arya thought She knew she ought to be excited but her belly was all knotted up tight Maybe that was just the fever she’d been fighting but maybe not Last night she’d had a bad dream a terrible dream She couldn’t remember what she’d dreamed of now but the feeling had lingered all day If anything it had only gotten stronger Fear cuts deeper than swords She had to be strong now the way her father told her There was nothing between her and her mother but a castle gate a river and an army    but it was Robb’s army so there was no real danger there Was there

Roose Bolton was one of them though The Leech Lord as the outlaws called him That made her uneasy She had fled Harrenhal to get away from Bolton as much as from the Bloody Mummers and she’d had to cut the throat of one of his guards to escape Did he know she’d done that Or did he blame Gendry or Hot Pie Would he have told her mother What would he do if he saw her He probably won’t even know me She looked more like a drowned rat than a lord’s cupbearer these days A drowned boy rat The Hound had hacked handfuls of her hair off only two days past He was an even worse barber than Yoren and he’d left her half bald on one side Robb won’t know me either I bet Or even Mother She had been a little girl the last time she saw them the day Lord Eddard Stark left Winterfell

They heard the music before they saw the castle the distant rattle of drums the brazen blare of horns the thin skirling of pipes faint beneath the growl of the river and the sound of the rain beating on their heads We’ve missed the wedding the Hound said but it sounds as though the feast is still going I’ll be rid of you soon

No I’ll be rid of you Arya thought

The road had been running mostly northwest but now it turned due west between an apple orchard and a field of drowned corn beaten down by the rain They passed the last of the apple trees and crested a rise and the castles river and camps all appeared at once There were hundreds of horses and thousands of men most of them milling about the three huge feast tents that stood side by side facing the castle gates like three great canvas longhalls Robb had made his camp well back from the walls on higher drier ground but the Green Fork had overflown its bank and even claimed a few carelessly placed tents

The music from the castles was louder here The sound of the drums and horns rolled across the camp The musicians in the nearer castle were playing a different song than the ones in the castle on the far bank though so it sounded more like a battle than a song They’re not very good Arya observed

The Hound made a sound that might have been a laugh There’s old deaf women in Lannisport complaining of the din I’ll warrant I’d heard Walder Frey’s eyes were failing but no one mentioned his bloody ears

Arya found herself wishing it were day If the sun was out and the wind was blowing she would have been able to see the banners better She would have looked for the direwolf of Stark or maybe the Cerwyn battleaxe or the Glover fist But in the gloom of night all the colors looked grey The rain had dwindled down to a fine drizzle almost a mist but an earlier downpour had left the banners wet as dishrags sodden and unreadable

A hedge of wagons and carts had been drawn up along the perimeter to make a crude wooden wall against any attack That was where the guards stopped them The lantern their sergeant carried shed enough light for Arya to see that his cloak was a pale pink spotted with red teardrops The men under him had the Leech Lord’s badge sewn over their hearts the flayed man of the Dreadfort Sandor Clegane gave them the same tale he’d used on the outriders but the Bolton sergeant was a harder sort of nut than Ser Donnel Haigh had been Salt pork’s no fit meat for a lord’s wedding feast he said scornfully

Got pickled pigs’ feet too ser

Not for the feast you don’t The feast’s half done And I’m a northman not some milksuck southron knight

I was told to see the steward or the cook   

Castle’s closed The lordlings are not to be disturbed The sergeant considered a moment You can unload by the feast tents there He pointed with a mailed hand Ale makes a man hungry and old Frey won’t miss a few pigs’ feet He don’t have the teeth for such anyhow Ask for Sedgekins he’ll know what’s to be done with you He barked a command and his men rolled one of the wagons aside for them to enter

The Hound’s whip spurred the team toward the tents No one seemed to pay them any mind They splashed past rows of brightly colored pavilions their walls of wet silk lit up like magic lanterns by lamps and braziers inside pink and gold and green they glimmered striped and fretty and chequy emblazoned with birds and beasts chevrons and stars wheels and weapons Arya spotted a yellow tent with six acrons on its panels three over two over one Lord Smallwood she knew remembering Acorn Hall so far away and the lady who’d said she was pretty

But for every shimmering silk pavilion there were two dozen of felt or canvas opaque and dark There were barracks tents too big enough to shelter two score footsoldiers though even those were dwarfed by the three great feast tents The drinking had been going on for hours it seemed Arya heard shouted toasts and the clash of cups mixed in with all the usual camp sounds horses whinnying and dogs barking wagons rumbling through the dark laughter and curses the clank and clatter of steel and wood The music grew still louder as they approached the castle but under that was a deeper darker sound the river the swollen Green Fork growling like a lion in its den

Arya twisted and turned trying to look everywhere at once hoping for a glimpse of a direwolf badge for a tent done up in grey and white for a face she knew from Winterfell All she saw were strangers She stared at a man relieving himself in the reeds but he wasn’t Alebelly She saw a half-dressed girl burst from a tent laughing but the tent was pale blue not grey like she’d thought at first and the man who went running after her wore a treecat on his doublet not a wolf Beneath a tree four archers were slipping waxed strings over the notches of their longbows but they were not her father’s archers A maester crossed their path but he was too young and thin to be Maester Luwin Arya gazed up at the Twins their high tower windows glowing softly wherever a light was burning Through the haze of rain the castles looked spooky and mysterious like something from one of Old Nan’s tales but they weren’t Winterfell

The press was thickest at the feast tents The wide flaps were tied back and men were pushing in and out with drinking horns and tankards in their hands some with camp followers Arya glanced inside as the Hound drove past the first of the three and saw hundreds of men crowding the benches and jostling around the casks of mead and ale and wine There was hardly room to move inside but none of them seemed to mind At least they were warm and dry Cold wet Arya envied them Some were even singing The fine misty rain was steaming all around the door from the heat escaping from inside Here’s to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin she heard a voice shout They all drank and someone yelled Here’s to the Young Wolf and Queen Jeyne

Who is Queen Jeyne Arya wondered briefly The only queen she knew was Cersei

Firepits had been dug outside the feast tents sheltered beneath rude canopies of woven wood and hides that kept the rain out so long as it fell straight down The wind was blowing off the river though so the drizzle came in anyway enough to make the fires hiss and swirl Serving men were turning joints of meat on spits above the flames The smells made Arya’s mouth water Shouldn’t we stop she asked Sandor Clegane There’s northmen in the tents She knew them by their beards by their faces by their cloaks of bearskin and sealskin by their half-heard toasts and the songs they sang Karstarks and Umbers and men of the mountain clans I bet there are Winterfell men too Her father’s men the Young Wolf’s men the direwolves of Stark

Your brother will be in the castle he said Your mother too You want them or not

Yes she said What about Sedgekins The sergeant had told them to ask for Sedgekins

Sedgekins can bugger himself with a hot poker Clegane shook out his whip and sent it hissing through the soft rain to bite at a horse’s flank It’s your bloody brother I want





CATELYN

The drums were pounding pounding pounding and her head with them Pipes wailed and flutes trilled from the musicians’ gallery at the foot of the hall fiddles screeched horns blew the skins skirled a lively tune but the drumming drove them all The sounds echoed off the rafters whilst the guests ate drank and shouted at one another below Walder Frey must be deaf as a stone to call this music Catelyn sipped a cup of wine and watched Jinglebell prance to the sounds of Alysanne At least she thought it was meant to be Alysanne With these players it might as easily have been The Bear and the Maiden Fair

Outside the rain still fell but within the Twins the air was thick and hot A fire roared in the hearth and rows of torches burned smokily from iron sconces on the walls Yet most of the heat came off the bodies of the wedding guests jammed in so thick along the benches that every man who tried to lift his cup poked his neighbor in the ribs

Even on the dais they were closer than Catelyn would have liked She had been placed between Ser Ryman Frey and Roose Bolton and had gotten a good noseful of both Ser Ryman drank as if Westeros was about to run short of wine and sweated it all out under his arms He had bathed in lemonwater she judged but no lemon could mask so much sour sweat Roose Bolton had a sweeter smell to him yet no more pleasant He sipped hippocras in preference to wine or mead and ate but little

Catelyn could not fault him for his lack of appetite The wedding feast began with a thin leek soup followed by a salad of green beans onions and beets river pike poached in almond milk mounds of mashed turnips that were cold before they reached the table jellied calves’ brains and a leche of stringy beef It was poor fare to set before a king and the calves’ brains turned Catelyn’s stomach Yet Robb ate it uncomplaining and her brother was too caught up with his bride to pay much attention

You would never guess Edmure complained of Roslin all the way from Riverrun to the Twins Husband and wife ate from a single plate drank from a single cup and exchanged chaste kisses between sips Most of the dishes Edmure waved away She could not blame him for that She remembered little of the food served at her own wedding feast Did I even taste it Or spend the whole time gazing at Ned’s face wondering who he was

Poor Roslin’s smile had a fixed quality to it as if someone had sewn it onto her face Well she is a maid wedded but the bedding’s yet to come No doubt she’s as terrified as I was Robb was seated between Alyx Frey and Fair Walda two of the more nubile Frey maidens At the wedding feast I hope you will not refuse to dance with my daughters Walder Frey had said It would please an old man’s heart His heart should be well pleased then Robb had done his duty like a king He had danced with each of the girls with Edmure’s bride and the eighth Lady Frey with the widow Ami and Roose Bolton’s wife Fat Walda with the pimply twins Serra and Sarra even with Shirei Lord Walder’s youngest who must have been all of six Catelyn wondered whether the Lord of the Crossing would be satisfied or if he would find cause for complaint in all the other daughters and granddaughters who had not had a turn with the king Your sisters dance very well she said to Ser Ryman Frey trying to be pleasant

They’re aunts and cousins Ser Ryman drank a swallow of wine the sweat trickling down his cheek into his beard

A sour man and in his cups Catelyn thought The Late Lord Frey might be niggardly when it came to feeding his guests but he did not stint on the drink The ale wine and mead were flowing as fast as the river outside The Greatjon was already roaring drunk Lord Walder’s son Merrett was matching him cup for cup but Ser Whalen Frey had passed out trying to keep up with the two of them Catelyn would sooner Lord Umber had seen fit to stay sober but telling the Greatjon not to drink was like telling him not to breathe for a few hours

Smalljon Umber and Robin Flint sat near Robb to the other side of Fair Walda and Alyx respectively Neither of them was drinking along with Patrek Mallister and Dacey Mormont they were her son’s guards this evening A wedding feast was not a battle but there were always dangers when men were in their cups and a king should never be unguarded Catelyn was glad of that and even more glad of the swordbelts hanging on pegs along the walls No man needs a longsword to deal with jellied calves’ brains

Everyone thought my lord would choose Fair Walda Lady Walda Bolton told Ser Wendel shouting to be heard above the music Fat Walda was a round pink butterball of a girl with watery blue eyes limp yellow hair and a huge bosom yet her voice was a fluttering squeak It was hard to picture her in the Dreadfort in her pink lace and cape of vair My lord grandfather offered Roose his bride’s weight in silver as a dowry though so my lord of Bolton picked me The girl’s chins jiggled when she laughed I weigh six stone more than Fair Walda but that was the first time I was glad of it I’m Lady Bolton now and my cousin’s still a maid and she’ll be nineteen soon poor thing

The Lord of the Dreadfort paid the chatter no mind Catelyn saw Sometimes he tasted a bite of this a spoon of that tearing bread from the loaf with short strong fingers but the meal could not distract him Bolton had made a toast to Lord Walder’s grandsons when the wedding feast began pointedly mentioning that Walder and Walder were in the care of his bastard son From the way the old man had squinted at him his mouth sucking at the air Catelyn knew he had heard the unspoken threat

Was there ever a wedding less joyful she wondered until she remembered her poor Sansa and her marriage to the Imp Mother take mercy on her She has a gentle soul The heat and smoke and noise were making her sick The musicians in the gallery might be numerous and loud but they were not especially gifted Catelyn took another swallow of wine and allowed a page to refill her cup A few more hours and the worst will be over By this hour tomorrow Robb would be off to another battle this time with the ironmen at Moat Cailin Strange how that prospect seemed almost a relief He will win his battle He wins all his battles and the ironborn are without a king Besides Ned taught him well The drums were pounding Jinglebell hopped past her once again but the music was so loud she could scarcely hear his bells

Above the din came a sudden snarling as two dogs fell upon each other over a scrap of meat They rolled across the floor snapping and biting as a howl of mirth went up Someone doused them with a flagon of ale and they broke apart One limped toward the dais Lord Walder’s toothless mouth opened in a bark of laughter as the dripping wet dog shook ale and hair all over three of his grandsons

The sight of the dogs made Catelyn wish once more for Grey Wind but Robb’s direwolf was nowhere to be seen Lord Walder had refused to allow him in the hall Your wild beast has a taste for human flesh I hear heh the old man had said Rips out throats yes I’ll have no such creature at my Roslin’s feast amongst women and little ones all my sweet innocents

Grey Wind is no danger to them my lord Robb protested Not so long as I am there

You were there at my gates were you not When the wolf attacked the grandsons I sent to greet you I heard all about that don’t think I didn’t heh

No harm was done—

No harm the king says No harm Petyr fell from his horse fell I lost a wife the same way falling His mouth worked in and out Or was she just some strumpet Bastard Walder’s mother yes now I recall She fell off her horse and cracked her head What would Your Grace do if Petyr had broken his neck heh Give me another apology in place of a grandson No no no Might be you’re king I won’t say you’re not the King in the North heh but under my roof my rule Have your wolf or have your wedding sire You’ll not have both

Catelyn could tell that her son was furious but he yielded with as much courtesy as he could summon If it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots he’d told her I’ll eat it and ask for a second bowl And so he had

The Greatjon had drunk another of Lord Walder’s brood under the table Petyr Pimple this time The lad has a third his capacity what did he expect Lord Umber wiped his mouth stood and began to sing A bear there was a bear a BEAR All black and brown and covered with hair His voice was not at all bad though somewhat thick from drink Unfortunately the fiddlers and drummers and flutists up above were playing Flowers of Spring which suited the words of The Bear and the Maiden Fair as well as snails might suit a bowl of porridge Even poor Jinglebell covered his ears at the cacophony

Roose Bolton murmured some words too soft to hear and went off in search of a privy The cramped hall was in a constant uproar of guests and servants coming and going A second feast for knights and lords of somewhat lesser rank was roaring along in the other castle she knew Lord Walder had exiled his baseborn children and their offspring to that side of the river so that Robb’s northmen had taken to referring to it as the bastard feast Some guests were no doubt stealing off to see if the bastards were having a better time than they were Some might even be venturing as far as the camps The Freys had provided wagons of wine ale and mead so the common soldiers could drink to the wedding of Riverrun and the Twins

Robb sat down in Bolton’s vacant place A few more hours and this farce is done Mother he said in a low voice as the Greatjon sang of the maid with honey in her hair Black Walder’s been mild as a lamb for once And Uncle Edmure seems well content in his bride He leaned across her Ser Ryman

Ser Ryman Frey blinked and said Sire Yes
