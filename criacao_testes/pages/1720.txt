before I must be moving and when theres tunes
going on I seem as if hung in wires If I thought after
Id left that music was still playing and I not there I
should be quite melancholy-like
  Whats yer hurry then Laban inquired Coggan+
You used to bide as late as the latest
  Well ye see neighbours I was lately married to a
woman and shes my vocation now and so ye see --  -- 
The young man hated lamely
  New Lords new laws as the saying is I suppose
remarked Coggan
  Ay a blieve -- ha ha said Susan Talls husband
in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of
jokes without minding them at all   The young man
then wished them good-night and withdrew
  Henery Fray was the first to follow Then Gabriel
arose and went off with Jan Coggan who had offered
him a lodging A few minutes later when the remaining
ones were on their legs and about to depart Fray came
back again in a hurry Flourishing his finger ominously
he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just -- where his eye
alighted by accident which happened to be in Joseph
Poorgrasss face
P 117
  O -- whats the matter whats the matter Henery
said Joseph starting back
  Whats a-brewing Henrey asked Jacob and Mark
Clark
  Baily Pennyways -- Baily Pennyways -- I said so yes
I said so
  What found out stealing anything
  Stealing it is The news is that after Miss
Everdene got home she went out again to see all was
safe as she usually do and coming in found Baily
Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a
a bushel of barley She fleed at him  like a cat -- never
such a tomboy as she is -- of course I speak with closed
doors
  You do -- you do Henery
  She fleed at him and to cut a long story short
he owned to having carried off five sack altogether upon
her promising not to persecute him Well hes turned
out neck and crop and my question is whos going to
be baily now
  The question was such a profound one that Henery
was obliged to drink there and then from the large
cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside Before
he had replaced it on the table in came the young man
Susan Talls husband in a still greater hurry
  Have ye heard the news thats all over parish
  About Baily Pennyways
  But besides that
  No -- not a morsel of it they replied looking into
the very midst of Laban Tall as if to meet his words
half-way down his throat
  What a night of horrors murmured Joseph Poor+
grass waving his hands spasmodically Ive had the
news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
murder and Ive seen a magpie all alone
  Fanny Robin -- Miss everdenes youngest servant --
cant be found Theyve been wanting to lock up the
door these two hours but she isnt come in And they
dont know what to do about going to hed for fear of
locking her out They wouldnt be so concerned if she
hadnt been noticed in such low spirits
P 118
these last few
days and Maryann dthink the beginning of a crowners
inquest has happened to the poor girl
  O -- tis burned -- tis burned came from Joseph
Poorgrasss dry lips
  No -- tis drowned said Tall
  Or tis her fathers razor suggested Billy Smallbury
with a vivid sense of detail
  Well -- Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two
of us before we go to bed What with this trouble about
the baily and now about the girl misess is almost wild
  They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse
excepting the old maltster whom neither news fire
rain nor thunder could draw from his hole There as
the others footsteps died away he sat down again and
continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red
bleared eyes
  From the bedroom window above their heads Bath+
shebas head and shoulders robed in mystic white were
dimly seen extended into the air
  Are any of my men among you she said anxiously
  Yes maam several said Susan Talls husband
  Tomorrow morning I wish two or three of you to
make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen
such a person as Fanny Robin Do it quietly there is
no reason for alarm as yet She must have left whilst
we were all at the fire
  I beg yer pardon but had she any young man court+
ing her in the parish maam asked Jacob Smallbury
  I dont know said Bathsheba
  Ive never heard of any such thing maam said
two or three
  It is hardly likely either continued Bathsheba
For any lover of hers might have come to the house if
