and singleness of heart 247 Praising God and having favour with all
the people And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be
saved

31 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer being the ninth hour

32 And a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom
they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful
to ask alms of them that entered into the temple 33 Who seeing Peter
and John about to go into the temple asked an alms

34 And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said Look on
us

35 And he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of
them

36 Then Peter said Silver and gold have I none but such as I have
give I thee In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk

37 And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength

38 And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into
the temple walking and leaping and praising God

39 And all the people saw him walking and praising God 310 And they
knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the
temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which
had happened unto him

311 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomons
greatly wondering

312 And when Peter saw it he answered unto the people Ye men of
Israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk
313 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our
fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus whom ye delivered up and
denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let
him go

314 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you 315 And killed the Prince of life whom God
hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses

316 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong
whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him
this perfect soundness in the presence of you all

317 And now brethren I wot that through ignorance ye did it as did
also your rulers

318 But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled

319 Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be
blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
of the Lord

320 And he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto
you 321 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began

322 For Moses truly said unto the fathers A prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you

323 And it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear
that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people

324 Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days

325 Ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which
God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham And in thy seed shall
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed

326 Unto you first God having raised up his Son Jesus sent him to
bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities

41 And as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of
the temple and the Sadducees came upon them 42 Being grieved that
they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection
from the dead

43 And they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next
day for it was now eventide

44 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number
of the men was about five thousand

45 And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders
and scribes 46 And Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John
and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest
were gathered together at Jerusalem
