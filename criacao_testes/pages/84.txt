Pycelle wrinkled his brow In the last stage of his fever the Hand called out the name Robert several times but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom for fear that he too might be taken ill The king did come and he sat beside the bed for hours talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon’s spirits His love was fierce to see

Was there nothing else No final words

When I saw that all hope had fled I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy so he should not suffer Just before he closed his eyes for the last time he whispered something to the king and his lady wife a blessing for his son The seed is strong he said At the end his speech was too slurred to comprehend Death did not come until the next morning but Lord Jon was at peace after that He never spoke again

Ned took another swallow of milk trying not to gag on the sweetness of it Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn’s death

Unnatural The aged maester’s voice was thin as a whisper No I could not say so Sad for a certainty Yet in its own way death is the most natural thing of all Lord Eddard Jon Arryn rests easy now his burdens lifted at last

This illness that took him said Ned Had you ever seen its like before in other men

Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms Pycelle replied Under our good King Robert and Aerys Targaryen before him and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys’s father Aegon the Fortunate the Fifth of His Name I have seen more of illness than I care to remember my lord I will tell you this Every case is different and every case is alike Lord Jon’s death was no stranger than any other

His wife thought otherwise

The Grand Maester nodded I recall now the widow is sister to your own noble wife If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds and the Lady Lysa was never that Since her last stillbirth she has seen enemies in every shadow and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost

So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness

I am Pycelle replied gravely If not illness my good lord what else could it be

Poison Ned suggested quietly

Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat A disturbing thought We are not the Free Cities where such things are common Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts yet even so the poisoner is beneath contempt He fell silent for a moment his eyes lost in thought What you suggest is possible my lord yet I do not think it likely Every hedge maester knows the common poisons and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs And the Hand was loved by all What sort of monster in man’s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord

I have heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon

Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully It is said Women cravens… and eunuchs He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes Above them a raven cawed loudly in the rookery The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys did you know Put not your trust in spiders my lord

That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl I will remember that Maester And I thank you for your help I have taken enough of your time He stood

Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease If there is any other service I might perform you need only ask

One thing Ned told him I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill

I fear you would find it of little interest Pycelle said It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses

Still I should like to see it

The old man opened the door As you wish I have it here somewhere When I find it I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway

You have been most courteous Ned told him Then almost as an afterthought he said One last question if you would be so kind You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died I wonder was the queen with him

Why no Pycelle said She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock in company with her father Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion’s crown In that he was sadly disappointed It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart

Dark wings dark words Ned murmured It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy

So the fishwives say Grand Maester Pycelle agreed but we know it is not always so When Maester Luwin’s bird brought the word about your Bran the message lifted every true heart in the castle did it not

As you say Maester

The gods are merciful Pycelle bowed his head Come to me as often as you like Lord Eddard I am here to serve
