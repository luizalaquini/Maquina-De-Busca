CH 8  PROSODIC FEATURES IN SPEECH SYNTHESIS
ds RT Prosodic features
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
Prosodic features are those which characterize an utterance as a whole
rather than having a local influence on individual sound segments
For speech output from computers an utterance usually comprises a
single unit of information which stretches over several words em a clause
or sentence  In natural speech an utterance can be very much longer but
it will be broken into prosodic units which are again roughly the size of a
clause or sentence  These prosodic units are certainly closely related
to each other  For example the pitch contour used when introducing a new
topic is usually different from those employed to develop it subsequently
However for the purposes of synthesis the successive prosodic units can
be treated independently and information about pitch contours to be used
will have to be specified in the input for each one
The independence between them is not complete however and
lower-level contextual effects such as interpolation of pitch between
the end of one prosodic unit and the start of the next must still be
imitated
pp
Prosodic features were introduced briefly in Chapter 2
Variations in voice dynamics occur in three dimensions  pitch of the voice
time and amplitude
These dimensions are inextricably twined together in living speech
Variations in voice quality are much less important for the factual
kind of speech usually sought in voice response applications
although they can play a considerable in conveying emotions
for a discussion of the acoustic manifestations of emotion in speech

The distinction between prosodic and segmental effects is a traditional one
but it becomes rather fuzzy when examined in detail
It is analogous to the distinction between hardware and
software in computer science  although useful from some points of view
the borderline becomes blurred as one gets closer to actual systems em with
microcode interrupts memory management and the like
At a trivial level prosodics
cannot exist without segmentals for there must be some vehicle to carry the
prosodic contrasts
Timing em a prosodic feature em is actually realized by the durations of
individual segments  Pauses are tantamount to silent segments
pp
While pitch may seem to be relatively independent of segmentals em and
this view is reinforced by the success of the source-filter model
which separates the frequency of the
excitation source from the filter characteristics em there
are some subtle phonetic effects of pitch
It has been observed that it drops on the transition into certain
consonants and rises again on the transition out Haggard

This can be explained in terms of variations in pressure from the
lungs on the vocal cords Ladefoged 1967

Ladefoged 1967

Briefly the increase in mouth pressure which occurs during some consonants
causes a reduction in the pressure difference across the vocal cords
and in the rate of flow of air between them
This results in a decrease in their frequency of vibration
When the constriction is released there is a temporary increase in the air
flow which increases the pitch again
The phenomenon is called microintonation
It is particularly noticeable in voiced stops but also occurs in voiced
fricatives and unvoiced stops
Simulation of the effect in synthesis-by-rule has often been found to give
noticeable improvements in the speech quality
pp
Loudness also has a segmental role  For example we noted in the last chapter
that amplitude values play a small part in identification of fricatives
In fact loudness is a very
ul
weak
prosodic feature  It contributes little to the perception of stress
Even for shouting the distinction from normal speech is as much in the voice
quality as in amplitude
