Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift It is a small thing my princess but all a poor exile could afford he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms she saw written in the Common Tongue She thanked him with all her heart

Magister Illyrio murmured a command and four burly slaves hurried forward bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze When she opened it she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce… and resting on top nestled in the soft cloth three huge eggs Dany gasped They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen each different than the others patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels and so large it took both of her hands to hold one She lifted it delicately expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel or even blown glass but it was much heavier than that as if it were all of solid stone The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales and as she turned the egg between her fingers they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun One egg was a deep green with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it Another was pale cream streaked with gold The last was black as black as a midnight sea yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls What are they she asked her voice hushed and full of wonder

Dragon’s eggs from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai said Magister Illyrio The eons have turned them to stone yet still they burn bright with beauty

I shall treasure them always Dany had heard tales of such eggs but she had never seen one nor thought to see one It was a truly magnificent gift though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo

The khal’s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons and splendid weapons they were Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings This is a gift worthy of a great warrior O blood of my blood and I am but a woman Let my lord husband bear these in my stead And so Khal Drogo too received his bride gifts

Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs sandsilks and jars of scent needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice A handsome gift Khaleesi Magister Illyrio said of the last after he had told her what it was Most lucky The gifts mounted up around her in great piles more gifts than she could possibly imagine more gifts than she could want or use

And last of all Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar When he returned the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him and he led the horse to her

She was a young filly spirited and splendid Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal There was something about her that took the breath away She was grey as the winter sea with a mane like silver smoke

Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck ran her fingers through the silver of her mane Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated Silver for the silver of your hair the khal says

She’s beautiful Dany murmured

She is the pride of the khalasar Illyrio said Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal

Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle so much smaller than the ones she was used to Dany sat there uncertain for a moment No one had told her about this part What should I do she asked Illyrio

It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered Take the reins and ride You need not go far

Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups She was only a fair rider she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees

And for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid Or perhaps it was for the first time ever

The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait and the crowd parted for her every eye upon them Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying The horse broke into a trot and she smiled Dothraki scrambled to clear a path The slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded She sent it into a gallop and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way As she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path They were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then and she gave the filly her head

The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings

When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio she said Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time

The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then Dany had lost all track of time Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse a lean red stallion As the khal was saddling the horse Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver dug his fingers into her leg and said Please him sweet sister or I swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before

The fear came back to her then with her brother’s words She felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her

They rode out together as the stars came out leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind Khal Drogo spoke no word to her but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode I am the blood of the dragon she whispered aloud as she followed trying to keep her courage up I am the blood of the dragon I am the blood of the dragon The dragon was never afraid

Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers She felt as fragile as glass in his hands her limbs as weak as water She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses and when he turned to look at her she began to cry

Khal Drogo stared at her tears his face strangely empty of expression No he said He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb

You speak the Common Tongue Dany said in wonder

No he said again

Perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one word more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better Drogo touched her hair lightly sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki Dany did not understand the words yet there was warmth in the tone a tenderness she had never expected from this man

He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking up into his eyes Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone Taking her lightly under the arms he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream Then he sat on the ground facing her legs crossed beneath him their faces finally at a height No he said
