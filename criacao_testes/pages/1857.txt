This good-fellowship -- 1camaraderie1 --  usually occurring
through similarity of pursuits is unfortunately seldom
superadded to love between the sexes because men and
women associate not in their lahours but in their
pleasures merely Where however happy circumstance
P 459
permits its development the compounded feeling proves
itself to be the only love which is strong as death -- that
love which many waters cannot quench nor the floods
drown beside which the passion usually called by the
name is evanescent as steam

A FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING -- CONCLUSION
THE most private secret plaines wedding that it is
possible to have
Those had been Bathshebas words to Oak one
evening some time after the event of the preceding
chapter and he meditated a full hour by the clock upon
how to carry out her wishes to the letter
A licence -- O yes it must be a licence he said
to himself at last Very well then first a license
On a dark night a few days later Oak came with
mysterious steps from the surrogates door in Caster+
bridge On the way home he heard a heavy tread in
front of him and overtaking the man found him to be
Coggan They walked together into the village until
they came to a little lane behind the church leading
down to the cottage of Laban Tall who had lately been
installed as clerk of the parish and was yet in mortal
terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone
voice among certain hard words of the Psalms whither
no man ventured to follow him
Well good-night Coggan said Oak Im going
down this way
Oh said Coggan surprised whats going on to+
night then make so bold Mr Oak
It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan
under the circumstances for Coggan had been true as
steel all through the time of Gabriels unhappiness about
Bathsheba and Gabriel said  You can keep a secret
Coggan
Youve proved me and you know
Yes I have and I do know Well then mistress
and I mean to get married to-morrow morning
Heavens high tower And yet Ive thought of
such a thing 
P 461
from time to time true I have But
keeping it so close Well there tis no consarn of
amine and I wish ee joy o her
Thank you Coggan But I assure ee that this
great hush is not what I wished for at all or what
either of us would have wished if it hadnt been for
certain things that would make a gay wedding seem
hardly the thing Bathsheba has a great wish that all
the parish shall not be in church looking at her -- shes
shyiike and nervous about it in fact -- so I be doing
this to humour her
Ay I see quite right too I suppose I must say
And you be now going down to the clerk
Yes you may as well come with me
I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be
throwed away said Coggan as they walked along
Labe Talls old woman will horn it all over parish in
half-an-hour 
So she will upon my life I never thought of
that said Oak pausing Yet I must tell him to+
night I suppose for hes working so far off and leaves
early
Ill tell ee how we could tackle her said Coggan
Ill knock and ask to speak to Laban outside the door
you standing in the background Then hell come out
and you can tell yer tale Shell never guess what I
want en for and Ill make up a few words about the
farm-work as a blind
This scheme was considered feasible and Coggan
advanced boldly and rapped at Mrs Talls door Mrs
Tall herself opened it
I wanted to have a word with Laban
Hes not at home and wont be this side of eleven
oclock Heve been forced to go over to Yalbury since
shutting out work I shall do quite as well
I hardly think you will Stop a moment and
Coggan stepped round the corner of the porch to consult
Oak
Whos tother man then said Mrs Tall
Only a friend said Coggan
Say hes wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch
to-morrow morning at ten said Oak in a whisper
That he must come without fail and wear his best
clothes
P 462
The clothes will floor us as safe as houses said
Coggan
It cant be helped said Oak Tell her
So Coggan delivered the message Mind het or
wet blow or snow he must come added Jan Tis
very particular indeed The fact is tis to witness her
sign some law-work about taking shares wi another
