6912 They that sit in the gate speak against me and I was the song
of the drunkards

6913 But as for me my prayer is unto thee O LORD in an acceptable
time O God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of
thy salvation

6914 Deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be
delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters

6915 Let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow
me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me

6916 Hear me O LORD for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies

6917 And hide not thy face from thy servant for I am in trouble
hear me speedily

6918 Draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of
mine enemies

6919 Thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour
mine adversaries are all before thee

6920 Reproach hath broken my heart and I am full of heaviness and I
looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters
but I found none

6921 They gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink

6922 Let their table become a snare before them and that which
should have been for their welfare let it become a trap

6923 Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their
loins continually to shake

6924 Pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them

6925 Let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their
tents

6926 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded

6927 Add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy
righteousness

6928 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be
written with the righteous

6929 But I am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation O God set me up
on high

6930 I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify him
with thanksgiving

6931 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs

6932 The humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall
live that seek God

6933 For the LORD heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners

6934 Let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing
that moveth therein

6935 For God will save Zion and will build the cities of Judah that
they may dwell there and have it in possession

6936 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that
love his name shall dwell therein



701 Make haste O God to deliver me make haste to help me O Lord

702 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let
them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt

703 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say
Aha aha

704 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let
such as love thy salvation say continually Let God be magnified

705 But I am poor and needy make haste unto me O God thou art my
help and my deliverer O LORD make no tarrying



711 In thee O LORD do I put my trust let me never be put to
confusion

712 Deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline
thine ear unto me and save me
