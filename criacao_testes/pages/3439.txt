It will not come to that Ned promised her praying it was true He took her in his arms again The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them and that they shall not have I must play out this fool’s masquerade as if nothing is amiss Remember why I came here my love If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn…

He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms Her scarred hands clung to him If she said what then my love

That was the most dangerous part Ned knew All justice flows from the king he told her When I know the truth I must go to Robert And pray that he is the man I think he is he finished silently and not the man I fear he has become





TYRION

Are you certain that you must leave us so soon the Lord Commander asked him

Past certain Lord Mormont Tyrion replied My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black

Would that I could Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist Old as he was the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear You’re a cunning man Tyrion We have need of men of your sort on the Wall

Tyrion grinned Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you Lord Mormont As they laughed he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning packed in a barrel of snow and they were succulent

Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile Lannister mocks us

Only you Ser Alliser Tyrion said This time the laughter round the table had a nervous uncertain quality to it

Thorne’s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together

Why asked Tyrion The crabs are here

The remark brought more guffaws from the others Ser Alliser stood up his mouth a tight line Come and make your japes with steel in your hand

Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand Why I have steel in my hand Ser Alliser although it appears to be a crab fork Shall we duel He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne’s chest with the tiny fork Roars of laughter filled the tower room Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander’s mouth as he began to gasp and choke Even his raven joined in cawing loudly from above the window Duel Duel Duel

Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt

Mormont was still gasping for breath Tyrion pounded him on the back To the victor goes the spoils he called out I claim Thorne’s share of the crabs

Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself You are a wicked man to provoke our Ser Alliser so he scolded

Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine If a man paints a target on his chest he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser

Not so objected the Lord Steward Bowen Marsh a man as round and red as a pomegranate You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains

Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names I’ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well he said Chip the ice off your eyes my good lords Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables not drilling your young warriors

The Watch has no shortage of stableboys Lord Mormont grumbled That seems to be all they send us these days Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers Ser Alliser is an anointed knight one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander He fought bravely at King’s Landing

On the wrong side Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly I ought to know I was there on the battlements beside him Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice Take the black or see our heads on spikes before evenfall No offense intended Tyrion

None taken Ser Jaremy My father is very fond of spiked heads especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion And a face as noble as yours well no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King’s Gate I think you would have looked very striking up there

Thank you Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile

Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true Tyrion You do mock us and our noble purpose here

Tyrion shrugged We all need to be mocked from time to time Lord Mormont lest we start to take ourselves too seriously More wine please He held out his cup

As Rykker filled it for him Bowen Marsh said You have a great thirst for a small man

Oh I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table He spoke softly yet the high officers of the Night’s Watch all fell quiet the better to hear what the ancient had to say I think he is a giant come among us here at the end of the world

Tyrion answered gently I’ve been called many things my lord but giant is seldom one of them

Nonetheless Maester Aemon said as his clouded milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion’s face I think it is true

For once Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words He could only bow his head politely and say You are too kind Maester Aemon

The blind man smiled He was a tiny thing wrinkled and hairless shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester’s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat I have been called many things my lord he said but kind is seldom one of them This time Tyrion himself led the laughter

Much later when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes The kingsroad can be perilous this far north the Lord Commander told him as they drank

I have Jyck and Morrec Tyrion said and Yoren is riding south again

Yoren is only one man The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument Three men should be sufficient

If you insist my lord Tyrion said You might send young Snow He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers

Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard Snow Oh the Stark bastard I think not The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them the brothers and mothers and all that A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone I know these things My own blood kin… my sister Maege rules Bear Island now since my son’s dishonor I have nieces I have never seen He took a swallow Besides Jon Snow is only a boy You shall have three strong swords to keep you safe

I am touched by your concern Lord Mormont The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him I hope I can repay your kindness

You can Mormont said bluntly Your sister sits beside the king Your brother is a great knight and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms Speak to them for us Tell them of our need here You have seen for yourself my lord The Night’s Watch is dying Our strength is less than a thousand now Six hundred here two hundred in the Shadow Tower even fewer at Eastwatch and a scant third of those fighting men The Wall is a hundred leagues long Think on that Should an attack come I have three men to defend each mile of wall

Three and a third Tyrion said with a yawn

Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him The old man warmed his hands before the fire I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce’s son lost on his first ranging The Royce boy was green as summer grass yet he insisted on the honor of his own command saying it was his due as a knight I did not wish to offend his lord father so I yielded I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch More fool I

Fool the raven agreed Tyrion glanced up The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes ruffling its wings Fool it called again Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature A pity

The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall he went on yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled I should never have believed it not of him but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell Of Royce there is no word One deserter and two men lost and now Ben Stark too has gone missing He sighed deeply Who am I to send searching after him In two years I will be seventy Too old and too weary for the burden I bear yet if I set it down who will pick it up Alliser Thorne Bowen Marsh I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are The Night’s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men Apart from the men at my table tonight I have perhaps twenty who can read and even fewer who can think or plan or lead Once the Watch spent its summers building and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it Now it is all we can do to stay alive

He was in deadly earnest Tyrion realized He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning I promise the king will hear of your need Tyrion said gravely and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well And he would Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word He left the rest unsaid that King Robert would ignore him Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses and Jaime would only laugh

You are a young man Tyrion Mormont said How many winters have you seen

He shrugged Eight nine I misremember

And all of them short

As you say my lord He had been born in the dead of winter a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years but Tyrion’s earliest memories were of spring
