Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five
cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of
the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees
before all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands
toward heaven

614 And said O LORD God of Israel there is no God like thee in the
heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy
unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts 615
Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou
hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it
with thine hand as it is this day

616 Now therefore O LORD God of Israel keep with thy servant David
my father that which thou hast promised him saying There shall not
fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel yet so
that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou
hast walked before me

617 Now then O LORD God of Israel let thy word be verified which
thou hast spoken unto thy servant David

618 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold
heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less
this house which I have built  619 Have respect therefore to the
prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O LORD my God to
hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before
thee 620 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night
upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name
there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward
this place

621 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of
thy people Israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou
from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest
forgive

622 If a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him
to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
623 Then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by
requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and
by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his
righteousness

624 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy
because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess
thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
625 Then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy
people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to
them and to their fathers

626 When the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they
have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and
confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict
them 627 Then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy
servants and of thy people Israel when thou hast taught them the
good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which
thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance

628 If there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there
be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies
besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or
whatsoever sickness there be 629 Then what prayer or what
supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people
Israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and
shall spread forth his hands in this house 630 Then hear thou from
heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man
according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only
knowest the hearts of the children of men 631 That they may fear
thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou
gavest unto our fathers

632 Moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people
Israel but is come from a far country for thy great names sake and
thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in
this house 633 Then hear thou from the heavens even from thy
dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to
thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear
thee as doth thy people Israel and may know that this house which I
have built is called by thy name

634 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which
thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy name 635
Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication
and maintain their cause

636 If they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth
not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their
enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or
near 637 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their
captivity saying We have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt
wickedly 638 If they return to thee with all their heart and with
all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have
carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest
unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and
toward the house which I have built for thy name 639 Then hear thou
from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their
supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which
