anything in the world to be as those children were un+
concerned at the meaning of their words because too
innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression
All the impassioned scenes of her brief expenence
seemed to revive with added emotion at that moment
and those scenes which had been without emotion
P 452
during enactment had emotion then Yet grief came
to her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former
times
Owing to Bathshebas face being buried in her hands
she did not notice a form which came quietly into the
porch and on seeing her first moved as if to retreat
then paused and regarded her Bathsheba did not raise
her head for some time and when she looked round
her face was wet and her eyes drowned and dim Mr
Oak exclaimed she disconcerted  how long have you
been here 
A few minutes maam said Oak respectfully
Are you going in said Bathsheba and there came
from within the church as from a prompter --
l loved the garish day and spite of fears
pride ruled my will remember not past years
I was said Gabriel  I am one of the bass singers
you know I have sung bass for several months
Indeed I wasnt aware of that Ill leave you then
Which I have loved long since and lost awhile
sang the children
Dont let me drive you away mistress I think I
wont go in to-night
O no -- you dont drive me away
Then they stood in a state of some embarrassment
Bathsheba trying to wipe her dreadfully drenched and
inflamed face without his noticing her At length Oak
said Ive not seen you-i mean spoken to you -- since
ever so long have I But he feared to bring distress+
ing memories back and interrupted himself with Were
you going into church 
No she said I came to see the tombstone
privately -- to see if they had cut the inscription as I
wished Mr Oak you neednt mind speaking to me if
you wish to on the matter which is in both our minds
at this moment
And have they done it as you wished  said Oak
Yes Come and see it if you have not already
So together they went and read the tomb Eight
months 
P 453
ago Gabriel murmured when he saw the date
It seems like yesterday to me
And to me as if it were years ago-iong years and
I had been dead between And now I am going home
Mr Oak
Oak walked after her I wanted to name a small
matter to you as soon as I could he said with hesitation
Merrly about business and I think I may just mention it
now if youll allow me
 O yes certainly
It is that I may soon have to give up the manage+
ment of your farm Mrs Troy The fact is I am think+
ing of leaving England -- not yet you know -- next
spring 
Leaving England she said in surprise and
genuine disappointment Why Gabriel what are you
going to do that for
Well Ive thought it best Oak stammered out
California is the spot Ive had in my mind to try
But it is understood everywhere that you are going
to take poor Mr Boldwoods farm on your own account
Ive had the refusal o it tis true but nothing is
settled yet and I have reasons for gieing up I shall
finish out my year there as manager for the trustees
but no more
And what shall I do without you Oh Gabriel I
dont think you ought to go away Youve been with
me so long -- through bright times and dark times -- such
old friends that as we are -- that it seems unkind almost I
had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master
you might still give a helping look across at mine And
now going away
I would have willingly
 Yet now that I am more helpless than ever you go
away
Yes thats the ill fortune o it said Gabriel in a
distressed tone And it is because of that very help+
lessness that I feel bound to go Good afternoon
maam  he concluded in evident anxiety to get
away and at once went out of the churchyard by a
path she could follow on no pretence whatever
Bathsheba went home her mind occupied with a
new trouble which being rather harassing than deadly
was calculated to do good by diverting her from the
chronic gloom of 
P 454
her life She was set thinking a great
deal about Oak and of his wich to shun her and there
occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of latter in+
tercourse with him which trivial when singly viewed
amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for
her society It broke upon her at length as a great
