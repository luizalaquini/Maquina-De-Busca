Ser Kevan leaned forward We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we come to battle

Ser Kevan seldom had a thought that Lord Tywin had not had first Tyrion had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his mouth Now he lowered it The vanguard he repeated dubiously Either his lord father had a new respect for Tyrion’s abilities or he’d decided to rid himself of his embarrassing get for good Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which

They seem ferocious enough Ser Kevan said

Ferocious Tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird His father watched judging him weighing every word Let me tell you how ferocious they are Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened his throat for him Perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back I couldn’t say Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man’s cock which was fortunate but even so Ulf is demanding blood money which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay

When soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their lord commander his father said

His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly and die for him if need be Tyrion lacked that gift He bought loyalty with gold and compelled obedience with his name A bigger man would be able to put the fear in them is that what you’re saying my lord

Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother If my son’s men will not obey his commands perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear guarding our baggage train

Do me no kindnesses Father he said angrily If you have no other command to offer me I’ll lead your van

Lord Tywin studied his dwarf son I said nothing about command You will serve under Ser Gregor

Tyrion took one bite of pork chewed a moment and spit it out angrily I find I am not hungry after all he said climbing awkwardly off the bench Pray excuse me my lords

Lord Tywin inclined his head dismissing him Tyrion turned and walked away He was conscious of their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill A great gust of laughter went up from behind him but he did not look back He hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs

Dusk had settled turning all the banners black The Lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river and the kingsroad In amongst the men and the horses and the trees it was easy to get lost and Tyrion did He passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires Fireflies drifted amongst the tents like wandering stars He caught the scent of garlic sausage spiced and savory so tempting it made his empty stomach growl Away in the distance he heard voices raised in some bawdy song A giggling woman raced past him naked beneath a dark cloak her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots Farther on two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream practicing their thrust-and-parry in the fading light their chests bare and slick with sweat

No one looked at him No one spoke to him No one paid him any mind He was surrounded by men sworn to House Lannister a vast host twenty thousand strong and yet he was alone

When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga’s laughter booming through the dark he followed it to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night Conn son of Coratt waved a tankard of ale Tyrion Halfman Come sit by our fire share meat with the Stone Crows We have an ox

I can see that Conn son of Coratt The huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire skewered on a spit the size of a small tree No doubt it was a small tree Blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat I thank you Send for me when the ox is cooked From the look of it that might even be before the battle He walked on

Each clan had its own cookfire Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows Stone Crows did not eat with Moon Brothers and no one ate with Burned Men The modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford’s stores had been erected in the center of the four fires Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the new servants Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs and even insisted he take a squire They were seated around the embers of a small cookfire A girl was with them slim dark-haired no more than eighteen by the look of her Tyrion studied her face for a moment before he spied fishbones in the ashes What did you eat

Trout m’lord said his groom Bronn caught them

Trout he thought Suckling pig Damn my father He stared mournfully at the bones his belly rumbling

His squire a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne swallowed whatever he had been about to say The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne the king’s headsman… and almost as quiet although not for want of a tongue Tyrion had made him stick it out once just to be certain Definitely a tongue he had said Someday you must learn to use it

At the moment he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl Is this her he asked Bronn

She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more It is m’lord and she can speak for herself if it please you

He cocked his head to one side I am Tyrion of House Lannister Men call me the Imp

My mother named me Shae Men call me… often

Bronn laughed and Tyrion had to smile Into the tent Shae if you would be so kind He lifted the flap and held it for her Inside he knelt to light a candle

The life of a soldier was not without certain compensations Wherever you have a camp you are certain to have camp followers At the end of the day’s march Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore I would prefer one who is reasonably young with as pretty a face as you can find he had said If she has washed sometime this year I shall be glad If she hasn’t wash her Be certain that you tell her who I am and warn her of what I am Jyck had not always troubled to do that There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they’d been hired to pleasure… a took that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again

He lifted the candle and looked her over Bronn had done well enough she was doe-eyed and slim with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy insolent and wicked He liked that Shall I take my gown off m’lord she asked

In good time Are you a maiden Shae

If it please you m’lord she said demurely

What would please me would be the truth of you girl

Aye but that will cost you double

Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly I am a Lannister Gold I have in plenty and you’ll find me generous… but I’ll want more from you than what you’ve got between your legs though I’ll want that too You’ll share my tent pour my wine laugh at my jests rub the ache from my legs after each day’s ride… and whether I keep you a day or a year for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed

Fair enough She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion tossing it aside There was nothing underneath but Shae If he don’t put down that candle m’lord will burn his fingers

Tyrion put down the candle took her hand in his and pulled her gently to him She bent to kiss him Her mouth tasted of honey and cloves and her fingers were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of his clothes

When he entered her she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small shuddering gasps of pleasure Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned but she did it so well that it did not matter That much truth he did not crave

He had needed her Tyrion realized afterward as she lay quietly in his arms Her or someone like her It had been nigh on a year since he’d lain with a woman since before he had set out for Winterfell in company with his brother and King Robert He could well die on the morrow or the day after and if he did he would sooner go to his grave thinking of Shae than of his lord father Lysa Arryn or the Lady Catelyn Stark

He could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay beside him That was a good feeling A song filled his head Softly quietly he began to whistle

What’s that m’lord Shae murmured against him

Nothing he told her A song I learned as a boy that’s all Go to sleep sweetling

When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady Tyrion slid out from beneath her gently so as not to disturb her sleep Naked he crawled outside stepped over his squire and walked around behind his tent to make water

Bronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree near where they’d tied the horses He was honing the edge of his sword wide awake the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men Where did you find her Tyrion asked him as he pissed

I took her from a knight The man was loath to give her up but your name changed his thinking somewhat… that and my dirk at his throat

Splendid Tyrion said dryly shaking off the last drops I seem to recall saying find me a whore not make me an enemy

The pretty ones were all claimed Bronn said I’ll be pleased to take her back if you’d prefer a toothless drab

Tyrion limped closer to where he sat My lord father would call that insolence and send you to the mines for impertinence

Good for me you’re not your father Bronn replied I saw one with boils all over her nose Would you like her

What and break your heart Tyrion shot back I shall keep Shae Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from I’d rather not have him beside me in the battle

Bronn rose cat-quick and cat-graceful turning his sword in his hand You’ll have me beside you in the battle dwarf

Tyrion nodded The night air was warm on his bare skin See that I survive this battle and you can name your reward

Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left and tried a cut Who’d want to kill the likes of you

My lord father for one He’s put me in the van
