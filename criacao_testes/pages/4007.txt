Then whats nagging at me Those double-exploding
bombs for one Its not that the Capitol couldnt have the
same weapon its just that Im sure the rebels did Gale and
Beetees brainchild Then theres the fact that Snow made
no escape attempt when I know him to be the consummate
survivor It seems hard to believe he didnt have a retreat
somewhere some bunker stocked with provisions where
he could live out the rest of his snaky little life And finally
theres his assessment of Coin Whats irrefutable is that
shes done exactly what he said Let the Capitol and the
districts run one another into the ground and then sauntered
in to take power Even if that was her plan it doesnt mean
she dropped those parachutes Victory was already in her
grasp Everything was in her grasp
Except me
I recall Boggss response when I admitted I hadnt put
much thought into Snows successor If your immediate
answer isnt Coin then youre a threat Youre the face of
the rebellion You may have more influence than any
other single person Outwardly the most youve ever done
is tolerated her
Suddenly Im thinking of Prim who was not yet
fourteen not yet old enough to be granted the title of
soldier but somehow working on the front lines How did
such a thing happen That my sister would have wanted to
be there I have no doubt That she would be more capable
than many older than she is a given But for all that
someone very high up would have had to approve putting a
thirteen-year-old in combat Did Coin do it hoping that
losing Prim would push me completely over the edge Or
at least firmly on her side I wouldnt even have had to
witness it in person Numerous cameras would be covering
the City Circle Capturing the moment forever
No now I am going crazy slipping into some state of
paranoia Too many people would know of the mission
Word would get out Or would it Who would have to know
besides Coin Plutarch and a small loyal or easily
disposable crew
I badly need help working this out only everyone I trust
is dead Cinna Boggs Finnick Prim Theres Peeta but
he couldnt do any more than speculate and who knows
what state his minds in anyway And that leaves only Gale
Hes far away but even if he were beside me could I
confide in him What could I say how could I phrase it
without implying that it was his bomb that killed Prim The
impossibility of that idea more than any is why Snow must
be lying
Ultimately theres only one person to turn to who might
know what happened and might still be on my side To
broach the subject at all will be a risk But while I think
Haymitch might gamble with my life in the arena I dont
think hed rat me out to Coin Whatever problems we may
have with each other we prefer resolving our differences
one-on-one
I scramble off the tiles out the door and across the hall
to his room When theres no response to my knock I push
inside Ugh Its amazing how quickly he can defile a space
Half-eaten plates of food shattered liquor bottles and
pieces of broken furniture from a drunken rampage scatter
his quarters He lies unkempt and unwashed in a tangle of
sheets on the bed passed out
Haymitch I say shaking his leg Of course thats
insufficient But I give it a few more tries before I dump the
pitcher of water in his face He comes to with a gasp
slashing blindly with his knife Apparently the end of Snows
reign didnt equal the end of his terror
Oh You he says I can tell by his voice that hes still
loaded
Haymitch I begin
Listen to that The Mockingjay found her voice He
laughs Well Plutarchs going to be happy He takes a
swig from a bottle Why am I soaking wet I lamely drop
the pitcher behind me into a pile of dirty clothes
I need your help I say
Haymitch belches filling the air with white liquor fumes
What is it sweetheart More boy trouble I dont know
why but this hurts me in a way Haymitch rarely can It must
show on my face because even in his drunken state he
tries to take it back Okay not funny Im already at the
door Not funny Come back By the thud of his body
hitting the floor I assume he tried to follow me but theres
no point
I zigzag through the mansion and disappear into a
wardrobe full of silken things I yank them from hangers until
I have a pile and then burrow into it In the lining of my
pocket I find a stray morphling tablet and swallow it dry
heading off my rising hysteria Its not enough to right things
though I hear Haymitch calling me in the distance but he
wont find me in his condition Especially not in this new
spot Swathed in silk I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoon
awaiting metamorphosis I always supposed that to be a
peaceful condition At first it is But as I journey into night I
feel more and more trapped suffocated by the slippery
bindings unable to emerge until I have transformed into
something of beauty I squirm trying to shed my ruined
body and unlock the secret to growing flawless wings
Despite enormous effort I remain a hideous creature fired
into my current form by the blast from the bombs
The encounter with Snow opens the door to my old
repertoire of nightmares Its like being stung by tracker
