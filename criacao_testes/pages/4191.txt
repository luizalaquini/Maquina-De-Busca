the distance now appeared close beside them
 Theres Mr Boldwood said Oak  I wonder what
Troy meant by his question
Coggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer
just checked their paces to discover if they were wanted
and finding they were not stood back to let him pass on
The only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had
been combating through the night and was combating
now were the want of colour in his welidefined face
the enlarged appearance of the veins in his forehead
and temples and the sharper lines about his mouth
The horse bore him away and the very step of the
animal seemed significant of dogged despair Gabriel for
a minute rose above his own grief in noticing Boldwoods
He saw the square figure sitting erect upon the horse
the head turned to neither side the elbows steady by
the hips the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in
its onward glide until the keen edges of Boldwoods
shape sank by degrees over the hill To one who knew
the man and his story there was something more striking
in this immobility than in a collapse The clash of
discord between mood and matter here was forced
painfully home to the heart  and as in laughter there are
more dreadful phases than in tears so was there in the
steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper
than a cry

WEALTH IN JEOPARDY -- THE RVEEL
ONE night at the end of August when Bathshebas
experiences as a married woman were still new and
when the weather was yet dry and sultry a man stood
motionless in the stackyard of Weatherbury Upper
Farm looking at the moon and sky
The night had a sinister aspect A heated breeze
from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty
objects and in the sky dashes of buoyant cloud were
sailing in a course at right angles to that of another
stratum neither of them in the direction of the breeze
below The moon as seen through these films had
a lurid metallic look The fields were sallow with the
impure light and all were tinged in monochrome as
if beheld through stained glass The same evening
the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail the
behaviour of the rooks had heen confused and the
horses had moved with timidity and caution
Thunder was imminent and taking some secondary
appearances into consideration it was likely to be
followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark
the close of dry weather for the season Before twelve
hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a
bygone thing
Oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un
protected ricks massive and heavy with the rich
produce of one-half the farm for that year He went
on to the barn
This was the night which had been selected by
Sergeant Troy -- ruling now in the room of his wife --
for giving the harvest supper and dance As Oak
approached the building the sound of violins and a
tambourine and the regular jigging of many feet grew
more distinct He came close to the large doors one
of which stood slightly ajar and looked in
The central space together with the recess at one
end was

emptied of all incumbrances and this area
covering about two-thirds of the whole was appropriated
for the gathering the remaining end which was piled
to the ceiling with oats being screened off with sail
cloth Tufts and garlands of green foliage decomted
the walls beams and extemporized chandeliers and
immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been
erected bearing a table and chairs Here sat three
fiddlers and beside them stood a frantic man with his
hair on end perspiration streaming down his cheeks
and a tanabourine quivering in his hand
The dance ended and on the black oak floor in the
midst a new row of couples formed for another
Now maam and no offence I hope I ask what
dance you would like next  said the first violin
Really it makes no difference said the clear voice
of Bathsheba who stood at the inner end of the build+
ing observing the scene from behind a table covered
with cups and viands Troy was lolling beside her
Then said the fiddler Ill venture to name that
the right and proper thing is The Soldiers Joy --
there being a gallant soldier married into the farm --
hey my sonnies and gentlemen all  
It shall be The Soldiers Joy exclaimed a
chorus
Thanks for the compliment said the sergeant
THE REVEL
gaily taking Bathsheba by the hand and leading her
to the top of the dance For though I have pur+
chased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majestys
regiment of cavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards to attend
to the new duties awaiting me here I shall continue a
soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I live
So the dance began As to the merits of The
