49 Use hospitality one to another without grudging

410 As every man hath received the gift even so minister the same
one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God

411 If any man speak let him speak as the oracles of God if any man
minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God
in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise
and dominion for ever and ever Amen

412 Beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you 413 But
rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings that
when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy

414 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the
spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil
spoken of but on your part he is glorified

415 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an
evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters

416 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but
let him glorify God on this behalf

417 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of God  418 And if the righteous scarcely be
saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear  419 Wherefore
let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping
of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful Creator

51 The elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and
a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed 52 Feed the flock of God which is among
you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly
not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind 53 Neither as being lords
over Gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock

54 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown
of glory that fadeth not away

55 Likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder Yea all
of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for
God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble

56 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he
may exalt you in due time 57 Casting all your care upon him for he
careth for you

58 Be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a
roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 59 Whom
resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world

510 But the God of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you
perfect stablish strengthen settle you

511 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever Amen

512 By Silvanus a faithful brother unto you as I suppose I have
written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace
of God wherein ye stand

513 The church that is at Babylon elected together with you
saluteth you and so doth Marcus my son

514 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity Peace be with you
all that are in Christ Jesus Amen




The Second General Epistle of Peter


11 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them
that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ 12 Grace and peace
be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
Lord 13 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him
that hath called us to glory and virtue 14 Whereby are given unto us
exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be
partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is
in the world through lust

15 And beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue
and to virtue knowledge 16 And to knowledge temperance and to
temperance patience and to patience godliness 17 And to godliness
brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity

18 For if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ

19 But he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar
off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
