Yes Jon replied Two of the six he took with him They’d been dead a long time only… the bodies are queer

Queer Pyp was all curiosity How queer

Sam will tell you Jon did not want to talk of it I should see if the Old Bear has need of me

He walked to the Lord Commander’s Tower alone with a curious sense of apprehension The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached The Old Bear’s in his solar one of them announced He was asking for you

Jon nodded He should have come straight from the stable He climbed the tower steps briskly He wants wine or a fire in his hearth that’s all he told himself

When he entered the solar Mormont’s raven screamed at him Corn the bird shrieked Corn Corn Corn

Don’t you believe it I just fed him the Old Bear growled He was seated by the window reading a letter Bring me a cup of wine and pour one for yourself

For myself my lord

Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon There was pity in that look he could taste it You heard me

Jon poured with exaggerated care vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act When the cups were filled he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter Yet all too soon they were filled Sit boy Mormont commanded him Drink

Jon remained standing It’s my father isn’t it

The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger Your father and the king he rumbled I won’t lie to you it’s grievous news I never thought to see another king not at my age with Robert half my years and strong as a bull He took a gulp of wine They say the king loved to hunt The things we love destroy us every time lad Remember that My son loved that young wife of his Vain woman If not for her he would never have thought to sell those poachers

Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying My lord I don’t understand What’s happened to my father

I told you to sit Mormont grumbled Sit the raven screamed And have a drink damn you That’s a command Snow

Jon sat and took a sip of wine

Lord Eddard has been imprisoned He is charged with treason It is said he plotted with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey

No Jon said at once That couldn’t be My father would never betray the king

Be that as it may said Mormont It is not for me to say Nor for you

But it’s a lie Jon insisted How could they think his father was a traitor had they all gone mad Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself… would he

He fathered a bastard a small voice whispered inside him Where was the honor in that And your mother what of her He will not even speak her name

My lord what will happen to him Will they kill him

As to that I cannot say lad I mean to send a letter I knew some of the king’s councillors in my youth Old Pycelle Lord Stannis Ser Barristan… Whatever your father has done or hasn’t done he is a great lord He must be allowed to take the black and join us here Gods knows we need men of Lord Eddard’s ability

Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in days past Why not Lord Eddard His father here That was a strange thought and strangely uncomfortable It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the black and yet if it meant his life…

And would Joffrey allow it He remembered the prince at Winterfell the way he’d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed bastards were beneath even his contempt My lord will the king listen to you

The Old Bear shrugged A boy king… I imagine he’ll listen to his mother A pity the dwarf isn’t with them He’s the lad’s uncle and he saw our need when he visited us It was a bad thing your lady mother taking him captive—

Lady Stark is not my mother Jon reminded him sharply Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him If Lord Eddard was killed she would be as much to blame as the queen My lord what of my sisters Arya and Sansa they were with my father do you know—

Pycelle makes no mention of them but doubtless they’ll be treated gently I will ask about them when I write Mormont shook his head This could not have happened at a worse time If ever the realm needed a strong king… there are dark days and cold nights ahead I feel it in my bones… He gave Jon a long shrewd look I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid boy

He’s my father Jon wanted to say but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it His throat was dry He made himself take another sip of wine

Your duty is here now the Lord Commander reminded him Your old life ended when you took the black His bird made a raucous echo Black Mormont took no notice Whatever they do in King’s Landing is none of our concern When Jon did not answer the old man finished his wine and said You’re free to go I’ll have no further need of you today On the morrow you can help me write that letter

Jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar The next he knew he was descending the tower steps thinking This is my father my sisters how can it be none of my concern

Outside one of the guards looked at him and said Be strong boy The gods are cruel

They know Jon realized My father is no traitor he said hoarsely Even the words stuck in his throat as if to choke him The wind was rising and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he’d gone in Spirit summer was drawing to an end

The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream Jon could not have said where he walked what he did who he spoke with Ghost was with him he knew that much The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort The girls do not even have that much he thought Their wolves might have kept them safe but Lady is dead and Nymeria’s lost they’re all alone

A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal Hobb had cooked up a venison stew thick with barley onions and carrots When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon’s plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread he knew what it meant He knows He looked around the hall saw heads turn quickly eyes politely averted They all know

His friends rallied to him We asked the septon to light a candle for your father Matthar told him It’s a lie we all know it’s a lie even Grenn knows it’s a lie Pyp chimed in Grenn nodded and Sam clasped Jon’s hand You’re my brother now so he’s my father too the fat boy said If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods I’ll go with you

The weirwoods were beyond the Wall yet he knew Sam meant what he said They are my brothers he thought As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon…

And then he heard the laughter sharp and cruel as a whip and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne Not only a bastard but a traitor’s bastard he was telling the men around him

In the blink of an eye Jon had vaulted onto the table dagger in his hand Pyp made a grab for him but he wrenched his leg away and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser’s hand Stew went flying everywhere spattering the brothers Thorne recoiled People were shouting but Jon Snow did not hear them He lunged at Ser Alliser’s face with the dagger slashing at those cold onyx eyes but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers

Later much later after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell Mormont came down to see him raven on his shoulder I told you not to do anything stupid boy the Old Bear said Boy the bird chorused Mormont shook his head disgusted And to think I had high hopes for you

They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed His friends were not allowed to see him but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost so he was not utterly alone

My father is no traitor he told the direwolf when the rest had gone Ghost looked at him in silence Jon slumped against the wall hands around his knees and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed The flame flickered and swayed the shadows moved around him the room seemed to grow darker and colder I will not sleep tonight Jon thought

Yet he must have dozed When he woke his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out Ghost stood on his hind legs scrabbling at the door Jon was startled to see how tall he’d grown Ghost what is it he called softly The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him baring his fangs in a silent snarl Has he gone mad Jon wondered It’s me Ghost he murmured trying not to sound afraid Yet he was trembling violently When had it gotten so cold

Ghost backed away from the door There were deep gouges where he’d raked the wood Jon watched him with mounting disquiet There’s someone out there isn’t there he whispered Crouching the direwolf crept backward white fur rising on the back of his neck The guard he thought they left a man to guard my door Ghost smells him through the door that’s all it is

Slowly Jon pushed himself to his feet He was shivering uncontrollably wishing he still had a sword Three quick steps brought him to the door He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward The creak of the hinges almost made him jump

His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps looking up at him Looking up at him even though he was lying on his stomach His head had been twisted completely around

It can’t be Jon told himself This is the Lord Commander’s Tower it’s guarded day and night this couldn’t happen it’s a dream I’m having a nightmare

Ghost slid past him out the door The wolf started up the steps stopped looked back at Jon That was when he heard it the soft scrape of a boot on stone the sound of a latch turning The sounds came from above From the Lord Commander’s chambers

A nightmare this might be yet it was no dream

The guard’s sword was in its sheath Jon knelt and worked it free The heft of steel in his fist made him bolder He moved up the steps Ghost padding silently before him Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair Jon crept up warily probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword

Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont’s raven Corn the bird was screaming Corn corn corn corn corn corn Ghost bounded ahead and Jon came scrambling after The door to Mormont’s solar was wide open The direwolf plunged through Jon stopped in the doorway blade in hand giving his eyes a moment to adjust Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows and the darkness was black as ink Who’s there he called out
