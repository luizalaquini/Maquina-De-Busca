Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them Littlefinger called dryly

Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons gently lowered his visor and rode to the end of the lists Both men couched their lances

Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose but Sansa was watching it all moist-eyed and eager The hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses broke into a gallop The Hound leaned forward as he rode his lance rock steady but Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact Clegane’s point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon while his own hit square Wood shattered and the Hound reeled fighting to keep his seat Sansa gasped A ragged cheer went up from the commons

I wonder how I ought spend your money Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly

The Hound just managed to stay in his saddle He jerked his mount around hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass Jaime Lannister tossed down his broken lance and snatched up a fresh one jesting with his squire The Hound spurred forward at a hard gallop Lannister rode to meet him This time when Jaime shifted his seat Sandor Clegane shifted with him Both lances exploded and by the time the splinters had settled a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while Ser Jaime Lannister rolled in the dirt golden and dented

Sansa said I knew the Hound would win

Littlefinger overheard If you know who’s going to win the second match speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean he called to her Ned smiled

A pity the Imp is not here with us Lord Renly said I should have won twice as much

Jaime Lannister was back on his feet but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in his fall and now he could not get it off The commons were hooting and pointing the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles and failing and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing louder than anyone Finally they had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith blind and stumbling

By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists He was huge the biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen Robert Baratheon and his brothers were all big men as was the Hound and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all but the knight they called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor He was well over seven feet tall closer to eight with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees His destrier seemed a pony in between his armored legs and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle

Unlike his brother Ser Gregor did not live at court He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands but for wars and tourneys He had been with Lord Tywin when King’s Landing fell a new-made knight of seventeen years even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity Some said it had been Gregor who’d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother the Dornish princess Elia before putting her to the sword These things were not said in Gregor’s hearing

Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion one knight among thousands He watched him with disquiet Ned seldom put much stock in gossip but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous He was soon to be married for the third time and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances and the fire that had disfigured his brother and the hunting accident that had killed their father Gregor had inherited the keep the gold and the family estates His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword and it was said that he had never returned not even to visit

When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance a murmur ran through the crowd and he heard Sansa’s fervent whisper Oh he’s so beautiful Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots The commons realized in the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires a gasp went up from a thousand throats Across the boy’s shoulders his cloak hung heavy It was woven of forget-me-nots real ones hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape

His courser was as slim as her rider a beautiful grey mare built for speed Ser Gregor’s huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent The boy from Highgarden did something with his legs and his horse pranced sideways nimble as a dancer Sansa clutched at his arm Father don’t let Ser Gregor hurt him she said Ned saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given her yesterday Jory had told him about that as well

These are tourney lances he told his daughter They make them to splinter on impact so no one is hurt Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons and the words were raw in his throat

Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse The stallion was screaming and pawing the ground shaking his head The Mountain kicked at the animal savagely with an armored boot The horse reared and almost threw him

The Knight of Flowers saluted the king rode to the far end of the list and couched his lance ready Ser Gregor brought his animal to the line fighting with the reins And suddenly it began The Mountain’s stallion broke in a hard gallop plunging forward wildly while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk Ser Gregor wrenched his shield into position juggled with his lance and all the while fought to hold his unruly mount on a straight line and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on him placing the point of his lance just there and in an eye blink the Mountain was failing He was so huge that he took his horse down with him in a tangle of steel and flesh

Ned heard applause cheers whistles shocked gasps excited muttering and over it all the rasping raucous laughter of the Hound The Knight of Flowers reined up at the end of the lists His lance was not even broken His sapphires winked in the sun as he raised his visor smiling The commons went mad for him

In the middle of the field Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to his feet He wrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground His face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes My sword he shouted to his squire and the boy ran it out to him By then his stallion was back on its feet as well

Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animal’s neck Cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat The stallion went to its knees screaming as it died By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell his bloody sword clutched in his fist Stop him Ned shouted but his words were lost in the roar Everyone else was yelling as well and Sansa was crying

It all happened so fast The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser Gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse The mare scented blood and reared Loras Tyrell kept his seat but barely Ser Gregor swung his sword a savage two-handed blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay stunned in the dirt But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow a rasping voice warned Leave him be and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy

The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive strength behind it but the Hound caught the blow and turned it and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound’s-head helmet yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother’s unprotected face

It was the king’s voice that put an end to it… the king’s voice and twenty swords Jon Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice and Robert had proved the truth of that on the Trident He used that voice now STOP THIS MADNESS he boomed IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING

The Hound went to one knee Ser Gregor’s blow cut air and at last he came to his senses He dropped his sword and glared at Robert surrounded by his Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen Wordlessly he turned and strode off shoving past Barristan Selmy Let him go Robert said and as quickly as that it was over

Is the Hound the champion now Sansa asked Ned

No he told her There will be one final joust between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers

But Sansa had the right of it after all A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane I owe you my life The day is yours ser

I am no ser the Hound replied but he took the victory and the champion’s purse and for perhaps the first time in his life the love of the commons They cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion

As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in with them Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat Littlefinger was saying I swear the boy planned the whole thing Gregor has always favored huge ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense The notion seemed to amuse him

It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy There is small honor in tricks the old man said stiffly

Small honor and twenty thousand golds Lord Renly smiled

That afternoon a boy named Anguy an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches won the archery competition outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand’s guard but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of and he refused

The melee went on for three hours Near forty men took part freeriders and hedge knights and new-made squires in search of a reputation They fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and blood small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured until only one man was left standing The victor was the red priest Thoros of Myr a madman who shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword He had won melees before the fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders and nothing frightened Thoros The final tally was three broken limbs a shattered collarbone a dozen smashed fingers two horses that had to be put down and more cuts sprains and bruises than anyone cared to count Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not taken part

That night at the feast Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great while Robert was in high good humor the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen and even his daughters were behaving Jory brought Arya down to join them and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly The tournament was magnificent she sighed You should have come How was your dancing

I’m sore all over Arya reported happily proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg

You must be a terrible dancer Sansa said doubtfully

Later while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven ballads called the Dance of the Dragons Ned inspected the bruise himself I hope Forel is not being too hard on you he said

Arya stood on one leg She was getting much better at that of late Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better

Ned frowned The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya’s slender blade yet still… a few days ago she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin she told him Before that he had her doing spins and back flips Arya are you certain you want to persist in this

She nodded Tomorrow we’re going to catch cats

Cats Ned sighed Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi If you like I will ask Jory to take over your lessons Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth

I don’t want them Arya said I want Syrio

Ned ran his fingers through his hair Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds cartwheels and hopping about on one leg but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw As you wish he said Surely she would grow tired of this soon Try to be careful

I will she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left

Much later after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool night air Across the Great Yard he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from Littlefinger’s windows The hour was well past midnight Down by the river the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die

He took out the dagger and studied it Littlefinger’s blade won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager sent to slay Bran in his sleep Why Why would the dwarf want Bran dead Why would anyone want Bran dead

The dagger Bran’s fall all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn he could feel it in his gut but the truth of Jon’s death remained as clouded to him as when he had started Lord Stannis had not returned to King’s Landing for the tourney Lysa Arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie The squire was dead and Jory was still searching the whorehouses What did he have but Robert’s bastard

That the armorer’s sullen apprentice was the king’s son Ned had no doubt The Baratheon look was stamped on his face in his jaw his eyes that black hair Renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age Stannis too cold and proud in his honor Gendry had to be Robert’s

Yet knowing all that what had he learned The king had other baseborn children scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms He had openly acknowledged one of his bastards a boy of Bran’s age whose mother was highborn The lad was being fostered by Lord Renly’s castellan at Storm’s End

Ned remembered Robert’s first child as well a daughter born in the Vale when Robert was scarcely more than a boy himself A sweet little girl the young lord of Storm’s End had doted on her He used to make daily visits to play with the babe long after he had lost interest in the mother Ned was often dragged along for company whether he willed it or not The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now he realized older than Robert had been when he fathered her A strange thought
