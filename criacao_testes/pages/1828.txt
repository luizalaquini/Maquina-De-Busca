 Not at present I think It is not necessary
 Why not maam  
 Because hes still alive
 How do you know that   said Liddy amazed
 I dont know it But wouldnt it have heen different
or shouldnt I have heard more or wouldnt they have
found him Liddy  -- or-i dont know how it is but
death would have been different from how this is I am
perfectly convinced that he is still alive  
Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday
when two circumstances conjoined to shake it The
first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper which
beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable pre+
sumptive evidence of Troys death by drowning con+
tained the important testimony of a young Mr Barker
MD of Budmouth who spoke to being an eyewitness
of the accident in a letter to the editor In this he
stated that he was passing over the cliff on the remoter
side of the
P 389
cove just as the sun was setting At that
time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside
the mouth of the cove and guessed in an instant that
there was but a poor chance for him unless he should
be possessed of unusual muscular powers He drifted
behind a projection of the coast and Mr Barker followed
along the shore in the same direction But by the time
that he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to
command a view of the sea beyond dusk had set in and
nothing further was to be seen
The other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes
when it became necessary for her to examine and identify
them -- though this had virtually been done long before
by those who inspected the letters in his pockets It
was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation that
Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing
again almost immediately that the notion that anything
but death could have prevented him was a perverse one
to entertain
Then Bathsheba said to herself that others were
assured in their opinion strange that she should not
be A stmnge reflection occured to her causing her
face to flush Suppose that Troy had followed Fanny
into another world Had he done this intentionally yet
contrived to make his death appear like an accident 
Nevertheless this thought of how the apparent might
differ from the reai-made vivid by her bygone jealousy
of Fanny and the remorse he had shown that night
 -- did not blind her to the perception of a likelier
difference less tragic but to herself far more disastrous
When alone late that evening beside a small fire and
much calmed down Bathsheba took Troys watch into
her hand which had been restored to her with the rest
of the articles belonging to him She opened the case
as he had opened it before her a week ago There was
the little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to
this great explosion
He was hers and she was his they should be gone
together she said I am nothing to either of them
and why should I keep her hair She took it in her
hand and held it over the fire  No-ill not burn it
-ill keep it in memory of her poor thing   she added
snatching back her hand

OAKS ADVANCEMENY -- A GREAT HOPE
THE later autumn and the winter drew on apace
and the leaves lay thick upon the turf of the glades
and the mosses of the woods Bathsheba having
previously been living in a state of suspended feeling
which was not suspense now lived in a mood of
quietude which was not precisely peacefulness While
she had known him to be alive she could have thought
of his death with equanimity but now that it might be
she had lost him she regretted that he was not hers
still She kept the farm going raked in her profits
without caring keenly about them and expended
money on ventures because she had done so in bygone
days which though not long gone by seemed infinitely
removed from her present She looked back upon that
past over a great gulf as if she were now a dead person
having the faculty of meditation still left in her by
means of which like the mouldering gentlefolk of the
poets story she could sit and ponder what a gift life
used to be
However one excellent result of her general apathy
was the long-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff but
he having virtually exercised that function for a long
time already the change beyond the substantial in+
crease of wages it brought was little more than a
nominal one addressed to the outside world
Boldwood lived secluded and inactive Much of
his wheat and all his barley of that season had been
spoilt by the rain It sprouted grew into intricate
mats and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls
The strange neglect which had produced this ruin
and waste became the subject of whispered talk among
all the people round and it was elicited from one of
Boldwoods men that forgetfulness had nothing to do
with it for he had been reminded of the danger to
