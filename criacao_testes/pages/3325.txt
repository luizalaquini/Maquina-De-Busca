118 For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man

119 Neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the
man

1110 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
of the angels

1111 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the
woman without the man in the Lord

1112 For as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the
woman but all things of God

1113 Judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered  1114 Doth not even nature itself teach you that if a
man have long hair it is a shame unto him  1115 But if a woman have
long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a
covering

1116 But if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom
neither the churches of God

1117 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not that ye
come together not for the better but for the worse

1118 For first of all when ye come together in the church I hear
that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it

1119 For there must be also heresies among you that they which are
approved may be made manifest among you

1120 When ye come together therefore into one place this is not to
eat the Lords supper

1121 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and
one is hungry and another is drunken

1122 What have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye
the church of God and shame them that have not What shall I say to
you shall I praise you in this I praise you not

1123 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread 1124 And when he had given thanks he brake it and said
Take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in
remembrance of me

1125 After the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped
saying This cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft
as ye drink it in remembrance of me

1126 For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do
shew the Lords death till he come

1127 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of
the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord

1128 But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread
and drink of that cup

1129 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself not discerning the Lords body

1130 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many
sleep

1131 For if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged

1132 But when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we
should not be condemned with the world

1133 Wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one
for another

1134 And if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not
together unto condemnation And the rest will I set in order when I
come

121 Now concerning spiritual gifts brethren I would not have you
ignorant

122 Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb
idols even as ye were led

123 Wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed and that no man can say that
Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost

124 Now there are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit

125 And there are differences of administrations but the same Lord

126 And there are diversities of operations but it is the same God
which worketh all in all

127 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal
