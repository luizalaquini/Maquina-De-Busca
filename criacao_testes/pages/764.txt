15 And your eyes shall see and ye shall say The LORD will be
magnified from the border of Israel

16 A son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then I be
a father where is mine honour and if I be a master where is my
fear saith the LORD of hosts unto you O priests that despise my
name And ye say Wherein have we despised thy name  17 Ye offer
polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say Wherein have we polluted
thee In that ye say The table of the LORD is contemptible

18 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye
offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy
governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith
the LORD of hosts

19 And now I pray you beseech God that he will be gracious unto us
this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the
LORD of hosts

110 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought
neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought I have no pleasure
in you saith the LORD of hosts neither will I accept an offering at
your hand

111 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
same my name shall be great among the Gentiles and in every place
incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my
name shall be great among the heathen saith the LORD of hosts

112 But ye have profaned it in that ye say The table of the LORD is
polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible

113 Ye said also Behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed
at it saith the LORD of hosts and ye brought that which was torn
and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should I
accept this of your hand saith the LORD

114 But cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and
voweth and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing for I am a
great King saith the LORD of hosts and my name is dreadful among the
heathen

21 And now O ye priests this commandment is for you

22 If ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give
glory unto my name saith the LORD of hosts I will even send a curse
upon you and I will curse your blessings yea I have cursed them
already because ye do not lay it to heart

23 Behold I will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces
even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with
it

24 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you that
my covenant might be with Levi saith the LORD of hosts

25 My covenant was with him of life and peace and I gave them to him
for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name

26 The law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in
his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many
away from iniquity

27 For the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek
the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts

28 But ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble
at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi saith the LORD of
hosts

29 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all
the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been
partial in the law

210 Have we not all one father hath not one God created us why do
we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the
covenant of our fathers  211 Judah hath dealt treacherously and an
abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem for Judah hath
profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved and hath married the
daughter of a strange god

212 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the
scholar out of the tabernacles of Jacob and him that offereth an
offering unto the LORD of hosts

213 And this have ye done again covering the altar of the LORD with
tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth
not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your
hand

214 Yet ye say Wherefore Because the LORD hath been witness between
thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant

215 And did not he make one Yet had he the residue of the spirit
And wherefore one That he might seek a godly seed Therefore take
heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife
of his youth

216 For the LORD the God of Israel saith that he hateth putting
