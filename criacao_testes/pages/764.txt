The big man shrugged I was Joffrey’s sworn shield The butcher’s boy attacked a prince of the blood

That’s a lie Arya squirmed in Harwin’s grip It was me I hit Joffrey and threw Lion’s Paw in the river Mycah just ran away like I told him

Did you see the boy attack Prince Joffrey Lord Beric Dondarrion asked the Hound

I heard it from the royal lips It’s not my place to question princes Clegane jerked his hands toward Arya This one’s own sister told the same tale when she stood before your precious Robert

Sansa’s just a liar Arya said furious at her sister all over again It wasn’t like she said It wasn’t

Thoros drew Lord Beric aside The two men stood talking in low whispers while Arya seethed They have to kill him I prayed for him to die hundreds and hundreds of times

Beric Dondarrion turned back to the Hound You stand accused of murder but no one here knows the truth or falsehood of the charge so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by battle

The Hound frowned suspiciously as if he did not trust his ears Are you a fool or a madman

Neither I am a just lord Prove your innocence with a blade and you shall be free to go

No Arya cried before Harwin covered her mouth No they can’t he’ll go free The Hound was deadly with a sword everyone knew that He’ll laugh at them she thought

And so he did a long rasping laugh that echoed off the cave walls a laugh choking with contempt So who will it be He looked at Lem Lemoncloak The brave man in the piss-yellow cloak No How about you Huntsman You’ve kicked dogs before try me He saw Greenbeard You’re big enough Tyrosh step forward Or do you mean to make the little girl fight me herself He laughed again Come on who wants to die

It’s me you’ll face said Lord Beric Dondarrion

Arya remembered all the tales He can’t be killed she thought hoping against hope The Mad Huntsman sliced apart the ropes that bound Sandor Clegane’s hands together I’ll need sword and armor The Hound rubbed a torn wrist

Your sword you shall have declared Lord Beric but your innocence must be your armor

Clegane’s mouth twitched My innocence against your breastplate is that the way of it

Ned help me remove my breastplate

Arya got goosebumps when Lord Beric said her father’s name but this Ned was only a boy a fair-haired squire no more than ten or twelve He stepped up quickly to undo the clasps that fastened the battered steel about the Marcher lord The quilting beneath was rotten with age and sweat and fell away when the metal was pulled loose Gendry sucked in his breath Mother have mercy

Lord Beric’s ribs were outlined starkly beneath his skin A puckered crater scarred his breast just above his left nipple and when he turned to call for sword and shield Arya saw a matching scar upon his back The lance went through him The Hound had seen it too Is he scared Arya wanted him to be scared before he died as scared as Mycah must have been

Ned fetched Lord Beric his swordbelt and a long black surcoat It was meant to be worn over armor so it draped his body loosely but across it crackled the forked purple lightning of his House He unsheathed his sword and gave the belt back to his squire

Thoros brought the Hound his swordbelt Does a dog have honor the priest asked Lest you think to cut your way free of here or seize some child for a hostage… Anguy Dennet Kyle feather him at the first sign of treachery Only when the three bowmen had notched their shafts did Thoros hand Clegane the belt

The Hound ripped the sword free and threw away the scabbard The Mad Huntsman gave him his oaken shield all studded with iron and painted yellow the three black dogs of Clegane emblazoned upon it The boy Ned helped Lord Beric with his own shield so hacked and battered that the purple lightning and the scatter of stars upon it had almost been obliterated

But when the Hound made to step toward his foe Thoros of Myr stopped him First we pray He turned toward the fire and lifted his arms Lord of Light look down upon us

All around the cave the brotherhood without banners lifted their own voices in response Lord of Light defend us

Lord of Light protect us in the darkness

Lord of Light shine your face upon us

Light your flame among us R’hllor said the red priest Show us the truth or falseness of this man Strike him down if he is guilty and give strength to his sword if he is true Lord of Light give us wisdom

For the night is dark the others chanted Harwin and Anguy loud as all the rest and full of terrors
