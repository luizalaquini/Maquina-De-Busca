2917 Leah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well
favoured

2918 And Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve thee seven years
for Rachel thy younger daughter

2919 And Laban said It is better that I give her to thee than that
I should give her to another man abide with me

2920 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto
him but a few days for the love he had to her

2921 And Jacob said unto Laban Give me my wife for my days are
fulfilled that I may go in unto her

2922 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a
feast

2923 And it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah his
daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her

2924 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid

2925 And it came to pass that in the morning behold it was Leah
and he said to Laban What is this thou hast done unto me did not I
serve with thee for Rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
2926 And Laban said It must not be so done in our country to give
the younger before the firstborn

2927 Fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years

2928 And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him Rachel
his daughter to wife also

2929 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid

2930 And he went in also unto Rachel and he loved also Rachel more
than Leah and served with him yet seven other years

2931 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated he opened her womb
but Rachel was barren

2932 And Leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name
Reuben for she said Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction
now therefore my husband will love me

2933 And she conceived again and bare a son and said Because the
LORD hath heard I was hated he hath therefore given me this son also
and she called his name Simeon

2934 And she conceived again and bare a son and said Now this time
will my husband be joined unto me because I have born him three sons
therefore was his name called Levi

2935 And she conceived again and bare a son and she said Now will
I praise the LORD therefore she called his name Judah and left
bearing

301 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children Rachel
envied her sister and said unto Jacob Give me children or else I
die

302 And Jacobs anger was kindled against Rachel and he said Am I
in Gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
303 And she said Behold my maid Bilhah go in unto her and she
shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her

304 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife and Jacob went in
unto her

305 And Bilhah conceived and bare Jacob a son

306 And Rachel said God hath judged me and hath also heard my
voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name Dan

307 And Bilhah Rachels maid conceived again and bare Jacob a second
son

308 And Rachel said With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
sister and I have prevailed and she called his name Naphtali

309 When Leah saw that she had left bearing she took Zilpah her
maid and gave her Jacob to wife

3010 And Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob a son

3011 And Leah said A troop cometh and she called his name Gad

3012 And Zilpah Leahs maid bare Jacob a second son

3013 And Leah said Happy am I for the daughters will call me
blessed and she called his name Asher

3014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found
mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother Leah Then
Rachel said to Leah Give me I pray thee of thy sons mandrakes
