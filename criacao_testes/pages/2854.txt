3437 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands
among us and multiplieth his words against God

351 Elihu spake moreover and said 352 Thinkest thou this to be
right that thou saidst My righteousness is more than Gods  353
For thou saidst What advantage will it be unto thee and What profit
shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin  354 I will answer thee
and thy companions with thee

355 Look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are
higher than thou

356 If thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy
transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him  357 If thou
be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine
hand  358 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy
righteousness may profit the son of man

359 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty

3510 But none saith Where is God my maker who giveth songs in the
night 3511 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and
maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven  3512 There they cry but
none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men

3513 Surely God will not hear vanity neither will the Almighty
regard it

3514 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is
before him therefore trust thou in him

3515 But now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet
he knoweth it not in great extremity 3516 Therefore doth Job open
his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge

361 Elihu also proceeded and said 362 Suffer me a little and I
will shew thee that I have yet to speak on Gods behalf

363 I will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe
righteousness to my Maker

364 For truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in
knowledge is with thee

365 Behold God is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in
strength and wisdom

366 He preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the
poor

367 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings
are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they
are exalted

368 And if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of
affliction 369 Then he sheweth them their work and their
transgressions that they have exceeded

3610 He openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that
they return from iniquity

3611 If they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in
prosperity and their years in pleasures

3612 But if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they
shall die without knowledge

3613 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he
bindeth them

3614 They die in youth and their life is among the unclean

3615 He delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears
in oppression

3616 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be
set on thy table should be full of fatness

3617 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and
justice take hold on thee

3618 Because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his
stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee

3619 Will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of
strength

3620 Desire not the night when people are cut off in their place

3621 Take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather
than affliction

3622 Behold God exalteth by his power who teacheth like him  3623
Who hath enjoined him his way or who can say Thou hast wrought
iniquity  3624 Remember that thou magnify his work which men
behold

3625 Every man may see it man may behold it afar off
