opinion and I want to explain something-i have
longed to do it ever since I returned and you looked so
gravely at me For if I were to die -- and I may die
soon -- it would be dreadful that you should always think
mistakenly of me Now listen
Gabriel ceased his rustling
I went to Bath that night in the full intention of
breaking off my engagement to Mr Troy It was owing
to circumstances which occurred after I got there that
 -- that we were married Now do you see the matter
in a new light
 I do -- somewhat
 I must I suppose say more now that I have
begun And perhaps its no harm for you are certainly
under no delusion that I ever loved you or that I can
have any object in speaking more than that object I
have mentioned Well I was alone in a strange city
and the horse was lame And at last I didnt know
what to do I saw when it was too late that scandal
might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that
way But I was coming away when he suddenly said
he had that day seen a woman more beautiful than I
and that his constancy could not be counted on unless
I at once became his And I was grieved and
troubled --  --  She cleared her voice and waited a
moment as if to gather breath  And then between
jealousy and distraction I married him   she whispered
with desperate impetuosity
Gabriel made no reply
He was not to blame for it was perfectly true about
 -- about his seeing somebody else she quickly added
And now I dont wish for a single remark from you
upon the subject --
P 312
indeed I forbid it I only wanted
you to know that misunderstood bit of my history before
a time comes when you could never know it -- You want
some more sheaves  
She went down the ladder and the work proceeded
Gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of
his mistress up and down and he said to her gently as
a mother --
I think you had better go indoors now you are
tired I can finish the rest alone If the wind does
not change the rain is likely to keep off
If I am useless I will go said Bathsheba in a
flagging cadence But O if your life should be lost 
 You are not useless but I would rather not tire
you longer You have done well
And you better   she said gratefully  Thank you
for your devotion a thousand times Gabriel  Good+
night-i know you are doing your very best for me
She diminished in the gloom and vanished and he
heard the latch of the gate fall as she passed through
He worked in a reverie now musing upon her story and
upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart which
had caused her to speak more warmly to him to-night
than she ever had done whilst unmarried and free to
speak as warmly as she chose
He was disturbed in his meditation by a grating
noise from the coach-house It was the vane on the
roof turning round and this change in the wind was the
signal for a disastrous rain
RAIN

RAIN -- ONE SOLITARY MEETS ANOTHER
IT was now five oclock and the dawn was promising
to break in hues of drab and ash
The air changed its temperature and stirred itself
more vigorously Cool breezes coursed in transparent
eddies round Oaks face The wind shifted yet a point
or two and blew stronger In ten minutes every wind
of heaven seemed to be roaming at large Some of the
thatching on the wheat-stacks was now whirled fantas+
tically aloft and had to be replaced and weighted with
some rails that lay near at hand This done Oak slaved
away again at the barley A huge drop of rain smote
his face the wind snarled round every corner the trees
rocked to the bases of their trunks and the twigs clashed
in strife Driving in spars at any point and on any
system inch by inch he covered more and more safely
from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred
pounds The rain came on in earnest and Oak soon felt
the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down
his back Ultimately he was reduced welinigh to a
homogeneous sop and the dyes of his clothes trickled
down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder
The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo+
sphere in liquid spines unbroken in continuity between
their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him
Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before
this time he had been fighting against fire in the same
spot as desperately as he was fighting against water
now -- and for a futile love of the same woman As for
her --  --  But Oak was generous and true and dis+
missed his reflections
It was about seven oclock in the dark leaden
morning when Gabriel came down from the last stack
and thankfully exclaimed It is done   He was
