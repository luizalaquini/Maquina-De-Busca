shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to
wife

2115 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people for I the
LORD do sanctify him

2116 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 2117 Speak unto Aaron
saying Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any
blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his God

2118 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish he shall not
approach a blind man or a lame or he that hath a flat nose or any
thing superfluous 2119 Or a man that is brokenfooted or
brokenhanded 2120 Or crookbackt or a dwarf or that hath a blemish
in his eye or be scurvy or scabbed or hath his stones broken 2121
No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come
nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire he hath a
blemish he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God

2122 He shall eat the bread of his God both of the most holy and of
the holy

2123 Only he shall not go in unto the vail nor come nigh unto the
altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries
for I the LORD do sanctify them

2124 And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the
children of Israel

221 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 222 Speak unto Aaron and
to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
children of Israel and that they profane not my holy name in those
things which they hallow unto me I am the LORD

223 Say unto them Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
generations that goeth unto the holy things which the children of
Israel hallow unto the LORD having his uncleanness upon him that
soul shall be cut off from my presence I am the LORD

224 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper or hath a
running issue he shall not eat of the holy things until he be clean
And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead or a man
whose seed goeth from him 225 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping
thing whereby he may be made unclean or a man of whom he may take
uncleanness whatsoever uncleanness he hath 226 The soul which hath
touched any such shall be unclean until even and shall not eat of the
holy things unless he wash his flesh with water

227 And when the sun is down he shall be clean and shall afterward
eat of the holy things because it is his food

228 That which dieth of itself or is torn with beasts he shall not
eat to defile himself therewith I am the LORD

229 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance lest they bear sin for
it and die therefore if they profane it I the LORD do sanctify
them

2210 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing a sojourner of
the priest or an hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing

2211 But if the priest buy any soul with his money he shall eat of
it and he that is born in his house they shall eat of his meat

2212 If the priests daughter also be married unto a stranger she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things

2213 But if the priests daughter be a widow or divorced and have
no child and is returned unto her fathers house as in her youth
she shall eat of her fathers meat but there shall be no stranger eat
thereof

2214 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly then he shall
put the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give it unto the priest
with the holy thing

2215 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
Israel which they offer unto the LORD 2216 Or suffer them to bear
the iniquity of trespass when they eat their holy things for I the
LORD do sanctify them

2217 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 2218 Speak unto Aaron
and to his sons and unto all the children of Israel and say unto
them Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel or of the strangers in
Israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his
freewill offerings which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt
offering 2219 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without
blemish of the beeves of the sheep or of the goats

2220 But whatsoever hath a blemish that shall ye not offer for it
shall not be acceptable for you

2221 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
LORD to accomplish his vow or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep
it shall be perfect to be accepted there shall be no blemish therein

2222 Blind or broken or maimed or having a wen or scurvy or
scabbed ye shall not offer these unto the LORD nor make an offering
by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD
