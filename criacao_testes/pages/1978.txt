These extremely crude and simplistic rules are really the most that one can do
without subjecting the utterance to a complicated semantic analysis
In statistical terms they are actually remarkably effective
Table 92 shows part of a spontaneous monologue which was transcribed by
Halliday and appears in his teaching text on intonation

Halliday 1970 Course in Spoken English Intonation

Among the prosodic markers are some that were not introduced in Chapter 8
Firstly each tone group has secondary contours which are identified
by 1+ 1- for tone group 1 and so on
Secondly the mark  is used to indicate a pause which disrupts
the speech rhythm
Notice that its positioning belies the advice of the old elocutionists

Thirdly compound tone groups such as 13 appear which contain
ul
two
tonic syllables
This differs from a simple concatenation of tone groups
with contours 1 and 3 in this case because the second is in some sense subsidiary to
the first
Typically it forms an adjunct clause while the first clause gives the
main information  Halliday provides many examples such as
LB
NI

NI

LE
But he does not comment on the
ul
acoustic
difference between a compound tone group and a concatenation of simple ones em
which is after all the information needed for synthesis
A final minor difference between Hallidays scheme and that outlined earlier
is that he compels tone group boundaries to occur at the beginning
of a foot
