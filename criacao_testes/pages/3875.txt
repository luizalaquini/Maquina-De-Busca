It was a relief when the musicians began to play The tiny jousters led dog and sow from the hall the guests returned to their trenchers of brawn and Tyrion called for another cup of wine But suddenly he felt Ser Garlan’s hand on his sleeve My lord beware the knight warned The king

Tyrion turned in his seat Joffrey was almost upon him red-faced and staggering wine slopping over the rim of the great golden wedding chalice he carried in both hands Your Grace was all he had time to say before the king upended the chalice over his head The wine washed down over his face in a red torrent It drenched his hair stung his eyes burned in his wound ran down his cheeks and soaked the velvet of his new doublet How do you like that Imp Joffrey mocked

Tyrion’s eyes were on fire He dabbed at his face with the back of a sleeve and tried to blink the world back into clarity That was ill done Your Grace he heard Ser Garlan say quietly

Not at all Ser Garlan Tyrion dare not let this grow any uglier than it was not here with half the realm looking on Not every king would think to honor a humble subject by serving him from his own royal chalice A pity the wine spilled

It didn’t spill said Joffrey too graceless to take the retreat Tyrion offered him And I wasn’t serving you either

Queen Margaery appeared suddenly at Joffrey’s elbow My sweet king the Tyrell girl entreated come return to your place there’s another singer waiting

Alaric of Eysen said Lady Olenna Tyrell leaning on her cane and taking no more notice of the wine-soaked dwarf than her granddaughter had done I do so hope he plays us ‘The Rains of Castamere’ It has been an hour I’ve forgotten how it goes

Ser Addam has a toast he wants to make as well said Margaery Your Grace please

I have no wine Joffrey declared How can I drink a toast if I have no wine Uncle Imp you can serve me Since you won’t joust you’ll be my cupbearer

I would be most honored

It’s not meant to be an honor Joffrey screamed Bend down and pick up my chalice Tyrion did as he was bid but as he reached for the handle Joff kicked the chalice through his legs Pick it up Are you as clumsy as you are ugly He had to crawl under the table to find the thing Good now fill it with wine He claimed a flagon from a serving girl and filled the goblet three-quarters full No on your knees dwarf Kneeling Tyrion raised up the heavy cup wondering if he was about to get a second bath But Joffrey took the wedding chalice one-handed drank deep and set it on the table You can get up now Uncle

His legs cramped as he tried to rise and almost spilled him again Tyrion had to grab hold of a chair to steady himself Ser Garlan lent him a hand Joffrey laughed and Cersei as well Then others He could not see who but he heard them

Your Grace Lord Tywin’s voice was impeccably correct They are bringing in the pie Your sword is needed

The pie Joffrey took his queen by the hand Come my lady it’s the pie

The guests stood shouting and applauding and smashing their wine cups together as the great pie made its slow way down the length of the hall wheeled along by a half-dozen beaming cooks Two yards across it was crusty and golden brown and they could hear squeaks and thumpings coming from inside it

Tyrion pulled himself back into his chair All he needed now was for a dove to shit on him and his day would be complete The wine had soaked through his doublet and smallclothes and he could feel the wetness against his skin He ought to change but no one was permitted to leave the feast until the time came for the bedding ceremony That was still a good twenty or thirty dishes off he judged

King Joffrey and his queen met the pie below the dais As Joff drew his sword Margaery laid a hand on his arm to restrain him Widow’s Wail was not meant for slicing pies

True Joffrey lifted his voice Ser Ilyn your sword

From the shadows at the back of the hall Ser Ilyn Payne appeared The specter at the feast thought Tyrion as he watched the King’s Justice stride forward gaunt and grim He had been too young to have known Ser Ilyn before he’d lost his tongue He would have been a different man in those days but now the silence is as much a part of him as those hollow eyes that rusty chainmail shirt and the greatsword on his back

Ser Ilyn bowed before the king and queen reached back over his shoulder and drew forth six feet of ornate silver bright with runes He knelt to offer the huge blade to Joffrey hilt first points of red fire winked from ruby eyes on the pommel a chunk of dragonglass carved in the shape of a grinning skull

Sansa stirred in her seat What sword is that

Tyrion’s eyes still stung from the wine He blinked and looked again Ser Ilyn’s greatsword was as long and wide as Ice but it was too silvery-bright Valyrian steel had a darkness to it a smokiness in its soul Sansa clutched his arm What has Ser Ilyn done with my father’s sword

I should have sent Ice back to Robb Stark Tyrion thought He glanced at his father but Lord Tywin was watching the king

Joffrey and Margaery joined hands to lift the greatsword and swung it down together in a silvery arc When the piecrust broke the doves burst forth in a swirl of white feathers scattering in every direction flapping for the windows and the rafters A roar of delight went up from the benches and the fiddlers and pipers in the gallery began to play a sprightly tune Joff took his bride in his arms and whirled her around merrily

A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream The pigeons were well and truly cooked in this pie but he found them no more appetizing than the white ones fluttering about the hall Sansa was not eating either You’re deathly pale my lady Tyrion said You need a breath of cool air and I need a fresh doublet He stood and offered her his hand Come

But before they could make their retreat Joffrey was back Uncle where are you going You’re my cupbearer remember

I need to change into fresh garb Your Grace May I have your leave

No I like the look of you this way Serve me my wine

The king’s chalice was on the table where he’d left it Tyrion had to climb back onto his chair to reach it Joff yanked it from his hands and drank long and deep his throat working as the wine ran purple down his chin My lord Margaery said we should return to our places Lord Buckler wants to toast us

My uncle hasn’t eaten his pigeon pie Holding the chalice one-handed Joff jammed his other into Tyrion’s pie It’s ill luck not to eat the pie he scolded as he filled his mouth with hot spiced pigeon See it’s good Spitting out flakes of crust he coughed and helped himself to another fistful Dry though Needs washing down Joff took a swallow of wine and coughed again more violently I want to see kof see you ride that kof kof pig Uncle I want… His words broke up in a fit of coughing

Margaery looked at him with concern Your Grace

It’s kof the pie noth—kof pie Joff took another drink or tried to but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled him over His face was turning red I kof I can’t kof kof kof kof… The chalice slipped from his hand and dark red wine went running across the dais

He’s choking Queen Margaery gasped

Her grandmother moved to her side Help the poor boy the Queen of Thorns screeched in a voice ten times her size Dolts Will you all stand about gaping Help your king

Ser Garlan shoved Tyrion aside and began to pound Joffrey on the back Ser Osmund Kettleblack ripped open the king’s collar A fearful high thin sound emerged from the boy’s throat the sound of a man trying to suck a river through a reed then it stopped and that was more terrible still Turn him over Mace Tyrell bellowed at everyone and no one Turn him over shake him by his heels A different voice was calling Water give him some water The High Septon began to pray loudly Grand Maester Pycelle shouted for someone to help him back to his chambers to fetch his potions Joffrey began to claw at his throat his nails tearing bloody gouges in the flesh Beneath the skin the muscles stood out hard as stone Prince Tommen was screaming and crying

He is going to die Tyrion realized He felt curiously calm though pandemonium raged all about him They were pounding Joff on the back again but his face was only growing darker Dogs were barking children were wailing men were shouting useless advice at each other Half the wedding guests were on their feet some shoving at each other for a better view others rushing for the doors in their haste to get away

Ser Meryn pried the king’s mouth open to jam a spoon down his throat As he did the boy’s eyes met Tyrion’s He has Jaime’s eyes Only he had never seen Jaime look so scared The boy’s only thirteen Joffrey was making a dry clacking noise trying to speak His eyes bulged white with terror and he lifted a hand… reaching for his uncle or pointing… Is he begging my forgiveness or does he think I can save him Noooo Cersei wailed Father help him someone help him my son my son…

Tyrion found himself thinking of Robb Stark My own wedding is looking much better in hindsight He looked to see how Sansa was taking this but there was so much confusion in the hall that he could not find her But his eyes fell on the wedding chalice forgotten on the floor He went and scooped it up There was still a half-inch of deep purple wine in the bottom of it Tyrion considered it a moment then poured it on the floor

Margaery Tyrell was weeping in her grandmother’s arms as the old lady said Be brave be brave Most of the musicians had fled but one last flutist in the gallery was blowing a dirge In the rear of the throne room scuffling had broken out around the doors and the guests were trampling on each other Ser Addam’s gold cloaks moved in to restore order Guests were rushing headlong out into the night some weeping some stumbling and retching others white with fear It occurred to Tyrion belatedly that it might be wise to leave himself

When he heard Cersei’s scream he knew that it was over

I should leave Now Instead he waddled toward her

His sister sat in a puddle of wine cradling her son’s body Her gown was tom and stained her face white as chalk A thin black dog crept up beside her sniffing at Joffrey’s corpse The boy is gone Cersei Lord Tywin said He put his gloved hand on his daughter’s shoulder as one of his guardsmen shooed away the dog Unhand him now Let him go She did not hear It took two Kingsguard to pry loose her fingers so the body of King Joffrey Baratheon could slide limp and lifeless to the floor

The High Septon knelt beside him Father Above judge our good King Joffrey justly he intoned beginning the prayer for the dead Margaery Tyrell began to sob and Tyrion heard her mother Lady Alerie saying He choked sweetling He choked on the pie It was naught to do with you He choked We all saw

He did not choke Cersei’s voice was sharp as Ser Ilyn’s sword My son was poisoned She looked to the white knights standing helplessly around her Kingsguard do your duty

My lady said Ser Loras Tyrell uncertain

Arrest my brother she commanded him He did this the dwarf Him and his little wife They killed my son Your king Take them Take them both





Sansa


Far across the city a bell began to toll
