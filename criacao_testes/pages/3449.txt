Halder lifted the sword for another blow Cut us off a ham Rast urged laughing

Jon shook off Pyp’s hand Halder enough

Halder looked to Ser Alliser

The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble the master-at-arms said in that sharp cold voice of his I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here Lord Snow

Look at him Halder Jon urged ignoring Thorne as best he could There’s no honor in beating a fallen foe He yielded He knelt beside the fat boy

Halder lowered his sword He yielded he echoed

Ser Alliser’s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow It would seem our Bastard is in love he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet Show me your steel Lord Snow

Jon drew his longsword He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point and he feared he was well beyond it now

Thorne smiled The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love so we shall make an exercise of it Rat Pimple help our Stone Head here Rast and Albett moved to join Halder Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal All you need do is get past the Bastard

Stay behind me Jon said to the fat boy Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him but never three He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight He braced himself for the assault

Suddenly Pyp was beside him Three to two will make for better sport the small boy said cheerfully He dropped his visor and slid out his sword Before Jon could even think to protest Grenn had stepped up to make a third

The yard had grown deathly quiet Jon could feel Ser Alliser’s eyes Why are you waiting he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft but it was Jon who moved first Halder barely got his sword up in time

Jon drove him backward attacking with every blow keeping the older boy on the heels Know your foe Ser Rodrik had taught him once Jon knew Halder brutally strong but short of patience with no taste for defense Frustrate him and he would leave himself open as certain as sunset

The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him Jon blocked a savage cut at his head the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together He slammed a sidestroke into Halder’s ribs and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder Chainmail crunched and pain flared up his neck but for an instant Halder was unbalanced Jon cut his left leg from under him and he fell with a curse and a crash

Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him giving Albett more than he cared for but Pyp was hard-pressed Rast had two years and forty pounds on him Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper’s helm like a bell As Rast went reeling Pyp slid in under his guard knocked him down and leveled a blade at his throat By then Jon had moved on Facing two swords Albett backed away I yield he shouted

Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust The mummer’s farce has gone on long enough for today He walked away The session was at an end

Dareon helped Halder to his feet The quarryman’s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard For an instant I thought I finally had you Snow

For an instant you did Jon replied Under his mail and leather his shoulder was throbbing He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm but when he raised his arm the pain made him grit his teeth

Let me a voice said Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently Did he hurt you

I’ve been bruised before He touched his shoulder and winced The yard was emptying around them

Blood matted the fat boy’s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder My name is Samwell Tarly of Horn… He stopped and licked his lips I mean I was of Horn Hill until I… left I’ve come to take the black My father is Lord Randyll a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden I used to be his heir only… His voice trailed off

I’m Jon Snow Ned Stark’s bastard of Winterfell

Samwell Tarly nodded I… if you want you can call me Sam My mother calls me Sam

You can call him Lord Snow Pyp said as he came up to join them You don’t want to know what his mother calls him

These two are Grenn and Pypar Jon said

Grenn’s the ugly one Pyp said

Grenn scowled You’re uglier than me At least I don’t have ears like a bat

My thanks to all of you the fat boy said gravely

Why didn’t you get up and fight Grenn demanded

I wanted to truly I just… I couldn’t I didn’t want him to hit me anymore He looked at the ground I… I fear I’m a coward My lord father always said so

Grenn looked thunderstruck Even Pyp had no words to say to that and Pyp had words for everything What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward

Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces His eyes met Jon’s and darted away quick as frightened animals I… I’m sorry he said I don’t mean to… to be like I am He walked heavily toward the armory

Jon called after him You were hurt he said Tomorrow you’ll do better

Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder No I won’t he said blinking back tears I never do better

When he was gone Grenn frowned Nobody likes cravens he said uncomfortably I wish we hadn’t helped him What if they think we’re craven too

You’re too stupid to be craven Pyp told him

I am not Grenn said

Yes you are If a bear attacked you in the woods you’d be too stupid to run away

I would not Grenn insisted I’d run away faster than you He stopped suddenly scowling when he saw Pyp’s grin and realized what he’d just said His thick neck flushed a dark red Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory hung up his sword and stripped off his battered armor

Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns the mornings were for swordplay the afternoons for work The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks to learn where their skills lay Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander’s table but for every day spent hunting he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword Other times he ran messages stood at guard mucked out stables fletched arrows assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories

That afternoon the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall It was lonely and boring work even with Ghost along for company but Jon found he did not mind On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall and the air was always cold and bracing He could think here and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly… and oddly of Tyrion Lannister He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it the dwarf had told him grinning The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had

His sore shoulder made the work go slowly It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths He lingered on high to watch the sun go down turning the western sky the color of blood Finally as dusk was settling over the north Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him

The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall laughing Pyp was in the middle of a story The mummer’s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices and he did not tell his tales so much as live them playing all the parts as needed a king one moment and a swineherd the next When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp’s antics as anyone… yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench where Samwell Tarly sat alone as far from the others as he could get

He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him The fat boy’s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost Is that a wolf

A direwolf Jon said His name is Ghost The direwolf is the sigil of my father’s House

Ours is a striding huntsman Samwell Tarly said

Do you like to hunt

The fat boy shuddered I hate it He looked as though he was going to cry again

What’s wrong now Jon asked him Why are you always so frightened

Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head too scared even to talk A burst of laughter filled the hall Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice He stood Let’s go outside
