Fight with them Qhorin had said before he surrendered his own life to Longclaw… but it had not come to that till now Once I shed a brother’s blood I am lost I cross the Wall for good then and there is no crossing back

After each day’s march the Magnar summoned him to ask shrewd sharp questions about Castle Black its garrison and defenses Jon lied where he dared and feigned ignorance a few times but Grigg the Goat and Errok listened as well and they knew enough to make Jon careful Too blatant a lie would betray him

But the truth was terrible Castle Black had no defenses but for the Wall itself It lacked even wooden palisades or earthen dikes The castle was nothing more than a cluster of towers and keeps two-thirds of them falling into ruin As for the garrison the Old Bear had taken two hundred on his ranging Had any returned Jon could not know Perhaps four hundred remained at the castle but most of those were builders or stewards not rangers

The Thenns were hardened warriors and more disciplined than the common run of wildling no doubt that was why Mance had chosen them The defenders of Castle Black would include blind Maester Aemon and his half-blind steward Clydas one-armed Donal Noye drunken Septon Cellador Deaf Dick Follard Three-Finger Hobb the cook old Ser Wynton Stout as well as Halder and Toad and Pyp and Albett and the rest of the boys who’d trained with Jon And commanding them would be red-faced Bowen Marsh the plump Lord Steward who had been made castellan in Lord Mormont’s absence Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh the Old Pomegranate which fit him just as well as the Old Bear fit Mormont He’s the man you want in front when the foes are in the field Edd would say in his usual dour voice He’ll count them right up for you A regular demon for counting that one

If the Magnar takes Castle Black unawares it will be red slaughter boys butchered in their beds before they know they are under attack Jon had to warn them but how He was never sent out to forage or hunt nor allowed to stand a watch alone And he feared for Ygritte as well He could not take her but if he left her would the Magnar make her answer for his treachery Two hearts that beat as one…

They shared the same sleeping skins every night and he went to sleep with her head against his chest and her red hair tickling his chin The smell of her had become a part of him Her crooked teeth the feel of her breast when he cupped it in his hand the taste of her mouth… they were his joy and his despair Many a night he lay with Ygritte warm beside him wondering if his lord father had felt this confused about his mother whoever she had been Ygritte set the trap and Mance Rayder pushed me into it

Every day he spent among the wildlings made what he had to do that much harder He was going to have to find some way to betray these men and when he did they would die He did not want their friendship any more than he wanted Ygritte’s love And yet… the Thenns spoke the Old Tongue and seldom talked to Jon at all but it was different with Jarl’s raiders the men who’d climbed the Wall Jon was coming to know them despite himself gaunt quiet Errok and gregarious Grigg the Goat the boys Quort and Bodger Hempen Dan the ropemaker The worst of the lot was Del a horsefaced youth near Jon’s own age who would talk dreamily of this wildling girl he meant to steal She’s lucky like your Ygritte She’s kissed by fire

Jon had to bite his tongue He didn’t want to know about Del’s girl or Bodger’s mother the place by the sea that Henk the Helm came from how Grigg yearned to visit the green men on the Isle of Faces or the time a moose had chased Toefinger up a tree He didn’t want to hear about the boil on Big Boil’s arse how much ale Stone Thumbs could drink or how Quort’s little brother had begged him not to go with Jarl Quort could not have been older than fourteen though he’d already stolen himself a wife and had a child on the way Might be he’ll be born in some castle the boy boasted Born in a castle like a lord He was very taken with the castles they’d seen by which he meant watchtowers

Jon wondered where Ghost was now Had he gone to Castle Black or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods He had no sense of the direwolf not even in his dreams It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him he felt alone He did not want to die alone

By that afternoon the trees had begun to thin and they marched east over gently rolling plains Grass rose waist high around them and stands of wild wheat swayed gently when the wind came gusting but for the most part the day was warm and bright Toward sunset however clouds began to threaten in the west They soon engulfed the orange sun and Lenn foretold a bad storm coming His mother was a woods witch so all the raiders agreed he had a gift for foretelling the weather There’s a village close Grigg the Goat told the Magnar Two miles three We could shelter there Styr agreed at once

It was well past dark and the storm was raging by the time they reached the place The village sat beside a lake and had been so long abandoned that most of the houses had collapsed Even the small timber inn that must once have been a welcome sight for travelers stood half-fallen and roofless We will find scant shelter here Jon thought gloomily Whenever the lightning flashed he could see a stone roundtower rising from an island out in the lake but without boats they had no way to reach it

Errok and Del had crept ahead to scout the ruins but Del was back almost at once Styr halted the column and sent a dozen of his Thenns trotting forward spears in hand By then Jon had seen it too the glimmer of a fire reddening the chimney of the inn We are not alone Dread coiled inside him like a snake He heard a horse neigh and then shouts Ride with them eat with them fight with them Qhorin had said

But the fighting was done There’s only one of them Errok said when he came back An old man with a horse

The Magnar shouted commands in the Old Tongue and a score of his Thenns spread out to establish a perimeter around the village whilst others went prowling through the houses to make certain no one else was hiding amongst the weeds and tumbled stones The rest crowded into the roofless inn jostling each other to get closer to the hearth The broken branches the old man had been burning seemed to generate more smoke than heat but any warmth was welcome on such a wild rainy night Two of the Thenns had thrown the man to the ground and were going through his things Another held his horse while three more looted his saddlebags

Jon walked away A rotten apple squished beneath his heel Styr will kill him The Magnar had said as much at Greyguard any kneelers they met were to be put to death at once to make certain they could not raise the alarm Ride with them eat with them fight with them Did that mean he must stand mute and helpless while they slit an old man’s throat

Near the edge of the village Jon came face-to-face with one of the guards Styr had posted The Thenn growled something in the Old Tongue and pointed his spear back toward the inn Get back where you belong Jon guessed But where is that

He walked towards the water and discovered an almost dry spot beneath the leaning daub-and-wattle wall of a tumbledown cottage that had mostly tumbled down That was where Ygritte found him sitting staring off across the rain-whipped lake I know this place he told her when she sat beside him That tower… look at the top of it the next time the lightning flashes and tell me what you see

Aye if you like she said and then Some o’ the Thenns are saying they heard noises out there Shouting they say

Thunder

They say shouting Might be it’s ghosts

The holdfast did have a grim haunted look standing there black against the storm on its rocky island with the rain lashing at the lake all around it We could go out and take a look he suggested I doubt we could get much wetter than we are

Swimming In the storm She laughed at the notion Is this a trick t’ get the clothes off me Jon Snow

Do I need a trick for that now he teased Or is that you can’t swim a stroke Jon was a strong swimmer himself having learned the art as a boy in Winterfell’s great moat

Ygritte punched his arm You know nothing Jon Snow I’m half a fish I’ll have you know

Half fish half goat half horse… there’s too many halves to you Ygritte He shook his head We wouldn’t need to swim if this is the place I think We could walk

She pulled back and gave him a look Walk on water What southron sorcery is that

No sorc— he began as a huge bolt of lightning stabbed down from the sky and touched the surface of the lake For half a heartbeat the world was noonday bright The clap of thunder was so loud that Ygritte gasped and covered her ears
