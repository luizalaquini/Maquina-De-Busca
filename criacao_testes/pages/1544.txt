Boggs escorts me down to the Hangar but we dont
talk beyond a preliminary greeting Im grateful to be spared
another exchange about my disobedience in 8 especially
since his mask looks so uncomfortable
At the last moment I remember to send a message to
my mother about my leaving 13 and stress that it wont be
dangerous We board a hovercraft for the short ride to 12
and Im directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch Gale
and Cressida are poring over a map Plutarchs brimming
with satisfaction as he shows me the beforeafter effects of
the first couple of propos The rebels who were barely
maintaining a foothold in several districts have rallied They
have actually taken 3 and 11--the latter so crucial since its
Panems main food supplier--and have made inroads in
several other districts as well
Hopeful Very hopeful indeed says Plutarch
Fulvias going to have the first round of We Remember
spots ready tonight so we can target the individual districts
with their dead Finnicks absolutely marvelous
Its painful to watch actually says Cressida He
knew so many of them personally
Thats what makes it so effective says Plutarch
Straight from the heart Youre all doing beautifully Coin
could not be more pleased
Gale didnt tell them then About my pretending not to
see Peeta and my anger at their cover-up But I guess its
too little too late because I still cant let it go It doesnt
matter Hes not speaking to me either
Its not until we land in the Meadow that I realize
Haymitch isnt among our company When I ask Plutarch
about his absence he just shakes his head and says He
couldnt face it
Haymitch Not able to face something Wanted a
day off more likely I say
I think his actual words were I couldnt face it without a
bottle says Plutarch
I roll my eyes long out of patience with my mentor his
weakness for drink and what he can or cant confront But
about five minutes after my return to 12 Im wishing I had a
bottle myself I thought Id come to terms with 12s demise--
heard of it seen it from the air and wandered through its
ashes So why does everything bring on a fresh pang of
grief Was I simply too out of it before to fully register the
loss of my world Or is it the look on Gales face as he
takes in the destruction on foot that makes the atrocity feel
brand-new
Cressida directs the team to start with me at my old
house I ask her what she wants me to do Whatever you
feel like she says Standing back in my kitchen I dont feel
like doing anything In fact I find myself focusing up at the
sky--the only roof left--because too many memories are
drowning me After a while Cressida says Thats fine
Katniss Lets move on
Gale doesnt get off so easily at his old address
Cressida films him in silence for a few minutes but just as
he pulls the one remnant of his previous life from the ashes-
-a twisted metal poker--she starts to question him about his
family his job life in the Seam She makes him go back to
the night of the firebombing and reenact it starting at his
house working his way down across the Meadow and
through the woods to the lake I straggle behind the film
crew and the bodyguards feeling their presence to be a
violation of my beloved woods This is a private place a
sanctuary already corrupted by the Capitols evil Even
after weve left behind the charred stumps near the fence
were still tripping over decomposing bodies Do we have
to record it for everyone to see
By the time we reach the lake Gale seems to have lost
his ability to speak Everyones dripping in sweat--
especially Castor and Pollux in their insect shells--and
Cressida calls for a break I scoop up handfuls of water
from the lake wishing I could dive in and surface alone and
naked and unobserved I wander around the perimeter for a
while When I come back around to the little concrete house
beside the lake I pause in the doorway and see Gale
propping the crooked poker he salvaged against the wall
by the hearth For a moment I have an image of a lone
stranger sometime far in the future wandering lost in the
wilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge with
the pile of split logs the hearth the poker Wondering how
it came to be Gale turns and meets my eyes and I know
hes thinking about our last meeting here When we fought
over whether or not to run away If we had would District 12
still be there I think it would But the Capitol would still be
in control of Panem as well
Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat
them in the shade of the trees I intentionally sit at the far
edge of the group next to Pollux so I dont have to talk No
ones talking much really In the relative quiet the birds
take back the woods I nudge Pollux with my elbow and
point out a small black bird with a crown It hops to a new
branch momentarily opening its wings showing off its
white patches Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his
eyebrows questioningly I nod confirming its a mockingjay
I hold up one finger to say Wait Ill show you and whistle a
birdcall The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles the
call right back at me Then to my surprise Pollux whistles a
few notes of his own The bird answers him immediately
Polluxs face breaks into an expression of delight and he
has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay My
