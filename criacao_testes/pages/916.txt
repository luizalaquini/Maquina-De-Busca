A child said Sansa uncertainly

Lysa waved a hand negligently Not for many years You are too young to be a mother One day you shall want children though Just as you will want to marry

I… I am married my lady

Yes but soon a widow Be glad the Imp preferred his whores It would not be fitting for my son to take that dwarf’s leavings but as he never touched you… How would you like to marry your cousin the Lord Robert

The thought made Sansa weary All she knew of Robert Arryn was that he was a little boy and sickly It is not me she wants her son to marry it is my claim No one will ever marry me for love But lying came easy to her now I… can scarcely wait to meet him my lady But he is still a child is he not

He is eight And not robust But such a good boy so bright and clever He will be a great man Alayne The seed is strong my lord husband said before he died His last words The gods sometimes let us glimpse the future as we lay dying I see no reason why you should not be wed as soon as we know that your Lannister husband is dead A secret wedding to be sure The Lord of the Eyrie could scarcely be thought to have married a bastard that would not be fitting The ravens should bring us the word from King’s Landing once the Imp’s head rolls You and Robert can be wed the next day won’t that be joyous It will be good for him to have a little companion He played with Vardis Egen’s boy when we first returned to the Eyrie and my steward’s sons as well but they were much too rough and I had no choice but to send them away Do you read well Alayne

Septa Mordane was good enough to say so

Robert has weak eyes but he loves to be read to Lady Lysa confided He likes stories about animals the best Do you know the little song about the chicken who dressed as a fox I sing him that all the time he never grows tired of it And he likes to play hopfrog and spin-the-sword and come-into-my-castle but you must always let him win That’s only proper don’t you think He is the Lord of the Eyrie after all you must never forget that You are well born and the Starks of Winterfell were always proud but Winterfell has fallen and you are really just a beggar now so put that pride aside Gratitude will better become you in your present circumstances Yes and obedience My son will have a grateful and obedient wife





Jon


Day and night the axes rang

Jon could not remember the last time he had slept When he closed his eyes he dreamed of fighting when he woke he fought Even in the King’s Tower he could hear the ceaseless thunk of bronze and flint and stolen steel biting into wood and it was louder when he tried to rest in the warming shed atop the Wall Mance had sledgehammers at work as well and long saws with teeth of bone and flint Once as he was drifting off into an exhausted sleep there came a great cracking from the haunted forest and a sentinel tree came crashing down in a cloud of dirt and needles

He was awake when Owen came to him lying restless under a pile of furs on the floor of the warming shed Lord Snow said Owen shaking his shoulder the dawn He gave Jon a hand to help pull him back onto his feet Others were waking as well jostling one another as they pulled on their boots and buckled their swordbelts in the close confines of the shed No one spoke They were all too tired for talk Few of them ever left the Wall these days It took too long to ride up and down in the cage Castle Black had been abandoned to Maester Aemon Ser Wynton Stout and a few others too old or ill to fight

I had a dream that the king had come Owen said happily Maester Aemon sent a raven and King Robert came with all his strength I dreamed I saw his golden banners

Jon made himself smile That would be a welcome sight to see Owen Ignoring the twinge of pain in his leg he swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders gathered up his crutch and went out onto the Wall to face another day

A gust of wind sent icy tendrils wending through his long brown hair Half a mile north the wildling encampments were stirring their campfires sending up smoky fingers to scratch against the pale dawn sky Along the edge of the forest they had raised their tents of hide and fur even a crude longhall of logs and woven branches there were horselines to the east mammoths to the west and men everywhere sharpening their swords putting points on crude spears donning makeshift armor of hide and horn and bone For every man that he could see Jon knew there were a score unseen in the wood The brush gave them some shelter from the elements and hid them from the eyes of the hated crows

Already their archers were stealing forward pushing their rolling mantlets Here come our breakfast arrows Pyp announced cheerfully as he did every morning It’s good that he can make a jape of it Jon thought Someone has to Three days ago one of those breakfast arrows had caught Red Alyn of the Rosewood in the leg You could still see his body at the foot of the Wall if you cared to lean out far enough Jon had to think that it was better for them to smile at Pyp’s jest than to brood over Alyn’s corpse

The mantlets were slanting wooden shields wide enough for five of the free folk to hide behind The archers pushed them close then knelt behind them to loose their arrows through slits in the wood The first time the wildlings rolled them out Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half-dozen ablaze but after that Mance started covering them with raw hides All the fire arrows in the world couldn’t make them catch now The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect the most arrows before they were done Dolorous Edd was leading with four but Othell Yarwyck Tumberjon and Watt of Long Lake had three apiece It was Pyp who’d started naming the scarecrows after their missing brothers too It makes it seem as if there’s more of us he said

More of us with arrows in our bellies Grenn complained but the custom did seem to give his brothers heart so Jon let the names stand and the wagering continue

On the edge of the Wall an ornate brass Myrish eye stood on three spindly legs Maester Aemon had once used it to peer at the stars before his own eyes had failed him Jon swung the tube down to have a look at the foe Even at this distance there was no mistaking Mance Rayder’s huge white tent sewn together from the pelts of snow bears The Myrish lenses brought the wildlings close enough for him to make out faces Of Mance himself he saw no sign this morning but his woman Dalla was outside tending the fire while her sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent Dalla looked so big it was a wonder she could move The child must be coming very soon Jon thought He swiveled the eye east and searched amongst the tents and trees till he found the turtle That will be coming very soon as well The wildlings had skinned one of the dead mammoths during the night and they were lashing the raw bloody hide over the turtle’s roof one more layer on top of the sheepskins and pelts The turtle had a rounded top and eight huge wheels and under the hides was a stout wooden frame When the wildlings had begun knocking it together Satin thought they were building a ship Not far wrong The turtle was a hull turned upside down and opened fore and aft a longhall on wheels

It’s done isn’t it asked Grenn

Near enough Jon shoved away the eye It will come today most like Did you fill the barrels

Every one They froze hard during the night Pyp checked

Grenn had changed a great deal from the big clumsy red-necked boy Jon had first befriended He had grown half a foot his chest and shoulders had thickened and he had not cut his hair nor trimmed his beard since the Fist of the First Men It made him look as huge and shaggy as an aurochs the mocking name that Ser Alliser Thorne had hung on him during training He looked weary now though When Jon said as much he nodded I heard their axes all night Couldn’t sleep for all the chopping

Then go sleep now
