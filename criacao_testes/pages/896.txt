The sound of horses turned her head Men They were coming from downwind so she had not smelled them but now they were almost here Men on horses with flapping black and yellow and pink wings and long shiny claws in hand Some of her younger brothers bared their teeth to defend the food they’d found but she snapped at them until they scattered That was the way of the wild Deer and hares and crows fled before wolves and wolves fled from men She abandoned the cold white prize in the mud where she had dragged it and ran and felt no shame

When morning came the Hound did not need to shout at Arya or shake her awake She had woken before him for a change and even watered the horses They broke their fast in silence until Sandor said This thing about your mother…

It doesn’t matter Arya said in a dull voice I know she’s dead I saw her in a dream

The Hound looked at her a long time then nodded No more was said of it They rode on toward the mountains

In the higher hills they came upon a tiny isolated village surrounded by grey-green sentinels and tall blue soldier pines and Clegane decided to risk going in We need food he said and a roof over our heads They’re not like to know what happened at the Twins and with any luck they won’t know me

The villagers were building a wooden palisade around their homes and when they saw the breadth of the Hound’s shoulders they offered them food and shelter and even coin for work If there’s wine as well I’ll do it he growled at them In the end he settled for ale and drank himself to sleep each night

His dream of selling Arya to Lady Arryn died there in the hills though There’s frost above us and snow in the high passes the village elder said If you don’t freeze or starve the shadowcats will get you or the cave bears There’s the clans as well The Burned Men are fearless since Timett One-Eye came back from the war And half a year ago Gunthor son of Gurn led the Stone Crows down on a village not eight miles from here They took every woman and every scrap of grain and killed half the men They have steel now good swords and mail hauberks and they watch the high road—the Stone Crows the Milk Snakes the Sons of the Mist all of them Might be you’d take a few with you but in the end they’d kill you and make off with your daughter

I’m not his daughter Arya might have shouted if she hadn’t felt so tired She was no one’s daughter now She was no one Not Arya not Weasel not Nan nor Arry nor Squab not even Lumpyhead She was only some girl who ran with a dog by day and dreamed of wolves by night

It was quiet in the village They had beds stuffed with straw and not too many lice the food was plain but filling and the air smelled of pines All the same Arya soon decided that she hated it The villagers were cowards None of them would even look at the Hound’s face at least not for long Some of the women tried to put her in a dress and make her do needlework but they weren’t Lady Smallwood and she was having none of it And there was one girl who took to following her the village elder’s daughter She was of an age with Arya but just a child she cried if she skinned a knee and carried a stupid cloth doll with her everywhere she went The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms sort of so the girl called him Ser Soldier and bragged how he kept her safe Go away Arya told her half a hundred times Just leave me be She wouldn’t though so finally Arya took the doll away from her ripped it open and pulled the rag stuffing out of its belly with a finger Now he really looks like a soldier she said before she threw the doll in a brook After that the girl stopped pestering her and Arya spent her days grooming Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods Sometimes she would find a stick and practice her needlework but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree until it broke

Might be we should stay here awhile the Hound told her after a fortnight He was drunk on ale but more brooding than sleepy We’d never reach the Eyrie and the Freys will still be hunting survivors in the riverlands Sounds like they need swords here with these clansmen raiding We can rest up maybe find a way to get a letter to your aunt Arya’s face darkened when she heard that She didn’t want to stay but there was nowhere to go either The next morning when the Hound went off to chop down trees and haul logs she crawled back into bed

But when the work was done and the tall wooden palisade was finished the village elder made it plain that there was no place for them Come winter we will be hard pressed to feed our own he explained And you… a man like you brings blood with him

Sandor’s mouth tightened So you do know who I am

Aye We don’t get travelers here that’s so but we go to market and to fairs We know about King Joffrey’s dog

When these Stone Crows come calling you might be glad to have a dog

Might be The man hesitated then gathered up his courage But they say you lost your belly for fighting at the Blackwater They say—

I know what they say Sandor’s voice sounded like two woodsaws grinding together Pay me and we’ll be gone

When they left the Hound had a pouch full of coppers a skin of sour ale and a new sword It was a very old sword if truth be told though new to him He swapped its owner the longaxe he’d taken at the Twins the one he’d used to raise the lump on Arya’s head The ale was gone in less than a day but Clegane sharpened the sword every night cursing the man he’d swapped with for every nick and spot of rust If he lost his belly for fighting why does he care if his sword is sharp It was not a question Arya dared ask him but she thought on it a lot Was that why he’d run from the Twins and carried her off

Back in the riverlands they found that the rains had ebbed away and the flood waters had begun to recede The Hound turned south back toward the Trident We’ll make for Riverrun he told Arya as they roasted a hare he’d killed Maybe the Blackfish wants to buy himself a she-wolf

He doesn’t know me He won’t even know I’m really me Arya was tired of making for Riverrun She had been making for Riverrun for years it seemed without ever getting there Every time she made for Riverrun she ended up someplace worse He won’t give you any ransom He’ll probably just hang you

He’s free to try He turned the spit

He doesn’t talk like he’s lost his belly for fighting I know where we could go Arya said She still had one brother left Jon will want me even if no one else does He’ll call me little sister and muss my hair It was a long way though and she didn’t think she could get there by herself She hadn’t even been able to reach Riverrun We could go to the Wall

Sandor’s laugh was half a growl The little wolf bitch wants to join the Night’s Watch does she

My brother’s on the Wall she said stubbornly

His mouth gave a twitch The Wall’s a thousand leagues from here We’d need to fight through the bloody Freys just to reach the Neck There’s lizard lions in those swamps that eat wolves every day for breakfast And if we did reach the north with our skins intact there’s ironborn in half the castles and thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well

Are you scared of them she asked Have you lost your belly for fighting

For a moment she thought he was going to hit her By then the hare was brown though skin crackling and grease popping as it dripped down into the cookfire Sandor took it off the stick ripped it apart with his big hands and tossed half of it into Arya’s lap There’s nothing wrong with my belly he said as he pulled off a leg but I don’t give a rat’s arse for you or your brother I have a brother too
