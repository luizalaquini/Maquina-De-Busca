and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the
land and from the strange wives

are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or
two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing

them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed
times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof
until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us

The Book of Nehemiah


11 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah And it came to pass
in the month Chisleu in the twentieth year as I was in Shushan the
palace 12 That Hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men
of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which
were left of the captivity and concerning Jerusalem

13 And they said unto me The remnant that are left of the captivity
there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall
