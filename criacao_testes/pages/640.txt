upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make
them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil

2918 And I will persecute them with the sword with the famine and
with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the
kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an
hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither I have driven
them 2919 Because they have not hearkened to my words saith the
LORD which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up
early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the LORD

2920 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD all ye of the captivity
whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon 2921 Thus saith the LORD
of hosts the God of Israel of Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of
Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my
name Behold I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes 2922 And of them
shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in
Babylon saying The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab whom
the king of Babylon roasted in the fire 2923 Because they have
committed villany in Israel and have committed adultery with their
neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which I
have not commanded them even I know and am a witness saith the
LORD

2924 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite saying
2925 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts the God of Israel saying
Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that
are at Jerusalem and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest and
to all the priests saying 2926 The LORD hath made thee priest in
the stead of Jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the
house of the LORD for every man that is mad and maketh himself a
prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks

2927 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth
which maketh himself a prophet to you  2928 For therefore he sent
unto us in Babylon saying This captivity is long build ye houses
and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them

2929 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
Jeremiah the prophet

2930 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah saying 2931 Send
to all them of the captivity saying Thus saith the LORD concerning
Shemaiah the Nehelamite Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto
you and I sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie 2932
Therefore thus saith the LORD Behold I will punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this
people neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people
saith the LORD because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD

301 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying 302 Thus
speaketh the LORD God of Israel saying Write thee all the words that
I have spoken unto thee in a book

303 For lo the days come saith the LORD that I will bring again
the captivity of my people Israel and Judah saith the LORD and I
will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers
and they shall possess it

304 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and
concerning Judah

305 For thus saith the LORD We have heard a voice of trembling of
fear and not of peace

306 Ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child
wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman
in travail and all faces are turned into paleness  307 Alas for
that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of
Jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it

308 For it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD of hosts
that I will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy
bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him 309 But
they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king whom I will
raise up unto them

3010 Therefore fear thou not O my servant Jacob saith the LORD
neither be dismayed O Israel for lo I will save thee from afar
and thy seed from the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return
and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid

3011 For I am with thee saith the LORD to save thee though I make
a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee yet I will
not make a full end of thee but I will correct thee in measure and
will not leave thee altogether unpunished

3012 For thus saith the LORD Thy bruise is incurable and thy wound
is grievous

3013 There is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up
thou hast no healing medicines

3014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for I
have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of
a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins
were increased

3015 Why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable
