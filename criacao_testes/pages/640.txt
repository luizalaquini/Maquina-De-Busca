No squall could frighten Dany though Daenerys Stormborn she was called for she had come howling into the world on distant Dragonstone as the greatest storm in the memory of Westeros howled outside a storm so fierce that it ripped gargoyles from the castle walls and smashed her father’s fleet to kindling

The narrow sea was often stormy and Dany had crossed it half a hundred times as a girl running from one Free City to the next half a step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives She loved the sea She liked the sharp salty smell of the air and the vastness of horizons bounded only by a vault of azure sky above It made her feel small but free as well She liked the dolphins that sometimes swam along beside Balerion slicing through the waves like silvery spears and the flying fish they glimpsed now and again She even liked the sailors with all their songs and stories Once on a voyage to Braavos as she’d watched the crew wrestle down a great green sail in a rising gale she had even thought how fine it would be to be a sailor But when she told her brother Viserys had twisted her hair until she cried You are blood of the dragon he had screamed at her A dragon not some smelly fish

He was a fool about that and so much else Dany thought If he had been wiser and more patient it would be him sailing west to take the throne that was his by rights Viserys had been stupid and vicious she had come to realize yet sometimes she missed him all the same Not the cruel weak man he had become by the end but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed the boy who told her tales of the Seven Kingdoms and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown

The captain appeared at her elbow Would that this Balerion could soar as her namesake did Your Grace he said in bastard Valyrian heavily flavored with accents of Pentos Then we should not need to row nor tow nor pray for wind

Just so Captain she answered with a smile pleased to have won the man over Captain Groleo was an old Pentoshi like his master Illyrio Mopatis and he had been nervous as a maiden about carrying three dragons on his ship Half a hundred buckets of seawater still hung from the gunwales in case of fires At first Groleo had wanted the dragons caged and Dany had consented to put his fears at ease but their misery was so palpable that she soon changed her mind and insisted they be freed

Even Captain Groleo was glad of that now There had been one small fire easily extinguished against that Balerion suddenly seemed to have far fewer rats than she’d had before when she sailed under the name Saduleon And her crew once as fearful as they were curious had begun to take a queer fierce pride in their dragons Every man of them from captain to cook’s boy loved to watch the three fly… though none so much as Dany

They are my children she told herself and if the maegi spoke truly they are the only children I am ever like to have

Viserion’s scales were the color of fresh cream his horns wing bones and spinal crest a dark gold that flashed bright as metal in the sun Rhaegal was made of the green of summer and the bronze of fall They soared above the ships in wide circles higher and higher each trying to climb above the other

Dragons always preferred to attack from above Dany had learned Should either get between the other and the sun he would fold his wings and dive screaming and they would tumble from the sky locked together in a tangled scaly ball jaws snapping and tails lashing The first time they had done it she feared that they meant to kill each other but it was only sport No sooner would they splash into the sea than they would break apart and rise again shrieking and hissing the salt water steaming off them as their wings clawed at the air Drogon was aloft as well though not in sight he would be miles ahead or miles behind hunting

He was always hungry her Drogon Hungry and growing fast Another year or perhaps two and he may be large enough to ride Then I shall have no need of ships to cross the great salt sea

But that time was not yet come Rhaegal and Viserion were the size of small dogs Drogon only a little larger and any dog would have outweighed them they were all wings and neck and tail lighter than they looked And so Daenerys Targaryen must rely on wood and wind and canvas to bear her home

The wood and the canvas had served her well enough so far but the fickle wind had turned traitor For six days and six nights they had been becalmed and now a seventh day had come and still no breath of air to fill their sails Fortunately two of the ships that Magister Illyrio had sent after her were trading galleys with two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen to row them But the great cog Balerion was a song of a different key a ponderous broad-beamed sow of a ship with immense holds and huge sails but helpless in a calm Vhagar and Meraxes had let out lines to tow her but it made for painfully slow going All three ships were crowded and heavily laden

I cannot see Drogon said Ser Jorah Mormont as he joined her on the forecastle Is he lost again

We are the ones who are lost ser Drogon has no taste for this wet creeping no more than I do Bolder than the other two her black dragon had been the first to try his wings above the water the first to flutter from ship to ship the first to lose himself in a passing cloud… and the first to kill The flying fish no sooner broke the surface of the water than they were enveloped in a lance of flame snatched up and swallowed How big will he grow Dany asked curiously Do you know

In the Seven Kingdoms there are tales of dragons who grew so huge that they could pluck giant krakens from the seas

Dany laughed That would be a wondrous sight to see

It is only a tale Khaleesi said her exile knight They talk of wise old dragons living a thousand years as well

Well how long does a dragon live She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails

Ser Jorah shrugged A dragon’s natural span of days is many times as long as a man’s or so the songs would have us believe… but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House Targaryen They were bred for war and in war they died It is no easy thing to slay a dragon but it can be done

The squire Whitebeard standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about his tall hardwood staff turned toward them and said Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator He was so large he could swallow an aurochs whole A dragon never stops growing Your Grace so long as he has food and freedom His name was Arstan but Strong Belwas had named him Whitebeard for his pale whiskers and most everyone called him that now He was taller than Ser Jorah though not so muscular his eyes were a pale blue his long beard as white as snow and as flne as silk

Freedom asked Dany curious What do you mean

In King’s Landing your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for their dragons The Dragonpit it is called It still stands atop the Hill of Rhaenys though all in ruins now That was where the royal dragons dwelt in days of yore and a cavernous dwelling it was with iron doors so wide that thirty knights could ride through them abreast Yet even so it was noted that none of the pit dragons ever reached the size of their ancestors The maesters say it was because of the walls around them and the great dome above their heads

If walls could keep us small peasants would all be tiny and kings as large as giants said Ser Jorah I’ve seen huge men born in hovels and dwarfs who dwelt in castles

Men are men Whitebeard replied Dragons are dragons

Ser Jorah snorted his disdain How profound The exile knight had no love for the old man he’d made that plain from the first What do you know of dragons anyway

Little enough that’s true Yet I served for a time in King’s Landing in the days when King Aerys sat the Iron Throne and walked beneath the dragonskulls that looked down from the walls of his throne room

Viserys talked of those skulls said Dany The Usurper took them down and hid them away He could not bear them looking down on him upon his stolen throne She beckoned Whitebeard closer Did you ever meet my royal father King Aerys II had died before his daughter was born
