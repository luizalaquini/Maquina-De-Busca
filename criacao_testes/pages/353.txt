Shagga’s more like to eat the maid and marry the goose observed Bronn Anyway Lollys outweighs him

There is that Tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway between two towers Who else wants me

The sellsword grew more serious There’s a moneylender from Braavos holding fancy papers and the like requests to see the king about payment on some loan

As if Joff could count past twenty Send the man to Littlefinger he’ll find a way to put him off Next

A lordling down from the Trident says your father’s men burned his keep raped his wife and killed all his peasants

I believe they call that war Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane’s work or that of Ser Amory Lorch or his father’s other pet hellhound the Qohorik What does he want of Joffrey

New peasants Bronn said He walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense

I’ll make time for him on the morrow Whether truly loyal or merely desperate a compliant river lord might have his uses See that he’s given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal Send him a new pair of boots as well good ones courtesy of King Joffrey A show of generosity never hurt

Bronn gave a curt nod There’s also a great gaggle of bakers butchers and greengrocers clamoring to be heard

I told them last time I have nothing to give them Only a thin trickle of food was coming into King’s Landing most of it earmarked for castle and garrison Prices had risen sickeningly high on greens roots flour and fruit and Tyrion did not want to think about what sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles of the pot-shops down in Flea Bottom Fish he hoped They still had the river and the sea… at least until Lord Stannis sailed

They want protection Last night a baker was roasted in his own oven The mob claimed he charged too much for bread

Did he

He’s not apt to deny it

They didn’t eat him did they

Not that I’ve heard

Next time they will Tyrion said grimly I give them what protection I can The gold cloaks—

They claim there were gold cloaks in the mob Bronn said They’re demanding to speak to the king himself

Fools Tyrion had sent them off with regrets his nephew would send them off with whips and spears He was half-tempted to allow it… but no he dare not Soon or late some enemy would march on King’s Landing and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors within the city walls Tell them King Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them

They want bread not promises

If I give them bread today on the morrow I’ll have twice as many at the gates Who else

A black brother down from the Wall The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar

Tyrion smiled wanly I’m surprised no one ate it I suppose I ought to see him It’s not Yoren perchance

No Some knight Thorne

Ser Alliser Thorne Of all the black brothers he’d met on the Wall Tyrion Lannister had liked Ser Alliser Thorne the least A bitter mean-spirited man with too great a sense of his own worth Come to think on it I don’t believe I care to see Ser Alliser just now Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year and let his hand rot a little more

Bronn snorted laughter and went his way while Tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps As he limped across the outer yard he heard the portcullis rattling up His sister and a large party were waiting by the main gate

Mounted on her white palfrey Cersei towered high above him a goddess in green Brother she called out not warmly The queen had not been pleased by the way he’d dealt with Janos Slynt

Your Grace Tyrion bowed politely You look lovely this morning Her crown was gold her cloak ermine Her retinue sat their mounts behind her Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard wearing white scale and his favorite scowl Ser Balon Swann bow slung from his silver-inlay saddle Lord Gyles Rosby his wheezing cough worse than ever Hallyne the Pyromancer of the Alchemists’ Guild and the queen’s newest favorite their cousin Ser Lancel Lannister her late husband’s squire upjumped to knight at his widow’s insistence Vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort Where are you bound this day sister Tyrion asked
