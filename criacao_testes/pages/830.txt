Jon had bitten his lip in his struggles He could taste blood mingled with the thick chalky potion It was all he could do not to retch it back up

Clydas brought a basin of warm water and Maester Aemon washed the pus and blood from his wound Gentle as he was even the lightest touch made Jon want to scream The Magnar’s men are disciplined and they have bronze armor he told them Talking helped keep his mind off his leg

The Magnar’s a lord on Skagos Noye said There were Skagossons at Eastwatch when I first came to the Wall I remember hearing them talk of him

Jon was using the word in its older sense I think Maester Aemon said not as a family name but as a title It derives from the Old Tongue

It means lord Jon agreed Styr is the Magnar of some place called Thenn in the far north of the Frostfangs He has a hundred of his own men and a score of raiders who know the Gift almost as well as we do Mance never found the horn though that’s something The Horn of Winter that’s what he was digging for up along the Milkwater

Maester Aemon paused washcloth in hand The Horn of Winter is an ancient legend Does the King-beyond-the-Wall truly believe that such a thing exists

They all do said Jon Ygritte said they opened a hundred graves… graves of kings and heroes all over the valley of the Milkwater but they never…

Who is Ygritte Donal Noye asked pointedly

A woman of the free folk How could he explain Ygritte to them She’s warm and smart and funny and she can kiss a man or slit his throat She’s with Styr but she’s not… she’s young only a girl in truth wild but she… She killed an old man for building a fire His tongue felt thick and clumsy The milk of the poppy was clouding his wits I broke my vows with her I never meant to but… It was wrong Wrong to love her wrong to leave her… I wasn’t strong enough The Halfhand commanded me ride with them watch I must not balk I… His head felt as if it were packed with wet wool

Maester Aemon sniffed Jon’s wound again Then he put the bloody cloth back in the basin and said Donal the hot knife if you please I shall need you to hold him still

I will not scream Jon told himself when he saw the blade glowing red hot But he broke that vow as well Donal Noye held him down while Clydas helped guide the maester’s hand Jon did not move except to pound his fist against the table again and again and again The pain was so huge he felt small and weak and helpless inside it a child whimpering in the dark Ygritte he thought when the stench of burning flesh was in his nose and his own shriek echoing in her ears Ygritte I had to For half a heartbeat the agony started to ebb But then the iron touched him once again and he fainted

When his eyelids fluttered open he was wrapped in thick wool and floating He could not seem to move but that did not matter For a time he dreamed that Ygritte was with him tending him with gentle hands Finally he closed his eyes and slept

The next waking was not so gentle The room was dark but under the blankets the pain was back a throbbing in his leg that turned into a hot knife at the least motion Jon learned that the hard way when he tried to see if he still had a leg Gasping he swallowed a scream and made another fist

Jon A candle appeared and a well-remembered face was looking down on him big ears and all You shouldn’t move

Pyp Jon reached up and the other boy clasped his hand and gave it a squeeze I thought you’d gone…

…with the Old Pomegranate No he thinks I’m too small and green Grenn’s here too

I’m here too Grenn stepped to the other side of the bed I fell asleep

Jon’s throat was dry Water he gasped Grenn brought it and held it to his lips I saw the Fist he said after a long swallow The blood and the dead horses… Noye said a dozen made it back… who

Dywen did Giant Dolorous Edd Sweet Donnel Hill Ulmer Left Hand Lew Garth Greyfeather Four or five more Me

Sam

Grenn looked away He killed one of the Others Jon I saw it He stabbed him with that dragonglass knife you made him and we started calling him Sam the Slayer He hated that

Sam the Slayer Jon could hardly imagine a less likely warrior than Sam Tarly What happened to him

We left him Grenn sounded miserable I shook him and screamed at him even slapped his face Giant tried to drag him to his feet but he was too heavy Remember in training how he’d curl up on the ground and lie there whimpering At Craster’s he wouldn’t even whimper Dirk and Ollo were tearing up the walls looking for food Garth and Garth were fighting some of the others were raping Craster’s wives Dolorous Edd figured Dirk’s bunch would kill all the loyal men to keep us from telling what they’d done and they had us two to one We left Sam with the Old Bear He wouldn’t move Jon

You were his brother he almost said How could you leave him amongst wildlings and murderers

He might still be alive said Pyp He might surprise us all and come riding up tomorrow

With Mance Rayder’s head aye Grenn was trying to sound cheerful Jon could tell Sam the Slayer

Jon tried to sit again It was as much a mistake as the first time He cried out cursing
