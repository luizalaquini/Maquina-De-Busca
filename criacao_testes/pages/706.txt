the going up to it had eight steps

4035 And he brought me to the north gate and measured it according
to these measures 4036 The little chambers thereof the posts
thereof and the arches thereof and the windows to it round about
the length was fifty cubits and the breadth five and twenty cubits

4037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court and palm
trees were upon the posts thereof on this side and on that side and
the going up to it had eight steps

4038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
the gates where they washed the burnt offering

4039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and
two tables on that side to slay thereon the burnt offering and the
sin offering and the trespass offering

4040 And at the side without as one goeth up to the entry of the
north gate were two tables and on the other side which was at the
porch of the gate were two tables

4041 Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side by
the side of the gate eight tables whereupon they slew their
sacrifices

4042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering
of a cubit and an half long and a cubit and an half broad and one
cubit high whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they
slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice

4043 And within were hooks an hand broad fastened round about and
upon the tables was the flesh of the offering

4044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
the inner court which was at the side of the north gate and their
prospect was toward the south one at the side of the east gate having
the prospect toward the north

4045 And he said unto me This chamber whose prospect is toward the
south is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the house

4046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
priests the keepers of the charge of the altar these are the sons of
Zadok among the sons of Levi which come near to the LORD to minister
unto him

4047 So he measured the court an hundred cubits long and an hundred
cubits broad foursquare and the altar that was before the house

4048 And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured each
post of the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that
side and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side and
three cubits on that side

4049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the breadth
eleven cubits and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to
it and there were pillars by the posts one on this side and another
on that side

411 Afterward he brought me to the temple and measured the posts
six cubits broad on the one side and six cubits broad on the other
side which was the breadth of the tabernacle

412 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits and the sides of the
door were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other
side and he measured the length thereof forty cubits and the
breadth twenty cubits

413 Then went he inward and measured the post of the door two
cubits and the door six cubits and the breadth of the door seven
cubits

414 So he measured the length thereof twenty cubits and the
breadth twenty cubits before the temple and he said unto me This
is the most holy place

415 After he measured the wall of the house six cubits and the
breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on
every side

416 And the side chambers were three one over another and thirty in
order and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the
side chambers round about that they might have hold but they had not
hold in the wall of the house

417 And there was an enlarging and a winding about still upward to
the side chambers for the winding about of the house went still
upward round about the house therefore the breadth of the house was
still upward and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest
by the midst

418 I saw also the height of the house round about the foundations
of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits

419 The thickness of the wall which was for the side chamber
without was five cubits and that which was left was the place of the
side chambers that were within

4110 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
