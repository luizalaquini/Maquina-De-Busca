extra aspiration for unvoiced stops beginning stressed syllables
can be applied only if stress markers are included in the phonetic
transcription

To specify a rule it is necessary to give a
ul
matching part
and a
ul
context
which define at what points in an utterance it is applicable and a
ul
replacement part
which is used to replace the matching part
The context can be specified in mathematical set notation using curly brackets
For example
LB
G SH W K OO		IU OO
LE
states that the matching part OO is replaced by IU OO after a G SH W or K
In fact allophonic variations of each sound segment
should also be accepted as valid context so this rule will also replace OO
after G CH W K or X1 Table 112 gives allophones of each segment
pp
Table 115 gives some rules that have been used for this purpose
FC Table 115
They were derived from careful study of the hints given in the
ML-I manual Votrax 1976

Votrax 1976

Classes such as voiced and stop-consonant in the context specify sets
of sound segments in the obvious way
The beginning of a stressed syllable is marked in the input by syll
Parentheses in the replacement part have a significance which is explained in
the next section
rh Handling prosodic features
We know from Chapter 8 the vital importance of prosodic features
in synthesizing lifelike speech
To allow them to be assigned to Votrax utterances an intermediate
output from a prosodic analysis program like ISP can be used
For example
LB
1  c
ul
dh i s  i z  d zh aa k s  h aa u s
LE

emphasis on the Jacks can be intercepted in the following form

Syllable boundaries pitches and durations have been assigned by the
procedures given earlier Chapter 8
A number always follows each phoneme to specify its duration
