Lord Balon is but the father of a great man

A modest lordling

Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him He kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck

What shall I wear to this great feast She reached back and pushed his face away

I’ll ask Helya to garb you One of my lady mother’s gowns might do She is off on Harlaw and not expected to return

The cold winds have worn her away I hear Will you not go see her Harlaw is only a day’s sail and surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son

Would that I could I am kept too busy here My father relies on me now that I am returned Come peace perhaps…

Your coming might bring her peace

Now you sound a woman Theon complained

I confess I am… and new with child

Somehow that thought excited him So you say but your body shows no signs of it How shall it be proven Before I believe you I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe and taste your mother’s milk

And what will my husband say to this Your father’s own sworn man and servant

We’ll give him so many ships to build he’ll never know you’ve left him

She laughed It’s a cruel lordling who’s seized me If I promise you that one day you may watch my babe get suck will you tell me more of your war Theon of House Greyjoy There are miles and mountains still ahead of us and I would hear of this wolf king you served and the golden lions he fights

Ever anxious to please her Theon obliged The rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he filled her pretty head with tales of Winterfell and war Some of the things he said astonished him She is easy to talk to gods praise her he reflected I feel as though I’ve known her for years If the wench’s pillow play is half the equal of her wit I’ll need to keep her… He thought of Sigrin the Shipwright a thick-bodied thick-witted man flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow and shook his head A waste A most tragic waste

It seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before them

The gates were open Theon put his heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot The hounds were barking wildly as he helped Esgred dismount Several came bounding up tails wagging They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over leaping all around her yapping and licking Off Theon shouted aiming an ineffectual kick at one big brown bitch but Esgred was laughing and wrestling with them

A stableman came pounding up after the dogs Take the horse Theon commanded him and get these damn dogs away—

The lout paid him no mind His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and he said Lady Asha You’re back

Last night she said I sailed from Great Wyk with Lord Goodbrother and spent the night at the inn My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from Lordsport She kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at Theon

All he could do was stand and gape at her Asha No She cannot be Asha He realized suddenly that there were two Ashas in his head One was the little girl he had known The other more vaguely imagined looked something like her mother Neither looked a bit like this… this… this…

The pimples went when the breasts came she explained while she tussled with a dog but I kept the vulture’s beak

Theon found his voice Why didn’t you tell me

Asha let go of the hound and straightened I wanted to see who you were first And I did She gave him a mocking half bow And now little brother pray excuse me I need to bathe and dress for the feast I wonder if I still have that chainmail gown I like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes She gave him that evil grin and crossed the bridge with that walk he’d liked so well half saunter and half sway

When Theon turned away Wex was smirking at him He gave the boy a clout on the ear That’s for enjoying this so much And another harder And that’s for not warning me Next time grow a tongue

His own chambers in the Guest Keep had never seemed so chilly though the thralls had left a brazier burning Theon kicked his boots off let his cloak fall to the floor and poured himself a cup of wine remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples She unlaced my breeches he thought outraged and she said… oh gods and I said… He groaned He could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself

No he thought then She was the one who made me a fool The evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of it And the way she kept reaching for my cock…
