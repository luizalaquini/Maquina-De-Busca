end of the harvest or this week or to-day I dont
see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for
nothing   concluded the small woman bigly
 No no Liddy  you must stay   said Bathsheba
dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious
inconsequence You must not notice my being in a
taking just now You are not as a servant -- -you are a
companion to me Dear dear -- I dont know what I
am doing since this miserable ache o my heart has
weighted and worn upon me so  What shall I come
to  I suppose I shall get further and further into
troubles I wonder sometimes if I am doomed to die
in the Union I am friendless enough God knows  
I wont notice anything nor will I leave you   sobbed
Liddy impulsively putting up her lips to Bathshebas
and kissing her
Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy and all was smooth
again
I dont often cry do I Lidd  but you have made
tears come into my eyes she said a smile shining
through the moisture Try to think him a good man
wont you dear Liddy  
I will miss indeed
He is a sort of steady man in a wild way you know
way I am afraid thats how I am And promise me
to keep my secret -- do Liddy And do not let them
know that I have been crying

about him because it will
be dreadful for me and no good to him poor thing 
Deaths head himself shant wring it from me mistress
if Ive a mind to keep anything and Ill always be your
friend replied Liddy emphatically at the same time
bringing a few more tears into her own eyes not from
any particular necessity but from an artistic sense of
making herself in keeping with the remainder of the
HOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES
picture which seems to influence women at such times
I think God likes us to be good friends dont you 
Indeed I do
And dear miss you wont harry me and storm at
me will you  because you seem to swell so tall as a
lion then and it frightens me  Do you know I fancy
you would be a match for any man when you are in one
0 your takings
Never do you   said Bathsheba slightly laughing
though somewhat seriously alarmed by this Amazonian
picture of herself I hope I am not a bold sort of
maid -- mannish   she continued with some anxiety
O no not mannish but so almighty womanish
that tis getting on that way sometimes Ah  miss she
said after having drawn her breath very sadly in and
sent it very sadly out I wish I had half your failing
that way Tis a great protection to a poor maid in
these illegitmate days

BLAME -- FURY
THE next evening Bathsheba with the idea of getting
out of the way of Mr Boldwood in the event of his
returning to answer her note in person proceeded to
fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some few hours
earlier Bathshebas companion as a gage of their
reconciliation had heen granted a weeks holiday to
visit her sister who was married to a thriving hurdler
and cattle-crib-maker living in a delightful labyrinth of
hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury The arrangement
was that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming
there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con+
tnvances which this man of the woods had introduced
into his wares
Leaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann
that they were to see everything carefully locked up for
the night she went out of the house just at the close of
a timely thunder-shower which had refined the air and
daintily bathed the coat of the land though all beneath
was dry as ever Freshness was exhaled in an essence
from the varied contours of bank and hollow as if the
earth breathed maiden breath and the pleased birds
were hymning to the scene Before her among the
clouds there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of
fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour+
hood of a hidden sun lingering on to the farthest north+
west corner of the heavens that this midsummer season
allowed
She had walked nearly two miles of her journey
watching how the day was retreating and thinking how
the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of
thought to give place in its turn to the time of prayer
and sleep when she beheld advancing over Yalbury hill
the very man she sought so anxiously to elude Boldwood
was stepping on not with that quiet tread of reserved
strength which was his customary
P 257
gait in which he
always seemed to be balancing two thoughts His
manner was stunned and sluggish now
Boldwood had for the first time been awakened to
womans privileges in tergiversation even when it involves
another persons possible blight That Bathsheba was
