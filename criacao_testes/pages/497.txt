Nor was there They found Squint floating facedown in the moat his entrails drifting behind him like a nest of pale snakes Drennan lay half naked in the gatehouse in the snug room where the drawbridge was worked His throat had been opened ear to ear A ragged tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back but his boots were scattered amidst the rushes and his breeches tangled about his feet There was cheese on a small table near the door beside an empty flagon And two cups

Theon picked one up and sniffed at the dregs of wine in the bottom Squint was up on the wallwalk no

Aye said Lorren

Theon flung the cup into the hearth I’d say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to stick it in the woman when she stuck it in him His own cheese knife by the look of it Someone find a pike and fish the other fool out of the moat

The other fool was in a deal worse shape than Drennan When Black Lorren drew him out of the water they saw that one of his arms had been wrenched off at the elbow half of his neck was missing and there was a ragged hole where his navel and groin once had been The pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling him in The stench was awful

The direwolves Theon said Both of them at a guess Disgusted he walked back to the drawbridge Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls with a wide moat between them The outer wall stood eighty feet high the inner more than a hundred Lacking men Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post his guards along the higher inner walls He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the castle rise against him

There had to be two or more he decided While the woman was entertaining Drennan the others freed the wolves

Theon called for a torch and led them up the steps to the wallwalk He swept the flame low before him looking for… there On the inside of the rampart and in the wide crenel between two upthrust merlons Blood he announced clumsily mopped up At a guess the woman killed Drennan and lowered the drawbridge Squint heard the clank of chains came to have a look and got this far They pushed the corpse through the crenel into the moat so he wouldn’t be found by another sentry

Urzen peered along the walls The other watch turrets are not far I see torches burning—

Torches but no guards Theon said testily Winterfell has more turrets than I have men

Four guards at the main gate said Black Lorren and five walking the walls beside Squint

Urzen said If he had sounded his horn—

I am served by fools Try and imagine it was you up here Urzen It’s dark and cold You have been walking sentry for hours looking forward to the end of your watch Then you hear a noise and move toward the gate and suddenly you see eyes at the top of the stair glowing green and gold in the torchlight Two shadows come rushing toward you faster than you can believe You catch a glimpse of teeth start to level your spear and they slam into you and open your belly tearing through leather as if it were cheesecloth He gave Urzen a hard shove And now you’re down on your back your guts are spilling out and one of them has his teeth around your neck Theon grabbed the man’s scrawny throat tightened his fingers and smiled Tell me at what moment during all of this do you stop to blow your fucking horn He shoved Urzen away roughly sending him stumbling back against a merlon The man rubbed his throat I should have had those beasts put down the day we took the castle he thought angrily I’d seen them kill I knew how dangerous they were

We must go after them Black Lorren said

Not in the dark Theon did not relish the idea of chasing direwolves through the wood by night the hunters could easily become the hunted We’ll wait for daylight Until then I had best go speak with my loyal subjects

Down in the yard a uneasy crowd of men women and children had been pushed up against the wall Many had not been given time to dress they covered themselves with woolen blankets or huddled naked under cloaks or bedrobes A dozen ironmen hemmed them in torches in one hand and weapons in the other The wind was gusting and the flickering orange light reflected dully off steel helms thick beards and unsmiling eyes

Theon walked up and down before the prisoners studying the faces They all looked guilty to him How many are missing

Six Reek stepped up behind him smelling of soap his long hair moving in the wind Both Starks that bog boy and his sister the halfwit from the stables and your wildling woman

Osha He had suspected her from the moment he saw that second cup I should have known better than to trust that one She’s as unnatural as Asha Even their names sound alike

Has anyone had a look at the stables

Aggar says no horses are missing

Dancer is still in his stall

Dancer Reek frowned Aggar says the horses are all there Only the halfwit is missing

They’re afoot then That was the best news he’d heard since he woke Bran would be riding in his basket on Hodor’s back no doubt Osha would need to carry Rickon his little legs wouldn’t take him far on their own Theon was confident that he’d soon have them back in his hands Bran and Rickon have fled he told the castle folk watching their eyes Who knows where they’ve gone No one answered They could not have escaped without help Theon went on Without food clothing weapons He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell but no doubt some had been hidden from him I’ll have the names of all those who aided them All those who turned a blind eye The only sound was the wind Come first light I mean to bring them back He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt I need huntsmen Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter Gage The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt to ask whether he’d brought anything choice for the table but he had nothing to say now Theon walked back the way he had come searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge The wild is no place for a cripple And Rickon young as he is how long will he last out there Nan think how frightened he must be The old woman had nattered at him for ten years telling her endless stories but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger I might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure but instead I protected you Is this the thanks you offer Joseth who’d groomed his horses Farlen who’d taught him all he knew of hounds Barth the brewer’s wife who’d been his first—not one of them would meet his eyes They hate me he realized

Reek stepped close Strip off their skins he urged his thick lips glistening Lord Bolton he used to say a naked man has few secrets but a flayed man’s got none

The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton Theon knew ages past certain of their lords had gone so far as to cloak themselves in the skins of dead enemies A number of Starks had ended thus Supposedly all that had stopped a thousand years ago when the Boltons had bent their knees to Winterfell Or so they say but old ways die hard as well I know

There will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell Theon said loudly I am your only protection against the likes of him he wanted to scream He could not be that blatant but perhaps some were clever enough to take the lesson
