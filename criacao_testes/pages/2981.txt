and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be
shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses I
have made their vintage shouting to cease

1611 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab and mine
inward parts for Kirharesh

1612 And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary on
the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he
shall not prevail

1613 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since
that time

1614 But now the LORD hath spoken saying Within three years as the
years of an hireling and the glory of Moab shall be contemned with
all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and
feeble

171 The burden of Damascus Behold Damascus is taken away from being
a city and it shall be a ruinous heap

172 The cities of Aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which
shall lie down and none shall make them afraid

173 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim and the kingdom from
Damascus and the remnant of Syria they shall be as the glory of the
children of Israel saith the LORD of hosts

174 And in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of Jacob
shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean

175 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and
reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth
ears in the valley of Rephaim

176 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an
olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough
four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the LORD
God of Israel

177 At that day shall a man look to his Maker and his eyes shall
have respect to the Holy One of Israel

178 And he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands
neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the
groves or the images

179 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and
an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of
Israel and there shall be desolation

1710 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation and hast
not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou
plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips 1711 In
the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt
thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the
day of grief and of desperate sorrow

1712 Woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the
noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing
like the rushing of mighty waters  1713 The nations shall rush like
the rushing of many waters but God shall rebuke them and they shall
flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before
the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind

1714 And behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is
not

This is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that
rob us

181 Woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers
of Ethiopia 182 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels
of bulrushes upon the waters saying Go ye swift messengers to a
nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning
hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers
have spoiled  183 All ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on
the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and
when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye

184 For so the LORD said unto me I will take my rest and I will
consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a
cloud of dew in the heat of harvest

185 For afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour
grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with
pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches

186 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and
to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and
all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them

187 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts
of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from
their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot
whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the
LORD of hosts the mount Zion

191 The burden of Egypt Behold the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud
