before your enemies

1443 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and
ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the LORD
therefore the LORD will not be with you

1444 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the LORD and Moses departed not out of the
camp

1445 Then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in
that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto Hormah

151 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 152 Speak unto the
children of Israel and say unto them When ye be come into the land
of your habitations which I give unto you 153 And will make an
offering by fire unto the LORD a burnt offering or a sacrifice in
performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts
to make a sweet savour unto the LORD of the herd or of the flock
154 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of
an hin of oil

155 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb

156 Or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil

157 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the LORD

158 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a
sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the LORD 159
Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil

1510 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine
for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the LORD

1511 Thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a
lamb or a kid

1512 According to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to
every one according to their number

1513 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour
unto the LORD

1514 And if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in
your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet
savour unto the LORD as ye do so he shall do

1515 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and
also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever
in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the
LORD

1516 One law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger
that sojourneth with you

1517 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 1518 Speak unto the
children of Israel and say unto them When ye come into the land
whither I bring you 1519 Then it shall be that when ye eat of the
bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD

1520 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall
ye heave it

1521 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
offering in your generations

1522 And if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments
which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses 1523 Even all that the LORD
hath commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the LORD
commanded Moses and henceforward among your generations 1524 Then
it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge
of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young
bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD with
his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering

1525 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
of the children of Israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is
ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by
fire unto the LORD and their sin offering before the LORD for their
ignorance 1526 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the
children of Israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them
seeing all the people were in ignorance

1527 And if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she
goat of the first year for a sin offering

1528 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD to make an
atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him

1529 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance
