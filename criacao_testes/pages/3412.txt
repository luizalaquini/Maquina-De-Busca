Gods Catelyn Sansa is only eleven Ned said And Joffrey… Joffrey is…

She finished for him …crown prince and heir to the Iron Throne And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon

That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth Brandon Yes Brandon would know what to do He always did It was all meant for Brandon You Winterfell everything He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens I never asked for this cup to pass to me

Perhaps not Catelyn said but Brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not

Ned turned away from her back to the night He stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall

Catelyn softened then to see his pain Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son

She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected Ned turned frowning What is it

Desmond’s voice came through the door My lord Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience

You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed

Yes my lord He insists

Very well Send him in

Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin Perhaps we should close the windows she suggested

Ned nodded absently Maester Luwin was shown in

The maester was a small grey man His eyes were grey and quick and saw much His hair was grey what little the years had left him His robe was grey wool trimmed with white fur the Stark colors Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them books messages strange artifacts toys for the children With all he kept hidden in his sleeves Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all

The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke My lord he said to Ned pardon for disturbing your rest I have been left a message

Ned looked irritated Been left By whom Has there been a rider I was not told

There was no rider my lord Only a carved wooden box left on a table in my observatory while I napped My servants saw no one but it must have been brought by someone in the king’s party We have had no other visitors from the south

A wooden box you say Catelyn said

Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory from Myr by the look of it The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal

Ned frowned He had little patience for this sort of thing Catelyn knew A lens he said What has that to do with me

I asked the same question Maester Luwin said Clearly there was more to this than the seeming

Under the heavy weight of her furs Catelyn shivered A lens is an instrument to help us see

Indeed it is He fingered the collar of his order a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe each link forged from a different metal

Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again What is it that they would have us see more clearly

The very thing I asked myself Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in but it is not for my eyes

Ned held out his hand Let me have it then

Luwin did not stir Pardons my lord The message is not for you either It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn and her alone May I approach

Catelyn nodded not trusting to speak The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax Luwin bowed and began to retreat

Stay Ned commanded him His voice was grave He looked at Catelyn What is it My lady you’re shaking

I’m afraid she admitted She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands The furs dropped away from her nakedness forgotten In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn It’s from Lysa Catelyn looked at her husband It will not make us glad she told him There is grief in this message Ned I can feel it

Ned frowned his face darkening Open it

Catelyn broke the seal

Her eyes moved over the words At first they made no sense to her Then she remembered Lysa took no chances When we were girls together we had a private language she and I

Can you read it

Yes Catelyn admitted

Then tell us

Perhaps I should withdraw Maester Luwin said

No Catelyn said We will need your counsel She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room

Maester Luwin averted his eyes Even Ned looked shocked What are you doing he asked

Lighting a fire Catelyn told him She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it then knelt over the cold hearth

Maester Luwin— Ned began

Maester Luwin has delivered all my children Catelyn said This is no time for false modesty She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it

Ned crossed the room took her by the arm and pulled her to her feet He held her there his face inches from her My lady tell me What was this message

Catelyn stiffened in his grasp A warning she said softly If we have the wits to hear

His eyes searched her face Go on

Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered

His fingers tightened on her arm By whom

The Lannisters she told him The queen

Ned released his hold on her arm There were deep red marks on her skin Gods he whispered His voice was hoarse Your sister is sick with grief She cannot know what she is saying

She knows Catelyn said Lysa is impulsive yes but this message was carefully planned cleverly hidden She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands To risk so much she must have had more than mere suspicion Catelyn looked to her husband Now we truly have no choice You must be Robert’s Hand You must go south with him and learn the truth
