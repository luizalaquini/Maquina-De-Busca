A sour man and in his cups Catelyn thought The Late Lord Frey might be niggardly when it came to feeding his guests but he did not stint on the drink The ale wine and mead were flowing as fast as the river outside The Greatjon was already roaring drunk Lord Walder’s son Merrett was matching him cup for cup but Ser Whalen Frey had passed out trying to keep up with the two of them Catelyn would sooner Lord Umber had seen fit to stay sober but telling the Greatjon not to drink was like telling him not to breathe for a few hours

Smalljon Umber and Robin Flint sat near Robb to the other side of Fair Walda and Alyx respectively Neither of them was drinking along with Patrek Mallister and Dacey Mormont they were her son’s guards this evening A wedding feast was not a battle but there were always dangers when men were in their cups and a king should never be unguarded Catelyn was glad of that and even more glad of the swordbelts hanging on pegs along the walls No man needs a longsword to deal with jellied calves’ brains

Everyone thought my lord would choose Fair Walda Lady Walda Bolton told Ser Wendel shouting to be heard above the music Fat Walda was a round pink butterball of a girl with watery blue eyes limp yellow hair and a huge bosom yet her voice was a fluttering squeak It was hard to picture her in the Dreadfort in her pink lace and cape of vair My lord grandfather offered Roose his bride’s weight in silver as a dowry though so my lord of Bolton picked me The girl’s chins jiggled when she laughed I weigh six stone more than Fair Walda but that was the first time I was glad of it I’m Lady Bolton now and my cousin’s still a maid and she’ll be nineteen soon poor thing

The Lord of the Dreadfort paid the chatter no mind Catelyn saw Sometimes he tasted a bite of this a spoon of that tearing bread from the loaf with short strong fingers but the meal could not distract him Bolton had made a toast to Lord Walder’s grandsons when the wedding feast began pointedly mentioning that Walder and Walder were in the care of his bastard son From the way the old man had squinted at him his mouth sucking at the air Catelyn knew he had heard the unspoken threat

Was there ever a wedding less joyful she wondered until she remembered her poor Sansa and her marriage to the Imp Mother take mercy on her She has a gentle soul The heat and smoke and noise were making her sick The musicians in the gallery might be numerous and loud but they were not especially gifted Catelyn took another swallow of wine and allowed a page to refill her cup A few more hours and the worst will be over By this hour tomorrow Robb would be off to another battle this time with the ironmen at Moat Cailin Strange how that prospect seemed almost a relief He will win his battle He wins all his battles and the ironborn are without a king Besides Ned taught him well The drums were pounding Jinglebell hopped past her once again but the music was so loud she could scarcely hear his bells

Above the din came a sudden snarling as two dogs fell upon each other over a scrap of meat They rolled across the floor snapping and biting as a howl of mirth went up Someone doused them with a flagon of ale and they broke apart One limped toward the dais Lord Walder’s toothless mouth opened in a bark of laughter as the dripping wet dog shook ale and hair all over three of his grandsons

The sight of the dogs made Catelyn wish once more for Grey Wind but Robb’s direwolf was nowhere to be seen Lord Walder had refused to allow him in the hall Your wild beast has a taste for human flesh I hear heh the old man had said Rips out throats yes I’ll have no such creature at my Roslin’s feast amongst women and little ones all my sweet innocents

Grey Wind is no danger to them my lord Robb protested Not so long as I am there

You were there at my gates were you not When the wolf attacked the grandsons I sent to greet you I heard all about that don’t think I didn’t heh

No harm was done—

No harm the king says No harm Petyr fell from his horse fell I lost a wife the same way falling His mouth worked in and out Or was she just some strumpet Bastard Walder’s mother yes now I recall She fell off her horse and cracked her head What would Your Grace do if Petyr had broken his neck heh Give me another apology in place of a grandson No no no Might be you’re king I won’t say you’re not the King in the North heh but under my roof my rule Have your wolf or have your wedding sire You’ll not have both

Catelyn could tell that her son was furious but he yielded with as much courtesy as he could summon If it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots he’d told her I’ll eat it and ask for a second bowl And so he had

The Greatjon had drunk another of Lord Walder’s brood under the table Petyr Pimple this time The lad has a third his capacity what did he expect Lord Umber wiped his mouth stood and began to sing A bear there was a bear a BEAR All black and brown and covered with hair His voice was not at all bad though somewhat thick from drink Unfortunately the fiddlers and drummers and flutists up above were playing Flowers of Spring which suited the words of The Bear and the Maiden Fair as well as snails might suit a bowl of porridge Even poor Jinglebell covered his ears at the cacophony

Roose Bolton murmured some words too soft to hear and went off in search of a privy The cramped hall was in a constant uproar of guests and servants coming and going A second feast for knights and lords of somewhat lesser rank was roaring along in the other castle she knew Lord Walder had exiled his baseborn children and their offspring to that side of the river so that Robb’s northmen had taken to referring to it as the bastard feast Some guests were no doubt stealing off to see if the bastards were having a better time than they were Some might even be venturing as far as the camps The Freys had provided wagons of wine ale and mead so the common soldiers could drink to the wedding of Riverrun and the Twins

Robb sat down in Bolton’s vacant place A few more hours and this farce is done Mother he said in a low voice as the Greatjon sang of the maid with honey in her hair Black Walder’s been mild as a lamb for once And Uncle Edmure seems well content in his bride He leaned across her Ser Ryman

Ser Ryman Frey blinked and said Sire Yes

I’d hoped to ask Olyvar to squire for me when we march north said Robb but I do not see him here Would he be at the other feast

Olyvar Ser Ryman shook his head No Not Olyvar Gone… gone from the castles Duty

I see Robb’s tone suggested otherwise When Ser Ryman offered nothing more the king got to his feet again Would you care for a dance Mother

Thank you but no A dance was the last thing she needed the way her head was throbbing No doubt one of Lord Walder’s daughters would be pleased to partner you

Oh no doubt His smile was resigned

The musicians were playing Iron Lances by then while the Greatjon sang The Lusty Lad Someone should acquaint them with each other it might improve the harmony Catelyn turned back to Ser Ryman I had heard that one of your cousins was a singer

Alesander Symond’s son Alyx is his sister He raised a cup toward where she danced with Robin Flint

Will Alesander be playing for us tonight

Ser Ryman squinted at her Not him He’s away He wiped sweat from his brow and lurched to his feet Pardons my lady Pardons Catelyn watched him stagger toward the door

Edmure was kissing Roslin and squeezing her hand Elsewhere in the hall Ser Marq Piper and Ser Danwell Frey played a drinking game Lame Lothar said something amusing to Ser Hosteen one of the younger Freys juggled three daggers for a group of giggly girls and Jinglebell sat on the floor sucking wine off his fingers The servers were bringing out huge silver platters piled high with cuts of juicy pink lamb the most appetizing dish they’d seen all evening And Robb was leading Dacey Mormont in a dance

When she wore a dress in place of a hauberk Lady Maege’s eldest daughter was quite pretty tall and willowy with a shy smile that made her long face light up It was pleasant to see that she could be as graceful on the dance floor as in the training yard Catelyn wondered if Lady Maege had reached the Neck as yet She had taken her other daughters with her but as one of Robb’s battle companions Dacey had chosen to remain by his side He has Ned’s gift for inspiring loyalty Olyvar Frey had been devoted to her son as well Hadn’t Robb said that Olyvar wanted to remain with him even after he’d married Jeyne
