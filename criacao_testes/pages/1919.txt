The parameters a sub 0 a sub 1 and a sub 2
were generated from the above
relationships for a sampling frequency of 8 kHz centre frequency of 1 kHz
and bandwidth of 75 Hz
It exhibits a peak of approximately the right bandwidth at the correct
frequency 1 kHz  Note that the response is flat at half the sampling
frequency for the frequency response from 4 kHz to 8 kHz is just a reflection of
that up to 4 kHz
This contrasts sharply with that of an analogue formant filter also shown
in Figure 513 which slopes
at -12 dBoctave at frequencies above resonance
pp
The behaviour of a digital formant filter at frequencies above
resonance actually makes it preferable to an analogue implementation
We saw earlier that considerable trouble must be taken with the latter to
compensate for the cumulative effect of -12 dBoctave at higher frequencies for
each of the formants
This is not necessary with digital implementations for the response of
a digital formant filter is flat at half the sampling frequency  In fact further
study shows that digital synthesizers without any higher-pole correction
give a closer approximation to the vocal tract than analogue ones with higher-pole
correction Gold and Rabiner 1968

rh Time-domain methods
An interesting alternative to frequency-domain speech synthesis is to construct
the formants in the time domain  When a second-order resonance is excited by
an impulse an exponentially decaying sinusoid is produced as illustrated by
Figure 514
FC Figure 514
The oscillation occurs at the resonant frequency of the filter
while the decay is related to the bandwidth  In fact if the formant filter
has transfer function

the time waveform for impulsive excitation is

xt =  w e sup -bt2  sin  wt

neglecting  b sup 2 w sup 2
LE
It is the combination of several such time waveforms coupled with the regular
reappearance of excitation at the pitch period that produces the characteristic
wiggly waveform of voiced speech
pp
Now suppose we take a sine wave of frequency w and multiply it by a
decaying exponential  e sup -bt2  This gives a signal

xt =  e sup -bt2  sin  wt

which is identical with the filtered impulse except for a factor w
If there are several formants in parallel all with the same bandwidth
the exponential factor is the same for each

A sub 1 A sub 2 and A sub 3 control the formant amplitudes
as in an ordinary parallel synthesizer
except that they need adjusting to account for the missing
factors w sub 1 w sub 2 and w sub 3
pp
A neat way of implementing such a synthesizer digitally is to store one cycle of a
sine wave in a read-only memory ROM  Then the formant frequencies can be
controlled by reading the ROM at different rates  For example if twice the
basic frequency is desired every second value should be read
Multiplication is needed for amplitude control of each formant  this can be
accomplished by shifting the digital word each place shifted accounts for
6 dB of attenuation  Finally the exponential damping factor can be
provided in analogue hardware by a single capacitor after the DA converter
This implementation gives a system for hardware-software synthesis which
involves an absolutely minimal amount of extra hardware apart from the computer
and does not need hardware multiplication for real-time operation
It could easily be made to work in real time with a microprocessor coupled
to a DA converter damping capacitor and fixed tone-control filter to give
the required spectral equalization
pp
Because the overall spectral decay of an impulse exciting a second-order
formant filter is 12 dBoctave the appropriate equalization is +6 dBoctave
lift at high frequencies to give an overall -6 dBoctave spectral trend
pp
Note however that this synthesis model is an extremely basic one  Only
impulsive excitation can be accomodated  For fricatives which we will
discuss in more detail below a different implementation is needed  A
hardware noise generator with a few fixed filters em one
for each fricative type em will suffice for a simple system  More damaging
is the lack of aspiration where random noise excites the vocal tract resonances
This cannot be simulated in the model  The
