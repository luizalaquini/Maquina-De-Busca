1719 These waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the
fenced cities throughout all Judah

181 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined
affinity with Ahab

182 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria And Ahab
killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he
had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead

183 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah Wilt
thou go with me to Ramothgilead And he answered him I am as thou
art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war

184 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel Enquire I pray
thee at the word of the LORD to day

185 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
hundred men and said unto them Shall we go to Ramothgilead to
battle or shall I forbear And they said Go up for God will deliver
it into the kings hand

186 But Jehoshaphat said Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
besides that we might enquire of him  187 And the king of Israel
said unto Jehoshaphat There is yet one man by whom we may enquire of
the LORD but I hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but
always evil the same is Micaiah the son of Imla And Jehoshaphat
said Let not the king say so

188 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers and said
Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla

189 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void
place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets
prophesied before them

1810 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron
and said Thus saith the LORD With these thou shalt push Syria until
they be consumed

1811 And all the prophets prophesied so saying Go up to
Ramothgilead and prosper for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand
of the king

1812 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him
saying Behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king
with one assent let thy word therefore I pray thee be like one of
theirs and speak thou good

1813 And Micaiah said As the LORD liveth even what my God saith
that will I speak

1814 And when he was come to the king the king said unto him
Micaiah shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle or shall I forbear
And he said Go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into
your hand

1815 And the king said to him How many times shall I adjure thee
that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD
1816 Then he said I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains
as sheep that have no shepherd and the LORD said These have no
master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace

1817 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat Did I not tell thee
that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil  1818 Again he
said Therefore hear the word of the LORD I saw the LORD sitting upon
his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and
on his left

1819 And the LORD said Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he
may go up and fall at Ramothgilead And one spake saying after this
manner and another saying after that manner

1820 Then there came out a spirit and stood before the LORD and
said I will entice him And the LORD said unto him Wherewith  1821
And he said I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets And the Lord said Thou shalt entice him and thou shalt
also prevail go out and do even so

1822 Now therefore behold the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
mouth of these thy prophets and the LORD hath spoken evil against
thee

1823 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and smote Micaiah
upon the cheek and said Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from
me to speak unto thee  1824 And Micaiah said Behold thou shalt see
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself

1825 Then the king of Israel said Take ye Micaiah and carry him
back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the kings son
1826 And say Thus saith the king Put this fellow in the prison and
feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until
I return in peace

1827 And Micaiah said If thou certainly return in peace then hath
not the LORD spoken by me And he said Hearken all ye people

1828 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
to Ramothgilead
