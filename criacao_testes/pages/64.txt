Jon smiled at him I’m sorry about your wrist Robb used the same move on me once only with a wooden blade It hurt like seven hells but yours must be worse Look if you want I can show you how to defend that

Alliser Thorne overheard him Lord Snow wants to take my place now He sneered I’d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs

I’ll take that wager Ser Alliser Jon said I’d love to see Ghost juggle

Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath shocked Silence fell

Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table The laughter spread up and down the benches until even the cooks joined in The birds stirred in the rafters and finally even Grenn began to chuckle

Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon As the laughter rolled around him his face darkened and his sword hand curled into a fist That was a grievous error Lord Snow he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy





EDDARD

Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore tired hungry and irritable He was still ahorse dreaming of a long hot soak a roast fowl and a featherbed when the king’s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council The honor of the Hand’s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient It will be convenient on the morrow Ned snapped as he dismounted

The steward bowed very low I shall give the councillors your regrets my lord

No damn it Ned said It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun I will see them Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable

Yes my lord the steward said We have given you Lord Arryn’s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand if it please you I shall have your things taken there

My thanks Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him Ned saw Vayon Poole his own steward and called out It seems the council has urgent need of me See that my daughters find their bedchambers and tell Jory to keep them there Arya is not to go exploring Poole bowed Ned turned back to the royal steward My wagons are still straggling through the city I shall need appropriate garments

It will be my great pleasure the steward said

And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing to find four members of the small council waiting for him

The chamber was richly furnished Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces

The councillor Ned liked least the eunuch Varys accosted him the moment he entered Lord Stark I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey I pray for his recovery His hand left powder stains on Ned’s sleeve and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave

Your gods have heard you Ned replied cool yet polite The prince grows stronger every day He disentangled himself from the eunuch’s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting Whenever he saw him it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him fresh from his victory on the Trident

I see you have arrived safely Lord Stark Renly said

And you as well Ned replied You must forgive me but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert

A poor copy Renly said with a shrug

Though much better dressed Littlefinger quipped Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court

It was true enough Lord Renly was in dark green velvet with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder fastened with an emerald brooch There are worse crimes Renly said with a laugh The way you dress for one

Littlefinger ignored the jibe He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence I have hoped to meet you for some years Lord Stark No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you

She has Ned replied with a chill in his voice The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well

Renly Baratheon laughed Varys shuffled over to listen
