I have labored long to make it so I am glad the Hand is pleased Her voice was flowing amber liquid with the accents of the distant Summer Isles

Titles can be as dangerous as names Tyrion warned Show me a few of your girls

It will be my great delight You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful and skilled in every art of love She swept off gracefully leaving Tyrion to waddle after as best he could on legs half the length of hers

From behind an ornate Myrish screen carved with flowers and fancies and dreaming maidens they peered unseen into a common room where an old man was playing a cheerful air on the pipes In a cushioned alcove a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a buxom young wench on his knee He’d unlaced her bodice and was tilting his cup to pour a thin trickle of wine over her breasts so he might lap it off Two other girls sat playing at tiles before a leaded glass window The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed hair The other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet wide dark eyes small pointed breasts They dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts The sunlight pouring through the colored glass outlined their sweet young bodies through the thin cloth and Tyrion felt a stirring in his groin I would respectfully suggest the dark-skinned girl said Chataya

She’s young

She has sixteen years my lord

A good age for Joffrey he thought remembering what Bronn had said His first had been even younger Tyrion remembered how shy she’d seemed as he drew her dress up over her head the first time Long dark hair and blue eyes you could drown in and he had So long ago    What a wretched fool you are dwarf Does she come from your home lands this girl

Her blood is the blood of summer my lord but my daughter was born here in King’s Landing His surprise must have shown on his face for Chataya continued My people hold that there is no shame to be found in the pillow house In the Summer Isles those who are skilled at giving pleasure are greatly esteemed Many highborn youths and maidens serve for a few years after their flowerings to honor the gods

What do the gods have to do with it

The gods made our bodies as well as our souls is it not so They give us voices so we might worship them with song They give us hands so we might build them temples And they give us desire so we might mate and worship them in that way

Remind me to tell the High Septon said Tyrion If I could pray with my cock I’d be much more religious He waved a hand I will gladly accept your suggestion

I shall summon my daughter Come

The girl met him at the foot of the stairs Taller than Shae though not so tall as her mother she had to kneel before Tyrion could kiss her My name is Alayaya she said with only the slightest hint of her mother’s accent Come my lord She took him by the hand and drew him up two flights of stairs then down a long hall Gasps and shrieks of pleasure were coming from behind one of the closed doors giggles and whispers from another Tyrion’s cock pressed against the lacings of his breeches This could be humiliating he thought as he followed Alayaya up another stair to the turret room There was only one door She led him through and closed it Within the room was a great canopied bed a tall wardrobe decorated with erotic carvings and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow diamonds

You are very beautiful Alayaya Tyrion told her when they were alone From head to heels every part of you is lovely Yet just now the part that interests me most is your tongue

My lord will find my tongue well schooled When I was a girl I learned when to use it and when not

That pleases me Tyrion smiled So what shall we do now Perchance you have some suggestion

Yes she said If my lord will open the wardrobe he will find what he seeks

Tyrion kissed her hand and climbed inside the empty wardrobe Alayaya closed it after him He groped for the back panel felt it slide under his fingers and pushed it all the way aside The hollow space behind the walls was pitch-black but he fumbled until he felt metal His hand closed around the rung of a ladder He found a lower rung with his foot and started down Well below street level the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel where he found Varys waiting with candle in hand

Varys did not look at all like himself A scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his spiked steel cap and he wore mail over boiled leather dirk and shortsword at his belt Was Chataya’s to your satisfaction my lord

Almost too much so admitted Tyrion You’re certain this woman can be relied on

I am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world my lord Chataya has no cause to love the queen though and she knows that she has you to thank for ridding her of Allar Deem Shall we go He started down the tunnel

Even his walk is different Tyrion observed The scent of sour wine and garlic clung to Varys instead of lavender I like this new garb of yours he offered as they went

The work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights So when I leave the castle I adopt more suitable guises and thus live to serve you longer

Leather becomes you You ought to come like this to our next council session

Your sister would not approve my lord

My sister would soil her smallclothes He smiled in the dark I saw no signs of any of her spies skulking after me

I am pleased to hear it my lord Some of your sister’s hirelings are mine as well unbeknownst to her I should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen

Well I’d hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for naught

Scarcely for naught Varys assured him They know you are here Whether any will be bold enough to enter Chataya’s in the guise of patrons I cannot say but I find it best to err on the side of caution

How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance

The tunnel was dug for another King’s Hand whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence

And yet you knew of it

Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel Careful the steps are steep

They emerged through a trap at the back of a stable having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under Rhaenys’s Hill A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about A mule and three horses occupied the stalls He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth Old he said and I have my doubts about his wind

He is not a mount to carry you into battle true Varys replied but he will serve and attract no notice As will the others And the stableboys see and hear only the animals The eunuch took a cloak from a peg It was roughspun sun-faded and threadbare but very ample in its cut If you will permit me When he swept it over Tyrion’s shoulders it enveloped him head to heel with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows Men see what they expect to see Varys said as he fussed and pulled Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children so a child is what they will see A boy in an old cloak on his father’s horse going about his father’s business Though it would be best if you came most often by night

I plan to    after today At the moment though Shae awaits me He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King’s Landing not far from the sea but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed

Which horse will you have

Tyrion shrugged This one will do well enough

I shall saddle him for you Varys took tack and saddle down from a peg

Tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly You missed a lively council Stannis has crowned himself it seems

I know

He accuses my brother and sister of incest I wonder how he came by that suspicion

Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard’s hair as Ned Stark did and Jon Arryn before him Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear The eunuch’s laugh was not his usual giggle but deeper and more throaty

Someone like you perchance

Am I suspected It was not me

If it had been would you admit it

No But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long It is one thing to deceive a king and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney Besides the bastards were there for all to see

Robert’s bastards What of them

He fathered eight to the best of my knowing Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle Their mothers were copper and honey chestnut and butter yet the babes were all black as ravens    and as ill-omened it would seem So when Joffrey Myrcella and Tommen slid out between your sister’s thighs each as golden as the sun the truth was not hard to glimpse

Tyrion shook his head If she had borne only one child for her husband it would have been enough to disarm suspicion    but then she would not have been Cersei If you were not this whisperer who was
