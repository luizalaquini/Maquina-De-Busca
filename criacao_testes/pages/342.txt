The queen was too caught up in her revenge to take note of the exchange Cuckolded by a halfwit fool Stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea

The story should not come from us Tyrion said or it will be seen for a self-serving lie Which it is to be sure

Once more Littlefinger supplied the answer Whores love to gossip and as it happens I own a brothel or three And no doubt Varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and pot-shops

Varys Cersei said frowning Where is Varys

I have been wondering about that myself Your Grace

The Spider spins his secret webs day and night Grand Maester Pycelle said ominously I mistrust that one my lords

And he speaks so kindly of you Tyrion pushed himself off his chair As it happened he knew what the eunuch was about but it was nothing the other councillors needed to hear Pray excuse me my lords Other business calls

Cersei was instantly suspicious King’s business

Nothing you need trouble yourself about

I’ll be the judge of that

Would you spoil my surprise Tyrion said I’m having a gift made for Joffrey A little chain

What does he need with another chain He has gold chains and silver more than he can wear If you think for a moment you can buy Joff’s love with gifts—

Why surely I have the king’s love as he has mine And this chain I believe he may one day treasure above all others The little man bowed and waddled to the door

Bronn was waiting outside the council chambers to escort him back to the Tower of the Hand The smiths are in your audience chamber waiting your pleasure he said as they crossed the ward

Waiting my pleasure I like the ring of that Bronn You almost sound a proper courtier Next you’ll be kneeling

Fuck you dwarf

That’s Shae’s task Tyrion heard Lady Tanda calling to him merrily from the top of the serpentine steps Pretending not to notice her he waddled a bit faster See that my litter is readied I’ll be leaving the castle as soon as I’m done here Two of the Moon Brothers had the door guard Tyrion greeted them pleasantly and grimaced before starting up the stairs The climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache

Within he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed his squire such that he was Podrick Payne was so shy he was furtive Tyrion had never quite gotten over the suspicion that his father had inflicted the boy on him as a joke

Your garb my lord the boy mumbled when Tyrion entered staring down at his boots Even when he worked up the courage to speak Pod could never quite manage to look at you For the audience And your chain The Hand’s chain

Very good Help me dress The doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in the shape of lions’ heads the chain a loop of solid gold hands the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold cut to his height On a normal man it would be no more than a half cape

The Hand’s private audience chamber was not so large as the king’s nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room but Tyrion liked its Myrish rugs wall hangings and sense of intimacy As he entered his steward cried out Tyrion Lannister Hand of the King He liked that too The gaggle of smiths armorers and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell to their knees

He hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them rise Goodmen I know you are all busy so I will be succinct Pod if you please The boy handed him a canvas sack Tyrion yanked the drawstring and upended the bag Its contents spilled onto the rug with a muffled thunk of metal on wool I had these made at the castle forge I want a thousand more just like them

One of the smiths knelt to inspect the object three immense steel links twisted together A mighty chain

Mighty but short the dwarf replied Somewhat like me I fancy one a good deal longer Do you have a name

They call me Ironbelly m’lord The smith was squat and broad plainly dressed in wool and leather but his arms were as thick as a bull’s neck

I want every forge in King’s Landing turned to making these links and joining them All other work is to be put aside I want every man who knows the art of working metal set to this task be he master journeyman or apprentice When I ride up the Street of Steel I want to hear hammers ringing night or day And I want a man a strong man to see that all this is done Are you that man Goodman Ironbelly

Might be I am m’lord But what of the mail and swords the queen was wanting
