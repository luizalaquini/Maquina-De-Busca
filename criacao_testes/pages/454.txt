Truth said the woman in the mask And bowing she faded back into the crowd

Rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios Khaleesi better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows who dare not show their face beneath the sun It is known

It is known Aggo agreed

Xaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions When Dany climbed back into the palanquin beside him he said Your savages are wiser than they know Such truths as the Asshai’i hoard are not like to make you smile Then he pressed another cup of wine on her and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse

In the quiet of her chambers Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk Her dragons were hungry so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier They are growing she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the blackened flesh They must weigh twice what they had in Vaes Tolorro Even so it would be years before they were large enough to take to war And they must be trained as well or they will lay my kingdom waste For all her Targaryen blood Dany had not the least idea of how to train a dragon

Ser Jorah Mormont came to her as the sun was going down The Pureborn refused you

As you said they would Come sit give me your counsel Dany drew him down to the cushions beside her and Jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine

You will get no help in this city Khaleesi Ser Jorah took an onion between thumb and forefinger Each day I am more convinced of that than the day before The Pureborn see no farther than the walls of Qarth and Xaro…

He asked me to marry him again

Yes and I know why When the knight frowned his heavy black brows joined together above his deep-set eyes

He dreams of me day and night She laughed

Forgive me my queen but it is your dragons he dreams of

Xaro assures me that in Qarth man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed The dragons are mine She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her

He tells it true as far as it goes but there’s one thing he failed to mention The Qartheen have a curious wedding custom my queen On the day of their union a wife may ask a token of love from her husband Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods he must grant And he may ask the same of her One thing only may be asked but whatever is named may not be denied

One thing she repeated And it may not be denied

With one dragon Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city but one ship will further our cause but little

Dany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men We passed through the bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones she told Ser Jorah Quaithe was there She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder and what the woman in the red mask had told her

I would be glad to leave this city if truth be told the knight said when she was done But not for Asshai

Where then

East he said

I am half a world away from my kingdom even here If I go any farther east I may never find my way home to Westeros

If you go west you risk your life

House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities she reminded him Truer friends than Xaro or the Pureborn

If you mean Illyrio Mopatis I wonder For sufficient gold Illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would a slave

My brother and I were guests in Illyrio’s manse for half a year If he meant to sell us he could have done it then

He did sell you Ser Jorah said To Khal Drogo

Dany flushed He had the truth of it but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it Illyrio protected us from the Usurper’s knives and he believed in my brother’s cause
