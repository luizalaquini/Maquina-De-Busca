during certain consonants was mentioned above em and these are
not normally considered as part of intonation
Such effects will certainly spoil attempts to store contours extracted
from living speech and apply them to different utterances but the impairment
may not be too great for pitch is only one of many segmental clues to
consonant identification
pp
In the system mentioned earlier which generated 7-digit telephone numbers
by concatenating formant-coded words a single natural pitch contour
was applied to all utterances
It was taken to match as well as possible the general shape of the
contours measured in naturally-spoken telephone numbers  However this is a very
restricted environment for telephone numbers exhibit almost no variety in
the configuration of stressed and unstressed syllables em
the only digit which is not a monosyllable is seven
Significant problems arise when more general utterances are considered
pp
Suppose the pitch contour of one utterance the source
is to be transferred to another the target
Assume that the utterances are encoded in source-filter form
either as parameter tracks for a formant synthesizer or as linear predictive
coefficients
Then there are no technical obstacles to combining pitch and segmentals
The source must be available as a complete utterance while the target
may be formed by concatenating smaller units such as words
pp
For definiteness we will consider utterances of the form
LB
The price is em dollars and em cents
LE
where the slots are filled by numbers less than 100
and of the form
LB
The price is em cents
LE
The domain of prices encompasses a wide range of syllable
configurations
There are between one and five syllables in each variable part
if the numbers are restricted to be less than 100
The sentences have a constant pragmatic semantic and syntactic structure
As in the vast majority of real-life situations
minimal phonetic distinctions between utterances do not occur
pp
Pitch transfer is complicated by the fact that values of the source pitch
are only known during the voiced parts of the utterance
Although it would certainly be possible to extrapolate pitch
over unvoiced parts this would introduce some artificiality into
the otherwise completely natural contours
Let us assume therefore that the pitch contour
of the voiced nucleus of each syllable in the source is applied to the
corresponding syllable nucleus in the target
pp
The primary factors which might tend to inhibit successful transfer
are
LB
NP
different numbers of syllables in the utterances
NP
variations in the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables
NP
different syllable durations
NP
pitch discontinuities
NP
phonetic differences between the utterances
LE
rh Syllabification
It is essential to take into account the syllable structures
of the utterances so that pitch is transferred between
corresponding syllables rather than over the utterance
as a whole
Fortunately syllable boundaries can be detected automatically
with a fair degree of accuracy especially if the speech is carefully
enunciated
It is worth considering briefly how this can be done even though it takes
us off the main topic of synthesis and into speech analysis
pp
A procedure developed by Mermelstein 1975
involves integrating the spectral energy
at each point in the utterance

Mermelstein 1975 Automatic segmentation of speech into syllabic units

First the low 500 Hz and high 4000 Hz ends are filtered out
with 12 dBoctave cutoffs
The resulting energy signal is smoothed
by a 40 Hz lowpass filter giving a so-called loudness
function
All this can be accomplished with simple recursive digital filters
pp
Then the loudness function is compared with its convex hull
The convex hull is the shape a piece of elastic would assume if
stretched over the top of the loudness function and anchored down at
both ends as illustrated in Figure 81
FC Figure 81
The point of maximum difference between the hull and loudness function
is taken to be a tentative syllable
boundary
The hull is recomputed but anchored to the actual loudness function
at the tentative boundary
