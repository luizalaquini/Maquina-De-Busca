O what shall I do -- what shall I do she again
exclaimed wringing her hands I wont send for him
No I wont
The most vigorous expression of a resolution does
not always coinicide with the greatest vigour of the
resolution itself It is often flung out as a sort of prop
to support a decaying conviction which whilst strong
required no enunciation to prove it so The No I
wont of Bathsheba meant virtually I think I must
She followed her assistants through the gate and
lifted her hand to one of them Laban answered to her
signal
Where is Oak staying
Across the valley at Nest Cottage
Jump on the bay mare and ride across and say he
must return instantly -- that I say so
Tall scrambled off to the field and in two minutes
was on Poll the bay bare-backed and with only a
halter by way of rein He diminished down the
hill
Bathsheba watched So did all the rest Tall
cantered along the bridle-path through Sixteen Acres
Sheeplands Middle Field The Flats Cappels Piece
shrank almost to a point crossed the bridge and
ascended from the valley through Springmead and
Whitepits on the other side The cottage to which
Gabriel had retired before taking his final departure
from the locality was visible as a white spot on the
opposite hill backed by blue firs Bathsheba walked
up and down The men entered the field and
endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb creatures
by rubbing them Nothing availed
Bathsheba continued walking The horse was seen
descending the hill and the wearisome series had to be
repeated in reverse order Whitepits Springmead
Cappels Piece The Flats Middle Field Sheeplands
Sixteen Acres She hoped Tall had had presence of
mind enough to give the mare up to Gabriel and return
himself on foot The rider neared them It was Tall
P 191
O what folly said Bathsheba
Gabriel was not visible anywhere
Perhaps he is already gone she said
Tall came into the inclosure and leapt off his face
tragic as Mortons after the battle of Shrewsbury
Well said Bathsheba unwilling to believe that
her verbal lettre-de-cachet could possibly have miscarried
He says beggars mustnt be choosers replied Laban
What said the young farmer opening her eyes
and drawing in her breath for an outburst Joseph
Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle
He says he shall not come onless you request en
to come civilly and in a proper manner as becomes any
ooman begging a favour
Oh oh thats his answer Where does he get his
airs Who am I then to be treated like that Shall
I beg to a man who has begged to me
Another of the flock sprang into the air and fell
dead
The men looked grave as if they suppressed opinion
Bathsheba turned aside her eyes full of tears The
strait she was in through pride and shrewishness could
not be disguised longer she burst out crying bitterly
they all saw it and she attempted no further concealment
I wouldnt cry about it miss said William Small+
bury compassionately Why not ask him softer like
Im sure hed come then Gable is a true man in that
way
Bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes
O it is a wicked cruelty to me -- it is -- it is she
murmured And he drives me to do what I wouldnt
yes he does  -- Tall come indoors
After this collapse not very dignified for the head
of an establishment she went into the house Tall at
her heels Here she sat down and hastily scribbled a
note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence
which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell follows a
storm The note was none the less polite for being
written in a hurry She held it at a distance was
about to fold it then added these words at the
bottom --
Do not desert me Gabriel
P 193
She looked a little redder in refolding it and closed
her lips as if thereby to suspend till too late the action
of conscience in examining whether such strategy were
justifiable The note was despatched as the message
had been and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result
It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened
between the messengers departure and the sound of the
horses tramp again outside She- could not watch this
time but leaning over the old bureau at which she had
written the letter closed her eyes as if to keep out both
hope and fear
  The case however was a promising one Gabriel
was not angry he was simply neutral although her first
command had been so haughty Such imperiousness
would have damned a little less beauty and on the
other hand such beauty would have redeemed a little
less imperiousness
