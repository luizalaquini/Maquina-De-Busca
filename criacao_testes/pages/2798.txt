Manasseh Issachar and Zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did
they eat the passover otherwise than it was written But Hezekiah
prayed for them saying The good LORD pardon every one 3019 That
prepareth his heart to seek God the LORD God of his fathers though
he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary

3020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah and healed the people

3021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the
Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day singing with loud
instruments unto the LORD

3022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the LORD and they did eat throughout the feast
seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the
LORD God of their fathers

3023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days
and they kept other seven days with gladness

3024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to
the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a
great number of priests sanctified themselves

3025 And all the congregation of Judah with the priests and the
Levites and all the congregation that came out of Israel and the
strangers that came out of the land of Israel and that dwelt in
Judah rejoiced

3026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem for since the time of
Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in
Jerusalem

3027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people and
their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling
place even unto heaven

311 Now when all this was finished all Israel that were present went
out to the cities of Judah and brake the images in pieces and cut
down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of
all Judah and Benjamin in Ephraim also and Manasseh until they had
utterly destroyed them all Then all the children of Israel returned
every man to his possession into their own cities

312 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
after their courses every man according to his service the priests
and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister
and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the
LORD

313 He appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the
burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and
for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the LORD

314 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
the portion of the priests and the Levites that they might be
encouraged in the law of the LORD

315 And as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of
Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil
and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all
things brought they in abundantly

316 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah that dwelt in
the cities of Judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD
their God and laid them by heaps

317 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps
and finished them in the seventh month

318 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they
blessed the LORD and his people Israel

319 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
concerning the heaps

3110 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him
and said Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house
of the LORD we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the
LORD hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great
store

3111 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
LORD and they prepared them 3112 And brought in the offerings and
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which Cononiah
the Levite was ruler and Shimei his brother was the next

3113 And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth
and Jozabad and Eliel and Ismachiah and Mahath and Benaiah were
overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother at the
commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house
of God

3114 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite the porter toward the
east was over the freewill offerings of God to distribute the
oblations of the LORD and the most holy things
