The First Epistle General of Peter


11 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia 12 Elect
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through
sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied

13 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead 14 To an
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away
reserved in heaven for you 15 Who are kept by the power of God
through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time

16 Wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations 17 That the trial
of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth
though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour
and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ 18 Whom having not seen
ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice
with joy unspeakable and full of glory 19 Receiving the end of your
faith even the salvation of your souls

110 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
111 Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings
of Christ and the glory that should follow

112 Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us
they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them
that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
from heaven which things the angels desire to look into

113 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to
the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation
of Jesus Christ 114 As obedient children not fashioning yourselves
according to the former lusts in your ignorance 115 But as he which
hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
116 Because it is written Be ye holy for I am holy

117 And if ye call on the Father who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear 118 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your fathers 119 But with
the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot 120 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
world but was manifest in these last times for you 121 Who by him
do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him
glory that your faith and hope might be in God

122 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently 123 Being born again not of
corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of God which
liveth and abideth for ever

124 For all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass The grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
125 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you

21 Wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies
and envies all evil speakings 22 As newborn babes desire the
sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby 23 If so be ye
have tasted that the Lord is gracious

24 To whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men
but chosen of God and precious 25 Ye also as lively stones are
built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ

26 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture Behold I lay in
Sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on
him shall not be confounded

27 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them
which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the
same is made the head of the corner 28 And a stone of stumbling and
a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being
disobedient whereunto also they were appointed

29 But ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy
nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of
him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
210 Which in time past were not a people but are now the people of
God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy

211 Dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain
from fleshly lusts which war against the soul 212 Having your
conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak
against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they
shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation

213 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake
whether it be to the king as supreme 214 Or unto governors as unto
