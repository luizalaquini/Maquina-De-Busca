Aye said the Mad Huntsman and a kinder fate than you deserve for all your kind have done Lions you call yourselves At Sherrer and the Mummer’s Ford girls of six and seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched No lion ever killed so cruel

I was not at Sherrer nor the Mummer’s Ford the Hound told him Lay your dead children at some other door

Thoros answered him Do you deny that House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne By rights your arms should bear two bloody infants in place of those ugly dogs

The Hound’s mouth twitched Do you take me for my brother Is being born Clegane a crime

Murder is a crime

Who did I murder

Lord Lothar Mallery and Ser Gladden Wylde said Harwin

My brothers Lister and Lennocks declared Jack-Be-Lucky

Goodman Beck and Mudge the miller’s son from Donnelwood an old woman called from the shadows

Merriman’s widow who loved so sweet added Greenbeard

Them septons at Sludgy Pond

Ser Andrey Charlton His squire Lucas Roote Every man woman and child in Fieldstone and Mousedown Mill

Lord and Lady Deddings that was so rich

Tom Sevenstrings took up the count Alyn of Winterfell Joth Quickbow Little Matt and his sister Randa Anvil Ryn Ser Ormond Ser Dudley Pate of Mory Pate of Lancewood Old Pate and Pate of Shermer’s Grove Blind Wyl the Whittler Goodwife Maerie Maerie the Whore Becca the Baker Ser Raymun Darry Lord Darry young Lord Darry The Bastard of Bracken Fletcher Will Harsley Goodwife Nolla—

Enough The Hound’s face was tight with anger You’re making noise These names mean nothing Who were they

People said Lord Beric People great and small young and old Good people and bad people who died on the points of Lannister spears or saw their bellies opened by Lannister swords

It wasn’t my sword in their bellies Any man who says it was is a bloody liar

You serve the Lannisters of Casterly Rock said Thoros

Once Me and thousands more Is each of us guilty of the crimes of the others Clegane spat Might be you are knights after all You lie like knights maybe you murder like knights

Lem and Jack-Be-Lucky began to shout at him but Dondarrion raised a hand for silence Say what you mean Clegane

A knight’s a sword with a horse The rest the vows and the sacred oils and the lady’s favors they’re silk ribbons tied round the sword Maybe the sword’s prettier with ribbons hanging off it but it will kill you just as dead Well bugger your ribbons and shove your swords up your arses I’m the same as you The only difference is I don’t lie about what I am So kill me but don’t call me a murderer while you stand there telling each other that your shit don’t stink You hear me

Arya squirted past Greenbeard so fast he never saw her You are a murderer she screamed You killed Mycah don’t say you never did You murdered him

The Hound stared at her with no flicker of recognition And who was this Mycah boy

I’m not a boy But Mycah was He was a butcher’s boy and you killed him Jory said you cut him near in half and he never even had a sword She could feel them looking at her now the women and the children and the men who called themselves the knights of the hollow hill Who’s this now someone asked

The Hound answered Seven hells The little sister The brat who tossed Joff’s pretty sword in the river He gave a bark of laughter Don’t you know you’re dead

No you’re dead she threw back at him

Harwin took her arm to draw her back as Lord Beric said The girl has named you a murderer Do you deny killing this butcher’s boy Mycah
