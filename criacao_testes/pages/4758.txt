We’ll do the same Dany decided Wars were won with gold as much as swords A tenth part In gold or silver coin or ivory Meereen has no need of saffron cloves or zorse hides

It shall be done as you command glorious queen said Daario My Stormcrows will collect your tenth

If the Stormcrows saw to the collections at least half the gold would somehow go astray Dany knew But the Second Sons were just as bad and the Unsullied were as unlettered as they were incorruptible Records must be kept she said Seek among the freedmen for men who can read write and do sums

His business done the captain of the Indigo Star bowed and took his leave Dany shifted uncomfortably on the ebony bench She dreaded what must come next yet she knew she had put it off too long already Yunkai and Astapor threats of war marriage proposals the march west looming over all    I need my knights I need their swords and I need their counsel Yet the thought of seeing Jorah Mormont again made her feel as if she’d swallowed a spoonful of flies angry agitated sick She could almost feel them buzzing round her belly I am the blood of the dragon I must be strong I must have fire in my eyes when I face them not tears Tell Belwas to bring my knights Dany commanded before she could change her mind My good knights

Strong Belwas was puffing from the climb when he marched them through the doors one meaty hand wrapped tight around each man’s arm Ser Barristan walked with his head held high but Ser Jorah stared at the marble floor as he approached The one is proud the other guilty The old man had shaved off his white beard He looked ten years younger without it But her balding bear looked older than he had They halted before the bench Strong Belwas stepped back and stood with his arms crossed across his scarred chest Ser Jorah cleared his throat Khaleesi   

She had missed his voice so much but she had to be stern Be quiet I will tell you when to speak She stood When I sent you down into the sewers part of me hoped I’d seen the last of you It seemed a fitting end for liars to drown in slavers’ filth I thought the gods would deal with you but instead you returned to me My gallant knights of Westeros an informer and a turncloak My brother would have hanged you both Viserys would have anyway She did not know what Rhaegar would have done I will admit you helped win me this city   

Ser Jorah’s mouth tightened We won you this city We sewer rats

Be quiet she said again    though there was truth to what he said While Joso’s Cock and the other rams were battering the city gates and her archers were firing flights of flaming arrows over the walls Dany had sent two hundred men along the river under cover of darkness to fire the hulks in the harbor But that was only to hide their true purpose As the flaming ships drew the eyes of the defenders on the walls a few half-mad swimmers found the sewer mouths and pried loose a rusted iron grating Ser Jorah Ser Barristan Strong Belwas and twenty brave fools slipped beneath the brown water and up the brick tunnel a mixed force of sellswords Unsullied and freedmen Dany had told them to choose only men who had no families    and preferably no sense of smell

They had been lucky as well as brave It had been a moon’s turn since the last good rain and the sewers were only thigh-high The oilcloth they’d wrapped around their torches kept them dry so they had light A few of the freedmen were frightened of the huge rats until Strong Belwas caught one and bit it in two One man was killed by a great pale lizard that reared up out of the dark water to drag him off by the leg but when next ripples were spied Ser Jorah butchered the beast with his blade They took some wrong turnings but once they found the surface Strong Belwas led them to the nearest fighting pit where they surprised a few guards and struck the chains off the slaves Within an hour half the fighting slaves in Meereen had risen

You helped win this city she repeated stubbornly And you have served me well in the past Ser Barristan saved me from the Titan’s Bastard and from the Sorrowful Man in Qarth Ser Jorah saved me from the poisoner in Vaes Dothrak and again from Drogo’s bloodriders after my sun-and-stars had died So many people wanted her dead sometimes she lost count And yet you lied deceived me betrayed me She turned to Ser Barristan You protected my father for many years fought beside my brother on the Trident but you abandoned Viserys in his exile and bent your knee to the Usurper instead Why And tell it true

Some truths are hard to hear Robert was a    a good knight    chivalrous brave    he spared my life and the lives of many others    Prince Viserys was only a boy it would have been years before he was fit to rule and    forgive me my queen but you asked for truth    even as a child your brother Viserys oft seemed to be his father’s son in ways that Rhaegar never did

His father’s son Dany frowned What does that mean

The old knight did not blink Your father is called ‘the Mad King’ in Westeros Has no one ever told you

Viserys did The Mad King The Usurper called him that the Usurper and his dogs The Mad King It was a lie

Why ask for truth Ser Barristan said softly if you close your ears to it He hesitated then continued I told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I’d joined you That was less than half of it Your Grace The truth is I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword To make certain that you were not   

   my father’s daughter If she was not her father’s daughter who was she

   mad he finished But I see no taint in you

Taint Dany bristled

I am no maester to quote history at you Your Grace Swords have been my life not books But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness Your father was not the first King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin Every time a new Targaryen is born he said the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land

Jaehaerys This old man knew my grandfather The thought gave her pause Most of what she knew of Westeros had come from her brother and the rest from Ser Jorah Ser Barristan would have forgotten more than the two of them had ever known This man can tell me what I came from So I am a coin in the hands of some god is that what you are saying ser

No Ser Barristan replied You are the trueborn heir of Westeros To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight should you find me worthy to bear a sword again If not I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire

What if I decide you’re only worthy to be my fool Dany asked scornfully Or perhaps my cook

I would be honored Your Grace Selmy said with quiet dignity I can bake apples and boil beef as well as any man and I’ve roasted many a duck over a campfire I hope you like them greasy with charred skin and bloody bones

That made her smile I’d have to be mad to eat such fare Ben Plumm come give Ser Barristan your longsword

But Whitebeard would not take it I flung my sword at Joffrey’s feet and have not touched one since Only from the hand of my queen will I accept a sword again

As you wish Dany took the sword from Brown Ben and offered it hilt first The old man took it reverently Now kneel she told him and swear it to my service

He went to one knee and lay the blade before her as he said the words Dany scarcely heard them He was the easy one she thought The other will be harder When Ser Barristan was done she turned to Jorah Mormont And now you ser Tell me true

The big man’s neck was red whether from anger or shame she did not know I have tried to tell you true half a hundred times I told you Arstan was more than he seemed I warned you that Xaro and Pyat Pree were not to be trusted I warned you—

You warned me against everyone except yourself His insolence angered her He should be humbler He should beg for my forgiveness Trust no one but Jorah Mormont you said    and all the time you were the Spider’s creature

I am no man’s creature I took the eunuch’s gold yes I learned some ciphers and wrote some letters but that was all—

All You spied on me and sold me to my enemies

For a time He said it grudgingly I stopped

When When did you stop

I made one report from Qarth but—

From Qarth Dany had been hoping it had ended much earlier What did you write from Quarth That you were my man now that you wanted no more of their schemes Ser Jorah could not meet her eyes When Khal Drogo died you asked me to go with you to Yi Ti and the Jade Sea Was that your wish or Robert’s

That was to protect you he insisted To keep you away from them I knew what snakes they were   

Snakes And what are you ser Something unspeakable occurred to her You told them I was carrying Drogo’s child   

Khaleesi   

Do not think to deny it ser Ser Barristan said sharply I was there when the eunuch told the council and Robert decreed that Her Grace and her child must die You were the source ser There was even talk that you might do the deed for a pardon

A lie Ser Jorah’s face darkened I would never    Daenerys it was me who stopped you from drinking the wine

Yes And how was it you knew the wine was poisoned

I    I but suspected    the caravan brought a letter from Varys he warned me there would be attempts He wanted you watched yes but not harmed He went to his knees If I had not told them someone else would have You know that

I know you betrayed me She touched her belly where her son Rhaego had perished I know a poisoner tried to kill my son because of you That’s what I know

No    no He shook his head I never meant    forgive me You have to forgive me

Have to It was too late He should have begun by begging forgiveness She could not pardon him as she’d intended She had dragged the wineseller behind her horse until there was nothing left of him Didn’t the man who brought him deserve the same This is Jorah my fierce bear the right arm that never failed me I would be dead without him but    I can’t forgive you she said I can’t

You forgave the old man   

He lied to me about his name You sold my secrets to the men who killed my father and stole my brother’s throne

I protected you I fought for you Killed for you

Kissed me she thought betrayed me

I went down into the sewers like a rat For you
