release is that Ill continue under his care although it will
have to be by phone because hed never live in a forsaken
place like 12 and Im confined there until further notice The
truth is no one quite knows what to do with me now that the
wars over although if another one should spring up
Plutarchs sure they could find a role for me Then Plutarch
has a good laugh It never seems to bother him when no
one else appreciates his jokes
Are you preparing for another war Plutarch I ask
Oh not now Now were in that sweet period where
everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be
repeated he says But collective thinking is usually shortlived
Were fickle stupid beings with poor memories and a
great gift for self-destruction Although who knows Maybe
this will be it Katniss
What I ask
The time it sticks Maybe we are witnessing the
evolution of the human race Think about that And then he
asks me if Id like to perform on a new singing program hes
launching in a few weeks Something upbeat would be
good Hell send the crew to my house
We land briefly in District 3 to drop off Plutarch Hes
meeting with Beetee to update the technology on the
broadcast system His parting words to me are Dont be a
stranger
When were back among the clouds I look at
Haymitch So why are you going back to Twelve
They cant seem to find a place for me in the Capitol
either he says
At first I dont question this But doubts begin to creep
in Haymitch hasnt assassinated anyone He could go
anywhere If hes coming back to 12 its because hes been
ordered to You have to look after me dont you As my
mentor He shrugs Then I realize what it means My
mothers not coming back
No he says He pulls an envelope from his jacket
pocket and hands it to me I examine the delicate perfectly
formed writing Shes helping to start up a hospital in
District Four She wants you to call as soon as we get in
My finger traces the graceful swoop of the letters You
know why she cant come back Yes I know why Because
between my father and Prim and the ashes the place is too
painful to bear But apparently not for me Do you want to
know who else wont be there
No I say I want to be surprised
Like a good mentor Haymitch makes me eat a
sandwich and then pretends he believes Im asleep for the
rest of the trip He busies himself going through every
compartment on the hovercraft finding the liquor and
stowing it in his bag Its night when we land on the green of
the Victors Village Half of the houses have lights in the
windows including Haymitchs and mine Not Peetas
Someone has built a fire in my kitchen I sit in the rocker
before it clutching my mothers letter
Well see you tomorrow says Haymitch
As the clinking of his bag of liquor bottles fades away I
whisper I doubt it
I am unable to move from the chair The rest of the
house looms cold and empty and dark I pull an old shawl
over my body and watch the flames I guess I sleep
because the next thing I know its morning and Greasy
Saes banging around at the stove She makes me eggs
and toast and sits there until Ive eaten it all We dont talk
much Her little granddaughter the one who lives in her own
world takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mothers
knitting basket Greasy Sae tells her to put it back but I say
she can have it No one in this house can knit anymore
After breakfast Greasy Sae does the dishes and leaves
but she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eat
again I dont know if shes just being neighborly or if shes
on the governments payroll but she shows up twice every
day She cooks I consume I try to figure out my next move
Theres no obstacle now to taking my life But I seem to be
waiting for something
Sometimes the phone rings and rings and rings but I
dont pick it up Haymitch never visits Maybe he changed
his mind and left although I suspect hes just drunk No one
comes but Greasy Sae and her granddaughter After
months of solitary confinement they seem like a crowd
Springs in the air today You ought to get out she
says Go hunting
I havent left the house I havent even left the kitchen
except to go to the small bathroom a few steps off of it Im
in the same clothes I left the Capitol in What I do is sit by
the fire Stare at the unopened letters piling up on the
mantel I dont have a bow
Check down the hall she says
After she leaves I consider a trip down the hall Rule it
out But after several hours I go anyway walking in silent
sock feet so as not to awaken the ghosts In the study
where I had my tea with President Snow I find a box with
my fathers hunting jacket our plant book my parents
wedding photo the spile Haymitch sent in and the locket
Peeta gave me in the clock arena The two bows and a
sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the
firebombing lie on the desk I put on the hunting jacket and
leave the rest of the stuff untouched I fall asleep on the sofa
in the formal living room A terrible nightmare follows where
Im lying at the bottom of a deep grave and every dead
person I know by name comes by and throws a shovel full of
