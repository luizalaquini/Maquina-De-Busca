1530 Then he said I have sinned yet honour me now I pray thee
before the elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with
me that I may worship the LORD thy God

1531 So Samuel turned again after Saul and Saul worshipped the LORD

1532 Then said Samuel Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites And Agag came unto him delicately And Agag said Surely
the bitterness of death is past

1533 And Samuel said As the sword hath made women childless so
shall thy mother be childless among women And Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces before the LORD in Gilgal

1534 Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house to
Gibeah of Saul

1535 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and the LORD repented that he
had made Saul king over Israel

161 And the LORD said unto Samuel How long wilt thou mourn for Saul
seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thine horn
with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite for I
have provided me a king among his sons

162 And Samuel said How can I go if Saul hear it he will kill me
And the LORD said Take an heifer with thee and say I am come to
sacrifice to the LORD

163 And call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will shew thee what thou
shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee

164 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake and came to Bethlehem
And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said Comest
thou peaceably  165 And he said Peaceably I am come to sacrifice
unto the LORD sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice
And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the
sacrifice

166 And it came to pass when they were come that he looked on
Eliab and said Surely the LORDs anointed is before him

167 But the LORD said unto Samuel Look not on his countenance or on
the height of his stature because I have refused him for the LORD
seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but
the LORD looketh on the heart

168 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel And
he said Neither hath the LORD chosen this

169 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by And he said Neither hath the
LORD chosen this

1610 Again Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel And
Samuel said unto Jesse The LORD hath not chosen these

1611 And Samuel said unto Jesse Are here all thy children And he
said There remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the
sheep And Samuel said unto Jesse Send and fetch him for we will not
sit down till he come hither

1612 And he sent and brought him in Now he was ruddy and withal of
a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to And the LORD said
Arise anoint him for this is he

1613 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst
of his brethren and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that
day forward So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah

1614 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and an evil
spirit from the LORD troubled him

1615 And Sauls servants said unto him Behold now an evil spirit
from God troubleth thee

1616 Let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to
seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come
to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall
play with his hand and thou shalt be well

1617 And Saul said unto his servants Provide me now a man that can
play well and bring him to me

1618 Then answered one of the servants and said Behold I have seen
a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a
mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a
comely person and the LORD is with him

1619 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said Send me
David thy son which is with the sheep

1620 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine
and a kid and sent them by David his son unto Saul

1621 And David came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him
greatly and he became his armourbearer

1622 And Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David I pray thee stand
before me for he hath found favour in my sight
