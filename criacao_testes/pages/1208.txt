Ghost stay he commanded The door to Craster’s Keep was made of two flaps of deerhide Jon shoved between them stooping to pass under the low lintel Two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about their boots The hall stank of soot dung and wet dog The air was heavy with smoke yet somehow still damp Rain leaked through the smoke hole in the roof It was all a single room with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery ladders

Jon remembered how he’d felt the day they had left the Wall nervous as a maiden but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon Well here’s one of the wonders he told himself gazing about the squalid foul-smelling hall The acrid smoke was making his eyes water A pity that Pyp and Toad can’t see all they’re missing

Craster sat above the fire the only man to enjoy his own chair Even Lord Commander Mormont must seat himself on the common bench with his raven muttering on his shoulder Jarman Buckwell stood behind dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather beside Thoren Smallwood in the late Ser Jaremy’s heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak

Craster’s sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold He looked to be a powerful man though well into the winter of his days now his mane of hair grey going to white A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look and one of his ears was missing So this is a wildling Jon remembered Old Nan’s tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup Perhaps he had not heard the stories

I’ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years he was telling Mormont And if truth be told I never once missed him A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer stirred the fire and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle

He ought to have passed here last year said Thoren Smallwood A dog came sniffing round his leg He kicked it and sent it off yipping

Lord Mormont said Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce who’d vanished with Gared and young Will

Aye those three I recall The lordling no older than one of these pups Too proud to sleep under my roof him in his sable cloak and black steel My wives give him big cow eyes all the same He turned his squint on the nearest of the women Gared says they were chasing raiders I told him with a commander that green best not catch ’em Gared wasn’t half-bad for a crow Had less ears than me that one The ’bite took ’em same as mine Craster laughed Now I hear he got no head neither The ’bite do that too

Jon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow and the way Theon Greyjoy had kicked the dead man’s head The man was a deserter On the way back to Winterfell Jon and Robb had raced and found six direwolf pups in the snow A thousand years ago

When Ser Waymar left you where was he bound

Craster gave a shrug Happens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of crows He drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside Had no good southron wine up here for a bear’s night I could use me some wine and a new axe Mine’s lost its bite can’t have that I got me women to protect He gazed around at his scurrying wives

You are few here and isolated Mormont said If you like I’ll detail some men to escort you south to the Wall

The raven seemed to like the notion Wall it screamed spreading black wings like a high collar behind Mormont’s head

Their host gave a nasty smile showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth And what would we do there serve you at supper We’re free folk here Craster serves no man

These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild The cold winds are rising

Let them rise My roots are sunk deep Craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist Tell him wife Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are

The woman licked at thin lips This is our place Craster keeps us safe Better to die free than live a slave

Slave muttered the raven

Mormont leaned forward Every village we have passed has been abandoned Yours are the first living faces we’ve seen since we left the Wall The people are gone… whether dead fled or taken I could not say The animals as well Nothing is left And earlier we found the bodies of two of Ben Stark’s rangers only a few leagues from the Wall They were pale and cold with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed Yet when we took them back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived but there was no human mercy left in them

The woman’s mouth hung open a wet pink cave but Craster only gave a snort We’ve had no such troubles here… and I’ll thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof I’m a godly man and the gods keep me safe If wights come walking I’ll know how to send them back to their graves Though I could use me a sharp new axe He sent his wife scurrying with a slap on her leg and a shout of More beer and be quick about it

No trouble from the dead Jarmen Buckwell said but what of the living my lord What of your king

King cried Mormont’s raven King king king

That Mance Rayder Craster spit into the fire King-beyond-the-Wall What do free folk want with kings He turned his squint on Mormont There’s much I could tell you o’ Rayder and his doings if I had a mind This o’ the empty villages that’s his work You would have found this hall abandoned as well if I were a man to scrape to such He sends a rider tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet I sent the man back but kept his tongue It’s nailed to that wall there He pointed Might be that I could tell you where to seek Mance Rayder If I had a mind The brown smile again But we’ll have time enough for that You’ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof belike and eat me out of pigs

A roof would be most welcome my lord Mormont said We’ve had hard riding and too much wet

Then you’ll guest here for a night No longer I’m not that fond o’ crows The loft’s for me and mine but you’ll have all the floor you like I’ve meat and beer for twenty no more The rest o’ your black crows can peck after their own corn

We’ve packed in our own supplies my lord said the Old Bear We should be pleased to share our food and wine

Craster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand I’ll taste your wine Lord Crow that I will One more thing Any man lays a hand on my wives he loses the hand

Your roof your rule said Thoren Smallwood and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly though he looked none too pleased

That’s settled then Craster grudged them a grunt D’ya have a man can draw a map

Sam Tarly can Jon pushed forward Sam loves maps

Mormont beckoned him closer Send him here after he’s eaten Have him bring quill and parchment And find Tollett as well Tell him to bring my axe A guest gift for our host

Who’s this one now Craster said before Jon could go He has the look of a Stark

My steward and squire Jon Snow

A bastard is it Craster looked Jon up and down Man wants to bed a woman seems like he ought to take her to wife That’s what I do He shooed Jon off with a wave Well run and do your service bastard and see that axe is good and sharp now I’ve no use for dull steel

Jon Snow bowed stiffly and took his leave Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as he was leaving and they almost collided at the deerhide door Outside the rain seemed to have slackened Tents had gone up all over the compound Jon could see the tops of others under the trees

Dolorous Edd was feeding the horses Give the wildling an axe why not He pointed out Mormont’s weapon a short-hafted battle-axe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black steel blade He’ll give it back I vow Buried in the Old Bear’s skull like as not Why not give him all our axes and our swords as well I mislike the way they clank and rattle as we ride We’d travel faster without them straight to hell’s door Does it rain in hell I wonder Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead

Jon smiled He wants an axe And wine as well

See the Old Bear’s clever If we get the wildling well and truly drunk perhaps he’ll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe I have two ears but only one head

Smallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch

Do you know the difference between a wildling who’s a friend to the Watch and one who’s not asked the dour squire Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves Our friends bury us in secret graves I wonder how long that bear’s been nailed up on that gate and what Craster had there before we came hallooing Edd looked at the axe doubtfully the rain running down his long face Is it dry in there

Drier than out here

If I lurk about after not too close to the fire belike they’ll take no note of me till morn The ones under his roof will be the first he murders but at least we’ll die dry

Jon had to laugh Craster’s one man We’re two hundred I doubt he’ll murder anyone

You cheer me said Edd sounding utterly morose And besides there’s much to be said for a good sharp axe I’d hate to be murdered with a maul I saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once Scarce split the skin at all but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd only purply-red A comely man but he died ugly It’s good that we’re not giving them mauls Edd walked away shaking his head his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him

Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear Wolf He sprinted around the hall toward the cry the earth sucking at his boots One of Craster’s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep Keep away she was shouting at Ghost You keep away The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him Get it away m’lord she pleaded when she saw him

He won’t hurt you He knew at once what had happened a wooden hutch its slats shattered lay on its side in the wet grass He must have been hungry We haven’t seen much game Jon whistled The direwolf bolted down the rabbit crunching the small bones between his teeth and padded over to him

The woman regarded them with nervous eyes She was younger than he’d thought at first A girl of fifteen or sixteen years he judged dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain her bare feet muddy to the ankles The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy Are you one of Craster’s daughters he asked

She put a hand over her belly Wife now Edging away from the wolf she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch I was going to breed them rabbits There’s no sheep left

The Watch will make good for them Jon had no coin of his own or he would have offered it to her… though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the Wall I’ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow

She wiped her hands on her skirt M’lord—
