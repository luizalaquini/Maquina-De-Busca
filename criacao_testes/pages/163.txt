Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy This time the king drank deeply His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside Will I dream

Ned gave him his answer You will my lord

Good he said smiling I will give Lyanna your love Ned Take care of my children for me

The words twisted in Ned’s belly like a knife For a moment he was at a loss He could not bring himself to lie Then he remembered the bastards little Barra at her mother’s breast Mya in the Vale Gendry at his forge and all the others I shall… guard your children as if they were my own he said slowly

Robert nodded and closed his eyes Ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face Sleep took him

Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned I will do all in my power my lord but the wound has mortified It took them two days to get him back By the time I saw him it was too late I can lessen His Grace’s suffering but only the gods can heal him now

How long Ned asked

By rights he should be dead already I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely

My brother was always strong Lord Renly said Not wise perhaps but strong In the sweltering heat of the bedchamber his brow was slick with sweat He might have been Robert’s ghost as he stood there young and dark and handsome He slew the boar His entrails were sliding from his belly yet somehow he slew the boar His voice was full of wonder

Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing Ned told him

Outside the door Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy Ned told him See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me

It shall be as you command my lord Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his years I have failed my sacred trust

Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself Ned said Robert loved to hunt boar I have seen him take a thousand of them He would stand his ground without flinching his legs braced the great spear in his hands and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged and wait until the last possible second until it was almost on him before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust No one could know this one would be his death

You are kind to say so Lord Eddard

The king himself said as much He blamed the wine

The white-haired knight gave a weary nod His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair yet he commanded us all to stand aside

I wonder Ser Barristan asked Varys so quietly who gave the king this wine

Ned had not heard the eunuch approach but when he looked around there he stood He wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor and his face was freshly powdered

The wine was from the king’s own skin Ser Barristan said

Only one skin Hunting is such thirsty work

I did not keep count More than one for a certainty His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required it

Such a dutiful boy said Varys to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment

Ned had a bitter taste in his mouth He recalled the two fair-haired boys Robert had sent chasing after a breastplate stretcher The king had told everyone the tale that night at the feast laughing until he shook Which squire

The elder said Ser Barristan Lancel

I know the lad well said Varys A stalwart boy Ser Kevan Lannister’s son nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth how well do I remember

Certainly Varys had once been young Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent You mention children Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made I want unmade At once

Alas said Varys At once may be too late I fear those birds have flown But I shall do what I can my lord With your leave He bowed and vanished down the steps his soft-soled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his descent
