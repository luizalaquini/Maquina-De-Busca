There is only one question I would put to you You served us loyally it’s true… but Varys tells me that your brother rode with Renly and then Stannis whilst your lord father chose not to call his banners at all and remained behind the walls of Stonehelm all through the fighting

My father is an old man my lord Well past forty His fighting days are done

And your brother

Donnel was wounded in the battle and yielded to Ser Elwood Harte He was ransomed afterward and pledged his fealty to King Joffrey as did many other captives

So he did said Jaime Even so… Renly Stannis Joffrey Tommen how did he come to omit Balon Greyjoy and Robb Stark He might have been the first knight in the realm to swear fealty to all six kings

Ser Balon’s unease was plain Donnel erred but he is Tommen’s man now You have my word

It’s not Ser Donnel the Constant who concerns me It’s you Jaime leaned forward What will you do if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper and one day comes storming into the throne room And there you stand all in white between your king and your blood What will you do

I… my lord that will never happen

It happened to me Jaime said

Swann wiped his brow with the sleeve of his white tunic

You have no answer

My lord Ser Balon drew himself up On my sword on my honor on my father’s name I swear… I shall not do as you did

Jaime laughed Good Return to your duties… and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to his shield

And then he was alone with the Knight of Flowers

Slim as a sword lithe and fit Ser Loras Tyrell wore a snowy linen tunic and white wool breeches with a gold belt around his waist and a gold rose clasping his fine silk cloak His hair was a soft brown tumble and his eyes were brown as well and bright with insolence He thinks this is a tourney and his tilt has just been called Seventeen and a knight of the Kingsguard said Jaime You must be proud Prince Aemon the Dragonknight was seventeen when he was named Did you know that

Yes my lord

And did you know that I was fifteen

That as well my lord He smiled

Jaime hated that smile I was better than you Ser Loras I was bigger I was stronger and I was quicker

And now you’re older the boy said My lord

He had to laugh This is too absurd Tyrion would mock me unmercifully if he could hear me now comparing cocks with this green boy Older and wiser ser You should learn from me

As you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn

That arrow hit too close to the mark I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold Jaime snapped I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning who could have slain all five of you with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right I learned from Prince Lewyn of Dorne and Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Jonothor Darry good men every one

Dead men every one

He’s me Jaime realized suddenly I am speaking to myself as I was all cocksure arrogance and empty chivalry This is what it does to you to be too good too young

As in a swordfight sometimes it is best to try a different stroke It’s said you fought magnificently in the battle… almost as well as Lord Renly’s ghost beside you A Sworn Brother has no secrets from his Lord Commander Tell me ser Who was wearing Renly’s armor

For a moment Loras Tyrell looked as though he might refuse but in the end he remembered his vows My brother he said sullenly Renly was taller than me and broader in the chest His armor was too loose on me but it suited Garlan well

Was the masquerade your notion or his

Lord Littlefinger suggested it He said it would frighten Stannis’s ignorant men-at-arms

And so it did And some knights and lordlings too Well you gave the singers something to make rhymes about I suppose that’s not to be despised What did you do with Renly

I buried him with mine own hands in a place he showed me once when I was a squire at Storm’s End No one shall ever find him there to disturb his rest He looked at Jaime defiantly I will defend King Tommen with all my strength I swear it I will give my life for his if need be But I will never betray Renly by word or deed He was the king that should have been He was the best of them

The best dressed perhaps Jaime thought but for once he did not say it The arrogance had gone out of Ser Loras the moment he began to speak of Renly He answered truly He is proud and reckless and full of piss but he is not false Not yet As you say One more thing and you may return to your duties

Yes my lord

I still have Brienne of Tarth in a tower cell

The boy’s mouth hardened A black cell would be better

You are certain that’s what she deserves

She deserves death I told Renly that a woman had no place in the Rainbow Guard She won the mêlée with a trick

I seem to recall another knight who was fond of tricks He once rode a mare in heat against a foe mounted on a bad-tempered stallion What sort of trickery did Brienne use

Ser Loras flushed She leapt… it makes no matter She won I grant her that His Grace put a rainbow cloak around her shoulders And she killed him Or let him die

A large difference there The difference between my crime and the shame of Boros Blount

She had sworn to protect him Ser Emmon Cuy Ser Robar Royce Ser Parmen Crane they’d sworn as well How could anyone have hurt him with her inside his tent and the others just outside Unless they were part of it

There were five of you at the wedding feast Jaime pointed out How could Joffrey die Unless you were part of it

Ser Loras drew himself up stiffly There was nothing we could have done

The wench says the same She grieves for Renly as you do I promise you I never grieve for Aerys Brienne’s ugly and pighead stubborn But she lacks the wits to be a liar and she is loyal past the point of sense She swore an oath to bring me to King’s Landing and here I sit This hand I lost… well that was my doing as much as hers Considering all she did to protect me I have no doubt that she would have fought for Renly had there been a foe to fight But a shadow Jaime shook his head Draw your sword Ser Loras Show me how you’d fight a shadow I should like to see that

Ser Loras made no move to rise She fled he said She and Catelyn Stark they left him in his blood and ran Why would they if it was not their work He stared at the table Renly gave me the van Otherwise it would have been me helping him don his armor He often entrusted that task to me We had… we had prayed together that night I left him with her Ser Parmen and Ser Emmon were guarding the tent and Ser Robar Royce was there as well Ser Emmon swore Brienne had… although…

Yes Jaime prompted sensing a doubt

The gorget was cut through One clean stroke through a steel gorget Renly’s armor was the best the finest steel How could she do that I tried myself and it was not possible She’s freakish strong for a woman but even the Mountain would have needed a heavy axe And why armor him and then cut his throat He gave Jaime a confused look If not her though… how could it be a shadow

Ask her Jaime came to a decision Go to her cell Ask your questions and hear her answers If you are still convinced that she murdered Lord Renly I will see that she answers for it The choice will be yours Accuse her or release her All I ask is that you judge her fairly on your honor as a knight

Ser Loras stood I shall On my honor

We are done then
