the impulse will correspond to a single excitation pulse
If the speech is unvoiced minimization will lead to an error
signal which is as nearly white noise as possible

How does one choose the linear predictive coefficients to minimize
the mean-squared error  The total squared prediction error is

leaving the range of summation unspecified for the moment
To minimize M by choice of the coefficients a sub j differentiate
with respect to each of them and set the resulting derivatives
to zero

This is a set of p linear equations for the p unknowns a sub 1 
a sub p
Solving it is equivalent to inverting a p times p matrix
This job must be repeated at the frame rate and so if
real-time operation is desired quite a lot of calculation is needed

So far the range of the n-summation has been left open  The
coefficients of the matrix equation have the form

autocorrelation of an infinite sequence depends only on the lag at which
it is computed and not on absolute time

An elegant method due to Durbin and Levinson exists for solving this
special system of equations  It requires much less computational
effort than is generally needed for symmetric matrix equations
pp
Of course an infinite range of summation can not be used in
practice  For one thing the power spectrum is changing and
only the data from a short time-frame should be used for
a realistic estimate of the optimum linear predictive coefficients
Hence a windowing procedure
