and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the essences
of evil things in the earth and in the waters under
the earth The fungi grew in all manner of positions
from rotting leaves and tree stumps some exhibiting
to her listless gaze their clammy tops others their
oozing gills Some were marked with great splotches
red as arterial blood others were saffron yellow and
others tall and attenuated with stems like macaroni
Some were leathery and of richest browns The
hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and
great in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort
and health and Bathsheba arose with a tremor at the
thought of having

passed the night on the brink of
so dismal a place
lhere were now other footsteps to be heard along
the road Bathshebas nerves were still unstrung

trian came into view He was a schoolboy with a
bag slung over his shoulder containing his dinner
and a hook in his hand He paused by the gate
and without looking up continued murmuring words
in tones quite loud enough to reach her ears
O Lord O Lord O Lord O Lord O Lord --
that I know out o book Give us give us give us
give us give us   -- that I know Grace that grace that
grace that grace that   -- that I know Other words
followed to the same effect The boy was of the
dunce class apparently the book was a psalter and
this was his way of learning the collect In the worst
attacks of trouble there appears to be always a super+
ficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged
and open to the notice of trifles and Bathsheba was
faintly amused at the boys method till he too passed on
By this time stupor had given place to anxiety and
anxiety began to make room for hunger and thirst
A form now appeared upon the rise on the other side
of the swamp half-hidden by the mist and came
towards Bathsheba The woman -- for it was a woman
 -- approached with her face askance as if looking
earnestly on all sides of her When she got a little
further round to the left and drew nearer Bathsheba
could see the newcomers profile ngainst the sunny
sky and knew the wavy sweep from forehead to chin
with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere about
it to be the familiar contour of Liddy Smallbury
Bathshebas heart bounded with gratitude in the
thought that she was not altogether deserted and she
jumped up  O Liddy   she said or attempted to say
but the words had only been framed hy her lips there
came no sound She had lost her voice by exposure
to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night
O maam I am so glad I have found you said
the girl as soon as she saw Bathsheba
 You cant come across Bathsheba said in a whisper
wihich she
P 365
vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to
reach Liddys ears Liddy not knowing this stepped
down upon the swamp saying as she did so It will
bear me up I think
Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture
of Liddy crossing the swamp to her there in the
morning light Iridescent bubbles of dank subter+
ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the
waiting maids feet as she trod hissing as they burst
and expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above
Liddy did not sink as Bathsheba had anticipated
She landed safely on the other side and looked up
at the beautiful though pale and weary face of her
young mistress
Poor thing   said Liddy with tears in her eyes
Do hearten yourself up a little maam However
did --  -- 
I cant speak above a whisper -- my voice is gone
for the present said Bathsheba hurriedly  I suppose
the damp air from that hollow has taken it away
Liddy dont question me mind Who sent you --
anybody  
 Nobody I thought when I found you were not
at home that something cruel had happened I fancy
I heard his voice late last night and so knowing
something was wrong --  -- 
Is he at home
No  he left just before I came out
Is Fanny taken away  
 Not yet She will soon be -- at nine oclock
we wont go home at present then Suppose we
walk about in this wood 
Liddy without exactly understanding everything or
anything in this episode assented and they walked
together further among the trees
But you had better come in maam and have
something to eat You will die of a chill 
I shall not come indoors yet -- perhaps never
Shall I get you something to eat and something
else to put over your head besides that little shawl
If you will Liddy
Liddy vanished and at the end of twenty minutes
