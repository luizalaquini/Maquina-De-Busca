Ser Edmure told me I am sorry Mother… for Lord Hoster and for you Yet first we must meet We’ve had word from the south Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother’s crown

Renly she said shocked I had thought surely it would be Lord Stannis…

So did we all my lady Galbart Glover said

The war council convened in the Great Hall at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square Lord Hoster was too weak to attend asleep on his balcony dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys with Brynden Blackfish at his side and his father’s bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of the Trident drawing them back Karyl Vance came in a lord now his father dead beneath the Golden Tooth Ser Marq Piper was with him and they brought a Darry Ser Raymun’s son a lad no older than Bran Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge glowering and blustering and took a seat as far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit

The northern lords sat opposite with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the tables They were fewer The Greatjon sat at Robb’s left hand and then Theon Greyjoy Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn Lord Rickard Karstark gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief took his seat like a man in a nightmare his long beard uncombed and unwashed He had left two sons dead in the Whispering Wood and there was no word of the third his eldest who had led the Karstark spears against Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork

The arguing raged on late into the night Each lord had a right to speak and speak they did… and shout and curse and reason and cajole and jest and bargain and slam tankards on the table and threaten and walk out and return sullen or smiling Catelyn sat and listened to it all

Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins Lord Tywin’s army had crossed the Trident and was making for Harrenhal And there were two kings in the realm Two kings and no agreement

Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time Young hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead Still others counseled patience Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines Jason Mallister pointed out let them bide their time denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops Lord Blackwood would have none of it They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton’s army down as well What Blackwood urged Bracken opposed as ever Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly and move south to join their might to his

Renly is not the king Robb said It was the first time her son had spoken Like his father he knew how to listen

You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey my lord Galbart Glover said He put your father to death

That makes him evil Robb replied I do not know that it makes Renly king Joffrey is still Robert’s eldest trueborn son so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm Were he to die and I mean to see that he does he has a younger brother Tommen is next in line after Joffrey

Tommen is no less a Lannister Ser Marq Piper snapped

As you say said Robb troubled Yet if neither one is king still how could it be Lord Renly He’s Robert’s younger brother Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me and Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis

Lady Mormont agreed Lord Stannis has the better claim

Renly is crowned said Marq Piper Highgarden and Storm’s End support his claim and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his he will have five of the seven great houses behind him Six if the Arryns bestir themselves Six against the Rock My lords within the year we will have all their heads on pikes the queen and the boy king Lord Tywin the Imp the Kingslayer Ser Kevan all of them That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly What does Lord Stannis have against that that we should cast it all aside

The right said Robb stubbornly Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it

So you mean us to declare for Stannis asked Edmure

I don’t know said Robb I prayed to know what to do but the gods did not answer The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor and we know that was a lie but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him we will be traitors

My lord father would urge caution aged Ser Stevron said with the weaselly smile of a Frey Wait let these two kings play their game of thrones When they are done fighting we can bend our knees to the victor or oppose him as we choose With Renly arming likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce… and the safe return of his son Noble lords allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms…

A roar of outrage drowned out his voice Craven the Greatjon thundered Begging for a truce will make us seem weak declared Lady Mormont Ransoms be damned we must not give up the Kingslayer shouted Rickard Karstark

Why not a peace Catelyn asked

The lords looked at her but it was Robb’s eyes she felt his and his alone My lady they murdered my lord father your husband he said grimly He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him the bright steel on the rough wood This is the only peace I have for Lannisters

The Greatjon bellowed his approval and other men added their voices shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table Catelyn waited until they had quieted My lords she said then Lord Eddard was your liege but I shared his bed and bore his children Do you think I love him any less than you Her voice almost broke with her grief but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself Robb if that sword could bring him back I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more… but he is gone and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that Ned is gone and Daryn Hornwood and Lord Karstark’s valiant sons and many other good men besides and none of them will return to us Must we have more deaths still

You are a woman my lady the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice Women do not understand these things

You are the gentle sex said Lord Karstark with the lines of grief fresh on his face A man has a need for vengeance

Give me Cersei Lannister Lord Karstark and you would see how gentle a woman can be Catelyn replied Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy… but I understand futility We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands and Ned was a prisoner falsely accused of treason We fought to defend ourselves and to win my lord’s freedom

Well the one is done and the other forever beyond our reach I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days but I must think of the living I want my daughters back and the queen holds them still If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks I will call that a bargain and thank the gods I want you safe Robb ruling at Winterfell from your father’s seat I want you to live your life to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son I want to write an end to this I want to go home my lords and weep for my husband

The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking

Peace said her uncle Brynden Peace is sweet my lady… but on what terms It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow

What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones asked Rickard Karstark

Aye said Lord Bracken Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields slaughtered my smallfolk and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him What have we fought for if we are to put all back as it was before

Lord Blackwood agreed to Catelyn’s surprise and dismay And if we do make peace with King Joffrey are we not then traitors to King Renly What if the stag should prevail against the lion where would that leave us

Whatever you may decide for yourselves I shall never call a Lannister my king declared Marq Piper

Nor I yelled the little Darry boy I never will

Again the shouting began Catelyn sat despairing She had come so close she thought They had almost listened almost… but the moment was gone There would be no peace no chance to heal no safety She looked at her son watched him as he listened to the lords debate frowning troubled yet wedded to his war He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey but she saw his true bride plain before her now the sword he had laid on the table

Catelyn was thinking of her girls wondering if she would ever see them again when the Greatjon lurched to his feet

MY LORDS he shouted his voice booming off the rafters Here is what I say to these two kings He spat Renly Baratheon is nothing to me nor Stannis neither Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men Even their gods are wrong The Others take the Lannisters too I’ve had a bellyful of them He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again It was the dragons we married and the dragons are all dead He pointed at Robb with the blade There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to m’lords he thundered The King in the North

And he knelt and laid his sword at her son’s feet

I’ll have peace on those terms Lord Karstark said They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well He eased his longsword from its scabbard The King in the North he said kneeling beside the Greatjon

Maege Mormont stood The King of Winter she declared and laid her spiked mace beside the swords And the river lords were rising too Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one… yet now were heard again ringing from the timbers of her father’s hall

The King in the North

The King in the North

THE KING IN THE NORTH





DAENERYS

The land was red and dead and parched and good wood was hard to come by Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods purple brush sheaves of brown grass They took the two straightest trees hacked the limbs and branches from them skinned off their bark and split them laying the logs in a square Its center they filled with straw brush bark shavings and bundles of dry grass Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them he was not the equal of Khal Drogo’s red but few horses were In the center of the square Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes

Bound hand and foot Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes It is not enough to kill a horse she told Dany By itself the blood is nothing You do not have the words to make a spell nor the wisdom to find them Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children You call me maegi as if it were a curse but all it means is wise You are a child with a child’s ignorance Whatever you mean to do it will not work Loose me from these bonds and I will help you

I am tired of the maegi’s braying Dany told Jhogo He took his whip to her and after that the godswife kept silent

Over the carcass of the horse they built a platform of hewn logs trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater and the thickest straightest branches they could find They laid the wood east to west from sunrise to sunset On the platform they piled Khal Drogo’s treasures his great tent his painted vests his saddles and harness the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son a mighty dragonbone bow Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo’s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well but she forbade it Those are mine she told him and I mean to keep them Another layer of brush was piled about the khal’s treasures and bundles of dried grass scattered over them
