He was there on his knees in the mud when Dolorous Edd came up Digging for worms Sam Or are you just sick

Sick said Sam weakly wiping his mouth with the back of his hand The smell   

Never knew Bannen could smell so good Edd’s tone was as morose as ever I had half a mind to carve a slice off him If we had some applesauce I might have done it Pork’s always best with applesauce I find Edd undid his laces and pulled out his cock You best not die Sam or I fear I might succumb There’s bound to be more crackling on you than Bannen ever had and I never could resist a bit of crackling He sighed as his piss arced out yellow and steaming We ride at first light did you hear Sun or snow the Old Bear tells me

Sun or snow Sam glanced up anxiously at the sky Snow he squeaked We    ride All of us

Well no some will need to walk He shook himself Dywen now he says we need to learn to ride dead horses like the Others do He claims it would save on feed How much could a dead horse eat Edd laced himself back up Can’t say I fancy the notion Once they figure a way to work a dead horse we’ll be next Likely I’ll be the first too ‘Edd’ they’ll say ‘dying’s no excuse for lying down no more so get on up and take this spear you’ve got the watch tonight’ Well I shouldn’t be so gloomy Might be I’ll die before they work it out

Might be we’ll all die and sooner than we’d like Sam thought as he climbed awkwardly to his feet

When Craster learned that his unwanted guests would be departing on the morrow the wildling became almost amiable or as close to amiable as Craster ever got Past time he said you don’t belong here I told you that All the same I’ll see you off proper with a feast Well a feed My wives can roast them horses you slaughtered and I’ll find some beer and bread He smiled his brown smile Nothing better than beer and horsemeat If you can’t ride ’em eat ’em that’s what I say

His wives and daughters dragged out the benches and the long log tables and cooked and served as well Except for Gilly Sam could hardly tell the women apart Some were old and some were young and some were only girls but a lot of them were Craster’s daughters as well as his wives and they all looked sort of alike As they went about their work they spoke in soft voices to each other but never to the men in black

Craster owned but one chair He sat in it clad in a sleeveless sheepskin jerkin His thick arms were covered with white hair and about one wrist was a twisted ring of gold Lord Commander Mormont took the place at the top of the bench to his right while the brothers crowded in knee to knee a dozen remained outside to guard the gate and tend the fires

Sam found a place between Grenn and Orphan Oss his stomach rumbling The charred horsemeat dripped with grease as Craster’s wives turned the spits above the firepit and the smell of it set his mouth to watering again but that reminded him of Bannen Hungry as he was Sam knew he would retch if he so much as tried a bite How could they eat the poor faithful garrons who had carried them so far When Craster’s wives brought onions he seized one eagerly One side was black with rot but he cut that part off with his dagger and ate the good half raw There was bread as well but only two loaves When Ulmer asked for more the woman only shook her head That was when the trouble started

Two loaves Clubfoot Karl complained from down the bench How stupid are you women We need more bread than this

Lord Commander Mormont gave him a hard look Take what you’re given and be thankful Would you sooner be out in the storm eating snow

We’ll be there soon enough Clubfoot Karl did not flinch from the Old Bear’s wrath I’d sooner eat what Craster’s hiding my lord

Craster narrowed his eyes I gave you crows enough I got me women to feed

Dirk speared a chunk of horsemeat Aye So you admit you got a secret larder How else to make it through a winter

I’m a godly man    Craster started

You’re a niggardly man said Karl and a liar

Hams Garth of Oldtown said in a reverent voice There were pigs last time we come I bet he’s got hams hid someplace Smoked and salted hams and bacon too

Sausage said Dirk Them long black ones they’re like rocks they keep for years I bet he’s got a hundred hanging in some cellar

Oats suggested Ollo Lophand Corn Barley

Corn said Mormont’s raven with a flap of the wings Corn corn corn corn corn

Enough said Lord Commander Mormont over the bird’s raucous calls Be quiet all of you This is folly

Apples said Garth of Greenaway Barrels and barrels of crisp autumn apples There are apple trees out there I saw ’em

Dried berries Cabbages Pine nuts

Corn Corn Corn

Salt mutton There’s a sheepfold He’s got casks and casks of mutton laid by you know he does

Craster looked fit to spit them all by then Lord Commander Mormont rose Silence I’ll hear no more such talk

Then stuff bread in your ears old man Clubfoot Karl pushed back from the table Or did you swallow your bloody crumb already

Sam saw the Old Bear’s face go red Have you forgotten who I am Sit eat and be silent That is a command

No one spoke No one moved All eyes were on the Lord Commander and the big clubfooted ranger as the two of them stared at each other across the table It seemed to Sam that Karl broke first and was about to sit though sullenly   

   but Craster stood and his axe was in his hand The big black steel axe that Mormont had given him as a guest gift No he growled You’ll not sit No one who calls me niggard will sleep beneath my roof nor eat at my board Out with you cripple And you and you and you He jabbed the head of the axe toward Dirk and Garth and Garth in turn Go sleep in the cold with empty bellies the lot o’ you or   

Bloody bastard Sam heard one of the Garths curse He never saw which one

Who calls me bastard Craster roared sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right

It’s no more than all men know Karl answered

Craster moved quicker than Sam would have believed possible vaulting across the table with axe in hand A woman screamed Garth Greenaway and Orphan Oss drew knives Karl stumbled back and tripped over Ser Byam lying wounded on the floor One instant Craster was coming after him spitting curses The next he was spitting blood Dirk had grabbed him by the hair yanked his head back and opened his throat ear to ear with one long slash Then he gave him a rough shove and the wildling fell forward crashing face first across Ser Byam Byam screamed in agony as Craster drowned in his own blood the axe slipping from his fingers Two of Craster’s wives were wailing a third cursed a fourth flew at Sweet Donnel and tried to scratch his eyes out He knocked her to the floor The Lord Commander stood over Craster’s corpse dark with anger The gods will curse us he cried There is no crime so foul as for a guest to bring murder into a man’s hall By all the laws of the hearth we—

There are no laws beyond the Wall old man Remember Dirk grabbed one of Craster’s wives by the arm and shoved the point of his bloody dirk up under her chin Show us where he keeps the food or you’ll get the same as he did woman

Unhand her Mormont took a step I’ll have your head for this you—

Garth of Greenaway blocked his path and Ollo Lophand yanked him back They both had blades in hand Hold your tongue Ollo warned Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for his dagger Ollo had only one hand but that was quick He twisted free of the old man’s grasp shoved the knife into Mormont’s belly and yanked it out again all red And then the world went mad

Later much later Sam found himself sitting crosslegged on the floor with Mormont’s head in his lap He did not remember how they’d gotten there or much of anything else that had happened after the Old Bear was stabbed Garth of Greenaway had killed Garth of Oldtown he recalled but not why Rolley of Sisterton had fallen from the loft and broken his neck after climbing the ladder to have a taste of Craster’s wives Grenn   

Grenn had shouted and slapped him and then he’d run away with Giant and Dolorous Edd and some others Craster still sprawled across Ser Byam but the wounded knight no longer moaned Four men in black sat on the bench eating chunks of burned horsemeat while Ollo coupled with a weeping woman on the table

Tarly When he tried to speak the blood dribbled from the Old Bear’s mouth down into his beard Tarly go Go

Where my lord His voice was flat and lifeless I am not afraid It was a queer feeling There’s no place to go

The Wall Make for the Wall Now

Now squawked the raven Now Now The bird walked up the old man’s arm to his chest and plucked a hair from his beard

You must Must tell them

Tell them what my lord Sam asked politely

All The Fist The wildlings Dragonglass This All His breathing was very shallow now his voice a whisper Tell my son Jorah Tell him take the black My wish Dying wish

Wish The raven cocked its head beady black eyes shining Corn the bird asked

No corn said Mormont feebly Tell Jorah Forgive him My son Please Go

It’s too far said Sam I’ll never reach the Wall my lord He was so very tired All he wanted was to sleep to sleep and sleep and never wake and he knew that if he just stayed here soon enough Dirk or Ollo Lophand or Clubfoot Karl would get angry with him and grant his wish just to see him die I’d sooner stay with you See I’m not frightened anymore Of you or    of anything
