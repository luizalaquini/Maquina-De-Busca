Rippledown Rill Arya read

See it loops around and flows down toward the lake back to Harrenhal He traced the line with a finger

Hot Pie’s eyes grew wide No They’ll kill us for sure

We have to know which river this is declared Gendry in his stubbornest voice We have to know

Well we don’t The map might have names written beside the blue lines but no one had written a name on the riverbank We won’t go up or downstream she decided rolling up the map We’ll cross and keep going north like we were

Can horses swim asked Hot Pie It looks deep Arry What if there are snakes

Are you sure we’re going north asked Gendry All these hills… if we got turned around…

The moss on the trees—

He pointed to a nearby tree That tree’s got moss on three sides and that next one has no moss at all We could be lost just riding around in a circle

We could be said Arya but I’m going to cross the river anyway You can come or you can stay here She climbed back into the saddle ignoring the both of them If they didn’t want to follow they could find Riverrun on their own though more likely the Mummers would just find them

She had to ride a good half mile along the bank before she finally found a place where it looked as though it might be safe to cross and even then her mare was reluctant to enter the water The river whatever its name was running brown and fast and the deep part in the middle came up past the horse’s belly Water filled her boots but she pressed in her heels all the same and climbed out on the far bank From behind she heard splashing and a mare’s nervous whinny They followed then Good She turned to watch as the boys struggled across and emerged dripping beside her It wasn’t the Trident she told them It wasn’t

The next river was shallower and easier to ford That one wasn’t the Trident either and no one argued with her when she told them they would cross it

Dusk was settling as they stopped to rest the horses once more and share another meal of bread and cheese I’m cold and wet Hot Pie complained We’re a long way from Harrenhal now for sure We could have us a fire—

NO Arya and Gendry both said at the exact same instant Hot Pie quailed a little Arya gave Gendry a sideways look He said it with me like Jon used to do back in Winterfell She missed Jon Snow the most of all her brothers

Could we sleep at least Hot Pie asked I’m so tired Arry and my arse is sore I think I’ve got blisters

You’ll have more than that if you’re caught she said We’ve got to keep going We’ve got to

But it’s almost dark and you can’t even see the moon

Get back on your horse

Plodding along at a slow walking pace as the light faded around them Arya found her own exhaustion weighing heavy on her She needed sleep as much as Hot Pie but they dare not If they slept they might open their eyes to find Vargo Hoat standing over them with Shagwell the Fool and Faithful Urswyck and Rorge and Biter and Septon Utt and all his other monsters

Yet after a while the motion of her horse became as soothing as the rocking of a cradle and Arya found her eyes growing heavy She let them close just for an instant then snapped them wide again I can’t go to sleep she screamed at herself silently I can’t I can’t She knuckled at her eye and rubbed it hard to keep it open clutching the reins tightly and kicking her mount to a canter But neither she nor the horse could sustain the pace and it was only a few moments before they fell back to a walk again and a few more until her eyes closed a second time This time they did not open quite so quickly

When they did she found that her horse had come to a stop and was nibbling at a tuft of grass while Gendry was shaking her arm You fell asleep he told her

I was just resting my eyes

You were resting them a long while then Your horse was wandering in a circle but it wasn’t till she stopped that I realized you were sleeping Hot Pie’s just as bad he rode into a tree limb and got knocked off you should have heard him yell Even that didn’t wake you up You need to stop and sleep

I can keep going as long as you can She yawned

Liar he said You keep going if you want to be stupid but I’m stopping I’ll take the first watch You sleep

What about Hot Pie

Gendry pointed Hot Pie was already on the ground curled up beneath his cloak on a bed of damp leaves and snoring softly He had a big wedge of cheese in one fist but it looked as though he had fallen asleep between bites

It was no good arguing Arya realized Gendry had the right of it The Mummers will need to sleep too she told herself hoping it was true She was so weary it was a struggle even to get down from the saddle but she remembered to hobble her horse before finding a place beneath a beech tree The ground was hard and damp She wondered how long it would be before she slept in a bed again with hot food and a fire to warm her The last thing she did before closing her eyes was unsheathe her sword and lay it down beside her Ser Gregor she whispered yawning Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and… the Tickler… the Hound…

Her dreams were red and savage The Mummers were in them four at least a pale Lyseni and a dark brutal axeman from Ib the scarred Dothraki horse lord called Iggo and a Dornishman whose name she never knew On and on they came riding through the rain in rusting mail and wet leather swords and axe clanking against their saddles They thought they were hunting her she knew with all the strange sharp certainty of dreams but they were wrong She was hunting them

She was no little girl in the dream she was a wolf huge and powerful and when she emerged from beneath the trees in front of them and bared her teeth in a low rumbling growl she could smell the rank stench of fear from horse and man alike The Lyseni’s mount reared and screamed in terror and the others shouted at one another in mantalk but before they could act the other wolves came hurtling from the darkness and the rain a great pack of them gaunt and wet and silent

The fight was short but bloody The hairy man went down as he unslung his axe the dark one died stringing an arrow and the pale man from Lys tried to bolt Her brothers and sisters ran him down turning him again and again coming at him from all sides snapping at the legs of his horse and tearing the throat from the rider when he came crashing to the earth

Only the belled man stood his ground His horse kicked in the head of one of her sisters and he cut another almost in half with his curved silvery claw as his hair tinkled softly

Filled with rage she leapt onto his back knocking him head-first from his saddle Her jaws locked on his arm as they fell her teeth sinking through the leather and wool and soft flesh When they landed she gave a savage jerk with her head and ripped the limb loose from his shoulder Exulting she shook it back and forth in her mouth scattering the warm red droplets amidst the cold black rain





Tyrion


He woke to the creak of old iron hinges

Who he croaked At least he had his voice back raw and hoarse though it was The fever was still on him and Tyrion had no notion of the hour How long had he slept this time He was so weak so damnably weak Who he called again more loudly Torchlight spilled through the open door but within the chamber the only light came from the stub of a candle beside his bed

When he saw a shape moving toward him Tyrion shivered Here in Maegor’s Holdfast every servant was in the queen’s pay so any visitor might be another of Cersei’s catspaws sent to finish the work Ser Mandon had begun

Then the man stepped into the candlelight got a good look at the dwarf’s pale face and chortled Cut yourself shaving did you

Tyrion’s fingers went to the great gash that ran from above one eye down to his jaw across what remained of his nose The proud flesh was still raw and warm to the touch With a fearful big razor yes

Bronn’s coal-black hair was freshly washed and brushed straight back from the hard lines of his face and he was dressed in high boots of soft tooled leather a wide belt studded with nuggets of silver and a cloak of pale green silk Across the dark grey wool of his doublet a burning chain was embroidered diagonally in bright green thread

Where have you been Tyrion demanded of him I sent for you… it must have been a fortnight ago

Four days ago more like the sellsword said and I’ve been here twice and found you dead to the world

Not dead Though my sweet sister did try Perhaps he should not have said that aloud but Tyrion was past caring Cersei was behind Ser Mandon’s attempt to kill him he knew that in his gut What’s that ugly thing on your chest

Bronn grinned My knightly sigil A flaming chain green on a smoke-grey field By your lord father’s command I’m Ser Bronn of the Blackwater now Imp See you don’t forget it

Tyrion put his hands on the featherbed and squirmed back a few inches against the pillows I was the one who promised you knighthood remember He had liked that by your lord father’s command not at all Lord Tywin had wasted little time Moving his son from the Tower of the Hand to claim it for himself was a message anyone could read and this was another I lose half my nose and you gain a knighthood The gods have a deal to answer for His voice was sour Did my father dub you himself

No Them of us as survived the fight at the winch towers got ourselves dabbed by the High Septon and dubbed by the Kingsguard Took half the bloody day with only three of the White Swords left to do the honors

I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle Shoved into the river by Pod half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart Who else was lost
