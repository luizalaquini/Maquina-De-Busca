O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles

he rode to a woman’s sigh

For she was his secret treasure

she was his shame and his bliss

And a chain and a keep are nothing

compared to a woman’s kiss





There’s more the man said as he broke off Oh a good deal more The refrain is especially nice I think For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm…

Enough Tyrion slid his fingers from his cloak empty That’s not a song I would care to hear again Ever

No Symon Silver Tongue put his harp aside and took a sip of wine A pity Still each man has his song as my old master used to say when he was teaching me to play Others might like my tune better The queen perhaps Or your lord father

Tyrion rubbed the scar over his nose and said My father has no time for singers and my sister is not as generous as one might think A wise man could earn more from silence than from song He could not put it much plainer than that

Symon seemed to take his meaning quick enough You will find my price modest my lord

That’s good to know This would not be a matter of thirty golden dragons Tyrion feared Tell me

At King Joffrey’s wedding feast the man said there is to be a tournament of singers

And jugglers and jesters and dancing bears

Only one dancing bear my lord said Symon who had plainly attended Cersei’s arrangements with far more interest than Tyrion had but seven singers Galyeon of Cuy Bethany Fair-fingers Aemon Costayne Alaric of Eysen Hamish the Harper Collio Quaynis and Orland of Oldtown will compete for a gilded lute with silver strings… yet unaccountably no invitation has been forthcoming for one who is master of them all

Let me guess Symon Silver Tongue

Symon smiled modestly I am prepared to prove the truth of my boast before king and court Hamish is old and oft forgets what he is singing And Collio with that absurd Tyroshi accent if you understand one word in three count yourself fortunate

My sweet sister has arranged the feast Even if I could secure you this invitation it might look queer Seven kingdoms seven vows seven challenges seventy-seven dishes… but eight singers What would the High Septon think

You did not strike me as a pious man my lord

Piety is not the point Certain forms must be observed

Symon took a sip of wine Still… a singer’s life is not without peril We ply our trade in alehouses and wine sinks before unruly drunkards If one of your sister’s seven should suffer some mishap I hope you might consider me to fill his place He smiled slyly inordinately pleased with himself

Six singers would be as unfortunate as eight to be sure I will inquire after the health of Cersei’s seven If any of them should be indisposed my man Bronn will find you

Very good my lord Symon might have left it at that but flushed with triumph he added I shall sing the night of King Joffrey’s wedding Should it happen that I am called to court why I will want to offer the king my very best compositions songs I have sung a thousand times that are certain to please If I should find myself singing in some dreary winesink though… well that would be an apt occasion to try my new song For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm

That will not be necessary said Tyrion You have my word as a Lannister Bronn will call upon you soon

Very good my lord The balding kettle-bellied singer took up his woodharp again

Bronn was waiting with the horses at the mouth of the alley He helped Tyrion into his saddle When do I take the man to Duskendale

You don’t Tyrion turned his horse Give him three days then inform him that Hamish the Harper has broken his arm Tell him that his clothes will never serve for court so he must be fitted for new garb at once He’ll come with you quick enough He grimaced You may want his tongue I understand it’s made of silver The rest of him should never be found

Bronn grinned There’s a pot shop I know in Flea Bottom makes a savory bowl of brown All kinds of meat in it I hear

Make certain I never eat there Tyrion spurred to a trot He wanted a bath and the hotter the better

Even that modest pleasure was denied him however no sooner had he returned to his chambers than Podrick Payne informed him that he had been summoned to the Tower of the Hand His lordship wants to see you The Hand Lord Tywin

I recall who the Hand is Pod Tyrion said I lost my nose not my wits

Bronn laughed Don’t bite the boy’s head off now

Why not He never uses it Tyrion wondered what he’d done now Or more like what I have failed to do A summons from Lord Tywin always had teeth his father never sent for him just to share a meal or a cup of wine that was for certain

As he entered his lord father’s solar a few moments later he heard a voice saying …cherrywood for the scabbards bound in red leather and ornamented with a row of lion’s-head studs in pure gold Perhaps with garnets for the eyes…

Rubies Lord Tywin said Garnets lack the fire

Tyrion cleared his throat My lord You sent for me

His father glanced up I did Come have a look at this A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand A wedding gift for Joffrey he told Tyrion The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold With this fool’s jabber of Stannis and his magic sword it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well A king should bear a kingly weapon

That’s much too much sword for Joff Tyrion said

He will grow into it Here feel the weight of it He offered the weapon hilt first

The sword was much lighter than he had expected As he turned it in his hand he saw why Only one metal could be beaten so thin and still have strength enough to fight with and there was no mistaking those ripples the mark of steel that has been folded back on itself many thousands of times Valyrian steel

Yes Lord Tywin said in a tone of deep satisfaction

At long last Father Valyrian steel blades were scarce and costly yet thousands remained in the world perhaps two hundred in the Seven Kingdoms alone It had always irked his father that none belonged to House Lannister The old Kings of the Rock had owned such a weapon but the greatsword Brightroar had been lost when the second King Tommen carried it back to Valyria on his fool’s quest He had never returned nor had Uncle Gery the youngest and most reckless of his father’s brothers who had gone seeking after the lost sword some eight years past

Thrice at least Lord Tywin had offered to buy Valyrian longswords from impoverished lesser houses but his advances had always been firmly rebuffed The little lordlings would gladly part with their daughters should a Lannister come asking but they cherished their old family swords

Tyrion wondered where the metal for this one had come from A few master armorers could rework old Valyrian steel but the secrets of its making had been lost when the Doom came to old Valyria The colors are strange he commented as he turned the blade in the sunlight Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black as was true here as well But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching each ripple distinct like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore How did you get this patterning I’ve never seen anything like it

Nor I my lord said the armorer I confess these colors were not what I intended and I do not know that I could duplicate them Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House and it was that color I set out to infuse into the metal But Valyrian steel is stubborn These old swords remember it is said and they do not change easily I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again but always the color would darken as if the blade was drinking the sun from it And some folds would not take the red at all as you can see If my lords of Lannister are displeased I will of course try again as many times as you should require but—

No need Lord Tywin said This will serve

A crimson sword might flash prettily in the sun but if truth be told I like these colors better said Tyrion They have an ominous beauty… and they make this blade unique There is no other sword like it in all the world I should think

There is one The armorer bent over the table and unfolded the bundle of oilcloth to reveal a second longsword
