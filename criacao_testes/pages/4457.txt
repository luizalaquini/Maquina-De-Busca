TYRION

I do not sleep as I did when I was younger Grand Maester Pycelle told him by way of apology for the dawn meeting I would sooner be up though the world be dark than lie restless abed fretting on tasks undone he said—though his heavy-lidded eyes made him look half-asleep as he said it

In the airy chambers beneath the rookery his girl served them boiled eggs stewed plums and porridge while Pycelle served the pontifications In these sad times when so many hunger I think it only fitting to keep my table spare

Commendable Tyrion admitted breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly of the Grand Maester’s bald spotted head I take a different view If there is food I eat it in case there is none on the morrow He smiled Tell me are your ravens early risers as well

Pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest To be sure Shall I send for quill and ink after we have eaten

No need Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends Send your girl away so we can talk

Leave us child Pycelle commanded The serving girl hurried from the room These letters now   

For the eyes of Doran Martell Prince of Dorne Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite It wanted salt One letter in two copies Send your swiftest birds The matter is of great import

I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast

Dispatch them now Stewed plums will keep The realm may not Lord Renly is leading his host up the roseroad and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone

Pycelle blinked If my lord prefers—

He does

I am here to serve The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly It was a heavy thing a dozen maester’s collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals

Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums—overcooked and watery to his taste—before the sound of wings prompted him to rise He spied the raven dark in the dawn sky and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room

The maester’s medicines made an impressive display dozens of pots sealed with wax hundreds of stoppered vials as many milkglass bottles countless jars of dried herbs each container neatly labeled in Pycelle’s precise hand An orderly mind Tyrion reflected and indeed once you puzzled out the arrangement it was easy to see that every potion had its place And such interesting things He noted sweetsleep and nightshade milk of the poppy the tears of Lys powdered greycap wolfsbane and demon’s dance basilisk venom blindeye widow’s blood   

Standing on his toes and straining upward he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf When he read the label he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve

He was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping down the stairs It is done my lord The old man seated himself A matter like this    best done promptly indeed indeed    of great import you say

Oh yes The porridge was too thick Tyrion felt and wanted butter and honey To be sure butter and honey were seldom seen in King’s Landing of late though Lord Gyles kept them well supplied in the castle Half of the food they ate these days came from his lands or Lady Tanda’s Rosby and Stokeworth lay near the city to the north and were yet untouched by war

The Prince of Dorne himself Might I ask   

Best not

As you say Pycelle’s curiosity was so ripe that Tyrion could almost taste it Mayhaps    the king’s council   

Tyrion tapped his wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl The council exists to advise the king Maester

Just so said Pycelle and the king—

—is a boy of thirteen I speak with his voice

So you do Indeed The King’s Own Hand Yet    your most gracious sister our Queen Regent she   

   bears a great weight upon those lovely white shoulders of hers I have no wish to add to her burdens Do you Tyrion cocked his head and gave the Grand Maester an inquiring stare

Pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food Something about Tyrion’s mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm knowing that he made good use of them Ah the old man muttered into his plums Doubtless you have the right of it my lord It is most considerate of you to    spare her this    burden

That’s just the sort of fellow I am Tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge Considerate Cersei is my own sweet sister after all

And a woman to be sure Grand Maester Pycelle said A most uncommon woman and yet    it is no small thing to tend to all the cares of the realm despite the frailty of her sex   

Oh yes she’s a frail dove just ask Eddard Stark I’m pleased you share my concern And I thank you for the hospitality of your table But a long day awaits He swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair Be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne

As you say my lord

And only me

Ah    to be sure Pycelle’s spotted hand was clutching at his beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope It made Tyrion’s heart glad One he thought

He waddled out into the lower bailey his stunted legs complained of the steps The sun was well up now and the castle was stirring Guardsmen walked the walls and knights and men-at-arms were training with blunted weapons Nearby Bronn sat on the lip of a well A pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them but the sellsword never looked Bronn I despair of you Tyrion gestured at the wenches With sweet sights like that before you all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor

There are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt I want Bronn answered but one day my life may hang on how close I’ve watched your louts He stood Who’s the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield

Some hedge knight Tallad he names himself Why

Bronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes He’s the best of them But watch him he falls into a rhythm delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks He grinned That will be the death of him the day he faces me

He’s pledged to Joffrey he’s not like to face you They set off across the bailey Bronn matching his long stride to Tyrion’s short one These days the sellsword was looking almost respectable His dark hair was washed and brushed he was freshly shaved and he wore the black breastplate of an officer of the City Watch From his shoulders trailed a cloak of Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands Tyrion had made him a gift of it when he named him captain of his personal guard How many supplicants do we have today he inquired

Thirty odd answered Bronn Most with complaints or wanting something as ever Your pet was back

He groaned Lady Tanda

Her page She invites you to sup with her again There’s to be a haunch of venison she says a brace of stuffed geese sauced with mulberries and—

—her daughter Tyrion finished sourly Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep Lady Tanda had been stalking him armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies wild boars and savory cream stews Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for her daughter Lollys a large soft dim-witted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirty-and-three Send her my regrets

No taste for stuffed goose Bronn grinned evilly

Perhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid Or better still send Shagga

Shagga’s more like to eat the maid and marry the goose observed Bronn Anyway Lollys outweighs him

There is that Tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway between two towers Who else wants me

The sellsword grew more serious There’s a moneylender from Braavos holding fancy papers and the like requests to see the king about payment on some loan

As if Joff could count past twenty Send the man to Littlefinger he’ll find a way to put him off Next
