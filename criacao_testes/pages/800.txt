Woman you bray like an ass and make no more sense

Woman She chuckled Is that meant to insult me I would return the slap if I took you for a man Dany met his stare I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen the Unburnt Mother of Dragons khaleesi to Drogo’s riders and queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros

What you are said Prendahl na Ghezn is a horselord’s whore When we break you I will breed you to my stallion

Strong Belwas drew his arakh Strong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen if she likes

No Belwas I have given these men my safe conduct She smiled Tell me this—are the Stormcrows slave or free

We are a brotherhood of free men Sallor declared

Good Dany stood Go back and tell your brothers what I said then It may be that some of them would sooner sup on gold and glory than on death I shall want your answer on the morrow

The Stormcrow captains rose in unison Our answer is no said Prendahl na Ghezn His fellows followed him out of the tent… but Daario Naharis glanced back as he left and inclined his head in polite farewell

Two hours later the commander of the Second Sons arrived alone He proved to be a towering Braavosi with pale green eyes and a bushy red-gold beard that reached nearly to his belt His name was Mero but he called himself the Titan’s Bastard

Mero tossed down his wine straightaway wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and leered at Dany I believe I fucked your twin sister in a pleasure house back home Or was it you

I think not I would remember a man of such magnificence I have no doubt

Yes that is so No woman has ever forgotten the Titan’s Bastard The Braavosi held out his cup to Jhiqui What say you take those clothes off and come sit on my lap If you please me I might bring the Second Sons over to your side

If you bring the Second Sons over to my side I might not have you gelded

The big man laughed Little girl another woman once tried to geld me with her teeth She has no teeth now but my sword is as long and thick as ever Shall I take it out and show you

No need After my eunuchs cut it off I can examine it at my leisure Dany took a sip of wine It is true that I am only a young girl and do not know the ways of war Explain to me how you propose to defeat ten thousand Unsullied with your five hundred Innocent as I am these odds seem poor to me

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run At Qohor when the Three Thousand made their stand Or do you deny it

That was many and more years ago before the Second Sons were led by the Titan’s Bastard

So it is from you they get their courage Dany turned to Ser Jorah When the battle is joined kill this one first

The exile knight smiled Gladly Your Grace

Of course she said to Mero you could run again We will not stop you Take your Yunkish gold and go

Had you ever seen the Titan of Braavos foolish girl you would know that it has no tail to turn

Then stay and fight for me

You are worth fighting for it is true the Braavosi said and I would gladly let you kiss my sword if I were free But I have taken Yunkai’s coin and pledged my holy word

Coins can be returned she said I will pay you as much and more I have other cities to conquer and a whole kingdom awaiting me half a world away Serve me faithfully and the Second Sons need never seek hire again

The Braavosi tugged on his thick red beard As much and more and perhaps a kiss besides eh Or more than a kiss For a man as magnificent as me

Perhaps
