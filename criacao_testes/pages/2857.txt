3925 He saith among the trumpets Ha ha and he smelleth the battle
afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting

3926 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward
the south  3927 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her
nest on high  3928 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the
crag of the rock and the strong place

3929 From thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off

3930 Her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are
there is she

401 Moreover the LORD answered Job and said 402 Shall he that
contendeth with the Almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let
him answer it

403 Then Job answered the LORD and said 404 Behold I am vile
what shall I answer thee I will lay mine hand upon my mouth

405 Once have I spoken but I will not answer yea twice but I will
proceed no further

406 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind and said
407 Gird up thy loins now like a man I will demand of thee and
declare thou unto me

408 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that
thou mayest be righteous  409 Hast thou an arm like God or canst
thou thunder with a voice like him  4010 Deck thyself now with
majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty

4011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is
proud and abase him

4012 Look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread
down the wicked in their place

4013 Hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret

4014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee

4015 Behold now behemoth which I made with thee he eateth grass as
an ox

4016 Lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the
navel of his belly

4017 He moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are
wrapped together

4018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars
of iron

4019 He is the chief of the ways of God he that made him can make
his sword to approach unto him

4020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts
of the field play

4021 He lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and
fens

4022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the
brook compass him about

4023 Behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth
that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth

4024 He taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares

411 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a
cord which thou lettest down  412 Canst thou put an hook into his
nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn  413 Will he make many
supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee  414
Will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant
for ever  415 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou
bind him for thy maidens  416 Shall the companions make a banquet of
him shall they part him among the merchants  417 Canst thou fill
his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears  418 Lay
thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more

419 Behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down
even at the sight of him  4110 None is so fierce that dare stir him
up who then is able to stand before me  4111 Who hath prevented me
that I should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine

4112 I will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely
proportion

4113 Who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him
with his double bridle  4114 Who can open the doors of his face his
teeth are terrible round about

4115 His scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal

4116 One is so near to another that no air can come between them

4117 They are joined one to another they stick together that they
