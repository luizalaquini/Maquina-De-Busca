give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were
reckoned by genealogies among the Levites

3120 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah and wrought that
which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God

3121 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
God and in the law and in the commandments to seek his God he did
it with all his heart and prospered

321 After these things and the establishment thereof Sennacherib
king of Assyria came and entered into Judah and encamped against the
fenced cities and thought to win them for himself

322 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he was
purposed to fight against Jerusalem 323 He took counsel with his
princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which
were without the city and they did help him

324 So there was gathered much people together who stopped all the
fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land
saying Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water
325 Also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was
broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and
repaired Millo in the city of David and made darts and shields in
abundance

326 And he set captains of war over the people and gathered them
together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake
comfortably to them saying 327 Be strong and courageous be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all the multitude
that is with him for there be more with us than with him 328 With
him is an arm of flesh but with us is the LORD our God to help us
and to fight our battles And the people rested themselves upon the
words of Hezekiah king of Judah

329 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
Jerusalem but he himself laid siege against Lachish and all his
power with him unto Hezekiah king of Judah and unto all Judah that
were at Jerusalem saying 3210 Thus saith Sennacherib king of
Assyria Whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem
3211 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
famine and by thirst saying The LORD our God shall deliver us out of
the hand of the king of Assyria  3212 Hath not the same Hezekiah
taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and
Jerusalem saying Ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense
upon it  3213 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all
the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands
any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand  3214 Who was
there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly
destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your
God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand  3215 Now
therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this
manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom
was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand
of my fathers how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine
hand  3216 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God and
against his servant Hezekiah

3217 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel and to
speak against him saying As the gods of the nations of other lands
have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the God
of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand

3218 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews speech unto the
people of Jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to
trouble them that they might take the city

3219 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods
of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man

3220 And for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah the
son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven

3221 And the LORD sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of
valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
Assyria So he returned with shame of face to his own land And when
he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own
bowels slew him there with the sword

3222 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of
all other and guided them on every side

3223 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem and presents
to Hezekiah king of Judah so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thenceforth

3224 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto
the LORD and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign

3225 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon
him and upon Judah and Jerusalem

3226 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
heart both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of
the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah

3227 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made
