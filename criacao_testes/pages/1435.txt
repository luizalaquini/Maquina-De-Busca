Ser Jorah Mormont scowled You told the sellswords—

—that I wanted their answers on the morrow I made no promises about tonight The Stormcrows will be arguing about my offer The Second Sons will be drunk on the wine I gave Mero And the Yunkai’i believe they have three days We will take them under cover of this darkness

They will have scouts watching for us

And in the dark they will see hundreds of campfires burning said Dany If they see anything at all

Khaleesi said Jhogo I will deal with these scouts They are no riders only slavers on horses

Just so she agreed I think we should attack from three sides Grey Worm your Unsullied shall strike at them from right and left while my kos lead my horse in wedge for a thrust through their center Slave soldiers will never stand before mounted Dothraki She smiled To be sure I am only a young girl and know little of war What do you think my lords

I think you are Rhaegar Targaryen’s sister Ser Jorah said with a rueful half smile

Aye said Arstan Whitebeard and a queen as well

It took an hour to work out all the details Now begins the most dangerous time Dany thought as her captains departed to their commands She could only pray that the gloom of the night would hide her preparations from the foe

Near midnight she got a scare when Ser Jorah bulled his way past Strong Belwas The Unsullied caught one of the sellswords trying to sneak into the camp

A spy That frightened her If they’d caught one how many others might have gotten away

He claims to come bearing gifts It’s the yellow fool with the blue hair

Daario Naharis That one I’ll hear him then

When the exile knight delivered him she asked herself whether two men had ever been so different The Tyroshi was fair where Ser Jorah was swarthy lithe where the knight was brawny graced with flowing locks where the other was balding yet smooth-skinned where Mormont was hairy And her knight dressed plainly while this other made a peacock look drab though he had thrown a heavy black cloak over his bright yellow finery for this visit He carried a heavy canvas sack slung over one shoulder

Khaleesi he cried I bring gifts and glad tidings The Stormcrows are yours A golden tooth gleamed in his mouth when he smiled And so is Daario Naharis

Dany was dubious If this Tyroshi had come to spy this declaration might be no more than a desperate plot to save his head What do Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor say of this

Little Daario upended the sack and the heads of Sallor the Bald and Prendahl na Ghezn spilled out upon her carpets My gifts to the dragon queen

Viserion sniffed the blood leaking from Prendahl’s neck and let loose a gout of flame that took the dead man full in the face blackening and blistering his bloodless cheeks Drogon and Rhaegal stirred at the smell of roasted meat

You did this Dany asked queasily

None other If her dragons discomfited Daario Naharis he hid it well For all the mind he paid them they might have been three kittens playing with a mouse

Why

Because you are so beautiful His hands were large and strong and there was something in his hard blue eyes and great curving nose that suggested the fierceness of some splendid bird of prey Prendahl talked too much and said too little His garb rich as it was had seen hard wear salt stains patterned his boots the enamel of his nails was chipped his lace was soiled by sweat and she could see where the end of his cloak was fraying And Sallor picked his nose as if his snot was gold He stood with his hands crossed at the wrists his palms resting on the pommels of his blades a curving Dothraki arakh on his left hip a Myrish stiletto on his right Their hilts were a matched pair of golden women naked and wanton

Are you skilled in the use of those handsome blades Dany asked him

Prendahl and Sallor would tell you so if dead men could talk I count no day as lived unless I have loved a woman slain a foeman and eaten a fine meal… and the days that I have lived are as numberless as the stars in the sky I make of slaughter a thing of beauty and many a tumbler and fire dancer has wept to the gods that they might be half so quick a quarter so graceful I would tell you the names of all the men I have slain but before I could finish your dragons would grow large as castles the walls of Yunkai would crumble into yellow dust and winter would come and go and come again

Dany laughed She liked the swagger she saw in this Daario Naharis Draw your sword and swear it to my service

In a blink Daario’s arakh was free of its sheath His submission was as outrageous as the rest of him a great swoop that brought his face down to her toes My sword is yours My life is yours My love is yours My blood my body my songs you own them all I live and die at your command fair queen

Then live Dany said and fight for me tonight

That would not be wise my queen Ser Jorah gave Daario a cold hard stare Keep this one here under guard until the battle’s fought and won

She considered a moment then shook her head If he can give us the Stormcrows surprise is certain

And if he betrays you surprise is lost

Dany looked down at the sellsword again He gave her such a smile that she flushed and turned away He won’t

How can you know that

She pointed to the lumps of blackened flesh the dragons were consuming bite by bloody bite I would call that proof of his sincerity Daario Naharis have your Stormcrows ready to strike the Yunkish rear when my attack begins Can you get back safely

If they stop me I will say I have been scouting and saw nothing The Tyroshi rose to his feet bowed and swept out

Ser Jorah Mormont lingered Your Grace he said too bluntly that was a mistake We know nothing of this man—

We know that he is a great fighter

A great talker you mean

He brings us the Stormcrows And he has blue eyes

Five hundred sellswords of uncertain loyalty

All loyalties are uncertain in such times as these Dany reminded him And I shall be betrayed twice more once for gold and once for love

Daenerys I am thrice your age Ser Jorah said I have seen how false men are Very few are worthy of trust and Daario Naharis is not one of them Even his beard wears false colors

That angered her Whilst you have an honest beard is that what you are telling me You are the only man I should ever trust

He stiffened I did not say that

You say it every day Pyat Pree’s a liar Xaro’s a schemer Belwas a braggart Arstan an assassin… do you think I’m still some virgin girl that I cannot hear the words behind the words

Your Grace—

She bulled over him You have been a better friend to me than any I have known a better brother than Viserys ever was You are the first of my Queensguard the commander of my army my most valued counselor my good right hand I honor and respect and cherish you—but I do not desire you Jorah Mormont and I am weary of your trying to push every other man in the world away from me so I must needs rely on you and you alone It will not serve and it will not make me love you any better

Mormont had flushed red when she first began but by the time Dany was done his face was pale again He stood still as stone If my queen commands he said curt and cold

Dany was warm enough for both of them She does she said She commands Now go see to your Unsullied ser You have a battle to fight and win

When he was gone Dany threw herself down on her pillows beside her dragons She had not meant to be so sharp with Ser Jorah but his endless suspicion had finally woken her dragon

He will forgive me she told herself I am his liege Dany found herself wondering whether he was right about Daario She felt very lonely all of a sudden Mirri Maz Duur had promised that she would never bear a living child House Targaryen will end with me That made her sad You must be my children she told the dragons my three fierce children Arstan says dragons live longer than men so you will go on after I am dead
