The immortal tune ended a fine DD rolling forth
from the bass-viol with the sonorousness of a cannonade
and Gabriel delayed his entry no longer He avoided
Bathsheba and got as near as possible to the platform
where Sergeant Troy was now seated drinking brandy+
and-water though the others drank without exception
cider and ale Gabriel could not easily thrust himself
within speaking distance of the sergeant and he sent
a message asking him to come down for a moment
The sergeant said he could not attend
Will you tell him then said Gabriel that I only
stepped athart to say that a heavy rain is sure to fall
soon and that something should be done to protect
the ricks 
M Troy says it will not rain returned the
messenger and he cannot stop to talk to you about
such fidgets
In Juxtaposition with Troy Oak had a melancholy
tendency to look like a candle beside gas and ill at
ease he went out again thinking he would go home 
for under the circumstances he had no heart for the
scene in the barn At the door he paused for a
moment  Troy was speaking
Friends it is not only the harvest home that we
are celebrating to-night but this is also a Wedding
Feast A short time ago I had the happiness to lead
to the altar this lady your mistress and not until now
have we been able to give any public flourish to the
event in Weatherbury That it may be thoroughly
well done and that every man may go happy to bed
I have ordered to be brought here some bottles of
brandy and kettles of hot water A treble-strong
goblet will he handed round to each guest
Bathsheba put her hand upon his arm and with
upturned pale face said imploringly  No -- dont give
it to them -- pray dont Frank  It will only do them
harm  they have had enough of everything
True -- we dont wish for no more thank ye said
one or two
Pooh   said the sergeant contemptuously and
raised his
P 300
voice as if lighted up by a new idea
 Friends he said  well send the women-folk home 
Tis time they were in bed Then we cockbirds will
have a jolly carouse to ourselves  If any of the men
show the white feather let them look elsewhere for a
winters work
Bathsheba indignantly left the barn followed by
all the women and children The musicians not
looking upon themselves as  company slipped quietly
away to their spring waggon and put in the horse
Thus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole
occupants of the place Oak not to appear unneces+
sarily disagreeable stayed a little while  then he too
arose and quietly took his departure followed by a
friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a
second round of grog
Gabriel proceeded towards his home In approach+
ing the door his toe kicked something which felt and
sounded soft leathery and distended like a boxing+
glove It was a large toad humbly travelling across
the path Oak took it up thinking it might be better
to kill the creature to save it from pain but finding
it uninjured he placed it again among the grass He
knew what this direct message from the Great Mother
meant And soon came another
When he struck a light indoors there appeared upon
the table a thin glistening streak as if a brush of varnish
had been lightly dragged across it Oaks eyes followed
the serpentine sheen to the other side where it led up
to a huge brown garden-slug which had come indoors
to-night for reasons of its own It was Natures second
way of hinting to him that he was to prepare for foul
weather
Oak sat down meditating for nearly an hour
During this time two black spiders of the kind common
in thatched houses promenaded the ceiling ultimately
dropping to the floor This reminded him that if there
was one class of manifestation on this matter that he
thoroughly understood it was the instincts of sheep
He left the room ran across two or three fields towards
the flock got upon a hedge and looked over among
them
They were crowded close together on the other side
around some
P 301
furze bushes and the first peculiarity ob+
servable was that on the sudden appearance of Oaks
head over the fence they did not stir or run away
They had now a terror of something greater than their
terror of man But this was not the most noteworthy
feature  they were all grouped in such a way that their
tails without a single exception were towards that half
of the horizon from which the storm threatened There
was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these
they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the
flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace
collar to which the clump of furze-bushes stood in the
position of a wearers neck
