If so I’d know Cersei keeps no secrets from me

Then it was the Imp

Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran He wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s window spying

Then why did the assassin have his dagger

What dagger was this

It was so long she said holding her hands apart plain but finely made with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day

Lannister poured drank poured and stared into his wine cup This wine seems to be improving as I drink it Imagine that I seem to remember that dagger now that you describe it Won it you say How

Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers Yet when she heard her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong No… was it the other way

Tyrion always backed me in the lists Jaime said but that day Ser Loras unhorsed me A mischance I took the boy too lightly but no matter Whatever my brother wagered he lost… but that dagger did change hands I recall it now Robert showed it to me that night at the feast His Grace loved to salt my wounds especially when drunk And when was he not drunk

Tyrion Lannister had said much the same thing as they rode through the Mountains of the Moon Catelyn remembered She had refused to believe him Petyr had sworn otherwise Petyr who had been almost a brother Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her hand… and yet if Jaime and Tyrion told the same tale what did that mean The brothers had not seen each other since departing Winterfell more than a year ago Are you trying to deceive me Somewhere there was a trap here

I’ve admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window what would it gain me to lie about this knife He tossed down another cup of wine Believe what you will I’m past caring what people say of me And it’s my turn Have Robert’s brothers taken the field

They have

Now there’s a niggardly response Give me more than that or your next answer will be as poor

Stannis marches against King’s Landing she said grudgingly Renly is dead murdered at Bitterbridge by his brother through some black art I do not understand

A pity Jaime said I rather liked Renly though Stannis is quite another tale What side have the Tyrells taken

Renly at first Now I could not say

Your boy must be feeling lonely

Robb was sixteen a few days past… a man grown and a king He’s won every battle he’s fought The last word we had from him he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings

He hasn’t faced my father yet has he

When he does he’ll defeat him As he did you

He took me unawares A craven’s trick

You dare talk of tricks Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoy’s garb under a peace banner

If it were one of your sons in this cell wouldn’t his brothers do as much for him

My son has no brothers she thought but she would not share her pain with a creature such as this

Jaime drank some more wine What’s a brother’s life when honor is at stake eh Another sip Tyrion is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom me

Catelyn could not deny it Robb’s bannermen would sooner see you dead Rickard Karstark in particular You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood

The two with the white sunburst were they Jaime gave a shrug If truth be told it was your son that I was trying to slay The others got in my way I killed them in fair fight in the heat of battle Any other knight would have done the same

How can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

Jaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup So many vows… they make you swear and swear Defend the king Obey the king Keep his secrets Do his bidding Your life for his But obey your father Love your sister Protect the innocent Defend the weak Respect the gods Obey the laws It’s too much No matter what you do you’re forsaking one vow or the other He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed his eyes for an instant leaning his head back against the patch of nitre on the wall I was the youngest man ever to wear the white cloak

And the youngest to betray all it stood for Kingslayer

Kingslayer he pronounced carefully And such a king he was He lifted his cup To Aerys Targaryen the Second of His Name Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm And to the sword that opened his throat A golden sword don’t you know Until his blood ran red down the blade Those are the Lannister colors red and gold

As he laughed she realized the wine had done its work Jaime had drained most of the flagon and he was drunk Only a man like you would be proud of such an act

I told you there are no men like me Answer me this Lady Stark—did your Ned ever tell you the manner of his father’s death Or his brother’s

They strangled Brandon while his father watched and then killed Lord Rickard as well An ugly tale and sixteen years old Why was he asking about it now

Killed yes but how

The cord or the axe I suppose

Jaime took a swallow wiped his mouth No doubt Ned wished to spare you His sweet young bride if not quite a maiden Well you wanted truth Ask me We made a bargain I can deny you nothing Ask

Dead is dead I do not want to know this

Brandon was different from his brother wasn’t he He had blood in his veins instead of cold water More like me

Brandon was nothing like you

If you say so You and he were to wed

He was on his way to Riverrun when… Strange how telling it still made her throat grow tight after all these years …when he heard about Lyanna and went to King’s Landing instead It was a rash thing to do She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun The gallant fool was what he called Brandon

Jaime poured the last half cup of wine He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die But Rhaegar wasn’t there Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son’s murder The others were lords’ sons too it seems to me

Ethan Glover was Brandon’s squire Catelyn said He was the only one to survive The others were Jeffory Mallister Kyle Royce and Elbert Arryn Jon Arryn’s nephew and heir It was queer how she still remembered the names after so many years Aerys accused them of treason and summoned their fathers to court to answer the charge with the sons as hostages When they came he had them murdered without trial Fathers and sons both

There were trials Of a sort Lord Rickard demanded trial by combat and the king granted the request Stark armored himself as for battle thinking to duel one of the Kingsguard Me perhaps Instead they took him to the throne room and suspended him from the rafters while two of Aerys’s pyromancers kindled a blaze beneath him The king told him that fire was the champion of House Targaryen So all Lord Rickard needed to do to prove himself innocent of treason was… well not burn

When the fire was blazing Brandon was brought in His hands were chained behind his back and around his neck was a wet leathern cord attached to a device the king had brought from Tyrosh His legs were left free though and his longsword was set down just beyond his reach

The pyromancers roasted Lord Rickard slowly banking and fanning that fire carefully to get a nice even heat His cloak caught first and then his surcoat and soon he wore nothing but metal and ashes Next he would start to cook Aerys promised… unless his son could free him Brandon tried but the more he struggled the tighter the cord constricted around his throat In the end he strangled himself

As for Lord Rickard the steel of his breastplate turned cherry-red before the end and his gold melted off his spurs and dripped down into the fire I stood at the foot of the Iron Throne in my white armor and white cloak filling my head with thoughts of Cersei After Gerold Hightower himself took me aside and said to me ‘You swore a vow to guard the king not to judge him’ That was the White Bull loyal to the end and a better man than me all agree

Aerys… Catelyn could taste bile at the back of her throat The story was so hideous she suspected it had to be true Aerys was mad the whole realm knew it but if you would have me believe you slew him to avenge Brandon Stark…

I made no such claim The Starks were nothing to me I will say I think it passing odd that I am loved by one for a kindness I never did and reviled by so many for my finest act At Robert’s coronation I was made to kneel at the royal feet beside Grand Maester Pycelle and Varys the eunuch so that he might forgive us our crimes before he took us into his service As for your Ned he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert’s throne I think Ned Stark loved Robert better than he ever loved his brother or his father… or even you my lady He was never unfaithful to Robert was he Jaime gave a drunken laugh Come Lady Stark don’t you find this all terribly amusing
