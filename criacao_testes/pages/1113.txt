He shall be our honored guest said Robb Ser Perwyn the youngest of the four Freys in the party dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother I require my lady mother’s return by evenfall Ser Stevron Robb went on It is not my intent to linger here long

Ser Stevron Frey gave a polite nod As you say my lord Catelyn spurred her horse forward and did not look back Lord Walder’s sons and envoys fell in around her

Her father had once said of Walder Frey that he was the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches When the Lord of the Crossing welcomed Catelyn in the great hall of the east castle surrounded by twenty living sons minus Ser Perwyn who would have made twenty-one thirty-six grandsons nineteen great-grandsons and numerous daughters granddaughters bastards and grandbastards she understood just what he had meant

Lord Walder was ninety a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head too gouty to stand unassisted His newest wife a pale frail girl of sixteen years walked beside his litter when they carried him in She was the eighth Lady Frey

It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord Catelyn said

The old man squinted at her suspiciously Is it I doubt that Spare me your sweet words Lady Catelyn I am too old Why are you here Is your boy too proud to come before me himself What am I to do with you

Catelyn had been a girl the last time she had visited the Twins but even then Lord Walder had been irascible sharp of tongue and blunt of manner Age had made him worse than ever it would seem She would need to choose her words with care and do her best to take no offense from his

Father Ser Stevron said reproachfully you forget yourself Lady Stark is here at your invitation

Did I ask you You are not Lord Frey yet not until I die Do I look dead I’ll hear no instructions from you

This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest Father one of his younger sons said

Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy Lord Walder complained I’ll speak any way I like damn you I’ve had three kings to guest in my life and queens as well do you think I require lessons from the likes of you Ryger Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed He dismissed the red-faced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons Danwell Whalen help me to my chair

They shifted Lord Walder from his litter and carried him to the high seat of the Freys a tall chair of black oak whose back was carved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge His young wife crept up timidly and covered his legs with a blanket When he was settled the old man beckoned Catelyn forward and planted a papery dry kiss on her hand There he announced Now that I have observed the courtesies my lady perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths Why are you here

To ask you to open your gates my lord Catelyn replied politely My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way

To Riverrun He sniggered Oh no need to tell me no need I’m not blind yet The old man can still read a map

To Riverrun Catelyn confirmed She saw no reason to deny it Where I might have expected to find you my lord You are still my father’s bannerman are you not

Heh said Lord Walder a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt I called my swords yes I did here they are you saw them on the walls It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled Well to send my sons I am well past marching myself Lady Catelyn He looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a tall stooped man of fifty years Tell her Jared Tell her that was my intent

It was my lady said Ser Jared Frey one of his sons by his second wife On my honor

Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her as if challenging her to dispute his version of events I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese Why should my boys hurry south to die All those who did go south are running north again

Catelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted him over a fire but she had only till evenfall to open the bridge Calmly she said All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun and soon Where can we go to talk my lord

We’re talking now Lord Frey complained The spotted pink head snapped around What are you all looking at he shouted at his kin Get out of here Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private Might be she has designs on my fidelity heh Go all of you find something useful to do Yes you too woman Out out out As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed They’re all waiting for me to die Stevron’s been waiting for forty years but I keep disappointing him Heh Why should I die just so he can be a lord I ask you I won’t do it

I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred

That would boil them to be sure Oh to be sure Now what do you want to say

We want to cross Catelyn told him

Oh do you That’s blunt Why should I let you

For a moment her anger flared If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements Lord Frey you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls

They’ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here the old man shot back Don’t you try and frighten me my lady Your husband’s in some traitor’s cell under the Red Keep your father’s sick might be dying and Jaime Lannister’s got your brother in chains What do you have that I should fear That son of yours I’ll match you son for son and I’ll still have eighteen when yours are all dead

You swore an oath to my father Catelyn reminded him

He bobbed his head side to side smiling Oh yes I said some words but I swore oaths to the crown too it seems to me Joffrey’s the king now and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels If I had the sense the gods gave a fish I’d help the Lannisters boil you all

Why don’t you she challenged him

Lord Walder snorted with disdain Lord Tywin the proud and splendid Warden of the West Hand of the King oh what a great man that one is him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there I’ll wager you he eats too many beans he breaks wind just like me but you’ll never hear him admit it oh no What’s he got to be so puffed up about anyway Only two sons and one of them’s a twisted little monster I’ll match him son for son and I’ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead He cackled If Lord Tywin wants my help he can bloody well ask for it

That was all Catelyn needed to hear I am asking for your help my lord she said humbly And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice

Lord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face Save your sweet words my lady Sweet words I get from my wife Did you see her Sixteen she is a little flower and her honey’s only for me I wager she gives me a son by this time next year Perhaps I’ll make him heir wouldn’t that boil the rest of them

I’m certain she will give you many sons

His head bobbed up and down Your lord father did not come to the wedding An insult as I see it Even if he is dying He never came to my last wedding either He calls me the Late Lord Frey you know Does he think I’m dead I’m not dead and I promise you I’ll outlive him as I outlived his father Your family has always pissed on me don’t deny it don’t lie you know it’s true Years ago I went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter Why not I had a daughter in mind sweet girl only a few years older than Edmure but if your brother didn’t warm to her I had others he might have had young ones old ones virgins widows whatever he wanted No Lord Hoster would not hear of it Sweet words he gave me excuses but what I wanted was to get rid of a daughter

And your sister that one she’s full as bad It was oh a year ago no more Jon Arryn was still the King’s Hand and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney Stevron and Jared are too old for the lists now but Danwell and Hosteen rode Perwyn as well and a couple of my bastards tried the melee If I’d known how they’d shame me I would never have troubled myself to make the journey Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp I ask you The boy’s half his age Ser Daisy they call him something like that And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine My third wife was a Crakehall all of the Crakehall women are sluts Well never mind about that she died before you were born what do you care

I was speaking of your sister I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king’s court They are sweet boys quiet and mannerly Walder is Merrett’s son named after me and the other one… heh I don’t recall… he might have been another Walder they’re always naming them Walder so I’ll favor them but his father… which one was his father now His face wrinkled up Well whoever he was Lord Arryn wouldn’t have him or the other one and I blame your lady sister for that She frosted up as if I’d suggested selling her boy to a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies What good are apologies I ask you

Catelyn frowned disquieted I had understood that Lysa’s boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock

No it was Lord Stannis Walder Frey said irritably Do you think I can’t tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin They’re both bungholes who think they’re too noble to shit but never mind about that I know the difference Or do you think I’m so old I can’t remember I’m ninety and I remember very well I remember what to do with a woman too That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year I’ll wager Or a daughter that can’t be helped Boy or girl it will be red wrinkled and squalling and like as not she’ll want to name it Walder or Walda

Catelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis you are quite certain of that

Yes yes yes the old man said Only he died so what does it matter You say you want to cross the river

We do

Well you can’t Lord Walder announced crisply Not unless I allow it and why should I The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine He pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms smirking waiting for her answer

The rest was only haggling

A swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened The drawbridge creaked down the portcullis winched up and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen Behind her came Ser Jared Frey Ser Hosteen Frey Ser Danwell Frey and Lord Walder’s bastard son Ronel Rivers leading a long column of pikemen rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks

Robb galloped out to meet her with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion It’s done she told him Lord Walder will grant you your crossing His swords are yours as well less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own a mixed force of archers and swordsmen He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison… but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust Lord Walder may need help keeping faith

As you say Mother Robb answered gazing at the ranks of pikemen Perhaps… Ser Helman Tallhart do you think

A fine choice

What… what did he want of us

If you can spare a few of your swords I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey’s grandsons north to Winterfell she told him I have agreed to take them as wards They are young boys aged eight years and seven It would seem they are both named Walder Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age I should think

Is that all Two fosterlings That’s a small enough price to—
