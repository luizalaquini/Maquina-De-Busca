533 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband

61 Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right

62 Honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with
promise 63 That it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long
on the earth

64 And ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord

65 Servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to
the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as
unto Christ 66 Not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the
servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart 67 With
good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men 68 Knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of
the Lord whether he be bond or free

69 And ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing
threatening knowing that your Master also is in heaven neither is
there respect of persons with him

610 Finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of
his might

611 Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil

612 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against
principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of
this world against spiritual wickedness in high places

613 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be
able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand

614 Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and
having on the breastplate of righteousness 615 And your feet shod
with the preparation of the gospel of peace 616 Above all taking
the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked

617 And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit
which is the word of God 618 Praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the Spirit and watching thereunto with all
perseverance and supplication for all saints 619 And for me that
utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to
make known the mystery of the gospel 620 For which I am an
ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to
speak

621 But that ye also may know my affairs and how I do Tychicus a
beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord shall make known to
you all things 622 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose
that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts

623 Peace be to the brethren and love with faith from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

624 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity

Amen




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians


11 Paul and Timotheus the servants of Jesus Christ to all the
saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and
deacons 12 Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and
from the Lord Jesus Christ

13 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you 14 Always in every
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy 15 For your
fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now 16 Being
confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ 17 Even as it is
meet for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart
inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of
the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace

18 For God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the
bowels of Jesus Christ

19 And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and in all judgment 110 That ye may approve things that
are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day
of Christ

111 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus
Christ unto the glory and praise of God

112 But I would ye should understand brethren that the things which
happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
gospel 113 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the
palace and in all other places 114 And many of the brethren in the
