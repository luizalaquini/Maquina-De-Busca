Harwin’s eyes went from her face to the flayed man on her doublet How do you know me he said frowning suspiciously The flayed man… who are you some serving boy to Lord Leech

For a moment she did not know how to answer She’d had so many names Had she only dreamed Arya Stark I’m a girl she sniffed I was Lord Bolton’s cupbearer but he was going to leave me for the goat so I ran off with Gendry and Hot Pie You have to know me You used to lead my pony when I was little

His eyes went wide Gods be good he said in a choked voice Arya Underfoot Lem let go of her

She broke my nose Lem dumped her unceremoniously to the floor Who in seven hells is she supposed to be

The Hand’s daughter Harwin went to one knee before her Arya Stark of Winterfell





Catelyn


Robb she knew the moment she heard the kennels erupt

Her son had returned to Riverrun and Grey Wind with him Only the scent of the great grey direwolf could send the hounds into such a frenzy of baying and barking He will come to me she knew Edmure had not returned after his first visit preferring to spend his days with Marq Piper and Patrek Mallister listening to Rymund the Rhymer’s verses about the battle at the Stone Mill Robb is not Edmure though Robb will see me

It had been raining for days now a cold grey downpour that well suited Catelyn’s mood Her father was growing weaker and more delirious with every passing day waking only to mutter Tansy and beg forgiveness Edmure shunned her and Ser Desmond Grell still denied her freedom of the castle however unhappy it seemed to make him Only the return of Ser Robin Ryger and his men footweary and drenched to the bone served to lighten her spirits They had walked back it seemed Somehow the Kingslayer had contrived to sink their galley and escape Maester Vyman confided Catelyn asked if she might speak with Ser Robin to learn more of what had happened but that was refused her

Something else was wrong as well On the day her brother returned a few hours after their argument she had heard angry voices from the yard below When she climbed to the roof to see there were knots of men gathered across the castle beside the main gate Horses were being led from the stables saddled and bridled and there was shouting though Catelyn was too far away to make out the words One of Robb’s white banners lay on the ground and one of the knights turned his horse and trampled over the direwolf as he spurred toward the gate Several others did the same Those are men who fought with Edmure on the fords she thought What could have made them so angry Has my brother slighted them somehow given them some insult She thought she recognized Ser Perwyn Frey who had traveled with her to Bitterbridge and Storm’s End and back and his bastard half brother Martyn Rivers as well but from this vantage it was hard to be certain Close to forty men poured out through the castle gates to what end she did not know

They did not come back Nor would Maester Vyman tell her who they had been where they had gone or what had made them so angry I am here to see to your father and only that my lady he said Your brother will soon be Lord of Riverrun What he wishes you to know he must tell you

But now Robb was returned from the west returned in triumph He will forgive me Catelyn told herself He must forgive me he is my own son and Arya and Sansa are as much his blood as mine He will free me from these rooms and then I will know what has happened

By the time Ser Desmond came for her she had bathed and dressed and combed out her auburn hair King Robb has returned from the west my lady the knight said and commands that you attend him in the Great Hall

It was the moment she had dreamt of and dreaded Have I lost two sons or three She would know soon enough

The hall was crowded when they entered Every eye was on the dais but Catelyn knew their backs Lady Mormont’s patched ringmail the Greatjon and his son looming above every other head in the hall Lord Jason Mallister white-haired with his winged helm in the crook of his arm Tytos Blackwood in his magnificent raven-feather cloak… Half of them will want to hang me now The other half may only turn their eyes away She had the uneasy feeling that someone was missing too

Robb stood on the dais He is a boy no longer she realized with a pang He is sixteen now a man grown Just look at him War had melted all the softness from his face and left him hard and lean He had shaved his beard away but his auburn hair fell uncut to his shoulders The recent rains had rusted his mail and left brown stains on the white of his cloak and surcoat Or perhaps the stains were blood On his head was the sword crown they had fashioned him of bronze and iron He bears it more comfortably now He bears it like a king

Edmure stood below the crowded dais head bowed modestly as Robb praised his victory …fell at the Stone Mill shall never be forgotten Small wonder Lord Tywin ran off to fight Stannis He’d had his fill of northmen and rivermen both That brought laughter and approving shouts but Robb raised a hand for quiet Make no mistake though The Lannisters will march again and there will be other battles to win before the kingdom is secure

The Greatjon roared out King in the North and thrust a mailed fist into the air The river lords answered with a shout of King of the Trident The hall grew thunderous with pounding fists and stamping feet

Only a few noted Catelyn and Ser Desmond amidst the tumult but they elbowed their fellows and slowly a hush grew around her She held her head high and ignored the eyes Let them think what they will It is Robb’s judgment that matters

The sight of Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face on the dais gave her comfort A boy she did not know seemed to be acting as Robb’s squire Behind him stood a young knight in a sand-colored surcoat blazoned with seashells and an older one who wore three black pepperpots on a saffron bend across a field of green and silver stripes Between them were a handsome older lady and a pretty maid who looked to be her daughter There was another girl as well near Sansa’s age The seashells were the sigil of some lesser house Catelyn knew the older man’s she did not recognize Prisoners Why would Robb bring captives onto the dais

Utherydes Wayn banged his staff on the floor as Ser Desmond escorted her forward If Robb looks at me as Edmure did I do not know what I will do But it seemed to her that it was not anger she saw in her son’s eyes but something else… apprehension perhaps No that made no sense What should he fear He was the Young Wolf King of the Trident and the North

Her uncle was the first to greet her As black a fish as ever Ser Brynden had no care for what others might think He leapt off the dais and pulled Catelyn into his arms When he said It is good to see you home Cat she had to struggle to keep her composure And you she whispered

Mother

Catelyn looked up at her tall kingly son Your Grace I have prayed for your safe return I had heard you were wounded

I took an arrow through the arm while storming the Crag he said It’s healed well though I had the best of care
