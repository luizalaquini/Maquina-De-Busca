No Never Tyrion raised an eyebrow Well no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you I’m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own And your brother Robb he’s always been kind and why not He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall And your father… he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night’s Watch…

Stop it Jon Snow said his face dark with anger The Night’s Watch is a noble calling

Tyrion laughed You’re too smart to believe that The Night’s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm I’ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys Those are your new brothers Jon Snow how do you like them Sullen peasants debtors poachers rapers thieves and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks so it’s scarcely dangerous work The bad part is you freeze your balls off but since you’re not allowed to breed anyway I don’t suppose that matters

Stop it the boy screamed He took a step forward his hands coiling into fists close to tears

Suddenly absurdly Tyrion felt guilty He took a step forward intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology

He never saw the wolf where it was or how it came at him One moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground the book spinning away from him as he fell the breath going out of him at the sudden impact his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves As he tried to get up his back spasmed painfully He must have wrenched it in the fall He ground his teeth in frustration grabbed a root and pulled himself back to a sitting position Help me he said to the boy reaching up a hand

And suddenly the wolf was between them He did not growl The damned thing never made a sound He only looked at him with those bright red eyes and showed him his teeth and that was more than enough Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt Don’t help me then I’ll sit right here until you leave

Jon Snow stroked Ghost’s thick white fur smiling now Ask me nicely

Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him and crushed it out with a will It was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated and it would not be the last Perhaps he even deserved this I should be very grateful for your kind assistance Jon he said mildly

Down Ghost the boy said The direwolf sat on his haunches Those red eyes never left Tyrion Jon came around behind him slid his hands under his arms and lifted him easily to his feet Then he picked up the book and handed it back

Why did he attack me Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand

Maybe he thought you were a grumkin

Tyrion glanced at him sharply Then he laughed a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission Oh gods he said choking on his laughter and shaking his head I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin What does he do to snarks

You don’t want to know Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion

Tyrion pulled out the stopper tilted his head and squeezed a long stream into his mouth The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly He held out the skin to Jon Snow Want some

The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow It’s true isn’t it he said when he was done What you said about the Night’s Watch

Tyrion nodded

Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line If that’s what it is that’s what it is

Tyrion grinned at him That’s good bastard Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it

Most men the boy said But not you

No Tyrion admitted not me I seldom even dream of dragons anymore There are no dragons He scooped up the fallen bearskin Come we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners

The walk was short but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots but Tyrion shook him off He would make his own way as he had all his life Still the camp was a welcome sight The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast a shield against the wind The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid Yoren sat on a stone skinning a squirrel The savory smell of stew filled Tyrion’s nostrils He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot Wordlessly Morrec handed him the ladle Tyrion tasted and handed it back More pepper he said

Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew There you are Jon damn it don’t go off like that by yourself I thought the Others had gotten you

It was the grumkins Tyrion told him laughing Jon Snow smiled Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren The old man grunted shrugged and went back to his bloody work

The squirrel gave some body to the stew and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep all but Jon Snow who had drawn the night’s first watch

Tyrion was the last to retire as always As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him he paused and looked back at Jon Snow The boy stood near the fire his face still and hard looking deep into the flames

Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed





CATELYN

Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran’s sickroom carrying a reading lamp and the books of account It is past time that we reviewed the figures my lady he said You’ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us

Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead It had grown very long she realized She would have to cut it soon I have no need to look at figures Maester Luwin she told him never taking her eyes from Bran I know what the visit cost us Take the books away

My lady the king’s party had healthy appetites We must replenish our stores before—

She cut him off I said take the books away The steward will attend to our needs

We have no steward Maester Luwin reminded her Like a little grey rat she thought he would not let go Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard’s household at King’s Landing

Catelyn nodded absently Oh yes I remember Bran looked so pale She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window so he could get the morning sun

Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick There are several appointments that require your immediate attention my lady Besides the steward we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory’s place a new master of horse—

Her eyes snapped around and found him A master of horse Her voice was a whip

The maester was shaken Yes my lady Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard so—

My son lies here broken and dying Luwin and you wish to discuss a new master of horse Do you think I care what happens in the stables Do you think it matters to me one whit I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran’s eyes do you understand that Do you

He bowed his head Yes my lady but the appointments—

I’ll make the appointments Robb said

Catelyn had not heard him enter but there he stood in the doorway looking at her She had been shouting she realized with a sudden flush of shame What was happening to her She was so tired and her head hurt all the time

Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices he said offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve

Her son glanced at the names He had come from outside Catelyn saw his cheeks were red from the cold his hair shaggy and windblown Good men he said We’ll talk about them tomorrow He handed back the list of names

Very good my lord The paper vanished into his sleeve

Leave us now Robb said Maester Luwin bowed and departed Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her He was wearing a sword she saw Mother what are you doing

Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her like Bran and Rickon and Sansa he had the Tully coloring the auburn hair the blue eyes Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face something as stern and hard as the north What am I doing she echoed puzzled How can you ask that What do you imagine I’m doing I am taking care of your brother I am taking care of Bran

Is that what you call it You haven’t left this room since Bran was hurt You didn’t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south

I said my farewells to them here and watched them ride out from that window She had begged Ned not to go not now not after what had happened everything had changed now couldn’t he see that It was no use He had no choice he had told her and then he left choosing I can’t leave him even for a moment not when any moment could be his last I have to be with him if… if… She took her son’s limp hand sliding his fingers through her own He was so frail and thin with no strength left in his hand but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin
