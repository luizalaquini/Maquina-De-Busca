It was only a bad dream…

Jojen stood I felt you I felt you fall Is that what scares you the falling

The falling Bran thought and the golden man the queen’s brother he scares me too but mostly the falling He did not say it though How could he He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin and he could not tell the Reeds either If he didn’t talk about it maybe he would forget He had never wanted to remember It might not even be a true remembering

Do you fall every night Bran Joien asked quietly

A low rumbling growl rose from Summer’s throat and there was no play in it He stalked forward all teeth and hot eyes Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother spear in hand Keep him back Bran

Jojen is making him angry

Meera shook out her net

It’s your anger Bran her brother said Your fear

It isn’t I’m not a wolf Yet he’d howled with them in the night and tasted blood in his wolf dreams

Part of you is Summer and part of Summer is you You know that Bran

Summer rushed forward but Meera blocked him jabbing with the three-pronged spear The wolf twisted aside circling stalking Meera turned to face him Call him back Bran

Summer Bran shouted To me Summer He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh His hand tingled though his dead leg felt nothing

The direwolf lunged again and again Meera’s spear darted out Summer dodged circled back The bushes rustled and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood teeth bared The scent was strong his brother had smelled his rage Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck Meera stood beside her brother with wolves to either side Bran call them off

I can’t

Jojen up the tree

There’s no need Today is not the day I die

Do it she screamed and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood using the face for his handholds The direwolves closed Meera abandoned spear and net jumped up and grabbed the branch above her head Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb Summer sat back on his haunches and howled while Shaggydog worried the net shaking it in his teeth

Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone He cupped hands around his mouth Hodor he shouted Hodor Hodor He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed They won’t hurt Hodor he assured his treed friends

A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools but Bran had never been so glad to see him Hodor help me Chase off the wolves Chase them off

Hodor went to it gleefully waving his arms and stamping his huge feet shouting Hodor Hodor running first at one wolf and then the other Shaggydog was the first to flee slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl When Summer had enough he came back to Bran and lay down beside him

No sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again Jojen never took his eyes off Summer We will talk again he promised Bran

It was the wolves it wasn’t me He did not understand why they’d gotten so wild Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood Hodor he said bring me to Maester Luwin

The maester’s turret below the rookery was one of Bran’s favorite places Luwin was hopelessly untidy but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to Bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes He liked the ravens too

He found Luwin perched on a high stool writing With Ser Rodrik gone all of the governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders My prince he said when Hodor entered you’re early for lessons today The maester spent several hours every afternoon tutoring Bran Rickon and the Walder Freys

Hodor stand still Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull himself up and out of the basket He hung for a moment by his arms until Hodor carried him to a chair Meera says her brother has the greensight

Maester Luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill Does she now

He nodded You told me that the children of the forest had the greensight I remember

Some claimed to have that power Their wise men were called greenseers

Was it magic

Call it that for want of a better word if you must At heart it was only a different sort of knowledge

What was it

Luwin set down his quill No one truly knows Bran The children are gone from the world and their wisdom with them It had to do with the faces in the trees we think The First Men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods That was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children Supposedly the greenseers also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees Even fish Does the Reed boy claim such powers

No I don’t think But he has dreams that come true sometimes Meera says

All of us have dreams that come true sometimes You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew he was dead remember

Rickon did too We dreamed the same dream

Call it greensight if you wish… but remember as well all those tens of thousands of dreams that you and Rickon have dreamed that did not come true Do you perchance recall what I taught you about the chain collar that every maester wears

Bran thought for a moment trying to remember A maester forges his chain in the Citadel of Oldtown It’s a chain because you swear to serve and it’s made of different metals because you serve the realm and the realm has different sorts of people Every time you learn something you get another link Black iron is for ravenry silver for healing gold for sums and numbers I don’t remember them all

Luwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it inch by inch He had a thick neck for a small man and the chain was tight but a few pulls had it all the way around This is Valyrian steel he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat Only one maester in a hundred wears such a link This signifies that I have studied what the Citadel calls the higher mysteries—magic for want of a better word A fascinating pursuit but of small use which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it

All those who study the higher mysteries try their own hand at spells soon or late I yielded to the temptation too I must confess it Well I was a boy and what boy does not secretly wish to find hidden powers in himself I got no more for my efforts than a thousand boys before me and a thousand since Sad to say magic does not work

Sometimes it does Bran protested I had that dream and Rickon did too And there are mages and warlocks in the east…

There are men who call themselves mages and warlocks Maester Luwin said I had a friend at the Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear but he was no more magical than I was Oh to be sure there is much we do not understand The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands and what does any man see of life but a few summers a few winters We look at mountains and call them eternal and so they seem… but in the course of time mountains rise and fall rivers change their courses stars fall from the sky and great cities sink beneath the sea Even gods die we think Everything changes

Perhaps magic was once a mighty force in the world but no longer What little remains is no more than the wisp of smoke that lingers in the air after a great fire has burned out and even that is fading Valyria was the last ember and Valyria is gone The dragons are no more the giants are dead the children of the forest forgotten with all their lore

No my prince Jojen Reed may have had a dream or two that he believes came true but he does not have the greensight No living man has that power

Bran said as much to Meera Reed when she came to him at dusk as he sat in his window seat watching the lights flicker to life I’m sorry for what happened with the wolves Summer shouldn’t have tried to hurt Jojen but Jojen shouldn’t have said all that about my dreams The crow lied when he said I could fly and your brother lied too

Or perhaps your maester is wrong

He isn’t Even my father relied on his counsel

Your father listened I have no doubt But in the end he decided for himself Bran will you let me tell you about a dream Jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers

The Walders aren’t my brothers

She paid that no heed You were sitting at supper but instead of a servant Maester Luwin brought you your food He served you the king’s cut off the roast the meat rare and bloody but with a savory smell that made everyone’s mouth water The meat he served the Freys was old and grey and dead Yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours

I don’t understand
