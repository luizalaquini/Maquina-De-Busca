Although it is important that the method of specifying utterances be easily
learned it is not necessary that plain English
is used  It should be simple for the programmer to enter new
utterances and modify them on-line in cut-and-try attempts to render the
man-machine dialogue as natural as possible  A phonetic input
can be quite adequate for this especially if the system allows the
programmer to hear immediately the synthesized version of the message
he types  Furthermore markers which indicate rhythm and intonation can
be added to the message so that the system does not have to deduce these features
by attempting to understand the plain text

This brings us to another disadvantage of speech storage as compared with
speech synthesis  To provide utterances for a voice response system using
stored human speech one must assemble together special input hardware
a quiet room and probably a dedicated computer  If the speech is to be
heavily encoded either expensive special hardware is required or the encoding
process if performed by software on a general-purpose computer will take
a considerable length of time perhaps hundreds of times real-time  In
either case time-consuming editing of the speech will be necessary with
follow-up recordings to clarify sections of speech which turn out to be
unsuitable or badly recorded  If at a later date the voice response
system needs modification it will be necessary to recall the same speaker
or re-record the entire utterance set  This discourages the application
programmer from adjusting his dialogue in the light of experience
Synthesizing from a textual representation on the other hand allows him
to change a speech prompt as simply as he could a VDU one and evaluate
its effect immediately

We will return to methods of digitizing and compacting speech in Chapters 3
and 4 and carry on to consider speech synthesis in subsequent chapters
Firstly however it is necessary to take a look at what speech is and how
people produce it

There are remarkably few general books on speech output although a
substantial specialist literature exists for the subject
In addition to the references listed above I suggest that you look

A nice easy-going introduction to speech recognition this book covers
the acoustic structure of the speech signal in a way which makes
it useful as background reading for speech synthesis as well
It complements Lea 1980 cited above which presents more recent results
in greater depth

This is a collection of previously-published research papers on speech
synthesis rather than a unified book
It contains many of the classic papers on the subject from 1940 - 1972
and is a very useful reference work
