The old man smiled sadly I thought it might be

Dawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand The wind swirled around them stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire

We ride at noon the ranger told him Best find that wolf of yours





TYRION

The queen intends to send Prince Tommen away They knelt alone in the hushed dimness of the sept surrounded by shadows and flickering candles but even so Lancel kept his voice low Lord Gyles will take him to Rosby and conceal him there in the guise of a page They plan to darken his hair and tell everyone that he is the son of a hedge knight

Is it the mob she fears Or me

Both said Lancel

Ah Tyrion had known nothing of this ploy Had Varys’s little birds failed him for once Even spiders must nod he supposed… or was the eunuch playing a deeper and more subtle game than he knew You have my thanks ser

Will you grant me the boon I asked of you

Perhaps Lancel wanted his own command in the next battle A splendid way to die before he finished growing that mustache but young knights always think themselves invincible

Tyrion lingered after his cousin had slipped away At the Warrior’s altar he used one candle to light another Watch over my brother you bloody bastard he’s one of yours He lit a second candle to the Stranger for himself

That night when the Red Keep was dark Bronn arrived to find him sealing a letter Take this to Ser Jacelyn Bywater The dwarf dribbled hot golden wax down onto the parchment

What does it say Bronn could not read so he asked impudent questions

That he’s to take fifty of his best swords and scout the roseroad Tyrion pressed his seal into the soft wax

Stannis is more like to come up the kingsroad

Oh I know Tell Bywater to disregard what’s in the letter and take his men north He’s to lay a trap along the Rosby road Lord Gyles will depart for his castle in a day or two with a dozen men-at-arms some servants and my nephew Prince Tommen may be dressed as a page

You want the boy brought back is that it

No I want him taken on to the castle Removing the boy from the city was one of his sister’s better notions Tyrion had decided At Rosby Tommen would be safe from the mob and keeping him apart from his brother also made things more difficult for Stannis even if he took King’s Landing and executed Joffrey he’d still have a Lannister claimant to contend with Lord Gyles is too sickly to run and too craven to fight He’ll command his castellan to open the gates Once inside the walls Bywater is to expel the garrison and hold Tommen there safe Ask him how he likes the sound of Lord Bywater

Lord Bronn would sound better I could grab the boy for you just as well I’ll dandle him on my knee and sing him nursery songs if there’s a lordship in it

I need you here said Tyrion And I don’t trust you with my nephew Should any ill befall Joffrey the Lannister claim to the Iron Throne would rest on Tommen’s young shoulders Ser Jacelyn’s gold cloaks would defend the boy Bronn’s sellswords were more apt to sell him to his enemies

What should the new lord do with the old one

Whatever he pleases so long as he remembers to feed him I don’t want him dying Tyrion pushed away from the table My sister will send one of the Kingsguard with the prince

Bronn was not concerned The Hound is Joffrey’s dog he won’t leave him Ironhand’s gold cloaks should be able to handle the others easy enough

If it comes to killing tell Ser Jacelyn I won’t have it done in front of Tommen Tyrion donned a heavy cloak of dark brown wool My nephew is tender-hearted

Are you certain he’s a Lannister
