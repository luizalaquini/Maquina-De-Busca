him an hundred and ten males

813 And of the last sons of Adonikam whose names are these
Eliphelet Jeiel and Shemaiah and with them threescore males

814 Of the sons also of Bigvai Uthai and Zabbud and with them
seventy males

815 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava
and there abode we in tents three days and I viewed the people and
the priests and found there none of the sons of Levi

816 Then sent I for Eliezer for Ariel for Shemaiah and for
Elnathan and for Jarib and for Elnathan and for Nathan and for
Zechariah and for Meshullam chief men also for Joiarib and for
Elnathan men of understanding

817 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
Casiphia and I told them what they should say unto Iddo and to his
brethren the Nethinims at the place Casiphia that they should bring
unto us ministers for the house of our God

818 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
understanding of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi the son of
Israel and Sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen 819
And Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari his
brethren and their sons twenty 820 Also of the Nethinims whom
David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites
two hundred and twenty Nethinims all of them were expressed by name

821 Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava that we
might afflict ourselves before our God to seek of him a right way for
us and for our little ones and for all our substance

822 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had
spoken unto the king saying The hand of our God is upon all them for
good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them
that forsake him

823 So we fasted and besought our God for this and he was intreated
of us

824 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests Sherebiah
Hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them 825 And weighed unto
them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of
the house of our God which the king and his counsellors and his
lords and all Israel there present had offered 826 I even weighed
unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver
vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents 827 Also
twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine
copper precious as gold

828 And I said unto them Ye are holy unto the LORD the vessels are
holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto
the LORD God of your fathers

829 Watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of
the priests and the Levites and chief of the fathers of Israel at
Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the LORD

830 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver and
the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house
of our God

831 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
the first month to go unto Jerusalem and the hand of our God was
upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such
as lay in wait by the way

832 And we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days

833 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of
Uriah the priest and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas and
with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of
Binnui Levites 834 By number and by weight of every one and all
the weight was written at that time

835 Also the children of those that had been carried away which were
come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the God of
Israel twelve bullocks for all Israel ninety and six rams seventy
and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a
burnt offering unto the LORD

836 And they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings
lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they
furthered the people and the house of God

91 Now when these things were done the princes came to me saying
The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not
separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to
their abominations even of the Canaanites the Hittites the
Perizzites the Jebusites the Ammonites the Moabites the Egyptians
and the Amorites

92 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for
their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the
people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath
been chief in this trespass
