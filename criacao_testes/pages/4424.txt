Cersei’s mouth tightened He could see her color rising If I name this letter a forgery and tell them to throw you in a dungeon no one will ignore that I promise you

He was walking on rotten ice now Tyrion knew One false step and he would plunge through No one he agreed amiably least of all our father The one with the army But why should you want to throw me into a dungeon sweet sister when I’ve come all this long way to help you

I do not require your help It was our father’s presence that I commanded

Yes he said quietly but it’s Jaime you want

His sister fancied herself subtle but he had grown up with her He could read her face like one of his favorite books and what he read now was rage and fear and despair Jaime—

—is my brother no less than yours Tyrion interrupted Give me your support and I promise you we will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed

How Cersei demanded The Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded Lord Eddard

True Tyrion agreed yet you still hold his daughters don’t you I saw the older girl out in the yard with Joffrey

Sansa the queen said I’ve given it out that I have the younger brat as well but it’s a lie I sent Meryn Trant to take her in hand when Robert died but her wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled No one has seen her since Likely she’s dead A great many people died that day

Tyrion had hoped for both Stark girls but he supposed one would have to do Tell me about our friends on the council

His sister glanced at the door What of them

Father seems to have taken a dislike to them When I left him he was wondering how their heads might look on the wall beside Lord Stark’s He leaned forward across the table Are you certain of their loyalty Do you trust them

I trust no one Cersei snapped I need them Does Father believe they are playing us false

Suspects rather

Why What does he know

Tyrion shrugged He knows that your son’s short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel

Cersei gave him a searching look Joff has had no lack of good counsel He’s always been strong-willed Now that he’s king he believes he should do as he pleases not as he’s bid

Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them Tyrion agreed This business with Eddard Stark    Joffrey’s work

The queen grimaced He was instructed to pardon Stark to allow him to take the black The man would have been out of our way forever and we might have made peace with that son of his but Joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show What was I to do He called for Lord Eddard’s head in front of half the city And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me Her hand tightened into a fist The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor’s Sept with blood after lying to him about our intent

It would seem he has a point said Tyrion So this Lord Slynt he was part of it was he Tell me whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council

Littlefinger made the arrangements We needed Slynt’s gold cloaks Eddard Stark was plotting with Renly and he’d written to Lord Stannis offering him the throne We might have lost all Even so it was a close thing If Sansa hadn’t come to me and told me all her father’s plans   

Tyrion was surprised Truly His own daughter Sansa had always seemed such a sweet child tender and courteous

The girl was wet with love She would have done anything for Joffrey until he cut off her father’s head and called it mercy That put an end to that

His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects Tyrion said with a crooked smile Was it Joffrey’s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too

Cersei sighed Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert’s death Varys suggested Ser Barristan Why not It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog He is very fond of Sandor Clegane We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse more than the useless old fool deserved

I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt’s gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud Gate

His sister looked very unhappy Janos should have sent more men He is not as competent as might be wished

Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon’s Kingsguard Tyrion reminded her pointedly He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen’s seven The smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight What do you imagine they’ll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon

Cersei glanced away I had not considered that

Father did said Tyrion That is why he sent me To put an end to these follies and bring your son to heel

Joff will be no more tractable for you than for me

He might

Why should he

He knows you would never hurt him

Cersei’s eyes narrowed If you believe I’d ever allow you to harm my son you’re sick with fever

Tyrion sighed She’d missed the point as she did so often Joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you he assured her but so long as the boy feels threatened he’ll be more inclined to listen He took her hand I am your brother you know You need me whether you care to admit it or no Your son needs me if he’s to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair

His sister seemed shocked that he would touch her You have always been cunning

In my own small way He grinned

It may be worth the trying    but make no mistake Tyrion If I accept you you shall be the King’s Hand in name but my Hand in truth You will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act and you will do nothing without my consent Do you understand

Oh yes

Do you agree

Certainly he lied I am yours sister For as long as I need to be So now that we are of one purpose we ought have no more secrets between us You say Joffrey had Lord Eddard killed Varys dismissed Ser Barristan and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt Who murdered Jon Arryn

Cersei yanked her hand back How should I know

The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me Where did she come by that notion I wonder

I’m sure I don’t know That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing He hinted that Lord Arryn suspected or    well believed   

That you were fucking our sweet Jaime

She slapped him

Did you think I was as blind as Father Tyrion rubbed his cheek Who you lie with is no matter to me    although it doesn’t seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other

She slapped him

Be gentle Cersei I’m only jesting with you If truth be told I’d sooner have a nice whore I never understood what Jaime saw in you apart from his own reflection
