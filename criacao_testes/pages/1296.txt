Roose Bolton studied him with pale eyes His Grace has defeated the Lannisters every time he has faced them in battle

He has lost the north insisted Hosteen Frey He has lost Winterfell His brothers are dead…

For a moment Arya forgot to breathe Dead Bran and Rickon dead What does he mean What does he mean about Winterfell Joffrey could never take Winterfell never Robb would never let him Then she remembered that Robb was not at Winterfell He was away in the west and Bran was crippled and Rickon only four It took all her strength to remain still and silent the way Syrio Forel had taught her to stand there like a stick of furniture She felt tears gathering in her eyes and willed them away It’s not true it can’t be true it’s just some Lannister lie

Had Stannis won all might have been different Ronel Rivers said wistfully He was one of Lord Walder’s bastards

Stannis lost Ser Hosteen said bluntly Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so King Robb must make his peace with the Lannisters He must put off his crown and bend the knee little as he may like it

And who will tell him so Roose Bolton smiled It is a fine thing to have so many valiant brothers in such troubled times I shall think on all you’ve said

His smile was dismissal The Freys made their courtesies and shuffled out leaving only Qyburn Steelshanks Walton and Arya Lord Bolton beckoned her closer I am bled sufficiently Nan you may remove the leeches

At once my lord It was best never to make Roose Bolton ask twice Arya wanted to ask him what Ser Hosteen had meant about Winterfell but she dared not I’ll ask Elmar she thought Elmar will tell me The leeches wriggled slowly between her fingers as she plucked them carefully from the lord’s body their pale bodies moist to the touch and distended with blood They’re only leeches she reminded herself If I closed my hand they’d squish between my fingers

There is a letter from your lady wife Qyburn pulled a roll of parchment from his sleeve Though he wore maester’s robes there was no chain about his neck it was whispered that he had lost it for dabbling in necromancy

You may read it Bolton said

The Lady Walda wrote from the Twins almost every day but all the letters were the same I pray for you morn noon and night my sweet lord she wrote and count the days until you share my bed again Return to me soon and I will give you many trueborn sons to take the place of your dear Domeric and rule the Dreadfort after you Arya pictured a plump pink baby in a cradle covered with plump pink leeches

She brought Lord Bolton a damp washcloth to wipe down his soft hairless body I will send a letter of my own he told the onetime maester

To the Lady Walda

To Ser Helman Tallhart

A rider from Ser Helman had come two days past Tallhart men had taken the castle of the Darrys accepting the surrender of its Lannister garrison after a brief siege

Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch by command of the king Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale Those are rich lands and hardly touched by the fighting It is time they had a taste Glover has lost a castle and Tallhart a son Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale

I shall prepare the message for your seal my lord

Arya was glad to hear that the castle of the Darrys would be burned That was where they’d brought her when she’d been caught after her fight with Joffrey and where the queen had made her father kill Sansa’s wolf It deserves to burn She wished that Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart would come back to Harrenhal though they had marched too quickly before she’d been able to decide whether to trust them with her secret

I will hunt today Roose Bolton announced as Qyburn helped him into a quilted jerkin

Is it safe my lord Qyburn asked Only three days past Septon Utt’s men were attacked by wolves They came right into his camp not five yards from the fire and killed two horses

It is wolves I mean to hunt I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling Bolton buckled on his belt adjusting the hang of sword and dagger It’s said that direwolves once roamed the north in great packs of a hundred or more and feared neither man nor mammoth but that was long ago and in another land It is queer to see the common wolves of the south so bold

Terrible times breed terrible things my lord

Bolton showed his teeth in something that might have been a smile Are these times so terrible Maester

Summer is gone and there are four kings in the realm

One king may be terrible but four He shrugged Nan my fur cloak She brought it to him My chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return he told her as she fastened it And tend to Lady Walda’s letter

As you say my lord

The lord and maester swept from the room giving her not so much as a backward glance When they were gone Arya took the letter and carried it to the hearth stirring the logs with a poker to wake the flames anew She watched the parchment twist blacken and flare up If the Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon Robb will kill them every one He’ll never bend the knee never never never He’s not afraid of any of them Curls of ash floated up the chimney Arya squatted beside the fire watching them rise through a veil of hot tears If Winterfell is truly gone is this my home now Am I still Arya or only Nan the serving girl for forever and forever and forever

She spent the next few hours tending to the lord’s chambers She swept out the old rushes and scattered fresh sweet-smelling ones laid a fresh fire in the hearth changed the linens and fluffed the featherbed emptied the chamber pots down the privy shaft and scrubbed them out carried an armload of soiled clothing to the washerwomen and brought up a bowl of crisp autumn pears from the kitchen When she was done with the bedchamber she went down half a flight of stairs to do the same in the great solar a spare drafty room as large as the halls of many a smaller castle The candles were down to stubs so Arya changed them out Under the windows was a huge oaken table where the lord wrote his letters She stacked the books changed the candles put the quills and inks and sealing wax in order

A large ragged sheepskin was tossed across the papers Arya had started to roll it up when the colors caught her eye the blue of lakes and rivers the red dots where castles and cities could be found the green of woods She spread it out instead THE LANDS OF THE TRIDENT said the ornate script beneath the map The drawing showed everything from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush There’s Harrenhal at the top of the big lake she realized but where’s Riverrun Then she saw It’s not so far…

The afternoon was still young by the time she was done so Arya took herself off to the godswood Her duties were lighter as Lord Bolton’s cupbearer than they had been under Weese or even Pinkeye though they required dressing like a page and washing more than she liked The hunt would not return for hours so she had a little time for her needlework

She slashed at birch leaves till the splintery point of the broken broomstick was green and sticky Ser Gregor she breathed Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling She spun and leapt and balanced on the balls of her feet darting this way and that knocking pinecones flying The Tickler she called out one time the Hound the next Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Queen Cersei The bole of an oak loomed before her and she lunged to drive her point through it grunting Joffrey Joffrey Joffrey Her arms and legs were dappled by sunlight and the shadows of leaves A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time she paused The heel of her right foot was bloody where she’d skinned it so she stood one-legged before the heart tree and raised her sword in salute Valar morghulis she told the old gods of the north She liked how the words sounded when she said them

As Arya crossed the yard to the bathhouse she spied a raven circling down toward the rookery and wondered where it had come from and what message it carried Might be it’s from Robb come to say it wasn’t true about Bran and Rickon She chewed on her lip hoping If I had wings I could fly back to Winterfell and see for myself And if it was true I’d just fly away fly up past the moon and the shining stars and see all the things in Old Nan’s stories dragons and sea monsters and the Titan of Braavos and maybe I wouldn’t ever fly back unless I wanted to

The hunting party returned near evenfall with nine dead wolves Seven were adults big grey-brown beasts savage and powerful their mouths drawn back over long yellow teeth by their dying snarls But the other two had only been pups Lord Bolton gave orders for the skins to be sewn into a blanket for his bed Cubs still have that soft fur my lord one of his men pointed out Make you a nice warm pair of gloves

Bolton glanced up at the banners waving above the gatehouse towers As the Starks are wont to remind us winter is coming Have it done When he saw Arya looking on he said Nan I’ll want a flagon of hot spice wine I took a chill in the woods See that it doesn’t get cold I’m of a mind to sup alone Barley bread butter and boar

At once my lord That was always the best thing to say

Hot Pie was making oatcakes when she entered the kitchen Three other cooks were boning fish while a spit boy turned a boar over the flames My lord wants his supper and hot spice wine to wash it down Arya announced and he doesn’t want it cold One of the cooks washed his hands took out a kettle and filled it with a heavy sweet red Hot Pie was told to crumble in the spices as the wine heated Arya went to help

I can do it he said sullenly I don’t need you to show me how to spice wine

He hates me too or else he’s scared of me She backed away more sad than angry When the food was ready the cooks covered it with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick towel to keep it warm Dusk was settling outside On the walls the crows muttered round the heads like courtiers round a king One of the guards held the door to Kingspyre Hope that’s not weasel soup he jested

Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leatherbound book when she entered Light some candles he commanded her as he turned a page It grows gloomy in here

She placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger then closed the book and placed it carefully in the fire He watched the flames consume it pale eyes shining with reflected light The old dry leather went up with a whoosh and the yellow pages stirred as they burned as if some ghost were reading them I will have no further need of you tonight he said never looking at her

She should have gone silent as a mouse but something had hold of her My lord she asked will you take me with you when you leave Harrenhal

He turned to stare at her and from the look in his eyes it was as if his supper had just spoken to him Did I give you leave to question me Nan

No my lord She lowered her eyes

You should not have spoken then Should you

No My lord

For a moment he looked amused I will answer you just this once I mean to give Harrenhal to Lord Vargo when I return to the north You will remain here with him

But I don’t— she started

He cut her off I am not in the habit of being questioned by servants Nan Must I have your tongue out

He would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog she knew No my lord

Then I’ll hear no more from you
