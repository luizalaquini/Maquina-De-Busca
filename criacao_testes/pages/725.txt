912 And he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and
against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil
for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon
Jerusalem

913 As it is written in the law of Moses all this evil is come upon
us yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God that we might
turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth

914 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil and brought it
upon us for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he
doeth for we obeyed not his voice

915 And now O Lord our God that hast brought thy people forth out
of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown
as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly

916 O LORD according to all thy righteousness I beseech thee let
thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem thy
holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our
fathers Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that
are about us

917 Now therefore O our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his
supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate for the Lords sake

918 O my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and
behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for
we do not present our supplications before thee for our
righteousnesses but for thy great mercies

919 O Lord hear O Lord forgive O Lord hearken and do defer not
for thine own sake O my God for thy city and thy people are called
by thy name

920 And whiles I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and
the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the
LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God 921 Yea whiles I was
speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the
vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about
the time of the evening oblation

922 And he informed me and talked with me and said O Daniel I am
now come forth to give thee skill and understanding

923 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth
and I am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore
understand the matter and consider the vision

924 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to
make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting
righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint
the most Holy

925 Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street
shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times

926 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but
not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with
a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined

927 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in
the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it
desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be
poured upon the desolate

101 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
unto Daniel whose name was called Belteshazzar and the thing was
true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing
and had understanding of the vision

102 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks

103 I ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth
neither did I anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were
fulfilled

104 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month as I was by
the side of the great river which is Hiddekel 105 Then I lifted up
mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen
whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz 106 His body also
was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and
his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to
polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a
multitude

107 And I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me
saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they
fled to hide themselves

108 Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there
remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption and I retained no strength
