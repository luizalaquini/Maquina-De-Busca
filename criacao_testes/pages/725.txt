With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts she was gone Only her scent lingered after That and the torch Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees The shifting torchlight washed over him Once Melisandre’s footsteps faded away the only sound was the scrabbling of rats Ice and fire he thought Black and white Dark and light Davos could not deny the power of her god He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre’s womb and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing She saw my purpose in her flames It was good to learn that Salla had not sold him but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again He did not like that either

He lifted his eyes to stare up at the torch He looked for a long time never blinking watching the flames shift and shimmer He tried to see beyond them to peer through the fiery curtain and glimpse whatever lived back there… but there was nothing only fire and after a time his eyes began to water

God-blind and tired Davos curled up on the straw and gave himself to sleep

Three days later—well Porridge had come thrice and Lamprey twice—Davos heard voices outside his cell He sat up at once his back to the stone wall listening to the sounds of struggle This was new a change in his unchanging world The noise was coming from the left where the steps led up to daylight He could hear a man’s voice pleading and shouting

…Madness the man was saying as he came into view dragged along between two guardsmen with fiery hearts on their breasts Porridge went before them jangling a ring of keys and Ser Axell Florent walked behind Axell the prisoner said desperately for the love you bear me unhand me You cannot do this I’m no traitor He was an older man tall and slender with silvery grey hair a pointed beard and a long elegant face twisted in fear Where is Selyse where is the queen I demand to see her The Others take you all Release me

The guards paid no mind to his outcries Here Porridge asked in front of the cell Davos got to his feet For an instant he considered trying to rush them when the door was opened but that was madness There were too many the guards wore swords and Porridge was strong as a bull

Ser Axell gave the gaoler a curt nod Let the traitors enjoy each other’s company

I am no traitor screeched the prisoner as Porridge was unlocking the door Though he was plainly dressed in grey wool doublet and black breeches his speech marked him as highborn His birth will not serve him here thought Davos

Porridge swung the bars wide Ser Axell gave a nod and the guards flung their charge in headlong The man stumbled and might have fallen but Davos caught him At once he wrenched away and staggered back toward the door only to have it slammed in his pale pampered face No he shouted Nooooo All the strength suddenly left his legs and he slid slowly to the floor clutching at the iron bars Ser Axell Porridge and the guards had already turned to leave You cannot do this the prisoner shouted at their retreating backs I am the King’s Hand

It was then that Davos knew him You are Alester Florent

The man turned his head Who…

Ser Davos Seaworth

Lord Alester blinked Seaworth… the onion knight You tried to murder Melisandre

Davos did not deny it At Storm’s End you wore red-gold armor with inlaid lapis flowers on your breastplate He reached down a hand to help the other man to his feet

Lord Alester brushed the filthy straw from his clothing I… I must apologize for my appearance ser My chests were lost when the Lannisters overran our camp I escaped with no more than the mail on my back and the rings on my fingers

He still wears those rings noted Davos who had lacked even all of his fingers

No doubt some cook’s boy or groom is prancing around King’s Landing just now in my slashed velvet doublet and jeweled cloak Lord Alester went on oblivious But war has its horrors as all men know No doubt you suffered your own losses

My ship said Davos All my men Four of my sons

May the… may the Lord of Light lead them through the darkness to a better world the other man said

May the Father judge them justly and the Mother grant them mercy Davos thought but he kept his prayer to himself The Seven had no place on Dragonstone now

My own son is safe at Brightwater the lord went on but I lost a nephew on the Fury Ser Imry my brother Ryam’s son

It had been Ser Imry Florent who led them blindly up the Blackwater Rush with all oars pulling paying no heed to the small stone towers at the mouth of the river Davos was not like to forget him My son Maric was your nephew’s oarmaster He remembered his last sight of Fury engulfed in wildfire Has there been any word of survivors

The Fury burned and sank with all hands his lordship said Your son and my nephew were lost with countless other good men The war itself was lost that day ser

This man is defeated Davos remembered Melisandre’s talk of embers in the ashes igniting great blazes Small wonder he ended here His Grace will never yield my lord

Folly that’s folly Lord Alester sat on the floor again as if the effort of standing for a moment had been too much for him Stannis Baratheon will never sit the Iron Throne Is it treason to say the truth A bitter truth but no less true for that His fleet is gone save for the Lyseni and Salladhor Saan will flee at the first sight of a Lannister sail Most of the lords who supported Stannis have gone over to Joffrey or died…

Even the lords of the narrow sea The lords sworn to Dragonstone

Lord Alester waved his hand feebly Lord Celtigar was captured and bent the knee Monford Velaryon died with his ship the red woman burned Sunglass and Lord Bar Emmon is fifteen fat and feeble Those are your lords of the narrow sea Only the strength of House Florent is left to Stannis against all the might of Highgarden Sunspear and Casterly Rock and now most of the storm lords as well The best hope that remains is to try and salvage something with a peace That is all I meant to do Gods be good how can they call it treason
