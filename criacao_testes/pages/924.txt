That is fool’s play thought Tyrion The Mountain is too bloody big to be any man’s toy

All around the yard the throng of spectators was creeping in toward the two combatants edging forward inch by inch to get a better view The Kingsguard tried to keep them back shoving at the gawkers forcefully with their big white shields but there were hundreds of gawkers and only six of the men in white armor

You raped her Prince Oberyn parried a savage cut with his spearhead You murdered her He sent the spearpoint at Clegane’s eyes so fast the huge man flinched back You killed her children The spear flickered sideways and down scraping against the Mountain’s breastplate You raped her You murdered her You killed her children The spear was two feet longer than Ser Gregor’s sword more than enough to keep him at an awkward distance He hacked at the shaft whenever Oberyn lunged at him trying to lop off the spearhead but he might as well have been trying to hack the wings off a fly You raped her You murdered her You killed her children Gregor tried to bull rush but Oberyn skipped aside and circled round his back You raped her You murdered her You killed her children

Be quiet Ser Gregor seemed to be moving a little slower and his greatsword no longer rose quite so high as it had when the contest began Shut your bloody mouth

You raped her the prince said moving to the right

Enough Ser Gregor took two long strides and brought his sword down at Oberyn’s head but the Dornishman backstepped once more You murdered her he said

SHUT UP Gregor charged headlong right at the point of the spear which slammed into his right breast then slid aside with a hideous steel shriek Suddenly the Mountain was close enough to strike his huge sword flashing in a steel blur The crowd was screaming as well Oberyn slipped the first blow and let go of the spear useless now that Ser Gregor was inside it The second cut the Dornishman caught on his shield Metal met metal with an ear-splitting clang sending the Red Viper reeling Ser Gregor followed bellowing He doesn’t use words he just roars like an animal Tyrion thought Oberyn’s retreat became a headlong backward flight mere inches ahead of the greatsword as it slashed at his chest his arms his head

The stable was behind him Spectators screamed and shoved at each other to get out of the way One stumbled into Oberyn’s back Ser Gregor hacked down with all his savage strength The Red Viper threw himself sideways rolling The luckless stableboy behind him was not so quick As his arm rose to protect his face Gregor’s sword took it off between elbow and shoulder Shut UP the Mountain howled at the stableboy’s scream and this time he swung the blade sideways sending the top half of the lad’s head across the yard in a spray of blood and brains Hundreds of spectators suddenly seemed to lose all interest in the guilt or innocence of Tyrion Lannister judging by the way they pushed and shoved at each other to escape the yard

But the Red Viper of Dorne was back on his feet his long spear in hand Elia he called at Ser Gregor You raped her You murdered her You killed her children Now say her name

The Mountain whirled Helm shield sword surcoat he was spattered with gore from head to heels You talk too much he grumbled You make my head hurt

I will hear you say it She was Elia of Dorne

The Mountain snorted contemptuously and came on… and in that moment the sun broke through the low clouds that had hidden the sky since dawn

The sun of Dorne Tyrion told himself but it was Gregor Clegane who moved first to put the sun at his back This is a dim and brutal man but he has a warrior’s instincts

The Red Viper crouched squinting and sent his spear darting forward again Ser Gregor hacked at it but the thrust had only been a feint Off balance he stumbled forward a step

Prince Oberyn tilted his dinted metal shield A shaft of sunlight blazed blindingly off polished gold and copper into the narrow slit of his foe’s helm Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare Prince Oberyn’s spear flashed like lightning and found the gap in the heavy plate the joint under the arm The point punched through mail and boiled leather Gregor gave a choked grunt as the Dornishman twisted his spear and yanked it free Elia Say it Elia Of Dorne He was circling spear poised for another thrust Say it

Tyrion had his own prayer Fall down and die was how it went Damn you fall down and die The blood trickling from the Mountain’s armpit was his own now and he must be bleeding even more heavily inside the breastplate When he tried to take a step one knee buckled Tyrion thought he was going down

Prince Oberyn had circled behind him ELIA OF DORNE he shouted Ser Gregor started to turn but too slow and too late The spearhead went through the back of the knee this time through the layers of chain and leather between the plates on thigh and calf The Mountain reeled swayed then collapsed face first on the ground His huge sword went flying from his hand Slowly ponderously he rolled onto his back

The Dornishman flung away his ruined shield grasped the spear in both hands and sauntered away Behind him the Mountain let out a groan and pushed himself onto an elbow Oberyn whirled cat-quick and ran at his fallen foe EEEEELLLLLLIIIIIAAAAA he screamed as he drove the spear down with the whole weight of his body behind it The crack of the ashwood shaft snapping was almost as sweet a sound as Cersei’s wail of fury and for an instant Prince Oberyn had wings The snake has vaulted over the Mountain Four feet of broken spear jutted from Clegane’s belly as Prince Oberyn rolled rose and dusted himself off He tossed aside the splintered spear and claimed his foe’s greatsword If you die before you say her name ser I will hunt you through all seven hells he promised

Ser Gregor tried to rise The broken spear had gone through him and was pinning him to the ground He wrapped both hands about the shaft grunting but could not pull it out Beneath him was a spreading pool of red I am feeling more innocent by the instant Tyrion told Ellaria Sand beside him

Prince Oberyn moved closer Say the name He put a foot on the Mountain’s chest and raised the greatsword with both hands Whether he intended to hack off Gregor’s head or shove the point through his eyeslit was something Tyrion would never know

Clegane’s hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee The Red Viper brought down the greatsword in a wild slash but he was off-balance and the edge did no more than put another dent in the Mountain’s vambrace Then the sword was forgotten as Gregor’s hand tightened and twisted yanking the Dornishman down on top of him They wrestled in the dust and blood the broken spear wobbling back and forth Tyrion saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince drawing him tight against his chest like a lover

Elia of Dorne they all heard Ser Gregor say when they were close enough to kiss His deep voice boomed within the helm I killed her screaming whelp He thrust his free hand into Oberyn’s unprotected face pushing steel fingers into his eyes Then I raped her Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman’s mouth making splinters of his teeth Then I smashed her fucking head in Like this As he drew back his huge fist the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air There was a sickening crunch Ellaria Sand wailed in terror and Tyrion’s breakfast came boiling back up He found himself on his knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes and that double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers

He never heard his father speak the words that condemned him Perhaps no words were necessary I put my life in the Red Viper’s hands and he dropped it When he remembered too late that snakes had no hands Tyrion began to laugh hysterically

He was halfway down the serpentine steps before he realized that the gold cloaks were not taking him back to his tower room I’ve been consigned to the black cells he said They did not bother to answer Why waste your breath on the dead
