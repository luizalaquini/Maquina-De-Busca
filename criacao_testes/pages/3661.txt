BRAN

The sound was the faintest of clinks a scraping of steel over stone He lifted his head from his paws listening sniffing at the night

The evening’s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong again Grass and thorns blackberries broken on the ground mud worms rotting leaves a rat creeping through the bush He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother’s coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he’d killed Other squirrels moved through the branches above smelling of wet fur and fear their little claws scratching at the bark The noise had sounded something like that

And he heard it again clink and scrape It brought him to his feet His ears pricked and his tail rose He howled a long deep shivery cry a howl to wake the sleepers but the piles of man-rock were dark and dead A still wet night a night to drive men into their holes The rain had stopped but the men still hid from the damp huddled by the fires in their caves of piled stone

His brother came sliding through the trees moving almost as quiet as another brother he remembered dimly from long ago the white one with the eyes of blood This brother’s eyes were pools of shadow but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling He had heard the sounds as well and known they meant danger

This time the clink and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of skinfeet on stone The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know Stranger Danger Death

He ran toward the sound his brother racing beside him The stone dens rose before them walls slick and wet He bared his teeth but the man-rock took no notice A gate loomed up a black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post When he crashed against it the gate shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held Through the bars he could look down the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond but there was no way through He could force his muzzle between the bars but no more Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth but they would not break They had tried to dig under but there were great flat stones beneath half-covered by earth and blown leaves

Snarling he paced back and forth in front of the gate then threw himself at it once more It moved a little and slammed him back Locked something whispered Chained The voice he did not hear the scent without a smell The other ways were closed as well Where doors opened in the walls of man-rock the wood was thick and strong There was no way out

There is the whisper came and it seemed as if he could see the shadow of a great tree covered in needles slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man Yet when he looked about it was not there The other side of the godswood the sentinel hurry hurry…

Through the gloom of night came a muffled shout cut short

Swiftly swiftly he whirled and bounded back into the trees wet leaves rustling beneath his paws branches whipping at him as he rushed past He could hear his brother following close They plunged under the heart tree and around the cold pool through the blackberry bushes under a tangle of oaks and ash and hawthorn scrub to the far side of the wood… and there it was the shadow he’d glimpsed without seeing the slanting tree pointing at the rooftops Sentinel came the thought

He remembered how it was to climb it then The needles everywhere scratching at his bare face and falling down the back of his neck the sticky sap on his hands the sharp piney smell of it It was an easy tree for a boy to climb leaning as it did crooked the branches so close together they almost made a ladder slanting right up to the roof

Growling he sniffed around the base of the tree lifted a leg and marked it with a stream of urine A low branch brushed his face and he snapped at it twisting and pulling until the wood cracked and tore His mouth was full of needles and the bitter taste of the sap He shook his head and snarled

His brother sat back on his haunches and lifted his voice in a ululating howl his song black with mourning The way was no way They were not squirrels nor the cubs of men they could not wriggle up the trunks of trees clinging with soft pink paws and clumsy feet They were runners hunters prowlers

Off across the night beyond the stone that hemmed them close the dogs woke and began to bark One and then another and then all of them a great clamor They smelled it too the scent of foes and fear

A desperate fury filled him hot as hunger He sprang away from the wall loped off beneath the trees the shadows of branch and leaf dappling his grey fur… and then he turned and raced back in a rush His feet flew kicking up wet leaves and pine needles and for a little time he was a hunter and an antlered stag was fleeing before him and he could see it smell it and he ran full out in pursuit The smell of fear made his heart thunder and slaver ran from his jaws and he reached the falling tree in stride and threw himself up the trunk claws scrabbling at the bark for purchase Upward he bounded up two bounds three hardly slowing until he was among the lower limbs Branches tangled his feet and whipped at his eyes grey-green needles scattered as he shouldered through them snapping He had to slow Something snagged at his foot and he wrenched it free snarling The trunk narrowed under him the slope steeper almost straight up and wet The bark tore like skin when he tried to claw at it He was a third of the way up halfway more the roof was almost within reach… and then he put down a foot and felt it slip off the curve of wet wood and suddenly he was sliding stumbling He yowled in fear and fury falling falling and twisted around while the ground rushed up to break him…

And then Bran was back abed in his lonely tower room tangled in his blankets his breath coming hard Summer he cried aloud Summer His shoulder seemed to ache as if he had fallen on it but he knew it was only the ghost of what the wolf was feeling Jojen told it true I am a beastling Outside he could hear the faint barking of dogs The sea has come It’s flowing over the walls just as Jojen saw Bran grabbed the bar overhead and pulled himself up shouting for help No one came and after a moment he remembered that no one would They had taken the guard off his door Ser Rodrik had needed every man of fighting age he could lay his hands on so Winterfell had been left with only a token garrison

The rest had left eight days past six hundred men from Winterfell and the nearest holdfasts Cley Cerwyn was bringing three hundred more to join them on the march and Maester Luwin had sent ravens before them summoning levies from White Harbor and the barrowlands and even the deep places inside the wolfswood Torrhen’s Square was under attack by some monstrous war chief named Dagmer Cleftjaw Old Nan said he couldn’t be killed that once a foe had cut his head in two with an axe but Dagmer was so fierce he’d just pushed the two halves back together and held them until they healed up Could Dagmer have won Torrhen’s Square was many days from Winterfell yet still…

Bran pulled himself from the bed moving bar to bar until he reached the windows His fingers fumbled a little as he swung back the shutters The yard was empty and all the windows he could see were black Winterfell slept Hodor he shouted down as loud as he could Hodor would be asleep above the stables but maybe if he yelled loud enough he’d hear or somebody would Hodor come fast Osha Meera Jojen anyone Bran cupped his hands around his mouth HOOOOODOOOOOR

But when the door crashed open behind him the man who stepped through was no one Bran knew He wore a leather jerkin sewn with overlapping iron disks and carried a dirk in one hand and an axe strapped to his back What do you want Bran demanded afraid This is my room You get out of here

Theon Greyjoy followed him into the bedchamber We’re not here to harm you Bran

Theon Bran felt dizzy with relief Did Robb send you Is he here too

Robb’s far away He can’t help you now

Help me He was confused Don’t scare me Theon

I’m Prince Theon now We’re both princes Bran Who would have dreamed it But I’ve taken your castle my prince

Winterfell Bran shook his head No you couldn’t

Leave us Werlag The man with the dirk withdrew Theon seated himself on the bed I sent four men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes and they opened a postern gate for the rest of us My men are dealing with yours even now I promise you Winterfell is mine

Bran did not understand But you’re Father’s ward

And now you and your brother are my wards As soon as the fighting’s done my men will be bringing the rest of your people together in the Great Hall You and I are going to speak to them You’ll tell them how you’ve yielded Winterfell to me and command them to serve and obey their new lord as they did the old

I won’t said Bran We’ll fight you and throw you out I never yielded you can’t make me say I did

This is no game Bran so don’t play the boy with me I won’t stand for it The castle is mine but these people are still yours If the prince would keep them safe he’d best do as he’s told He rose and went to the door Someone will come dress you and carry you to the Great Hall Think carefully on what you want to say

The waiting made Bran feel even more helpless than before He sat in the window seat staring out at dark towers and walls black as shadow Once he thought he heard shouting beyond the Guards Hall and something that might have been the clash of swords but he did not have Summer’s ears to hear nor his nose to smell Awake I am still broken but when I sleep when I’m Summer I can run and fight and hear and smell

He had expected that Hodor would come for him or maybe one of the serving girls but when the door next opened it was Maester Luwin carrying a candle Bran he said you… know what has happened You have been told The skin was broken above his left eye and blood ran down that side of his face

Theon came He said Winterfell was his now

The maester set down the candle and wiped the blood off his cheek They swam the moat Climbed the walls with hook and rope Came over wet and dripping steel in hand He sat on the chair by the door as fresh blood flowed Alebelly was on the gate they surprised him in the turret and killed him Hayhead’s wounded as well I had time to send off two ravens before they burst in The bird to White Harbor got away but they brought down the other with an arrow The maester stared at the rushes Ser Rodrik took too many of our men but I am to blame as much as he is I never saw this danger I never…

Jojen saw it Bran thought You better help me dress

Yes that’s so In the heavy ironbound chest at the foot of Bran’s bed the maester found smallclothes breeches and tunic You are the Stark in Winterfell and Robb’s heir You must look princely Together they garbed him as befit a lord

Theon wants me to yield the castle Bran said as the maester was fastening the cloak with his favorite wolf’s-head clasp of silver and jet

There is no shame in that A lord must protect his smallfolk Cruel places breed cruel peoples Bran remember that as you deal with these ironmen Your lord father did what he could to gentle Theon but I fear it was too little and too late

The ironman who came for them was a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard that covered half his chest He bore the boy easily enough though he looked none too happy with the task Rickon’s bedchamber was a half turn down the steps The four-year-old was cranky at being woken I want Mother he said I want her And Shaggydog too

Your mother is far away my prince Maester Luwin pulled a bedrobe over the child’s head But I’m here and Bran He took Rickon by the hand and led him out

Below they came on Meera and Jojen being herded from their room by a bald man whose spear was three feet taller than he was When Jojen looked at Bran his eyes were green pools full of sorrow Other ironmen had rousted the Freys Your brother’s lost his kingdom Little Walder told Bran You’re no prince now just a hostage

So are you Jojen said and me and all of us

No one was talking to you frogeater

One of the ironmen went before them carrying a torch but the rain had started again and soon drowned it out As they hurried across the yard they could hear the direwolves howling in the godswood I hope Summer wasn’t hurt falling from the tree

Theon Greyjoy was seated in the high seat of the Starks He had taken off his cloak Over a shirt of fine mail he wore a black surcoat emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House His hands rested on the wolves’ heads carved at the ends of the wide stone arms Theon’s sitting in Robb’s chair Rickon said

Hush Rickon Bran could feel the menace around them but his brother was too young A few torches had been lit and a fire kindled in the great hearth but most of the hall remained in darkness There was no place to sit with the benches stacked against the walls so the castle folk stood in small groups not daring to speak He saw Old Nan her toothless mouth opening and closing Hayhead was carried in between two of the other guards a bloodstained bandage wrapped about his bare chest Poxy Tym wept inconsolably and Beth Cassel cried with fear

What have we here Theon asked of the Reeds and Freys

These are Lady Catelyn’s wards both named Walder Frey Maester Luwin explained And this is Jojen Reed and his sister Meera son and daughter to Howland Reed of Greywater Watch who came to renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell

Some might call that ill-timed said Theon though not for me Here you are and here you’ll stay He vacated the high seat Bring the prince here Lorren The black-bearded man dumped Bran onto the stone as if he were a sack of oats
