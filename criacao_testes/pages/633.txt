…SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE SUMMER AIR THE BEAR THE BEAR ALL BLACK AND BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR

But the queen Sansa went on she won’t let me go…

She will Without Highgarden the Lannisters have no hope of keeping Joffrey on his throne If my son the lord oaf asks she will have no choice but to grant his request

Will he asked Sansa Will he ask

Lady Olenna frowned I see no need to give him a choice Of course he has no hint of our true purpose

HE SMELLED THE SCENT ON THE SUMMER AIR

Sansa wrinkled her brow Our true purpose my lady

HE SNIFFED AND ROARED AND SMELLED IT THERE HONEY ON THE SUMMER AIR

To see you safely wed child the old woman said as Butterbumps bellowed out the old old song to my grandson

Wed to Ser Loras oh… Sansa’s breath caught in her throat She remembered Ser Loras in his sparkling sapphire armor tossing her a rose Ser Loras in white silk so pure innocent beautiful The dimples at the corner of his mouth when he smiled The sweetness of his laugh the warmth of his hand She could only imagine what it would be like to pull up his tunic and caress the smooth skin underneath to stand on her toes and kiss him to run her fingers through those thick brown curls and drown in his deep brown eyes A flush crept up her neck

OH I’M A MAID AND I’M PURE AND FAIR I’LL NEVER DANCE WITH A HAIRY BEAR A BEAR A BEAR I’LL NEVER DANCE WITH A HAIRY BEAR

Would you like that Sansa asked Margaery I’ve never had a sister only brothers Oh please say yes please say that you will consent to marry my brother

The words came tumbling out of her Yes I will I would like that more than anything To wed Ser Loras to love him…

Loras Lady Olenna sounded annoyed Don’t be foolish child Kingsguard never wed Didn’t they teach you anything in Winterfell We were speaking of my grandson Willas He is a bit old for you to be sure but a dear boy for all that Not the least bit oafish and heir to Highgarden besides

Sansa felt dizzy one instant her head was full of dreams of Loras and the next they had all been snatched away Willas Willas I she said stupidly Courtesy is a lady’s armor You must not offend them be careful what you say I do not know Ser Willas I have never had the pleasure my lady Is he… is he as great a knight as his brothers

…LIFTED HER HIGH INTO THE AIR THE BEAR THE BEAR

No Margaery said He has never taken vows

Her grandmother frowned Tell the girl the truth The poor lad is crippled and that’s the way of it

He was hurt as a squire riding in his first tourney Margaery confided His horse fell and crushed his leg

That snake of a Dornishman was to blame that Oberyn Martell And his maester as well

I CALLED FOR A KNIGHT BUT YOU’RE A BEAR A BEAR A BEAR ALL BLACK AND BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR

Willas has a bad leg but a good heart said Margaery He used to read to me when I was a little girl and draw me pictures of the stars You will love him as much as we do Sansa

SHE KICKED AND WAILED THE MAID SO FAIR BUT HE LICKED THE HONEY FROM HER HAIR HER HAIR HER HAIR HE LICKED THE HONEY FROM HER HAIR

When might I meet him asked Sansa hesitantly

Soon promised Margaery When you come to Highgarden after Joffrey and I are wed My grandmother will take you

I will said the old woman patting Sansa’s hand and smiling a soft wrinkly smile I will indeed

THEN SHE SIGHED AND SQUEALED AND KICKED THE AIR MY BEAR SHE SANG MY BEAR SO FAIR AND OFF THEY WENT FROM HERE TO THERE THE BEAR THE BEAR AND THE MAIDEN FAIR Butterbumps roared the last line leapt into the air and came down on both feet with a crash that shook the wine cups on the table The women laughed and clapped
