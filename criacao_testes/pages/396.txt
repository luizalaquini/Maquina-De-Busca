TYRION

Through the door came the soft sound of the high harp mingled with a trilling of pipes The singer’s voice was muffled by the thick walls yet Tyrion knew the verse I loved a maid as fair as summer he remembered with sunlight in her hair…

Ser Meryn Trant guarded the queen’s door this night His muttered My lord struck Tyrion as a tad grudging but he opened the door nonetheless The song broke off abruptly as he strode into his sister’s bedchamber

Cersei was reclining on a pile of cushions Her feet were bare her golden hair artfully tousled her robe a green-and-gold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as she looked up Sweet sister Tyrion said how beautiful you look tonight He turned to the singer And you as well cousin I had no notion you had such a lovely voice

The compliment made Ser Lancel sulky perhaps he thought he was being mocked It seemed to Tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted Lancel had thick sandy hair green Lannister eyes and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip At sixteen he was cursed with all the certainty of youth unleavened by any trace of humor or self-doubt and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome His recent elevation had only made him worse Did Her Grace send for you the boy demanded

Not that I recall Tyrion admitted It grieves me to disturb your revels Lancel but as it happens I have matters of import to discuss with my sister

Cersei regarded him suspiciously If you are here about those begging brothers Tyrion spare me your reproaches I won’t have them spreading their filthy treasons in the streets They can preach to each other in the dungeons

And count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen added Lancel I would have had their tongues out

One even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the rightful king Cersei declared It will not be borne Tyrion I gave you ample opportunity to deal with these lice but you and your Ser Jacelyn did nothing so I commanded Vylarr to attend to the matter

And so he did Tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him but they were not important enough to battle over No doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets That is not why I came I have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear sweet sister but they are best spoken of privily

Very well The harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out while Cersei kissed her cousin chastely on the cheek Leave us Lancel My brother’s harmless when he’s alone If he’d brought his pets we’d smell them

The young knight gave his cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully behind him I’ll have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight Tyrion said when he was gone

You’re very pleased with yourself aren’t you Why

Why not Tyrion said Every day every night hammers rang along the Street of Steel and the great chain grew longer He hopped up onto the great canopied bed Is this the bed where Robert died I’m surprised you kept it

It gives me sweet dreams she said Now spit out your business and waddle away Imp

Tyrion smiled Lord Stannis has sailed from Dragonstone

Cersei bolted to her feet And yet you sit there grinning like a harvest-day pumpkin Has Bywater called out the City Watch We must send a bird to Harrenhal at once He was laughing by then She seized him by the shoulders and shook him Stop it Are you mad or drunk Stop it

It was all he could do to get out the words I can’t he gasped It’s too… gods too funny… Stannis…

What

He hasn’t sailed against us Tyrion managed He’s laid siege to Storm’s End Renly is riding to meet him

His sister’s nails dug painfully into his arms For a moment she stared incredulous as if he had begun to gibber in an unknown tongue Stannis and Renly are fighting each other When he nodded Cersei began to chuckle Gods be good she gasped I’m starting to believe that Robert was the clever one

Tyrion threw back his head and roared They laughed together Cersei pulled him off the bed and whirled him around and even hugged him for a moment as giddy as a girl By the time she let go of him Tyrion was breathless and dizzy He staggered to her sideboard and put out a hand to steady himself

Do you think it will truly come to battle between them If they should come to some accord—

They won’t Tyrion said They are too different and yet too much alike and neither could ever stomach the other

And Stannis has always felt he was cheated of Storm’s End Cersei said thoughtfully The ancestral seat of House Baratheon his by rights… if you knew how many times he came to Robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has When Robert gave the place to Renly Stannis clenched his jaw so tight I thought his teeth would shatter

He took it as a slight
