2910 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
Israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us

2911 My sons be not now negligent for the LORD hath chosen you to
stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him
and burn incense

2912 Then the Levites arose Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the
son of Azariah of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of
Merari Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehalelel and of
the Gershonites Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah
2913 And of the sons of Elizaphan Shimri and Jeiel and of the sons
of Asaph Zechariah and Mattaniah 2914 And of the sons of Heman
Jehiel and Shimei and of the sons of Jeduthun Shemaiah and Uzziel

2915 And they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and
came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the
LORD to cleanse the house of the LORD

2916 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
LORD to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they
found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the
LORD And the Levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook
Kidron

2917 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD
so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end

2918 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said We have
cleansed all the house of the LORD and the altar of burnt offering
with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the
vessels thereof

2919 Moreover all the vessels which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and
behold they are before the altar of the LORD

2920 Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of
the city and went up to the house of the LORD

2921 And they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven
lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for
the sanctuary and for Judah And he commanded the priests the sons of
Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD

2922 So they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood
and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the
rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the
lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar

2923 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them
2924 And the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with
their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all Israel for
the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should
be made for all Israel

2925 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals
with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of
David and of Gad the kings seer and Nathan the prophet for so was
the commandment of the LORD by his prophets

2926 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David and the
priests with the trumpets

2927 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
altar

And when the burnt offering began the song of the LORD began also
with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by David king of
Israel

2928 And all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and
the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt
offering was finished

2929 And when they had made an end of offering the king and all that
were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped

2930 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the
seer And they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads
and worshipped

2931 Then Hezekiah answered and said Now ye have consecrated
yourselves unto the LORD come near and bring sacrifices and thank
offerings into the house of the LORD And the congregation brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart
burnt offerings

2932 And the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation
brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two
hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD

2933 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep
