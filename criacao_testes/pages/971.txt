his ways

112 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is
tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him

113 Let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God
cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man 114 But
every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and
enticed

115 Then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
when it is finished bringeth forth death

116 Do not err my beloved brethren

117 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh
down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither
shadow of turning

118 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we
should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures

119 Wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear
slow to speak slow to wrath 120 For the wrath of man worketh not
the righteousness of God

121 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is
able to save your souls

122 But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your
own selves

123 For if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass 124 For he
beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he was

125 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth
therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this
man shall be blessed in his deed

126 If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his
tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vain

127 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this To
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep
himself unspotted from the world

21 My brethren have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord
of glory with respect of persons

22 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in
goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment 23
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto
him Sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor Stand thou
there or sit here under my footstool 24 Are ye not then partial in
yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts  25 Hearken my
beloved brethren Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in
faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that
love him  26 But ye have despised the poor Do not rich men oppress
you and draw you before the judgment seats  27 Do not they
blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called  28 If ye
fulfil the royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself ye do well 29 But if ye have respect to
persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors

210 For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
point he is guilty of all

211 For he that said Do not commit adultery said also Do not kill
Now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a
transgressor of the law

212 So speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law
of liberty

213 For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no
mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment

214 What doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith
and have not works can faith save him  215 If a brother or sister
be naked and destitute of daily food 216 And one of you say unto
them Depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye
give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it
profit  217 Even so faith if it hath not works is dead being
alone

218 Yea a man may say Thou hast faith and I have works shew me
thy faith without thy works and I will shew thee my faith by my
works

219 Thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the devils
also believe and tremble

220 But wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead
221 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had
offered Isaac his son upon the altar  222 Seest thou how faith
wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect  223 And
