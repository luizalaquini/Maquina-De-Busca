That didnt bother you when I was in Eight Or Two for
that matter I counter
You werent originally authorized for combat in either
case says Plutarch shooting me a look that signals Im
about to reveal too much
No the bomber battle in 8 and my intervention in 2
were spontaneous rash and definitely unauthorized
And both resulted in your injury Boggs reminds me
Suddenly I see myself through his eyes A smallish
seventeen-year-old girl who cant quite catch her breath
since her ribs havent fully healed Disheveled
Undisciplined Recuperating Not a soldier but someone
who needs to be looked after
But I have to go I say
Why asks Coin
I cant very well say its so I can carry out my own
personal vendetta against Snow Or that the idea of
remaining here in 13 with the latest version of Peeta while
Gale goes off to fight is unbearable But I have no shortage
of reasons to want to fight in the Capitol Because of
Twelve Because they destroyed my district
The president thinks about this a moment Considers
me Well you have three weeks Its not long but you can
begin training If the Assignment Board deems you fit
possibly your case will be reviewed
Thats it Thats the most I can hope for I guess its my
own fault I did blow off my schedule every single day unless
something suited me It didnt seem like much of a priority
jogging around a field with a gun with so many other things
going on And now Im paying for my negligence
Back in the hospital I find Johanna in the same
circumstance and spitting mad I tell her about what Coin
said Maybe you can train too
Fine Ill train But Im going to the stinking Capitol if I
have to kill a crew and fly there myself says Johanna
Probably best not to bring that up in training I say
But its nice to know Ill have a ride
Johanna grins and I feel a slight but significant shift in
our relationship I dont know that were actually friends but
possibly the word allies would be accurate Thats good Im
going to need an ally
The next morning when we report for training at 730
reality slaps me in the face Weve been funneled into a
class of relative beginners fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds
which seems a little insulting until its obvious that theyre in
far better condition than we are Gale and the other people
already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different
accelerated phase of training After we stretch--which hurts-
-theres a couple of hours of strengthening exercises--which
hurt--and a five-mile run--which kills Even with Johannas
motivational insults driving me on I have to drop out after a
mile
Its my ribs I explain to the trainer a no-nonsense
middle-aged woman were supposed to address as
Soldier York Theyre still bruised
Well Ill tell you Soldier Everdeen those are going to
take at least another month to heal up on their own she
saysI shake my head I dont have a month
She looks me up and down The doctors havent
offered you any treatment
Is there a treatment I ask They said they had to
mend naturally
Thats what they say But they could speed up the
process if I recommend it I warn you though it isnt any
fun she tells me
Please Ive got to get to the Capitol I say
Soldier York doesnt question this She scribbles
something on a pad and sends me directly back to the
hospital I hesitate I dont want to miss any more training
Ill be back for the afternoon session I promise She just
purses her lips
Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later Im
flattened out on my hospital bed gritting my teeth to keep
from begging them to bring back my morphling drip Its
been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed I havent
used it lately but I kept it for Johannas sake Today they
tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller
as the mixture of the two drugs--the morphling and
whatevers set my ribs on fire--has dangerous side effects
They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days
But I told them to go ahead
Its a bad night in our room Sleeps out of the question
I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest
burning and Johannas fighting off withdrawal symptoms
Early on when I apologize about cutting off her morphling
supply she waves it off saying it had to happen anyway
But by three in the morning Im the target of every colorful
bit of profanity District 7 has to offer At dawn she drags
me out of bed determined to get to training
I dont think I can do it I confess
You can do it We both can Were victors
remember Were the ones who can survive anything they
throw at us she snarls at me Shes a sick greenish color
shaking like a leaf I get dressed
We must be victors to make it through the morning I
think Im going to lose Johanna when we realize its pouring
outside Her face turns ashen and she seems to have
ceased breathing
Its just water It wont kill us I say She clenches her
jaw and stomps out into the mud Rain drenches us as we
