   not natural coming on them so fast in the night and all He’s more wolf than man all them Starks are   

   shit on your wolves and giants the boy’d piss his pants if he knew we was coming He wasn’t man enough to march on Harrenhal was he Ran t’other way didn’t he He’d run now if he knew what was best for him

So you say but might be the boy knows something we don’t maybe it’s us ought to be run   

Yes Arya thought Yes it’s you who ought to run you and Lord Tywin and the Mountain and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever he is all of you better run or my brother will kill you he’s a Stark he’s more wolf than man and so am I

Weasel Weese’s voice cracked like a whip She never saw where he came from but suddenly he was right in front of her Give me that Took you long enough He snatched the sword from her fingers and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of his hand Next time be quicker about it

For a moment she had been a wolf again but Weese’s slap took it all away and left her with nothing but the taste of her own blood in her mouth She’d bitten her tongue when he hit her She hated him for that

You want another Weese demanded You’ll get it too I’ll have none of your insolent looks Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him but he better send his lads to fetch them or I’ll find someone wants ’em worse Arya started off but not quick enough for Weese You run if you want to eat tonight he shouted his promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten And don’t be getting lost again or I swear I’ll beat you bloody

You won’t Arya thought You won’t ever again But she ran The old gods of the north must have been guiding her steps Halfway to the brewhouse as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow’s Tower and Kingspyre she heard harsh growling laughter Rorge came around a corner with three other men the manticore badge of Ser Amory sewn over their hearts When he saw her he stopped and grinned showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face Yoren’s little cunt he called her Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall don’t we He laughed again and the others laughed with him Where’s your stick now Rorge demanded suddenly the smile gone as quick as it had come Seems to me I promised to fuck you with it He took a step toward her Arya edged backward Not so brave now that I’m not in chains are you

I saved you She kept a good yard between them ready to run quick as a snake if he made a grab for her

Owe you another fucking for that seems like Did Yoren pump your cunny or did he like that tight little ass better

I’m looking for Jaqen she said There’s a message

Rorge halted Something in his eyes    could it be that he was scared of Jaqen H’ghar The bathhouse Get out of my way

Arya whirled and ran swift as a deer her feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the bathhouse She found Jaqen soaking in a tub steam rising around him as a serving girl sluiced hot water over his head His long hair red on one side and white on the other fell down across his shoulders wet and heavy

She crept up quiet as a shadow but he opened his eyes all the same She steals in on little mice feet but a man hears he said How could he hear me she wondered and it seemed as if he heard that as well The scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a man with open ears Clever girls go barefoot

I have a message Arya eyed the serving girl uncertainly When she did not seem likely to go away she leaned in until her mouth was almost touching his ear Weese she whispered

Jaqen H’ghar closed his eyes again floating languid half-asleep Tell his lordship a man shall attend him at his leisure His hand moved suddenly splashing hot water at her and Arya had to leap back to keep from getting drenched

When she told Tuffleberry what Weese had said the brewer cursed loudly You tell Weese my lads got duties to attend to and you tell him he’s a pox-ridden bastard too and the seven hells will freeze over before he gets another horn of my ale I’ll have them barrels within the hour or Lord Tywin will hear of it see if he don’t

Weese cursed too when Arya brought back that message even though she left out the pox-ridden bastard part He fumed and threatened but in the end he rounded up six men and sent them off grumbling to fetch the barrels down to the brewhouse

Supper that evening was a thin stew of barley onion and carrots with a wedge of stale brown bread One of the women had taken to sleeping in Weese’s bed and she got a piece of ripe blue cheese as well and a wing off the capon that Weese had spoken of that morning He ate the rest himself the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at the corner of his mouth The bird was almost gone when he glanced up from his trencher and saw Arya staring Weasel come here

A few mouthfuls of dark meat still clung to one thigh He forgot but now he’s remembered Arya thought It made her feel bad for telling Jaqen to kill him She got off the bench and went to the head of the table

I saw you looking at me Weese wiped his fingers on the front of her shift Then he grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other What did I tell you He slapped her again backhand Keep those eyes to yourself or next time I’ll spoon one out and feed it to my bitch A shove sent her stumbling to the floor Her hem caught on a loose nail in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as she fell You’ll mend that before you sleep Weese announced as he pulled the last bit of meat off the capon When he was finished he sucked his fingers noisily and threw the bones to his ugly spotted dog

Weese Arya whispered that night as she bent over the tear in her shift Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling she said calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle through the undyed wool The Tickler and the Hound Ser Gregor Ser Amory Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei She wondered how much longer she would have to include Weese in her prayer and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow when she woke he’d be dead

But it was the sharp toe of Weese’s boot that woke her as ever The main strength of Lord Tywin’s host would ride this day he told them as they broke their fast on oatcakes Don’t none of you be thinking how easy it’ll be here once m’lord of Lannister is gone he warned The castle won’t grow no smaller I promise you that only now there’ll be fewer hands to tend to it You lot of slugabeds are going to learn what work is now yes you are

Not from you Arya picked at her oaten cake Weese frowned at her as if he smelled her secret Quickly she dropped her gaze to her food and dared not raise her eyes again

Pale light filled the yard when Lord Tywin Lannister took his leave of Harrenhal Arya watched from an arched window halfway up the Wailing Tower His charger wore a blanket of enameled crimson scales and gilded crinet and chamfron while Lord Tywin himself sported a thick ermine cloak His brother Ser Kevan looked near as splendid No less than four standard-bearers went before them carrying huge crimson banners emblazoned with the golden lion Behind the Lannisters came their great lords and captains Their banners flared and flapped a pageant of color red ox and golden mountain purple unicorn and bantam rooster brindled boar and badger a silver ferret and a juggler in motley stars and sunbursts peacock and panther chevron and dagger black hood and blue beetle and green arrow

Last of all came Ser Gregor Clegane in his grey plate steel astride a stallion as bad-tempered as his rider Polliver rode beside him with the black dog standard in his hand and Gendry’s horned helm on his head He was a tall man but he looked no more than a half-grown boy when he rode in his master’s shadow

A shiver crept up Arya’s spine as she watched them pass under the great iron portcullis of Harrenhal Suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake I’m so stupid she thought Weese did not matter no more than Chiswyck had These were the men who mattered the ones she ought to have killed Last night she could have whispered any of them dead if only she hadn’t been so mad at Weese for hitting her and lying about the capon Lord Tywin why didn’t I say Lord Tywin

Perhaps it was not too late to change her mind Weese was not killed yet If she could find Jaqen tell him   

Hurriedly Arya ran down the twisting steps her chores forgotten She heard the rattle of chains as the portcullis was slowly lowered its spikes sinking deep into the ground    and then another sound a shriek of pain and fear

A dozen people got there before her though none was coming any too close Arya squirmed between them Weese was sprawled across the cobbles his throat a red ruin eyes gaping sightlessly up at a bank of grey cloud His ugly spotted dog stood on his chest lapping at the blood pulsing from his neck and every so often ripping a mouthful of flesh out of the dead man’s face

Finally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while she was worrying at one of Weese’s ears

Damnedest thing she heard a man say He had that bitch dog since she was a pup

This place is cursed the man with the crossbow said

It’s Harren’s ghost that’s what it is said Goodwife Amabel I’ll not sleep here another night I swear it

Arya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog Jaqen H’ghar was leaning up against the side of the Wailing Tower When he saw her looking he lifted a hand to his face and laid two fingers casually against his cheek





CATELYN

Two days ride from Riverrun a scout spied them watering their horses beside a muddy steam Catelyn had never been so glad to see the twin tower badge of House Frey

When she asked him to lead them to her uncle he said The Blackfish is gone west with the king my lady Martyn Rivers commands the outriders in his stead

I see She had met Rivers at the Twins a baseborn son of Lord Walder Frey half brother to Ser Perwyn It did not surprise her to learn that Robb had struck at the heart of Lannister power clearly he had been contemplating just that when he sent her away to treat with Renly Where is Rivers now

His camp is two hours ride my lady

Take us to him she commanded Brienne helped her back into her saddle and they set out at once

Have you come from Bitterbridge my lady the scout asked

No She had not dared With Renly dead Catelyn had been uncertain of the reception she might receive from his young widow and her protectors Instead she had ridden through the heart of the war through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the Lannisters and each night her scouts brought back tales that made her ill Lord Renly is slain she added

We’d hoped that tale was some Lannister lie or—

Would that it were My brother commands in Riverrun

Yes my lady His Grace left Ser Edmure to hold Riverrun and guard his rear

Gods grant him the strength to do so Catelyn thought And the wisdom as well Is there word from Robb in the west

You have not heard The man seemed surprised His Grace won a great victory at Oxcross Ser Stafford Lannister is dead his host scattered
