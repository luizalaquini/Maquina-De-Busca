And perhaps the dragon did remember but Dany could not She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea These places he talked of Casterly Rock and the Eyrie Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn Dorne and the Isle of Faces they were just words to her Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King’s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother’s womb

Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories The midnight flight to Dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ship’s black sails Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved The sack of King’s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper’s dogs the lords Lannister and Stark Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar’s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father’s throat with a golden sword

She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart They said that storm was terrible The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea Her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her

She did not remember Dragonstone either They had run again just before the Usurper’s brother set sail with his new-built fleet By then only Dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their House had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs It would not remain for long The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast

She remembered Ser Willem dimly a great grey bear of a man half-blind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed The servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to Dany He called her Little Princess and sometimes My Lady and his hands were soft as old leather He never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor That was when they lived in Braavos in the big house with the red door Dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window After Ser Willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever

They had wandered since then from Braavos to Myr from Myr to Tyrosh and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys never staying long in any one place Her brother would not allow it The Usurper’s hired knives were close behind them he insisted though Dany had never seen one

At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother’s crown had gone In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos they called her brother the beggar king Dany did not want to know what they called her

We will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it The jewels and the silks Dragonstone and King’s Landing the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back Viserys lived for that day All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known

There came a soft knock on her door Come Dany said turning away from the window Illyrio’s servants entered bowed and set about their business They were slaves a gift from one of the magister’s many Dothraki friends There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos Nonetheless they were slaves The old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it She was Illyrio’s favorite a fair-haired blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked

They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany’s head and helped her into the tub The water was scalding hot but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out She liked the heat It made her feel clean Besides her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen Ours is the house of the dragon he would say The fire is in our blood

The old woman washed her long silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags all in silence The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver There was more like that so much more what a handsome man the khal was so tall and fierce fearless in battle the best rider ever to mount a horse a demon archer Daenerys said nothing She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride The line must be kept pure Viserys had told her a thousand times theirs was the kingsblood the golden blood of old Valyria the blood of the dragon Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger a barbarian

When she was clean the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains a dab on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her breasts and one last one cool on her lips down there between her legs They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up and then the gown a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists Last of all came the collar a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs

Now you look all a princess the girl said breathlessly when they were done Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided A princess she thought but she remembered what the girl had said how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars She felt a sudden chill and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms

Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall seated on the edge of the pool his hand trailing in the water He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically Stand there he told her Turn around Yes Good You look…

Regal Magister Illyrio said stepping through an archway He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk rolls of fat jiggled as he walked Gemstones glittered on every finger and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day Princess Daenerys the magister said as he took her hand He bowed his head showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard She is a vision Your Grace a vision he told her brother Drogo will be enraptured

She’s too skinny Viserys said His hair the same silver-blond as hers had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch It was a severe look that emphasized the hard gaunt lines of his face He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him and said Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young

She has had her blood She is old enough for the khal Illyrio told him not for the first time Look at her That silver-gold hair those purple eyes… she is the blood of old Valyria no doubt no doubt… and highborn daughter of the old king sister to the new she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo When he released her hand Daenerys found herself trembling

I suppose her brother said doubtfully The savages have queer tastes Boys horses sheep…

Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo Illyrio said

Anger flashed in her brother’s lilac eyes Do you take me for a fool

The magister bowed slightly I take you for a king Kings lack the caution of common men My apologies if I have given offense He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers

The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio’s elaborately carved palanquin Two servants went ahead to light their way carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders It was warm and close inside behind the curtains Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio’s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes

Her brother sprawled out on his pillows beside her never noticed His mind was away across the narrow sea We won’t need his whole khalasar Viserys said His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest Ten thousand that would be enough I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers The realm will rise for its rightful king Tyrell Redwyne Darry Greyjoy they have no more love for the Usurper than I do The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children And the smallfolk will be with us They cry out for their king He looked at Illyrio anxiously They do don’t they

They are your people and they love you well Magister Illyrio said amiably In holdfasts all across the realm men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water He gave a massive shrug Or so my agents tell me

Dany had no agents no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea but she mistrusted Illyrio’s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio Her brother was nodding eagerly however I shall kill the Usurper myself he promised who had never killed anyone as he killed my brother Rhaegar And Lannister too the Kingslayer for what he did to my father

That would be most fitting Magister Illyrio said Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips but her brother did not notice Nodding he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again

The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos Illyrio told them The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords It is not that we fear these barbarians Illyrio would explain with a smile The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki or so the red priests promise… yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap
