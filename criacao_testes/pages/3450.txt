The round fat face looked up at him suspicious Why What will we do outside

Talk Jon said Have you seen the Wall

I’m fat not blind Samwell Tarly said Of course I saw it it’s seven hundred feet high Yet he stood up all the same wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders and followed Jon from the common hall still wary as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night Ghost padded along beside them I never thought it would be like this Sam said as they walked his words steaming in the cold air Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up All the buildings are falling down and it’s so… so…

Cold A hard frost was settling over the castle and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots

Sam nodded miserably I hate the cold he said Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning

It must have been warmer where you come from

I never saw snow until last month We were crossing the barrowlands me and the men my father sent to see me north and this white stuff began to fall like a soft rain At first I thought it was so beautiful like feathers drifting from the sky but it kept on and on until I was frozen to the bone The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders and still it kept coming I was afraid it would never end

Jon smiled

The Wall loomed before them glimmering palely in the light of the half moon In the sky above the stars burned clear and sharp Are they going to make me go up there Sam asked His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs I’ll die if I have to climb that

There’s a winch Jon said pointing They can draw you up in a cage

Samwell Tarly sniffled I don’t like high places

It was too much Jon frowned incredulous Are you afraid of everything he asked I don’t understand If you are truly so craven why are you here Why would a coward want to join the Night’s Watch

Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment and his round face seemed to cave in on itself He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake Jon Snow could only stand and watch Like the snowfall on the barrowlands it seemed the tears would never end

It was Ghost who knew what to do Silent as shadow the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly’s face The fat boy cried out startled… and somehow in a heartbeat his sobs turned to laughter

Jon Snow laughed with him Afterward they sat on the frozen ground huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows It seemed a thousand years ago now Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell

Sometimes I dream about it he said I’m walking down this long empty hall My voice echoes all around but no one answers so I walk faster opening doors shouting names I don’t even know who I’m looking for Most nights it’s my father but sometimes it’s Robb instead or my little sister Arya or my uncle The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him his uncle was still missing The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower but they’d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way In the stony highlands to the northwest the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished

Do you ever find anyone in your dream Sam asked

Jon shook his head No one The castle is always empty He had never told anyone of the dream and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now yet somehow it felt good to talk of it Even the ravens are gone from the rookery and the stables are full of bones That always scares me I start to run then throwing open doors climbing the tower three steps at a time screaming for someone for anyone And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts It’s black inside and I can see the steps spiraling down Somehow I know I have to go down there but I don’t want to I’m afraid of what might be waiting for me The old Kings of Winter are down there sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps but it’s not them I’m afraid of I scream that I’m not a Stark that this isn’t my place but it’s no good I have to go anyway so I start down feeling the walls as I descend with no torch to light the way It gets darker and darker until I want to scream He stopped frowning embarrassed That’s when I always wake His skin cold and clammy shivering in the darkness of his cell Ghost would leap up beside him his warmth as comforting as daybreak He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur Do you dream of Horn Hill Jon asked

No Sam’s mouth grew tight and hard I hated it there He scratched Ghost behind the ear brooding and Jon let the silence breathe After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk and Jon Snow listened quietly and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall

The Tarlys were a family old in honor bannermen to Mace Tyrell Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly Samwell was born heir to rich lands a strong keep and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years

Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell’s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump soft and awkward Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs to wear soft velvets to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts His passions were books and kittens and dancing clumsy as he was But he grew ill at the sight of blood and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted The boy was cursed and caned slapped and starved One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial Another dressed him in his mother’s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor He only grew fatter and more frightened until Lord Randyll’s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing One time Sam confided his voice dropping from a whisper two men came to the castle warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood but it didn’t make me brave as they’d promised I got sick and retched Father had them scourged

Finally after three girls in as many years Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son From that day Lord Randyll ignored Sam devoting all his time to the younger boy a fierce robust child more to his liking Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books

Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill where his father was skinning a deer You are almost a man grown now and my heir Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke You have given me no cause to disown you but neither will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon’s Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her and you are not worthy to touch her hilt So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black You will forsake all claim to your brother’s inheritance and start north before evenfall

If you do not then on the morrow we shall have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you will be thrown from the saddle to die… or so I will tell your mother She has a woman’s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you and I have no wish to cause her pain Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy should you think to defy me Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside So There is your choice The Night’s Watch—he reached inside the deer ripped out its heart and held it in his fist red and dripping—or this

Sam told the tale in a calm dead voice as if it were something that had happened to someone else not to him And strangely Jon thought he did not weep not even once When he was done they sat together and listened to the wind for a time There was no other sound in all the world

Finally Jon said We should go back to the common hall

Why Sam asked

Jon shrugged There’s hot cider to drink or mulled wine if you prefer Some nights Dareon sings for us if the mood is on him He was a singer before… well not truly but almost an apprentice singer

How did he come here Sam asked

Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter The girl was two years older and Dareon swears she helped him through her window but under her father’s eye she named it rape so here he is When Maester Aemon heard him sing he said his voice was honey poured over thunder Jon smiled Toad sometimes sings too if you call it singing Drinking songs he learned in his father’s winesink Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart They laughed at that together

I should like to hear them both Sam admitted but they would not want me there His face was troubled He’s going to make me fight again on the morrow isn’t he

He is Jon was forced to say

Sam got awkwardly to his feet I had better try to sleep He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off

The others were still in the common room when Jon returned alone but for Ghost Where have you been Pyp asked

Talking with Sam he said

He truly is craven said Grenn At supper there were still places on the bench when he got his pie but he was too scared to come sit with us

The Lord of Ham thinks he’s too good to eat with the likes of us suggested Jeren

I saw him eat a pork pie Toad said smirking Do you think it was a brother He began to make oinking noises

Stop it Jon snapped angrily

The other boys fell silent taken aback by his sudden fury Listen to me Jon said into the quiet and he told them how it was going to be Pyp backed him as he’d known he would but when Halder spoke up it was a pleasant surprise Grenn was anxious at the first but Jon knew the words to move him One by one the rest fell in line Jon persuaded some cajoled some shamed the others made threats where threats were required At the end they had all agreed… all but Rast

You girls do as you please Rast said but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy I’m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon He laughed in Jon’s face and left them there

Hours later as the castle slept three of them paid a call on his cell Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs Jon could hear Rast’s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest The direwolf’s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy’s throat just enough to draw blood Remember we know where you sleep Jon said softly

The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved

From that day forth neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly When Ser Alliser matched them against him they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow clumsy strokes If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse yet Sam remained unhurt A few nights later at Jon’s urging he joined them for the evening meal taking a place on the bench beside Halder It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk but in time he was laughing at Pyp’s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them

Fat and awkward and frightened he might be but Samwell Tarly was no fool One night he visited Jon in his cell I don’t know what you did he said but I know you did it He looked away shyly I’ve never had a friend before

We’re not friends Jon said He put a hand on Sam’s broad shoulder We’re brothers

And so they were he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father’s sons and he loved them still yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them Catelyn Stark had seen to that The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams but Castle Black was his life now and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night’s Watch

My uncle spoke truly he whispered to Ghost He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again to tell him
