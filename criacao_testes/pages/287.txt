Sansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage You should go with her she told the king Your brother might be hurt

Joffrey shrugged What if he is

You should help him up and tell him how well he rode Sansa could not seem to stop herself

He got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt the king pointed out That’s not riding well

Look the Hound interrupted The boy has courage He’s going to try again

They were helping Prince Tommen mount his pony If only Tommen were the elder instead of Joffrey Sansa thought I wouldn’t mind marrying Tommen

The sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise Chains rattled as the portcullis was drawn upward and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges Who told them to open the gate Joff demanded With the troubles in the city the gates of the Red Keep had been closed for days

A column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter of hooves Clegane stepped close to the king one hand on the hilt of his longsword The visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty yet the standard they carried was the lion of Lannister golden on its crimson field A few wore the red cloaks and mail of Lannister men-at-arms but more were freeriders and sellswords armored in oddments and bristling with sharp steel… and there were others monstrous savages out of one of Old Nan’s tales the scary ones Bran used to love They were clad in shabby skins and boiled leather with long hair and fierce beards Some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or wrapped around their hands and others were missing eyes ears and fingers

In their midst riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front was the queen’s dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister the one they called the Imp He had let his beard grow to cover his pushed-in face until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair coarse as wire Down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak black fur striped with white He held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he had visited Winterfell With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes he was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon

Yet Tommen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard shouting with glee One of the savages a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers scooped the boy out of his saddle armor and all and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle Tommen’s breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion clapped him on the backplate and Sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height Myrcella came running after her brother and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun her in a circle squealing

When he lowered her back to the ground the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came waddling across the yard toward Joffrey Two of his men followed close behind him a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been Tommen and Myrcella trailed after them

The dwarf went to one knee before the king Your Grace

You Joffrey said

Me the Imp agreed although a more courteous greeting might be in order for an uncle and an elder

They said you were dead the Hound said

The little man gave the big one a look One of his eyes was green one was black and both were cool I was speaking to the king not to his cur

I’m glad you’re not dead said Princess Myrcella

We share that view sweet child Tyrion turned to Sansa My lady I am sorry for your losses Truly the gods are cruel

Sansa could not think of a word to say to him How could he be sorry for her losses Was he mocking her It wasn’t the gods who’d been cruel it was Joffrey

I am sorry for your loss as well Joffrey the dwarf said

What loss

Your royal father A large fierce man with a black beard you’ll recall him if you try He was king before you

Oh him Yes it was very sad a boar killed him

Is that what ‘they’ say Your Grace

Joffrey frowned Sansa felt that she ought to say something What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her A lady’s armor is courtesy that was it She donned her armor and said I’m sorry my lady mother took you captive my lord

A great many people are sorry for that Tyrion replied and before I am done some may be a deal sorrier… yet I thank you for the sentiment Joffrey where might I find your mother

She’s with my council the king answered Your brother Jaime keeps losing battles He gave Sansa an angry look as if it were her fault He’s been taken by the Starks and we’ve lost Riverrun and now her stupid brother is calling himself a king
