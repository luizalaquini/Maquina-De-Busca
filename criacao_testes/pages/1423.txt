He enjoys cutting off hands The linen that covered Jaime’s stump was spotted with blood and wine He enjoys cutting off feet as well He doesn’t seem to need a reason

Nonetheless he had one Hoat is more cunning than he appears No man commands a company such as the Brave Companions for long unless he has some wits about him Bolton stabbed a chunk of meat with the point of his dagger put it in his mouth chewed thoughtfully swallowed Lord Vargo abandoned House Lannister because I offered him Harrenhal a reward a thousand times greater than any he could hope to have from Lord Tywin As a stranger to Westeros he did not know the prize was poisoned

The curse of Harren the Black mocked Jaime

The curse of Tywin Lannister Bolton held out his goblet and Elmar refilled it silently Our goat should have consulted the Tarbecks or the Reynes They might have warned him how your lord father deals with betrayal

There are no Tarbecks or Reynes said Jaime

My point precisely Lord Vargo doubtless hoped that Lord Stannis would triumph at King’s Landing and thence confirm him in his possession of this castle in gratitude for his small part in the downfall of House Lannister He gave a dry chuckle He knows little of Stannis Baratheon either I fear That one might have given him Harrenhal for his service… but he would have given him a noose for his crimes as well

A noose is kinder than what he’ll get from my father

By now he has come to the same realization With Stannis broken and Renly dead only a Stark victory can save him from Lord Tywin’s vengeance but the chances of that grow perishingly slim

King Robb has won every battle Brienne said stoutly as stubbornly loyal of speech as she was of deed

Won every battle while losing the Freys the Karstarks Winterfell and the north A pity the wolf is so young Boys of sixteen always believe they are immortal and invincible An older man would bend the knee I’d think After a war there is always a peace and with peace there are pardons… for the Robb Starks at least Not for the likes of Vargo Hoat Bolton gave him a small smile Both sides have made use of him but neither will shed a tear at his passing The Brave Companions did not fight in the Battle of the Blackwater yet they died there all the same

You’ll forgive me if I don’t mourn

You have no pity for our wretched doomed goat Ah but the gods must… else why deliver you into his hands Bolton chewed another chunk of meat Karhold is smaller and meaner than Harrenhal but it lies well beyond the reach of the lion’s claws Once wed to Alys Karstark Hoat might be a lord in truth If he could collect some gold from your father so much the better but he would have delivered you to Lord Rickard no matter how much Lord Tywin paid His price would be the maid and safe refuge

But to sell you he must keep you and the riverlands are full of those who would gladly steal you away Glover and Tallhart were broken at Duskendale but remnants of their host are still abroad with the Mountain slaughtering the stragglers A thousand Karstarks prowl the lands south and east of Riverrun hunting you Elsewhere are Darry men left lordless and lawless packs of four-footed wolves and the lightning lord’s outlaw bands Dondarrion would gladly hang you and the goat together from the same tree The Lord of the Dreadfort sopped up some of the blood with a chunk of bread Harrenhal was the only place Lord Vargo could hope to hold you safe but here his Brave Companions are much outnumbered by my own men and by Ser Aenys and his Freys No doubt he feared I might return you to Ser Edmure at Riverrun… or worse send you on to your father

By maiming you he meant to remove your sword as a threat gain himself a grisly token to send to your father and diminish your value to me For he is my man as I am King Robb’s man Thus his crime is mine or may seem so in your father’s eyes And therein lies my… small difficulty He gazed at Jaime his pale eyes unblinking expectant chill

I see You want me to absolve you of blame To tell my father that this stump is no work of yours Jaime laughed My lord send me to Cersei and I’ll sing as sweet a song as you could want of how gently you treated me Any other answer he knew and Bolton would give him back to the goat Had I a hand I’d write it out How I was maimed by the sellsword my own father brought to Westeros and saved by the noble Lord Bolton

I will trust to your word ser

There’s something I don’t often hear How soon might we be permitted to leave And how do you mean to get me past all these wolves and brigands and Karstarks

You will leave when Qyburn says you are strong enough with a strong escort of picked men under the command of my captain Walton Steelshanks he is called A soldier of iron loyalty Walton will see you safe and whole to King’s Landing

Provided Lady Catelyn’s daughters are delivered safe and whole as well said the wench My lord your man Walton’s protection is welcome but the girls are my charge

The Lord of the Dreadfort gave her an uninterested glance The girls need not concern you any further my lady The Lady Sansa is the dwarf’s wife only the gods can part them now

His wife Brienne said appalled The Imp But… he swore before the whole court in sight of gods and men…

She is such an innocent Jaime was almost as surprised if truth be told but he hid it better Sansa Stark that ought to put a smile on Tyrion’s face He remembered how happy his brother had been with his little crofter’s daughter… for a fortnight

What the Imp did or did nor swear scarcely matters now said Lord Bolton Least of all to you The wench looked almost wounded Perhaps she finally felt the steel jaws of the trap when Roose Bolton beckoned to his guards Ser Jaime will continue on to King’s Landing I said nothing about you I fear It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both his prizes The Lord of the Dreadfort reached out to pick another prune Were I you my lady I should worry less about Starks and rather more about sapphires





Tyrion


A horse whickered impatiently behind him from amidst the ranks of gold cloaks drawn up across the road Tyrion could hear Lord Gyles coughing as well He had not asked for Gyles no more than he’d asked for Ser Addam Or Jalabhar Xho or any of the rest but his lord father felt Doran Martell might take it ill if only a dwarf came out to escort him across the Blackwater

Joffrey should have met the Dornishmen himself he reflected as he sat waiting but he would have mucked it up no doubt Of late the king had been repeating little jests about the Dornish that he’d picked up from Mace Tyrell’s men-atarms How many Dornishmen does it take to shoe a horse Nine One to do the shoeing and eight to lift the horse up Somehow Tyrion did not think Doran Martell would find that amusing

He could see their banners flying as the riders emerged from the green of the living wood in a long dusty column From here to the river only bare black trees remained a legacy of his battle Too many banners he thought sourly as he watched the ashes kick up under the hooves of the approaching horses as they had beneath the hooves of the Tyrell van as it smashed Stannis in the flank Martell’s brought half the lords of Dorne by the look of it He tried to think of some good that might come of that and failed How many banners do you count he asked Bronn

The sellsword knight shaded his eyes Eight… no nine

Tyrion turned in his saddle Pod come up here Describe the arms you see and tell me which houses they represent

Podrick Payne edged his gelding closer He was carrying the royal standard Joffrey’s great stag-and-lion and struggling with its weight Bronn bore Tyrion’s own banner the lion of Lannister gold on crimson

He’s getting taller Tyrion realized as Pod stood in his stirrups for a better look He’ll soon tower over me like all the rest The lad had been making a diligent study of Dornish heraldry at Tyrion’s command but as ever he was nervous I can’t see The wind is flapping them

Bronn tell the boy what you see

Bronn looked very much the knight today in his new doublet and cloak the flaming chain across his chest A red sun on orange he called with a spear through its back

Martell Podrick Payne said at once visibly relieved House Martell of Sunspear my lord The Prince of Dorne

My horse would have known that one said Tyrion dryly Give him another Bronn

There’s a purple flag with yellow balls

Lemons Pod said hopefully A purple fleld strewn with lemons For House Dalt Of of Lemonwood

Might be Next’s a big black bird on yellow Something pink or white in its claws hard to say with the banner flapping

The vulture of Blackmont grasps a baby in its talons said Pod House Blackmont of Blackmont ser

Bronn laughed Reading books again Books will ruin your sword eye boy I see a skull too A black banner

The crowned skull of House Manwoody bone and gold on black Pod sounded more confident with every correct answer The Manwoodys of Kingsgrave

Three black spiders

They’re scorpions ser House Qorgyle of Sandstone three scorpions black on red

Red and yellow a jagged line between

The flames of Hellholt House Uller

Tyrion was impressed The boy’s not half stupid once he gets his tongue untied Go on Pod he urged If you get them all I’ll make you a gift

A pie with red and black slices said Bronn There’s a gold hand in the middle

House Allyrion of Godsgrace
