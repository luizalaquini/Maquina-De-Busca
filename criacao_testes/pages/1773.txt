froward young person 1hate1 him  
 We know you do miss said Liddy and so do we
all
 I hate him too said Maryann
 Maryann -- O you perjured woman  How can you
speak that wicked story   said Bathsheba excitedly
You admired him from your heart only this morning
in the very world you did Yes Maryann you know it  
Yes miss but so did you He is a wild scamp
now and you are right to hate him
Hes 1not1 a wild scamp How dare you to my face 
I have no right to hate him nor you nor anybody
But I am a silly woman What is it to me what he is 
You know it is nothing I dont care for him  I dont
mean to defend his good name not I Mind this if
any of you say a word against him youll be dismissed
instantly  
She flung down the letter and surged back into the
parlour with a big heart and tearful eyes Liddy following
her
O miss said mild Liddy looking pitifully into
Bathshebas face I am sorry we mistook you so 
did think you cared for him but I see you dont now
 Shut the door Liddy
P 253
Liddy closed the door and went on   People always
say such foolery miss Ill make answer henceforard
Of course a lady like Miss Everdene cant love him
Ill say it out in plain black and white
Bathsheba burst out  O Liddy are you such a
simpleton  Cant you read riddles  Cant you see
Are you a woman yourself  
Liddys clear eyes rounded with wonderment
 Yes you must be a blind thing Liddy   she said
in reckless abandonment and grief O I love him
to very distraction and misery and agony  Dont be
frightened at me though perhaps I am enough to frighten
any innocent woman Come closer -- closer She put
her arms round Liddys neck I must let it out to
somebody it is wearing me away  Dont you yet know
enough of me to see through that miserable denial of
mine O God what a lie it was  Heaven and my
Love forgive me And dont you know that a woman
who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is
HOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES
balanced against her love  There go out of the room 
I want to be quite alone
Liddy went towards the door
 Liddy come here Solemnly swear to me that hes
not a fast man that it is all lies they say about him 
Put miss how can I say he is not if --  -- 
You graceless girl How can you have the cruel
heart to repeat what they say Unfeeling thing that
you are But 1Ill1 see if you or anybody else in the
village or town either dare do such a thing   She
started off pacing from fireplace to door and back
again
No miss I dont -- I know it is not true   said
Liddy frightened at Bathshebas unwonted vehemence
I suppose you only agree with me like that to please
me But Liddy he 1cannot be1 had as is said Do you
hear 
 Yes miss yes
And you dont believe he is
I dont know what to say miss said Liddy be+
ginning to cry If I say No you dont believe me
and if I say Yes you rage at me  
 Say you dont believe it -- say you dont  
P 254
I dont believe him to be so had as they make out
He is not had at all My poor life and heart
how weak I am   she moaned in a relaxed desultory
way heedless of Liddys presence O how I wish I
had never seen him Loving is misery for women
always I shall never forgive God for making me a
woman and dearly am I beginning to pay for the honour
of owning a pretty face She freshened and turned to
Liddy suddenly  Mind this Lydia Smallbury if you
repeat anywhere a single word of what l have said to
you inside this closed door Ill never trust you or love
you or have you with me a moment longer -- not a
moment  
 I dont want to repeat anything said Liddy with
womanly dignity of a diminutive order but I dont
wish to stay with you And if you please Ill go at the
end of the harvest or this week or to-day I dont
see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for
nothing   concluded the small woman bigly
 No no Liddy  you must stay   said Bathsheba
dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious
inconsequence You must not notice my being in a
taking just now You are not as a servant -- -you are a
companion to me Dear dear -- I dont know what I
am doing since this miserable ache o my heart has
weighted and worn upon me so  What shall I come
to  I suppose I shall get further and further into
troubles I wonder sometimes if I am doomed to die
in the Union I am friendless enough God knows  
I wont notice anything nor will I leave you   sobbed
Liddy impulsively putting up her lips to Bathshebas
