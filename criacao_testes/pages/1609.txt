I tell them Weve got an audience waiting
Im expecting a production meeting in which Plutarch
instructs me where to stand and gives me my cue for
shooting Snow Instead I find myself sent into a room
where six people sit around a table Peeta Johanna
Beetee Haymitch Annie and Enobaria They all wear the
gray rebel uniforms from 13 No one looks particularly well
Whats this I say
Were not sure Haymitch answers It appears to be
a gathering of the remaining victors
Were all thats left I ask
The price of celebrity says Beetee We were
targeted from both sides The Capitol killed the victors they
suspected of being rebels The rebels killed those thought
to be allied with the Capitol
Johanna scowls at Enobaria So whats she doing
here
She is protected under what we call the Mockingjay
Deal says Coin as she enters behind me Wherein
Katniss Everdeen agreed to support the rebels in
exchange for captured victors immunity Katniss has
upheld her side of the bargain and so shall we
Enobaria smiles at Johanna Dont look so smug
says Johanna Well kill you anyway
Sit down please Katniss says Coin closing the
door I take a seat between Annie and Beetee carefully
placing Snows rose on the table As usual Coin gets right
to the point Ive asked you here to settle a debate Today
we will execute Snow In the previous weeks hundreds of
his accomplices in the oppression of Panem have been
tried and now await their own deaths However the
suffering in the districts has been so extreme that these
measures appear insufficient to the victims In fact many
are calling for a complete annihilation of those who held
Capitol citizenship However in the interest of maintaining
a sustainable population we cannot afford this
Through the water in the glass I see a distorted image
of one of Peetas hands The burn marks We are both fire
mutts now My eyes travel up to where the flames licked
across his forehead singeing away his brows but just
missing his eyes Those same blue eyes that used to meet
mine and then flit away at school Just as they do now
So an alternative has been placed on the table
Since my colleagues and I can come to no consensus it
has been agreed that we will let the victors decide A
majority of four will approve the plan No one may abstain
from the vote says Coin What has been proposed is that
in lieu of eliminating the entire Capitol population we have
a final symbolic Hunger Games using the children directly
related to those who held the most power
All seven of us turn to her What says Johanna
We hold another Hunger Games using Capitol
children says Coin
Are you joking asks Peeta
No I should also tell you that if we do hold the Games
it will be known it was done with your approval although the
individual breakdown of your votes will be kept secret for
your own security Coin tells us
Was this Plutarchs idea asks Haymitch
It was mine says Coin It seemed to balance the
need for vengeance with the least loss of life You may cast
your votes
No bursts out Peeta I vote no of course We cant
have another Hunger Games
Why not Johanna retorts It seems very fair to me
Snow even has a granddaughter I vote yes
So do I says Enobaria almost indifferently Let
them have a taste of their own medicine
This is why we rebelled Remember Peeta looks at
the rest of us Annie
I vote no with Peeta she says So would Finnick if
he were here
But he isnt because Snows mutts killed him
Johanna reminds her
No says Beetee It would set a bad precedent We
have to stop viewing one another as enemies At this point
unity is essential for our survival No
Were down to Katniss and Haymitch says Coin
Was it like this then Seventy-five years or so ago
Did a group of people sit around and cast their votes on
initiating the Hunger Games Was there dissent Did
someone make a case for mercy that was beaten down by
the calls for the deaths of the districts children The scent
of Snows rose curls up into my nose down into my throat
squeezing it tight with despair All those people I loved
dead and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in an
attempt to avoid wasting life Nothing has changed Nothing
will ever change now
I weigh my options carefully think everything through
Keeping my eyes on the rose I say I vote yesfor Prim
Haymitch its up to you says Coin
A furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity he
could become party to but I can feel Haymitch watching
me This is the moment then When we find out exactly just
how alike we are and how much he truly understands me
Im with the Mockingjay he says
Excellent That carries the vote says Coin Now we
really must take our places for the execution
As she passes me I hold up the glass with the rose
Can you see that Snows wearing this Just over his
