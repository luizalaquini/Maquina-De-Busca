Seated betwixt his black oak towers the Lord of the Crossing clapped his spotted hands together The noise they made was so faint that even those on the dais scarce heard it but Ser Aenys and Ser Hosteen saw and began to pound their cups on the table Lame Lothar joined them then Marq Piper and Ser Danwell and Ser Raymund Half the guests were soon pounding Finally even the mob of musicians in the gallery took note The piping drumming and fiddling trailed off into quiet

Your Grace Lord Walder called out to Robb the septon has prayed his prayers some words have been said and Lord Edmure’s wrapped my sweetling in a fish cloak but they are not yet man and wife A sword needs a sheath heh and a wedding needs a bedding What does my sire say Is it meet that we should bed them

A score or more of Walder Frey’s sons and grandsons began to bang their cups again shouting To bed To bed To bed with them Roslin had gone white Catelyn wondered whether it was the prospect of losing her maidenhead that frightened the girl or the bedding itself With so many siblings she was not like to be a stranger to the custom but it was different when you were the one being bedded On Catelyn’s own wedding night Jory Cassell had torn her gown in his haste to get her out of it and drunken Desmond Grell kept apologizing for every bawdy joke only to make another When Lord Dustin had beheld her naked he’d told Ned that her breasts were enough to make him wish he’d never been weaned Poor man she thought He had ridden south with Ned never to return Catelyn wondered how many of the men here tonight would be dead before the year was done Too many I fear

Robb raised a hand if you think the time is meet Lord Walder by all means let us bed them

A roar of approval greeted his pronouncement Up in the gallery the musicians took up their pipes and horns and fiddles again and began to play The Queen Took Off Her Sandal the King Took Off His Crown Jinglebell hopped from foot to foot his own crown ringing I hear Tully men have trout between their legs instead of cocks Alyx Frey called out boldly Does it take a worm to make them rise To which Ser Marq Piper threw back I hear that Frey women have two gates in place of one and Alyx said Aye but both are closed and barred to little things like you A gust of laughter followed until Patrek Mallister climbed up onto a table to propose a toast to Edmure’s one-eyed fish And a mighty pike it is he proclaimed Nay I’ll wager it’s a minnow Fat Walda Bolton shouted out from Catelyn’s side Then the general cry of Bed them Bed them went up again

The guests swarmed the dais the drunkest in the forefront as ever The men and boys surrounded Roslin and lifted her into the air whilst the maids and mothers in the hall pulled Edmure to his feet and began tugging at his clothing He was laughing and shouting bawdy jokes back at them though the music was too loud for Catelyn to hear She heard the Greatjon though Give this little bride to me he bellowed as he shoved through the other men and threw Roslin over one shoulder Look at this little thing No meat on her at all

Catelyn felt sorry for the girl Most brides tried to return the banter or at least pretended to enjoy it but Roslin was stiff with terror clutching the Greatjon as if she feared he might drop her She’s crying too Catelyn realized as she watched Ser Marq Piper pull off one of the bride’s shoes I hope Edmure is gentle with the poor child Jolly bawdy music still poured down from the gallery the queen was taking off her kirtle now and the king his tunic

She knew she should join the throng of women round her brother but she would only ruin their fun The last thing she felt just now was bawdy Edmure would forgive her absence she did not doubt much jollier to be stripped and bedded by a score of lusty laughing Freys than by a sour stricken sister

As man and maid were carried from the hall a trail of clothing behind them Catelyn saw that Robb had also remained Walder Frey was prickly enough to see some insult to his daughter in that He should join in Roslin’s bedding but is it my place to tell him so She tensed until she saw that others had stayed as well Petyr Pimple and Ser Whalen Frey slept on their heads on the table Merrett Frey poured himself another cup of wine while Jinglebell wandered about stealing bites off the plates of those who’d left Ser Wendel Manderly was lustily attacking a leg of lamb And of course Lord Walder was far too feeble to leave his seat without help He will expect Robb to go though She could almost hear the old man asking why His Grace did not want to see his daughter naked The drums were pounding again pounding and pounding and pounding

Dacey Mormont who seemed to be the only woman left in the hall besides Catelyn stepped up behind Edwyn Frey and touched him lightly on the arm as she said something in his ear Edwyn wrenched himself away from her with unseemly violence No he said too loudly I’m done with dancing for the nonce Dacey paled and turned away Catelyn got slowly to her feet What just happened there Doubt gripped her heart where an instant before had been only weariness It is nothing she tried to tell herself you are seeing grumkins in the woodpile you are become an old silly woman sick with grief and fear But something must have shown on her face Even Ser Wendel Manderly took note Is something amiss he asked the leg of lamb in his hands

She did not answer him Instead she went after Edwyn Frey The players in the gallery had finally gotten both king and queen down to their name-day suits With scarcely a moment’s respite they began to play a very different sort of song No one sang the words but Catelyn knew The Rains of Castamere when she heard it Edwyn was hurrying toward a door She hurried faster driven by the music Six quick strides and she caught him And who are you the proud lord said that I must bow so low She grabbed Edwyn by the arm to turn him and went cold all over when she felt the iron rings beneath his silken sleeve

Catelyn slapped him so hard she broke his lip Olyvar she thought and Perwyn Alesander all absent And Roslin wept…

Edwyn Frey shoved her aside The music drowned all other sound echoing off the walls as if the stones themselves were playing Robb gave Edwyn an angry look and moved to block his way… and staggered suddenly as a quarrel sprouted from his side just beneath the shoulder If he screamed then the sound was swallowed by the pipes and horns and fiddles Catelyn saw a second bolt pierce his leg saw him fall Up in the gallery half the musicians had crossbows in their hands instead of drums or lutes She ran toward her son until something punched in the small of the back and the hard stone floor came up to slap her Robb she screamed She saw Smalljon Umber wrestle a table off its trestles Crossbow bolts thudded into the wood one two three as he flung it down on top of his king Robin Flint was ringed by Freys their daggers rising and falling Ser Wendel Manderly rose ponderously to his feet holding his leg of lamb A quarrel went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck Ser Wendel crashed forward knocking the table off its trestles and sending cups flagons trenchers platters turnips beets and wine bouncing spilling and sliding across the floor

Catelyn’s back was on fire I have to reach him The Smalljon bludgeoned Ser Raymund Frey across the face with a leg of mutton But when he reached for his swordbelt a crossbow bolt drove him to his knees In a coat of gold or a coat of red a lion still has claws She saw Lucas Blackwood cut down by Ser Hosteen Frey One of the Vances was hamstrung by Black Walder as he was wrestling with Ser Harys Haigh And mine are long and sharp my lord as long and sharp as yours The crossbows took Donnel Locke Owen Norrey and half a dozen more Young Ser Benfrey had seized Dacey Mormont by the arm but Catelyn saw her grab up a flagon of wine with her other hand smash it full in his face and run for the door It flew open before she reached it Ser Ryman Frey pushed into the hall clad in steel from helm to heel A dozen Frey men-at-arms packed the door behind him They were armed with heavy longaxes

Mercy Catelyn cried but horns and drums and the clash of steel smothered her plea Ser Ryman buried the head of his axe in Dacey’s stomach By then men were pouring in the other doors as well mailed men in shaggy fur cloaks with steel in their hands Northmen She took them for rescue for half a heartbeat till one of them struck the Smalljon’s head off with two huge blows of his axe Hope blew out like a candle in a storm

In the midst of slaughter the Lord of the Crossing sat on his carved oaken throne watching greedily

There was a dagger on the floor a few feet away Perhaps it had skittered there when the Smalljon knocked the table off its trestles or perhaps it had fallen from the hand of some dying man Catelyn crawled toward it Her limbs were leaden and the taste of blood was in her mouth I will kill Walder Frey she told herself Jinglebell was closer to the knife hiding under a table but he only cringed away as she snatched up the blade I will kill the old man I can do that much at least

Then the tabletop that the Smalljon had flung over Robb shifted and her son struggled to his knees He had an arrow in his side a second in his leg a third through his chest Lord Walder raised a hand and the music stopped all but one drum Catelyn heard the crash of distant battle and closer the wild howling of a wolf Grey Wind she remembered too late Heh Lord Walder cackled at Robb the King in the North arises Seems we killed some of your men Your Grace Oh but I’ll make you an apology that will mend them all again heh

Catelyn grabbed a handful of Jinglebell Frey’s long grey hair and dragged him out of his hiding place Lord Walder she shouted LORD WALDER The drum beat slow and sonorous doom boom doom Enough said Catelyn Enough I say You have repaid betrayal with betrayal let it end When she pressed her dagger to Jinglebell’s throat the memory of Bran’s sickroom came back to her with the feel of steel at her own throat The drum went boom doom boom doom boom doom Please she said He is my son My first son and my last Let him go Let him go and I swear we will forget this… forget all you’ve done here I swear it by the old gods and new we… we will take no vengeance…

Lord Walder peered at her in mistrust Only a fool would believe such blather D’you take me for a fool my lady

I take you for a father Keep me for a hostage Edmure as well if you haven’t killed him But let Robb go

No Robb’s voice was whisper faint Mother no…

Yes Robb get up Get up and walk out please please Save yourself… if not for me for Jeyne

Jeyne Robb grabbed the edge of the table and forced himself to stand Mother he said Grey Wind…

Go to him Now Robb walk out of here

Lord Walder snorted And why would I let him do that

She pressed the blade deeper into Jinglebell’s throat The lackwit rolled his eyes at her in mute appeal A foul stench assailed her nose but she paid it no more mind than she did the sullen ceaseless pounding of that drum boom doom boom doom boom doom Ser Ryman and Black Walder were circling round her back but Catelyn did not care They could do as they wished with her imprison her rape her kill her it made no matter She had lived too long and Ned was waiting It was Robb she feared for On my honor as a Tully she told Lord Walder on my honor as a Stark I will trade your boy’s life for Robb’s A son for a son Her hand shook so badly she was ringing Jinglebell’s head
