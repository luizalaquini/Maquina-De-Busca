Sansa was surprised that Margaery did not see it too She is older than me she must be wiser And her father Lord Tyrell he knows what he is doing surely I am just being silly

When she told Ser Dontos that she was going to Highgarden to marry Willas Tyrell she thought he would be relieved and pleased for her Instead he had grabbed her arm and said You cannot in a voice as thick with horror as with wine I tell you these Tyrells are only Lannisters with flowers I beg of you forget this folly give your Florian a kiss and promise you’ll go ahead as we have planned The night of Joffrey’s wedding that’s not so long wear the silver hair net and do as I told you and afterward we make our escape He tried to plant a kiss on her cheek

Sansa slipped from his grasp and stepped away from him I won’t I can’t Something would go wrong When I wanted to escape you wouldn’t take me and now I don’t need to

Dontos stared at her stupidly But the arrangements are made sweetling The ship to take you home the boat to take you to the ship your Florian did it all for his sweet Jonquil

I am sorry for all the trouble I put you to she said but I have no need of boats and ships now

But it’s all to see you safe

I will be safe in Highgarden Willas will keep me safe

But he does not know you Dontos insisted and he will not love you Jonquil Jonquil open your sweet eyes these Tyrells care nothing for you It’s your claim they mean to wed

My claim She was lost for a moment

Sweetling he told her you are heir to Winterfell He grabbed her again pleading that she must not do this thing and Sansa wrenched free and left him swaying beneath the heart tree She had not visited the godswood since

But she had not forgotten his words either The heir to Winterfell she would think as she lay abed at night It’s your claim they mean to wed Sansa had grown up with three brothers She never thought to have a claim but with Bran and Rickon dead… It doesn’t matter there’s still Robb he’s a man grown now and soon he’ll wed and have a son Anyway Willas Tyrell will have Highgarden what would he want with Winterfell

Sometimes she would whisper his name into her pillow just to hear the sound of it Willas Willas Willas Willas was as good a name as Loras she supposed They even sounded the same a little What did it matter about his leg Willas would be Lord of Highgarden and she would be his lady

She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge If I give him sons he may come to love me She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon and raise them all to be as valiant as Ser Loras And to hate Lannisters too In Sansa’s dreams her children looked just like the brothers she had lost Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya

She could never hold a picture of Willas long in her head though her imaginings kept turning him back into Ser Loras young and graceful and beautiful You must not think of him like that she told herself Or else he may see the disappointment in your eyes when you meet and how could he marry you then knowing it was his brother you loved Willas Tyrell was twice her age she reminded herself constantly and lame as well and perhaps even plump and red-faced like his father But comely or no he might be the only champion she would ever have

Once she dreamed it was still her marrying Joff not Margaery and on their wedding night he turned into the headsman Ilyn Payne She woke trembling She did not want Margaery to suffer as she had but she dreaded the thought that the Tyrells might refuse to go ahead with the wedding I warned her I did I told her the truth of him Perhaps Margaery did not believe her Joff always played the perfect knight with her as once he had with Sansa She will see his true nature soon enough After the wedding if not before Sansa decided that she would light a candle to the Mother Above the next time she visited the sept and ask her to protect Margaery from Joffrey’s cruelty And perhaps a candle to the Warrior as well for Loras

She would wear her new gown for the ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor she decided as the seamstress took her last measurement That must be why Cersei is having it made for me so I will not look shabby at the wedding She really ought to have a different gown for the feast afterward but she supposed one of her old ones would do She did not want to risk getting food or wine on the new one I must take it with me to Highgarden She wanted to look beautiful for Willas Tyrell Even if Dontos was right and it is Winterfell he wants and not me he still may come to love me for myself Sansa hugged herself tightly wondering how long it would be before the gown was ready She could scarcely wait to wear it





Arya


The rains came and went but there was more grey sky than blue and all the streams were running high On the morning of the third day Arya noticed that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees We’re going the wrong way she said to Gendry as they rode past an especially mossy elm We’re going south See how the moss is growing on the trunk

He pushed thick black hair from eyes and said We’re following the road that’s all The road goes south here

We’ve been going south all day she wanted to tell him And yesterday too when we were riding along that streambed But she hadn’t been paying close attention yesterday so she couldn’t be certain I think we’re lost she said in a low voice We shouldn’t have left the river All we had to do was follow it

The river bends and loops said Gendry This is just a shorter way I bet Some secret outlaw way Lem and Tom and them have been living here for years

That was true Arya bit her lip But the moss…

The way it’s raining we’ll have moss growing from our ears before long Gendry complained

Only from our south ear Arya declared stubbornly There was no use trying to convince the Bull of anything Still he was the only true friend she had now that Hot Pie had left them
