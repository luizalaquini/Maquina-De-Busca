1424 And the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had
adjured the people saying Cursed be the man that eateth any food
until evening that I may be avenged on mine enemies So none of the
people tasted any food

1425 And all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey
upon the ground

1426 And when the people were come into the wood behold the honey
dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared
the oath

1427 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth
and his eyes were enlightened

1428 Then answered one of the people and said Thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath saying Cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day And the people were faint

1429 Then said Jonathan My father hath troubled the land see I
pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a
little of this honey

1430 How much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been
now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines  1431 And they
smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon and the
people were very faint

1432 And the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen
and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them
with the blood

1433 Then they told Saul saying Behold the people sin against the
LORD in that they eat with the blood And he said Ye have
transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day

1434 And Saul said Disperse yourselves among the people and say
unto them Bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep
and slay them here and eat and sin not against the LORD in eating
with the blood

And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and
slew them there

1435 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD the same was the first
altar that he built unto the LORD

1436 And Saul said Let us go down after the Philistines by night
and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of
them And they said Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee Then said
the priest Let us draw near hither unto God

1437 And Saul asked counsel of God Shall I go down after the
Philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel But he
answered him not that day

1438 And Saul said Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people
and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day

1439 For as the LORD liveth which saveth Israel though it be in
Jonathan my son he shall surely die But there was not a man among
all the people that answered him

1440 Then said he unto all Israel Be ye on one side and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the other side And the people said unto
Saul Do what seemeth good unto thee

1441 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel Give a perfect
lot

And Saul and Jonathan were taken but the people escaped

1442 And Saul said Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son And
Jonathan was taken

1443 Then Saul said to Jonathan Tell me what thou hast done And
Jonathan told him and said I did but taste a little honey with the
end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo I must die

1444 And Saul answered God do so and more also for thou shalt
surely die Jonathan

1445 And the people said unto Saul Shall Jonathan die who hath
wrought this great salvation in Israel God forbid as the LORD
liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for
he hath wrought with God this day So the people rescued Jonathan
that he died not

1446 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines and the
Philistines went to their own place

1447 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his
enemies on every side against Moab and against the children of
Ammon and against Edom and against the kings of Zobah and against
the Philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them
