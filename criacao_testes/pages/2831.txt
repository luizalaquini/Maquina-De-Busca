73 Then Esther the queen answered and said If I have found favour in
thy sight O king and if it please the king let my life be given me
at my petition and my people at my request 74 For we are sold I
and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish But if we
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen I had held my tongue
although the enemy could not countervail the kings damage

75 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen
Who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so
76 And Esther said The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman
Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen

77 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace garden and Haman stood up to make request for his
life to Esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king

78 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
the banquet of wine and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther
was Then said the king Will he force the queen also before me in the
house As the word went out of kings mouth they covered Hamans
face

79 And Harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king
Behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which Haman had made for
Mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of
Haman Then the king said Hang him thereon

710 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai Then was the kings wrath pacified

81 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
Jews enemy unto Esther the queen And Mordecai came before the king
for Esther had told what he was unto her

82 And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman and
gave it unto Mordecai And Esther set Mordecai over the house of
Haman

83 And Esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his
feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman
the Agagite and his device that he had devised against the Jews

84 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther So Esther
arose and stood before the king 85 And said If it please the king
and if I have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the
king and I be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the
letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite which he
wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the kings provinces 86
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred  87 Then
the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew
Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman and him they have
hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews

88 Write ye also for the Jews as it liketh you in the kings name
and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in
the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse

89 Then were the kings scribes called at that time in the third
month that is the month Sivan on the three and twentieth day
thereof and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded
unto the Jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of
the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia an hundred twenty
and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing
thereof and unto every people after their language and to the Jews
according to their writing and according to their language

810 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus name and sealed it with the
kings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on
mules camels and young dromedaries 811 Wherein the king granted
the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and
to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish
all the power of the people and province that would assault them both
little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey 812
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus namely upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month Adar

813 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies

814 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being
hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment And the decree was
given at Shushan the palace

815 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a
garment of fine linen and purple and the city of Shushan rejoiced and
was glad

816 The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honour

817 And in every province and in every city whithersoever the
kings commandment and his decree came the Jews had joy and gladness
a feast and a good day And many of the people of the land became
Jews for the fear of the Jews fell upon them

91 Now in the twelfth month that is the month Adar on the
thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree
