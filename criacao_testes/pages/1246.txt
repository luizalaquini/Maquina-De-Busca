Yet even crowned I am a beggar still Dany thought I have become the most splendid beggar in the world but a beggar all the same She hated it as her brother must have All those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the Usurper’s knives pleading for help from archons and princes and magisters buying our food with flattery He must have known how they mocked him Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter In the end it had driven him mad It will do the same to me if I let it Part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro and make the dead city bloom No that is defeat I have something Viserys never had I have the dragons The dragons are all the difference

She stroked Rhaegal The green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard Outside the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed all its myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea Make way you Milk Men make way for the Mother of Dragons Jhogo cried and the Qartheen moved aside though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice Through the swaying draperies Dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion From time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given him Aggo guarded on her other side while Rakharo rode behind the procession watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger Ser Jorah she had left behind today to guard her other dragons the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start He distrusts everyone she reflected and perhaps for good reason

As Dany lifted her goblet to drink Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back hissing Your dragon has a good nose Xaro wiped his lips The wine is ordinary It is said that across the Jade Sea they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines taste like vinegar Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it you and I

The Arbor makes the best wine in the world Dany declared Lord Redwyne had fought for her father against the Usurper she remembered one of the few to remain true to the last Will he fight for me as well There was no way to be certain after so many years Come with me to the Arbor Xaro and you’ll have the finest vintages you ever tasted But we’ll need to go in a warship not a pleasure barge

I have no warships War is bad for trade Many times I have told you Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of peace

Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of gold she thought and gold will buy me all the ships and swords I need I have not asked you to take up a sword only to lend me your ships

He smiled modestly Of trading ships I have a few that is so Who can say how many One may be sinking even now in some stormy corner of the Summer Sea On the morrow another will fall afoul of corsairs The next day one of my captains may look at the wealth in his hold and think All this should belong to me Such are the perils of trade Why the longer we talk the fewer ships I am likely to have I grow poorer by the instant

Give me ships and I will make you rich again

Marry me bright light and sail the ship of my heart I cannot sleep at night for thinking of your beauty

Dany smiled Xaro’s flowery protestations of passion amused her but his manner was at odds with his words While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare breast when he’d helped her into the palanquin Xaro hardly deigned to notice it even in these close confines And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk You speak sweetly Xaro but under your words I hear another no

This Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard I cannot bear the thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin The jewels in Xaro’s nose gave him the aspect of some strange glittery bird His long elegant fingers waved dismissal Let this be your kingdom most exquisite of queens and let me be your king I will give you a throne of gold if you like When Qarth begins to pall we can journey round Yi Ti and search for the dreaming city of the poets to sip the wine of wisdom from a dead man’s skull

I mean to sail to Westeros and drink the wine of vengeance from the skull of the Usurper She scratched Rhaegal under one eye and his jade-green wings unfolded for a moment stirring the still air in the palanquin

A single perfect tear ran down the cheek of Xaro Xhoan Daxos Will nothing turn you from this madness

Nothing she said wishing she was as certain as she sounded If each of the Thirteen would lend me ten ships—

You would have one hundred thirty ships and no crew to sail them The justice of your cause means naught to the common men of Qarth Why should my sailors care who sits upon the throne of some kingdom at the edge of the world

I will pay them to care

With what coin sweet star of my heaven

With the gold the seekers bring

That you may do Xaro acknowledged but so much caring will cost dear You will need to pay them far more than I do and all of Qarth laughs at my ruinous generosity

If the Thirteen will not aid me perhaps I should ask the Guild of Spicers or the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Xaro gave a languid shrug They will give you nothing but flattery and lies The Spicers are dissemblers and braggarts and the Brotherhood is full of pirates

Then I must heed Pyat Pree and go to the warlocks

The merchant prince sat up sharply Pyat Pree has blue lips and it is truly said that blue lips speak only lies Heed the wisdom of one who loves you Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

I would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend Xaro Xhoan Daxos would give me what I ask

I have given you my home and heart do they mean nothing to you I have given you perfume and pomegranates tumbling monkeys and spitting snakes scrolls from lost Valyria an idol’s head and a serpent’s foot I have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold and a matched set of bullocks to bear it one white as ivory and one black as jet with horns inlaid with jewels

Yes Dany said But it was ships and soldiers I wanted

Did I not give you an army sweetest of women A thousand knights each in shining armor

The armor had been made of silver and gold the knights of jade and beryl and onyx and tourmaline of amber and opal and amethyst each as tall as her little finger A thousand lovely knights she said but not the sort my enemies need fear And my bullocks cannot carry me across the water I—why are we stopping The oxen had slowed notably

Khaleesi Aggo called through the drapes as the palanquin jerked to a sudden halt Dany rolled onto an elbow to lean out They were on the fringes of the bazaar the way ahead blocked by a solid wall of people What are they looking at

Jhogo rode back to her A firemage Khaleesi

I want to sec

Then you must The Dothraki offered a hand down When she took it he pulled her up onto his horse and sat her in front of him where she could see over the heads of the crowd The firemage had conjured a ladder in the air a crackling orange ladder of swirling flame that rose unsupported from the floor of the bazaar reaching toward the high latticed roof

Most of the spectators she noticed were not of the city she saw sailors off trading ships merchants come by caravan dusty men out of the red waste wandering soldiers craftsmen slavers Jhogo slid one hand about her waist and leaned close The Milk Men shun him Khaleesi do you see the girl in the felt hat There behind the fat priest She is a—

—cutpurse finished Dany She was no pampered lady blind to such things She had seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the Free Cities during the years she’d spent with her brother running from the Usurper’s hired knives

The mage was gesturing urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of his arms As the watchers craned their necks upward the cutpurses squirmed through the press small blades hidden in their palms They relieved the prosperous of their coin with one hand while pointing upward with the other

When the fiery ladder stood forty feet high the mage leapt forward and began to climb it scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey Each rung he touched dissolved behind him leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke When he reached the top the ladder was gone and so was he

A fine trick announced Jhogo with admiration

No trick a woman said in the Common Tongue

Dany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd yet there she stood eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask What mean you my lady

Half a year gone that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass He had some small skill with powders and wildfire sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets

Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood Even the smoke was gone now and the crowd was breaking up each man going about his business In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty And now

And now his powers grow Khaleesi And you are the cause of it

Me She laughed How could that be

The woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany’s wrist You are the Mother of Dragons are you not

She is and no spawn of shadows may touch her Jhogo brushed Quaithe’s fingers away with the handle of his whip

The woman took a step backward You must leave this city soon Daenerys Targaryen or you will never be permitted to leave it at all

Dany’s wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched her Where would you have me go she asked

To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Asshai Dany thought She would have me go to Asshai Will the Asshai’i give me an army she demanded Will there be gold for me in Asshai Will there be ships What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth

Truth said the woman in the mask And bowing she faded back into the crowd
