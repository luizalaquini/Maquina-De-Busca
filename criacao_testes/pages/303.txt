I do the fat boy blurted He was older than Jon a man grown by law but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy I found drawings of the faces in the trees and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest… works that even the Citadel doesn’t have scrolls from old Valyria counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years…

The books will still be here when we return

If we return…

The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men three-quarters of them rangers Qhorin Halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower You’ll be as safe as if you were back in your lord father’s castle at Horn Hill

Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile I was never very safe in my father’s castle either

The gods play cruel jests Jon thought Pyp and Toad all a lather to be a part of the great ranging were to remain at Castle Black It was Samwell Tarly the self-proclaimed coward grossly fat timid and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword who must face the haunted forest The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens so they might send back word as they went Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them so his steward must go in his place We need you for the ravens Sam And someone has to help me keep Grenn humble

Sam’s chins quivered You could care for the ravens or Grenn could or anyone he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice I could show you how You know your letters too you could write down Lord Mormont’s messages as well as I

I’m the Old Bear’s steward I’ll need to squire for him tend his horse set up his tent I won’t have time to watch over birds as well Sam you said the words You’re a brother of the Night’s Watch now

A brother of the Night’s Watch shouldn’t be so scared

We’re all scared We’d be fools if we weren’t Too many rangers had been lost the past two years even Benjen Stark Jon’s uncle They had found two of his uncle’s men in the wood slain but the corpses had risen in the chill of night Jon’s burnt fingers twitched as he remembered He still saw the wight in his dreams dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of There’s no shame in fear my father told me what matters is how we face it Come I’ll help you gather up the maps

Sam nodded unhappily The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the earth In summer the wormwalks were seldom used save by rats and other vermin but winter was a different matter When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together

Soon Jon thought as they climbed He’d seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with word of summer’s end the great raven of the Citadel white and silent as Ghost He had seen a winter once when he was very young but everyone agreed that it had been a short one and mild This one would be different He could feel it in his bones

The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith’s bellows by the time they reached the surface They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon’s cloak swirl and snap Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary but he woke when Jon appeared bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them

Sam squinted up at the Wall It loomed above them an icy cliff seven hundred feet high Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing with moods of its own The color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers now the dirty white of old snow and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance It was the end of the world

And we are going beyond it

The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds but the pale red line was there behind them The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont’s Torch saying only half in jest that the gods must have sent it to light the old man’s way through the haunted forest

The comet’s so bright you can see it by day now Sam said shading his eyes with a fistful of books

Never mind about comets it’s maps the Old Bear wants

Ghost loped ahead of them The grounds seemed deserted this morning with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole’s Town digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind Grenn had gone with them Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging They’d wanted Jon and Sam to come as well but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest and Jon had wanted no part of it Do what you want he told Toad I took a vow

As they passed the sept he heard voices raised in song Some men want whores on the eve of battle and some want gods Jon wondered who felt better afterward The sept tempted him no more than the brothel his own gods kept their temples in the wild places where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches The Seven have no power beyond the Wall he thought but my gods will be waiting

Outside the armory Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits They’d come in last night with Conwy one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff two blond boys with the look of brothers a foppish youth in soiled satin a raggy man with a clubfoot and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior Ser Endrew was showing him the error of that presumption He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been but his lessons would still raise bruises Sam winced at every blow but Jon Snow watched the swordplay closely

What do you make of them Snow Donal Noye stood in the door of his armory bare-chested under a leather apron the stump of his left arm uncovered for once With his big gut and barrel chest his flat nose and bristly black jaw Noyc did not make a pretty sight but he was a welcome one nonetheless The armorer had proved himself a good friend

They smell of summer Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling Where did Conwy find them

A lord’s dungeon near Gulltown the smith replied A brigand a barber a beggar two orphans and a boy whore With such do we defend the realms of men

They’ll do Jon gave Sam a private smile We did

Noye drew him closer You’ve heard these tidings of your brother

Last night Conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them and the talk in the common room had been of little else Jon was still not certain how he felt about it Robb a king The brother he’d played with fought with shared his first cup of wine with But not mother’s milk no So now Robb will sip summerwine from jeweled goblets while I’m kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from cupped hands Robb will make a good king he said loyally
