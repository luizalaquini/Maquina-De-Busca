Outriders spied the Manderly banners—the white merman with trident in hand rising from a blue-green sea—and hailed them warmly They were led to a spot of high ground dry enough for a camp Ser Wylis called a halt there and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended while his brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father’s respects to their liege lord

The ground under their horses’ hooves was soft and wet It fell away slowly beneath them as they rode past smoky peat fires lines of horses and wagons heavy-laden with hardbread and salt beef On a stony outcrop of land higher than the surrounding country they passed a lord’s pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth Catelyn recognized the banner the bull moose of the Hornwoods brown on its dark orange field

Just beyond through the mists she glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat Cailin… or what remained of them Immense blocks of black basalt each as large as a crofter’s cottage lay scattered and tumbled like a child’s wooden blocks half-sunk in the soft boggy soil Nothing else remained of a curtain wall that had once stood as high as Winterfell’s The wooden keep was gone entirely rotted away a thousand years past with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood All that was left of the great stronghold of the First Men were three towers… three where there had once been twenty if the taletellers could be believed

The Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough and even boasted a few feet of standing wall to either side of it The Drunkard’s Tower off in the bog where the south and west walls had once met leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter And the tall slender Children’s Tower where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon their nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters had lost half its crown It looked as if some great beast had taken a bite out of the crenellations along the tower top and spit the rubble across the bog All three towers were green with moss A tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower its gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin

Gods have mercy Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them This is Moat Cailin It’s no more than a—

—death trap Catelyn finished I know how it looks Uncle I thought the same the first time I saw it but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides and any enemy must pass between them The bogs here are impenetrable full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes To assault any of the towers an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck cross a moat full of lizard-lions and scale walls slimy with moss all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers She gave her uncle a grim smile And when night falls there are said to be ghosts cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood

Ser Brynden chuckled Remind me not to linger here Last I looked I was southron myself

Standards had been raised atop all three towers The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard’s Tower beneath the direwolf on the Children’s Tower it was the Greatjon’s giant in shattered chains But on the Gatehouse Tower the Stark banner flew alone That was where Robb had made his seat Catelyn made for it with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her their horses stepping slowly down the log-and-plank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud

She found her son surrounded by his father’s lords bannermen in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth He was seated at a massive stone table a pile of maps and papers in front of him talking intently with Roose Bolton and the Greatjon At first he did not notice her… but his wolf did The great grey beast was lying near the fire but when Catelyn entered he lifted his head and his golden eyes met hers The lords fell silent one by one and Robb looked up at the sudden quiet and saw her Mother he said his voice thick with emotion

Catelyn wanted to run to him to kiss his sweet brow to wrap him in her arms and hold him so tightly that he would never come to harm… but here in front of his lords she dared not He was playing a man’s part now and she would not take that away from him So she held herself at the far end of the basalt slab they were using for a table The direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where she stood It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be You’ve grown a beard she said to Robb while Grey Wind sniffed her hand

He rubbed his stubbled jaw suddenly awkward Yes His chin hairs were redder than the ones on his head

I like it Catelyn stroked the wolfs head gently It makes you look like my brother Edmure Grey Wind nipped at her fingers playful and trotted back to his place by the fire

Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects kneeling before her and pressing his brow to her hand Lady Catelyn he said you are fair as ever a welcome sight in troubled times The Glovers followed Galbart and Robett and Greatjon Umber and the rest one by one Theon Greyjoy was the last I had not looked to see you here my lady he said as he knelt

I had not thought to be here Catelyn said until I came ashore at White Harbor and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners You know his son Ser Wendel Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow And my uncle Ser Brynden Tully who has left my sister’s service for mine

The Blackfish Robb said Thank you for joining us ser We need men of your courage And you Ser Wendel I am glad to have you here Is Ser Rodrik with you as well Mother I’ve missed him

Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor but unskilled in the arts of war

Have no fear on that count Lady Stark the Greatjon told her in his bass rumble Winterfell is safe We’ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister’s bunghole soon enough begging your pardons and then it’s on to the Red Keep to free Ned

My lady a question as it please you Roose Bolton Lord of the Dreadfort had a small voice yet when he spoke larger men quieted to listen His eyes were curiously pale almost without color and his look disturbing It is said that you hold Lord Tywin’s dwarf son as captive Have you brought him to us I vow we should make good use of such a hostage

I did hold Tyrion Lannister but no longer Catelyn was forced to admit A chorus of consternation greeted the news I was no more pleased than you my lords The gods saw fit to free him with some help from my fool of a sister She ought not to be so open in her contempt she knew but her parting from the Eyrie had not been pleasant She had offered to take Lord Robert with her to foster him at Winterfell for a few years The company of other boys would do him good she had dared to suggest Lysa’s rage had been frightening to behold Sister or no she had replied if you try to steal my son you will leave by the Moon Door After that there was no more to be said

The lords were anxious to question her further but Catelyn raised a hand No doubt we will have time for all this later but my journey has fatigued me I would speak with my son alone I know you will forgive me my lords She gave them no choice led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood the bannermen bowed and took their leave And you Theon she added when Greyjoy lingered He smiled and left them

There was ale and cheese on the table Catelyn tilled a horn sat sipped and studied her son He seemed taller than when she’d left and the wisps of beard did make him look older Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers

I will be sixteen soon enough Robb said

And you are fifteen now Fifteen and leading a host to battle Can you understand why I might fear Robb

His look grew stubborn There was no one else

No one she said Pray who were those men I saw here a moment ago Roose Bolton Rickard Karstark Galbart and Robett Glover the Greatjon Helman Tallhart… you might have given the command to any of them Gods be good you might even have sent Theon though he would not be my choice

They are not Starks he said

They are men Robb seasoned in battle You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past

She saw anger in his eyes at that but it was gone as quick as it came and suddenly he was a boy again I know he said abashed Are you… are you sending me back to Winterfell

Catelyn sighed I should You ought never have left Yet I dare not not now You have come too far Someday these lords will look to you as their liege If I pack you off now like a child being sent to bed without his supper they will remember and laugh about it in their cups The day will come when you need them to respect you even fear you a little Laughter is poison to fear I will not do that to you much as I might wish to keep you safe

You have my thanks Mother he said his relief obvious beneath the formality

She reached across his table and touched his hair You are my firstborn Robb I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world red-faced and squalling

He rose clearly uncomfortable with her touch and walked to the hearth Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg You know… about Father

Yes The reports of Robert’s sudden death and Ned’s fall had frightened Catelyn more than she could say but she would not let her son see her fear Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor Have you had any word of your sisters

There was a letter Robb said scratching his direwolf under the jaw One for you as well but it came to Winterfell with mine He went to the table rummaged among some maps and papers and returned with a crumpled parchment This is the one she wrote me I never thought to bring yours

Something in Robb’s tone troubled her She smoothed out the paper and read Concern gave way to disbelief then to anger and lastly to fear This is Cersei’s letter not your sister’s she said when she was done The real message is in what Sansa does not say All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her… I know the sound of a threat even whispered They have Sansa hostage and they mean to keep her

There’s no mention of Arya Robb pointed out miserable

No Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean not now not here

I had hoped… if you still held the Imp a trade of hostages… He took Sansa’s letter and crumpled it in his fist and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time Is there word from the Eyrie I wrote to Aunt Lysa asking help Has she called Lord Arryn’s banners do you know Will the knights of the Vale come join us

Only one she said the best of them my uncle… but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate

Robb took it hard Mother what are we going to do I brought this whole army together eighteen thousand men but I don’t… I’m not certain… He looked to her his eyes shining the proud young lord melted away in an instant and quick as that he was a child again a fifteen-year-old boy looking to his mother for answers

It would not do

What are you so afraid of Robb she asked gently

I… He turned his head away to hide the first tear If we march… even if we win… the Lannisters hold Sansa and Father They’ll kill them won’t they

They want us to think so

You mean they’re lying

I do not know Robb What I do know is that you have no choice If you go to King’s Landing and swear fealty you will never be allowed to leave If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell your lords will lose all respect for you Some may even go over to the Lannisters Then the queen with that much less to fear can do as she likes with her prisoners Our best hope our only true hope is that you can defeat the foe in the field If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive why then a trade might very well be possible but that is not the heart of it So long as you have power enough that they must fear you Ned and your sister should be safe Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace should the fighting go against her

What if the fighting doesn’t go against her Robb asked What if it goes against us

Catelyn took his hand Robb I will not soften the truth for you If you lose there is no hope for any of us They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock Remember the fate of Rhaegar’s children

She saw the fear in his young eyes then but there was a strength as well Then I will not lose he vowed

Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands she said She had to learn if he was truly ready
