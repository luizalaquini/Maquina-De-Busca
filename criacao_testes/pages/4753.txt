Once the barrel was on its side Jon grabbed a torch and waved it above the surface of the Wall back and forth just enough to melt the ice a little The thin film of water helped the barrel roll more easily Too easily in fact they almost lost it But finally with four of them pooling their efforts they rolled their boulder to the edge and stood it up again

They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted There’s a turtle at our door Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look Hoardings Marsh should have built hoardings So many things they should have done The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away from the gate Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them and Jon thought he saw one man go down but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path but then he saw The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall so they simply pushed it over the carcass His leg twitched but Horse caught his arm and drew him back to safety You shouldn’t lean out like that the boy said

We should have built hoardings Jon thought he could hear the crash of axes on wood but that was probably just fear ringing in his ears He looked to Grenn Do it

Grenn got behind a barrel put his shoulder against it grunted and began to push Owen and Mully moved to help him They shoved the barrel out a foot and then another And suddenly it was gone

They heard the thump as it struck the Wall on the way down and then much louder the crash and crack of splintering wood followed by shouts and screams Satin whooped and Owen the Oaf danced in circles while Pyp leaned out and called The turtle was stuffed full of rabbits Look at them hop away

Again Jon barked and Grenn and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel and sent it tottering out into empty air

By the time they were done the front of Mance’s turtle was a crushed and splintered ruin and wildlings were spilling out the other end and scrambling for their camp Satin scooped up his crossbow and sent a few quarrels after them as they ran to see them off the faster Grenn was grinning through his beard Pyp was making japes and none of them would die today

On the morrow though    Jon glanced toward the shed Eight barrels of gravel remained where twelve had stood a few moments before He realized how tired he was then and how much his wound was hurting I need to sleep A few hours at least He could go to Maester Aemon for some dreamwine that would help I am going down to the King’s Tower he told them Call me if Mance gets up to anything Pyp you have the Wall

Me said Pyp

Him said Grenn

Smiling he left them to it and rode down in the cage

A cup of dreamwine did help as it happened No sooner had he stretched out on the narrow bed in his cell than sleep took him His dreams were strange and formless full of strange voices shouts and cries and the sound of a warhorn blowing low and loud a single deep booming note that lingered in the air

When he awoke the sky was black outside the arrow slit that served him for a window and four men he did not know were standing over him One held a lantern Jon Snow the tallest of them said brusquely pull on your boots and come with us

His first groggy thought was that somehow the Wall had fallen whilst he slept that Mance Rayder had sent more giants or another turtle and broken through the gate But when he rubbed his eyes he saw that the strangers were all in black They’re men of the Night’s Watch Jon realized Come where Who are you

The tall man gestured and two of the others pulled Jon from the bed With the lantern leading the way they marched him from his cell and up a half turn of stair to the Old Bear’s solar He saw Maester Aemon standing by the fire his hands folded around the head of a blackthorn cane Septon Cellador was half drunk as usual and Ser Wynton Stout was asleep in a window seat The other brothers were strangers to him All but one

Immaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say Here’s the turncloak now my lord Ned Stark’s bastard of Winterfell

I’m no turncloak Thorne Jon said coldly

We shall see In the leather chair behind the table where the Old Bear wrote his letters sat a big broad jowly man Jon did not know Yes we shall see he said again You will not deny that you are Jon Snow I hope Stark’s bastard

Lord Snow he likes to call himself Ser Alliser was a spare slim man compact and sinewy and just now his flinty eyes were dark with amusement

You’re the one who named me Lord Snow said Jon Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys he trained during his time as Castle Black’s master-at-arms The Old Bear had sent Thorne to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea These others must be Eastwatch men The bird reached Cotter Pyke and he’s sent us help How many men have you brought he asked the man behind the table

It’s me who’ll ask the questions the jowly man replied You’ve been charged with oathbreaking cowardice and desertion Jon Snow Do you deny that you abandoned your brothers to die on the Fist of the First Men and joined the wildling Mance Rayder this self-styled King-beyond-the-Wall

Abandoned     Jon almost choked on the word

Maester Aemon spoke up then My lord Donal Noye and I discussed these issues when Jon Snow first returned to us and were satisfied by Jon’s explanations

Well I am not satisfied Maester said the jowly man I will hear these explanations for myself Yes I will

Jon swallowed his anger I abandoned no one I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling Pass I joined the wildlings under orders The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of Winter   

The Horn of Winter Ser Alliser chuckled Were you commanded to count their snarks as well Lord Snow

No but I counted their giants as best I could

Ser snapped the jowly man You will address Ser Alliser as ser and myself as m’lord I am Janos Slynt Lord of Harrenhal and commander here at Castle Black until such time as Bowen Marsh returns with his garrison You will grant us our courtesies yes I will not suffer to hear an anointed knight like the good Ser Alliser mocked by a traitor’s bastard He raised a hand and pointed a meaty finger at Jon’s face Do you deny that you took a wildling woman into your bed

No Jon’s grief over Ygritte was too fresh for him to deny her now No my lord

I suppose it was also the Halfhand who commanded you to fuck this unwashed whore Ser Alliser asked with a smirk

Ser She was no whore ser The Halfhand told me not to balk whatever the wildlings asked of me but    I will not deny that I went beyond what I had to do that I    cared for her

You admit to being an oathbreaker then said Janos Slynt

Half the men at Castle Black visited Mole’s Town from time to time to dig for buried treasures in the brothel Jon knew but he would not dishonor Ygritte by equating her with the Mole’s Town whores I broke my vows with a woman I admit that Yes

Yes m’lord When Slynt scowled his jowls quivered He was as broad as the Old Bear had been and no doubt would be as bald if he lived to Mormont’s age Half his hair was gone already though he could not have been more than forty

Yes my lord Jon said I rode with the wildlings and ate with them as the Halfhand commanded me and I shared my furs with Ygritte But I swear to you I never turned my cloak I escaped the Magnar as soon as I could and never took up arms against my brothers or the realm

Lord Slynt’s small eyes studied him Ser Glendon he commanded bring in the other prisoner

Ser Glendon was the tall man who had dragged Jon from his bed Four other men went with him when he left the room but they were back soon enough with a captive a small sallow battered man fettered hand and foot He had a single eyebrow a widow’s peak and a mustache that looked like a smear of dirt on his upper lip but his face was swollen and mottled with bruises and most of his front teeth had been knocked out

The Eastwatch men threw the captive roughly to the floor Lord Slynt frowned down at him Is this the one you spoke of

The captive blinked yellow eyes Aye Not until that instant did Jon recognize Rattleshirt He is a different man without his armor he thought Aye the wildling repeated he’s the craven killed the Halfhand Up in the Frostfangs it were after we hunted down t’other crows and killed them every one We would have done for this one too only he begged f’ his worthless life offered t’ join us if we’d have him The Halfhand swore he’d see the craven dead first but the wolf ripped Qhorin half t’ pieces and this one opened his throat He gave Jon a cracktooth smile then and spat blood on his foot

Well Janos Slynt demanded of Jon harshly Do you deny it Or will you claim Qhorin commanded you to kill him

He told me    The words came hard He told me to do whatever they asked of me

Slynt looked about the solar at the other Eastwatch men Does this boy think I fell off a turnip wagon onto my head

Your lies won’t save you now Lord Snow warned Ser Alliser Thorne We’ll have the truth from you bastard

I’ve told you the truth Our garrons were failing and Rattleshirt was close behind us Qhorin told me to pretend to join the wildlings ‘You must not balk whatever is asked of you’ he said He knew they would make me kill him Rattleshirt was going to kill him anyway he knew that too

So now you claim the great Qhorin Halfhand feared this creature Slynt looked at Rattleshirt and snorted

All men fear the Lord o’ Bones the wildling grumbled Ser Glendon kicked him and he lapsed back into silence

I never said that Jon insisted

Slynt slammed a fist on the table I heard you Ser Alliser had your measure true enough it seems You lie through your bastard’s teeth Well I will not suffer it I will not You might have fooled this crippled blacksmith but not Janos Slynt Oh no Janos Slynt does not swallow lies so easily Did you think my skull was stuffed with cabbage

I don’t know what your skull is stuffed with My lord

Lord Snow is nothing if not arrogant said Ser Alliser He murdered Qhorin just as his fellow turncloaks did Lord Mormont It would not surprise me to learn that it was all part of the same fell plot Benjen Stark may well have a hand in all this as well For all we know he is sitting in Mance Rayder’s tent even now You know these Starks my lord
