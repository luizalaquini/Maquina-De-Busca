At the north window he leaned against the sill for a breath of the cold night air hoping to catch a glimpse of Mad Prendos raising sail but the sea seemed black and empty as far as the eye could see Is she gone already He could only pray that she was and the boy with her A half moon was sliding in and out amongst thin high clouds and Davos could see familiar stars There was the Galley sailing west there the Crone’s Lantern four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze The clouds hid most of the Ice Dragon all but the bright blue eye that marked due north The sky is full of smugglers’ stars They were old friends those stars Davos hoped that meant good luck

But when he lowered his gaze from the sky to the castle ramparts he was not so certain The wings of the stone dragons cast great black shadows in the light from the nightfire He tried to tell himself that they were no more than carvings cold and lifeless This was their place once A place of dragons and dragonlords the seat of House Targaryen The Targaryens were the blood of old Valyria…

The wind sighed through the chamber and in the hearth the flames gusted and swirled He listened to the logs crackle and spit When Davos left the window his shadow went before him tall and thin and fell across the Painted Table like a sword And there he stood for a long time waiting He heard their boots on the stone steps as they ascended The king’s voice went before him …is not three he was saying

Three is three came Melisandre’s answer I swear to you Your Grace I saw him die and heard his mother’s wail

In the nightfire Stannis and Melisandre came through the door together The flames are full of tricks What is what will be what may be You cannot tell me for a certainty…

Your Grace Davos stepped forward Lady Melisandre saw it true Your nephew Joffrey is dead

If the king was surprised to find him at the Painted Table he gave no sign Lord Davos he said He was not my nephew Though for years I believed he was

He choked on a morsel of food at his wedding feast Davos said It may be that he was poisoned

He is the third said Melisandre

I can count woman Stannis walked along the table past Oldtown and the Arbor up toward the Shield Islands and the mouth of the Mander Weddings have become more perilous than battles it would seem Who was the poisoner Is it known

His uncle it’s said The Imp

Stannis ground his teeth A dangerous man I learned that on the Blackwater How do you come by this report

The Lyseni still trade at King’s Landing Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me

I suppose not The king ran his fingers across the table Joffrey… I remember once this kitchen cat… the cooks were wont to feed her scraps and fish heads One told the boy that she had kittens in her belly thinking he might want one Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if it were true When he found the kittens he brought them to show to his father Robert hit the boy so hard I thought he’d killed him The king took off his crown and placed it on the table Dwarf or leech this killer served the kingdom well They must send for me now

They will not said Melisandre Joffrey has a brother

Tommen The king said the name grudgingly

They will crown Tommen and rule in his name

Stannis made a fist Tommen is gentler than Joffrey but born of the same incest Another monster in the making Another leech upon the land Westeros needs a man’s hand not a child’s

Melisandre moved closer Save them sire Let me wake the stone dragons Three is three Give me the boy

Edric Storm Davos said

Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury I know his name Spare me your reproaches I like this no more than you do but my duty is to the realm My duty… He turned back to Melisandre You swear there is no other way Swear it on your life for I promise you shall die by inches if you lie

You are he who must stand against the Other The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago The red comet was your herald You are the prince that was promised and if you fail the world fails with you Melisandre went to him her red lips parted her ruby throbbing Give me this boy she whispered and I will give you your kingdom

He can’t said Davos Edric Storm is gone

Gone Stannis turned What do you mean gone

He is aboard a Lyseni galley safely out to sea Davos watched Melisandre’s pale heart-shaped face He saw the flicker of dismay there the sudden uncertainty She did not see it

The king’s eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of his face The bastard was taken from Dragonstone without my leave A galley you say If that Lysene pirate thinks to use the boy to squeeze gold from me—

This is your Hand’s work sire Melisandre gave Davos a knowing look You will bring him back my lord You will

The boy is out of my reach said Davos And out of your reach as well my lady

Her red eyes made him squirm I should have left you to the dark ser Do you know what you have done

My duty

Some might call it treason Stannis went to the window to stare out into the night Is he looking for the ship I raised you up from dirt Davos He sounded more tired than angry Was loyalty too much to hope for

Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater I might have died myself You have my loyalty always Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words he said next he knew his life depended on them Your Grace you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience to defend your realm against your foes to protect your people Is not Edric Storm one of your people One of those I swore to protect I kept my oath How could that be treason

Stannis ground his teeth again I never asked for this crown Gold is cold and heavy on the head but so long as I am the king I have a duty… If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark… Sacrifice… is never easy Davos Or it is no true sacrifice Tell him my lady

Melisandre said Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart’s blood of his own beloved wife If a man with a thousand cows gives one to god that is nothing But a man who offers the only cow he owns…

She talks of cows Davos told the king I am speaking of a boy your daughter’s friend your brother’s son

A king’s son with the power of kingsblood in his veins Melisandre’s ruby glowed like a red star at her throat Do you think you’ve saved this boy Onion Knight When the long night falls Edric Storm shall die with the rest wherever he is hidden Your own sons as well Darkness and cold will cover the earth You meddle in matters you do not understand

There’s much I don’t understand Davos admitted I have never pretended elsewise I know the seas and rivers the shapes of the coasts where the rocks and shoals lie I know hidden coves where a boat can land unseen And I know that a king protects his people or he is no king at all

Stannis’s face darkened Do you mock me to my face Must I learn a king’s duty from an onion smuggler

Davos knelt If I have offended take my head I’ll die as I lived your loyal man But hear me first Hear me for the sake of the onions I brought you and the fingers you took

Stannis slid Lightbringer from its scabbard Its glow filled the chamber Say what you will but say it quickly The muscles in the king’s neck stood out like cords

Davos fumbled inside his cloak and drew out the crinkled sheet of parchment It seemed a thin and flimsy thing yet it was all the shield he had A King’s Hand should be able to read and write Maester Pylos has been teaching me He smoothed the letter flat upon his knee and began to read by the light of the magic sword





Jon


He dreamt he was back in Winterfell limping past the stone kings on their thrones Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps You are no Stark he could hear them mutter in heavy granite voices There is no place for you here Go away He walked deeper into the darkness Father he called Bran Rickon No one answered A chill wind was blowing on his neck Uncle he called Uncle Benjen Father Please Father help me Up above he heard drums They are feasting in the Great Hall but I am not welcome there I am no Stark and this is not my place His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees The crypts were growing darker A light has gone out somewhere Ygritte he whispered Forgive me Please But it was only a direwolf grey and ghastly spotted with blood his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark…

The cell was dark the bed hard beneath him His own bed he remembered his own bed in his steward’s cell beneath the Old Bear’s chambers By rights it should have brought him sweeter dreams Even beneath the furs he was cold Ghost had shared his cell before the ranging warming it against the chill of night And in the wild Ygritte had slept beside him Both gone now He had burned Ygritte himself as he knew she would have wanted and Ghost… where are you Was he dead as well was that what his dream had meant the bloody wolf in the crypts But the wolf in the dream had been grey not white Grey like Bran’s wolf Had the Thenns hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown If so Bran was lost to him for good and all

Jon was trying to make sense of that when the horn blew

The Horn of Winter he thought still confused from sleep But Mance never found Joramun’s horn so that couldn’t be A second blast followed as long and deep as the first Jon had to get up and go to the Wall he knew but it was so hard…

He shoved aside his furs and sat The pain in his leg seemed duller nothing he could not stand He had slept in his breeches and tunic and smallclothes for the added warmth so he had only to pull on his boots and don leather and mail and cloak The horn blew again two long blasts so he slung Longclaw over one shoulder found his crutch and hobbled down the steps

It was the black of night outside bitter cold and overcast His brothers were spilling out of towers and keeps buckling their swordbelts and walking toward the Wall Jon looked for Pyp and Grenn but could not find them Perhaps one of them was the sentry blowing the horn It is Mance he thought He has come at last That was good We will fight a battle and then we’ll rest Alive or dead we’ll rest
