The serving men brought every dish to Bran first that he might take the lord’s portion if he chose By the time they reached the ducks he could eat no more After that he nodded approval at each course in turn and waved it away If the dish smelled especially choice he would send it to one of the lords on the dais a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must make He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood the boar to the boisterous Umbers a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn and a huge lobster to Joseth the master of horse who was neither lord nor guest but had seen to Dancer’s training and made it possible for Bran to ride He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well for no reason but he loved them Ser Rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster brothers so he sent Little Walder some boiled beets and Big Walder the buttered turnips

On the benches below Winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town friends from the nearer holdfasts and the escorts of their lordly guests Some faces Bran had never seen before others he knew as well as his own yet they all seemed equally foreign to him He watched them as from a distance as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber looking down on the yard below seeing everything yet a part of nothing

Osha moved among the tables pouring ale One of Leobald Tallhart’s men slid a hand up under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head to roars of laughter Yet Mikken had his hand down some woman’s bodice and she seemed not to mind Bran watched Farlen make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers On the dais Lord Wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they were an enemy host He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had commanded that a special wide chair be built for him to sit in but he laughed loud and often and Bran thought he liked him Poor wan Lady Hornwood sat beside him her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food At the opposite end of the high table Hothen and Mors were playing a drinking game slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust

It is too hot here and too noisy and they are all getting drunk Bran itched under his grey and white woolens and suddenly he wished he were anywhere but here It is cool in the godswood now Steam is rising off the hot pools and the red leaves of the weirwood are rustling The smells are richer than here and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to it

Bran Ser Rodrik said You do not eat

The waking dream had been so vivid for a moment Bran had not known where he was I’ll have more later he said My belly’s full to bursting

The old knight’s white mustache was pink with wine You have done well Bran Here and at the audiences You will be an especial fine lord one day I think

I want to be a knight Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his father’s goblet grateful for something to clutch The lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on the side of the cup He felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm and remembered the last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet

It had been the night of the welcoming feast when King Robert had brought his court to Winterfell Summer still reigned then His parents had shared the dais with Robert and his queen with her brothers beside her Uncle Benjen had been there too all in black Bran and his brothers and sisters sat with the king’s children Joffrey and Tommen and Princess Myrcella who’d spent the whole meal gazing at Robb with adoring eyes Arya made faces across the table when no one was looking Sansa listened raptly while the king’s high harper sang songs of chivalry and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn’t with them Because he’s a bastard Bran finally had to whisper to him

And now they are all gone It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away the girls to captivity Jon to the Wall Robb and Mother to war King Robert and Father to their graves and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well…

Even down on the benches there were new men at the tables Jory was dead and Fat Tom and Porther Alyn Desmond Hullen who had been master of horse Harwin his son… all those who had gone south with his father even Septa Mordane and Vayon Poole The rest had ridden to war with Robb and might soon be dead as well for all Bran knew He liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough but he missed his old friends

He looked up and down the benches at all the faces happy and sad and wondered who would be missing next year and the year after He might have cried then but he couldn’t He was the Stark in Winterfell his father’s son and his brother’s heir and almost a man grown

At the foot of the hall the doors opened and a gust of cold air made the torches flame brighter for an instant Alebelly led two new guests into the feast The Lady Meera of House Reed the rotund guardsman bellowed over the clamor With her brother Jojen of Greywater Watch

Men looked up from their cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers Bran heard Little Walder mutter Frogeaters to Big Walder beside him Ser Rodrik climbed to his feet Be welcome friends and share this harvest with us Serving men hurried to lengthen the table on the dais fetching trestles and chairs

Who are they Rickon asked

Mudmen answered Little Walder disdainfully They’re thieves and cravens and they have green teeth from eating frogs

Maester Luwin crouched beside Bran’s seat to whisper counsel in his ear You must greet these ones warmly I had not thought to see them here but… you know who they are

Bran nodded Crannogmen From the Neck

Howland Reed was a great friend to your father Ser Rodrik told him These two are his it would seem

As the newcomers walked the length of the hall Bran saw that one was indeed a girl though he would never have known it by her dress She wore lambskin breeches soft with long use and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales Though near Robb’s age she was slim as a boy with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of breasts A woven net hung from one slim hip a long bronze knife from the other under her arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back

Her brother was several years younger and bore no weapons All his garb was green even to the leather of his boots and when he came closer Bran saw that his eyes were the color of moss though his teeth looked as white as anyone else’s Both Reeds were slight of build slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself They went to one knee before the dais

My lords of Stark the girl said The years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North My lord father has sent us here to say the words again for all our people

She is looking at me Bran realized He had to make some answer My brother Robb is fighting in the south he said but you can say your words to me if you like

To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater they said together Hearth and heart and harvest we yield up to you my lord Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command Grant mercy to our weak help to our helpless and justice to all and we shall never fail you

I swear it by earth and water said the boy in green

I swear it by bronze and iron his sister said

We swear it by ice and fire they finished together
