Ser Hugh of the Vale Littlefinger named him The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn’s death

I shall send for him Ned said And the others

Littlefinger winced My lord step over here to the window if you would be so kind

Why

Come and I’ll show you my lord

Frowning Ned crossed to the window Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture There across the yard at the door of the armory do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone

What of him

He reports to Varys The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings He shifted in the window seat Now glance at the wall Farther west above the stables The guardsman leaning on the ramparts

Ned saw the man Another of the eunuch’s whisperers

No this one belongs to the queen Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower the better to note who calls on you There are others many unknown even to me The Red Keep is full of eyes Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel

Eddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues Seven hells he swore It did seem as though the man on the walls was watching him Suddenly uncomfortable Ned moved away from the window Is everyone someone’s informer in this cursed city

Scarcely said Littlefinger He counted on the fingers on his hand Why there’s me you the king… although come to think on it the king tells the queen much too much and I’m less than certain about you He stood up Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely

Yes said Ned

In that case I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you Littlefinger said with a mocking smile The wiser answer was no my lord but be that as it may Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others Your own comings and goings will be noted but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day He started for the door

Lord Petyr Ned called after him I… am grateful for your help Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you

Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard You are slow to learn Lord Eddard Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed down off your horse





JON

Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard Your feet should be farther apart he urged You don’t want to lose your balance That’s good Now pivot as you deliver the stroke get all your weight behind the blade

Dareon broke off and lifted his visor Seven gods he murmured Would you look at this Jon

Jon turned Through the eye slit of his helm he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory By the look of him he must have weighed twenty stone The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet They… they told me I was to come here for… for training he said to no one in particular

A lordling Pyp observed to Jon Southron most like near Highgarden Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers’ troupe and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you’d been born just from the sound of your voice

A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy’s fur-trimmed surcoat Jon did not recognize the sigil Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south Now they send us pigs to man the Wall Is fur and velvet your notion of armor my Lord of Ham

It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him padded doublet boiled leather mail and plate and helm even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat As none of it was black however Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory That took half the morning His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move Dressed for battle the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin Let us hope you are not as inept as you look Ser Alliser said Halder see what Ser Piggy can do

Jon Snow winced Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason He was sixteen tall and muscular and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt This will be uglier than a whore’s ass Pyp muttered and it was

The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers I yield he shrilled No more I yield don’t hit me Rast and some of the other boys were laughing
