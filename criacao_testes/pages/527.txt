I don’t want to I don’t want to

There was no way Sansa could avoid them She greeted them courteously May I be of help

Lady Tanda flushed with shame No my lady but we thank you kindly You must forgive my daughter she has not been well

I don’t want to Lollys clutched at her maid a slender pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat onto those iron spikes Please please I don’t want to

Sansa spoke to her gently We’ll all be thrice protected inside and there’s to be food and drink and song as well

Lollys gaped at her mouth open She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears I don’t want to

You have to her sister Falyse said sharply and that is the end of it Shae help me They each took an elbow and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge Sansa followed with their mother She’s been sick Lady Tanda said If a babe can be termed a sickness Sansa thought It was common gossip that Lollys was with child

The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords Another sat at the foot of the stair—a real guard would have been standing not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside

The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand but it could still seat a hundred and it made up in grace what it lacked in space Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce so the torches burned twice as bright the walls were paneled in richly carved wood and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle A line of arched windows ran along the south wall but they had been closed off with heavy draperies Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike It makes no matter Sansa thought The war is with us

Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables along with a handful of old men and young boys The women were wives daughters mothers and sisters Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis Many would not return The air was heavy with the knowledge As Joffrey’s betrothed Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail and held his sword before him her father’s greatsword Ice near as tall as he was Its point rested on the floor and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip Sansa’s breath caught in her throat Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare He turned his gaunt pox-ravaged face toward her

What is he doing here she asked Osfryd Kettleblack He captained the queen’s new red cloak guard

Osfryd grinned Her Grace expects she’ll have need of him before the night’s done

Ser Ilyn was the King’s Justice There was only one service he might be needed for Whose head does she want

All rise for Her Grace Cersei of House Lannister Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm the royal steward cried

Cersei’s gown was snowy linen white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds The white made her look strangely innocent almost maidenly but there were points of color on her cheeks

Be seated the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais and be welcome Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair a page performed the same service for Sansa You look pale Sansa Cersei observed Is your red flower still blooming

Yes

How apt The men will bleed out there and you in here The queen signaled for the first course to be served

Why is Ser Ilyn here Sansa blurted out

The queen glanced at the mute headsman To deal with treason and to defend us if need be He was a knight before he was a headsman She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred When the axes smash down those doors you may be glad of him

I would be gladder if it were the Hound Sansa thought Harsh as he was she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her Won’t your guards protect us

And who will protect us from my guards The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off They’ll steal what they can and flee along with the serving men washer women and stableboys all out to save their own worthless hides Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked Sansa No you wouldn’t would you All you know of life you learned from singers and there’s such a dearth of good sacking songs

True knights would never harm women and children The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them

True knights The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing No doubt you’re right So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you sweetling I’m sure it won’t be very long now
