1438 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
house and shut up the house seven days 1439 And the priest shall
come again the seventh day and shall look and behold if the plague
be spread in the walls of the house 1440 Then the priest shall
command that they take away the stones in which the plague is and
they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city 1441 And
he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place 1442 And they shall take other stones and put them in
the place of those stones and he shall take other morter and shall
plaister the house

1443 And if the plague come again and break out in the house after
that he hath taken away the stones and after he hath scraped the
house and after it is plaistered 1444 Then the priest shall come
and look and behold if the plague be spread in the house it is a
fretting leprosy in the house it is unclean

1445 And he shall break down the house the stones of it and the
timber thereof and all the morter of the house and he shall carry
them forth out of the city into an unclean place

1446 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
shut up shall be unclean until the even

1447 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes and he
that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes

1448 And if the priest shall come in and look upon it and behold
the plague hath not spread in the house after the house was
plaistered then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because
the plague is healed

1449 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds and cedar
wood and scarlet and hyssop 1450 And he shall kill the one of the
birds in an earthen vessel over running water 1451 And he shall take
the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living bird
and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water
and sprinkle the house seven times 1452 And he shall cleanse the
house with the blood of the bird and with the running water and with
the living bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and
with the scarlet 1453 But he shall let go the living bird out of the
city into the open fields and make an atonement for the house and it
shall be clean

1454 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and scall
1455 And for the leprosy of a garment and of a house 1456 And for
a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot 1457 To teach when
it is unclean and when it is clean this is the law of leprosy

151 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron saying 152 Speak
unto the children of Israel and say unto them When any man hath a
running issue out of his flesh because of his issue he is unclean

153 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue whether his flesh
run with his issue or his flesh be stopped from his issue it is his
uncleanness

154 Every bed whereon he lieth that hath the issue is unclean and
every thing whereon he sitteth shall be unclean

155 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe
himself in water and be unclean until the even

156 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be
unclean until the even

157 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the
even

158 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean then
he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean
until the even

159 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall
be unclean

1510 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
unclean until the even and he that beareth any of those things shall
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the
even

1511 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue and hath not
rinsed his hands in water he shall wash his clothes and bathe
himself in water and be unclean until the even

1512 And the vessel of earth that he toucheth which hath the issue
shall be broken and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water

1513 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue then he
shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing and wash his
clothes and bathe his flesh in running water and shall be clean

1514 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves or
two young pigeons and come before the LORD unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation and give them unto the priest 1515
And the priest shall offer them the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
