Back in her bedchamber Sansa took off her cloak and her wet boots and sat beside the fire She had no doubt that she would be made to answer for Lord Robert’s fit Perhaps Lady Lysa will send me away Her aunt was quick to banish anyone who displeased her and nothing displeased her quite so much as people she suspected of mistreating her son

Sansa would have welcomed banishment The Gates of the Moon was much larger than the Eyrie and livelier as well Lord Nestor Royce seemed gruff and stern but his daughter Myranda kept his castle for him and everyone said how frolicsome she was Even Sansa’s supposed bastardy might not count too much against her below One of King Robert’s baseborn daughters was in service to Lord Nestor and she and the Lady Myranda were said to be fast friends as close as sisters

I will tell my aunt that I don’t want to marry Robert Not even the High Septon himself could declare a woman married if she refused to say the vows She wasn’t a beggar no matter what her aunt said She was thirteen a woman flowered and wed the heir to Winterfell Sansa felt sorry for her little cousin sometimes but she could not imagine ever wanting to be his wife I would sooner be married to Tyrion again If Lady Lysa knew that surely she’d send her away… away from Robert’s pouts and shakes and runny eyes away from Marillion’s lingering looks away from Petyr’s kisses I will tell her I will

It was late that afternoon when Lady Lysa summoned her Sansa had been marshaling her courage all day but no sooner did Marillion appear at her door than all her doubts returned Lady Lysa requires your presence in the High Hall The singer’s eyes undressed her as he spoke but she was used to that

Marillion was comely there was no denying it boyish and slender with smooth skin sandy hair a charming smile But he had made himself well hated in the Vale by everyone but her aunt and little Lord Robert To hear the servants talk Sansa was not the first maid to suffer his advances and the others had not had Lothor Brune to defend them But Lady Lysa would hear no complaints against him Since coming to the Eyrie the singer had become her favorite He sang Lord Robert to sleep every night and tweaked the noses of Lady Lysa’s suitors with verses that made mock of their foibles Her aunt had showered him with gold and gifts costly clothes a gold arm ring a belt studded with moonstones a fine horse She had even given him her late husband’s favorite falcon It all served to make Marillion unfailingly courteous in Lady Lysa’s presence and unfailingly arrogant outside it

Thank you Sansa told him stiffly I know the way

He would not leave My lady said to bring you

Bring me She did not like the sound of that Are you a guardsman now Littlefinger had dismissed the Eyrie’s captain of guards and put Ser Lothor Brune in his place

Do you require guarding Marillion said lightly I am composing a new song you should know A song so sweet and sad it will melt even your frozen heart ‘The Roadside Rose’ I mean to call it About a baseborn girl so beautiful she bewitched every man who laid eyes upon her

I am a Stark of Winterfell she longed to tell him Instead she nodded and let him escort her down the tower steps and along a bridge The High Hall had been closed as long as she’d been at the Eyrie Sansa wondered why her aunt had opened it Normally she preferred the comfort of her solar or the cozy warmth of Lord Arryn’s audience chamber with its view of the waterfall

Two guards in sky-blue cloaks flanked the carved wooden doors of the High Hall spears in hand No one is to enter so long as Alayne is with Lady Lysa Marillion told them

Aye The men let them pass then crossed their spears Marillion swung the doors shut and barred them with a third spear longer and thicker than those the guards had borne

Sansa felt a prickle of unease Why did you do that

My lady awaits you

She looked about uncertainly Lady Lysa sat on the dais in a highbacked chair of carved weirwood alone To her right was a second chair taller than her own with a stack of blue cushions piled on the seat but Lord Robert was not in it Sansa hoped he’d recovered Marillion was not like to tell her though

Sansa walked down the blue silk carpet between rows of fluted pillars slim as lances The floors and walls of the High Hall were made of milk-white marble veined with blue Shafts of pale daylight slanted down through narrow arched windows along the eastern wall Between the windows were torches mounted in high iron sconces but none of them was lit Her footsteps fell softly on the carpet Outside the wind blew cold and lonely

Amidst so much white marble even the sunlight looked chilly somehow… though not half so chilly as her aunt Lady Lysa had dressed in a gown of cream-colored velvet and a necklace of sapphires and moonstones Her auburn hair had been done up in a thick braid and fell across one shoulder She sat in the high seat watching her niece approach her face red and puffy beneath the paint and powder On the wall behind her hung a huge banner the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn in cream and blue

Sansa stopped before the dais and curtsied My lady You sent for me She could still hear the sound of the wind and the soft chords Marillion was playing at the foot of the hall

I saw what you did the Lady Lysa said

Sansa smoothed down the folds of her skirt I trust Lord Robert is better I never meant to rip his doll He was smashing my snow castle I only…

Will you play the coy deceiver with me her aunt said I was not speaking of Robert’s doll I saw you kissing him

The High Hall seemed to grow a little colder The walls and floor and columns might have turned to ice He kissed me

Lysa’s nostrils flared And why would he do that He has a wife who loves him A woman grown not a little girl He has no need for the likes of you Confess child You threw yourself at him That was the way of it

Sansa took a step backward That’s not true

Where are you going Are you afraid Such wanton behavior must be punished but I will not be hard on you We keep a whipping boy for Robert as is the custom in the Free Cities His health is too delicate for him to bear the rod himself I shall find some common girl to take your whipping but first you must own up to what you’ve done I cannot abide a liar Alayne

I was building a snow castle Sansa said Lord Petyr was helping me and then he kissed me That’s what you saw

Have you no honor her aunt said sharply Or do you take me for a fool You do don’t you You take me for a fool Yes I see that now I am not a fool You think you can have any man you want because you’re young and beautiful Don’t think I haven’t seen the looks you give Marillion I know everything that happens in the Eyrie little lady And I have known your like before too But you are mistaken if you think big eyes and strumpet’s smiles will win you Petyr He is mine She rose to her feet They all tried to take him from me My lord father my husband your mother… Catelyn most of all She liked to kiss my Petyr too oh yes she did
