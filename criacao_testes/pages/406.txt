Ned Stark a traitor Ser Jorah snorted Not bloody likely The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor

What honor could he have Dany said He was a traitor to his true king as were these Lannisters It pleased her to hear that the Usurper’s dogs were fighting amongst themselves though she was unsurprised The same thing happened when her Drogo died and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces My brother is dead as well Viserys who was the true king she told the Summer Islander Khal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold Would her brother have been any wiser had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand

Then I grieve for you Dragonmother and for bleeding Westeros bereft of its rightful king

Beneath Dany’s gentle fingers green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold When his mouth opened his teeth gleamed like black needles When does your ship return to Westeros Captain

Not for a year or more I fear From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east to make the trader’s circle round the Jade Sea

I see said Dany disappointed I wish you fair winds and good trading then You have brought me a precious gift

I have been amply repaid great queen

She puzzled at that How so

His eyes gleamed I have seen dragons

Dany laughed And will see more of them one day I hope Come to me in King’s Landing when I am on my father’s throne and you shall have a great reward

The Summer Islander promised he would do so and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave Jhiqui showed him out while Ser Jorah Mormont remained

Khaleesi the knight said when they were alone I should not speak so freely of your plans if I were you This man will spread the tale wherever he goes now

Let him she said Let the whole world know my purpose The Usurper is dead what does it matter

Not every sailor’s tale is true Ser Jorah cautioned and even if Robert be truly dead his son rules in his place This changes nothing truly

This changes everything Dany rose abruptly Screeching her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings Drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway The others skittered across the floor wingtips scrabbling on the marble Before the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo’s khalasar a hundred thousand made as one by his strength Now they fly to pieces even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead

The high lords have always fought Tell me who’s won and I’ll tell you what it means Khaleesi the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches You will need a fleet gold armies alliances—

All this I know She took his hands in hers and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes Sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed but does he ever truly see me as his queen I am not the frightened girl you met in Pentos I have counted only fifteen name days true… but I am as old as the crones in the dosh khaleen and as young as my dragons Jorah I have borne a child burned a khal and crossed the red waste and the Dothraki sea Mine is the blood of the dragon

As was your brother’s he said stubbornly

I am not Viserys

No he admitted There is more of Rhaegar in you I think but even Rhaegar could be slain Robert proved that on the Trident with no more than a warhammer Even dragons can die

Dragons die She stood on her toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek But so do dragonslayers





BRAN

Meera moved in a wary circle her net dangling loose in her left hand the slender three-pronged frog spear poised in her right Summer followed her with his golden eyes turning his tail held stiff and tall Watching watching…

Yai the girl shouted the spear darting out The wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear Meera cast her net the tangles unfolding in the air before her Summer’s leap carried him into it He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward Her spear went spinning away The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an Oof The wolf crouched atop her

Bran hooted You lose
