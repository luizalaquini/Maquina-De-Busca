1712 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have
received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with
the beast

1713 These have one mind and shall give their power and strength
unto the beast

1714 These shall make war with the Lamb and the Lamb shall overcome
them for he is Lord of lords and King of kings and they that are
with him are called and chosen and faithful

1715 And he saith unto me The waters which thou sawest where the
whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues

1716 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall
hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat
her flesh and burn her with fire

1717 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to
agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of God
shall be fulfilled

1718 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city which
reigneth over the kings of the earth

181 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven
having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory

182 And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the
great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils
and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird

183 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication
with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
abundance of her delicacies

184 And I heard another voice from heaven saying Come out of her
my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive
not of her plagues

185 For her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered
her iniquities

186 Reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double
according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her
double

187 How much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so
much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a
queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow

188 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning
and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is
the Lord God who judgeth her

189 And the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and
lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when
they shall see the smoke of her burning 1810 Standing afar off for
the fear of her torment saying Alas alas that great city Babylon
that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come

1811 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her
for no man buyeth their merchandise any more 1812 The merchandise of
gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen
and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner
vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of
brass and iron and marble 1813 And cinnamon and odours and
ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and
wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves
and souls of men

1814 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from
thee and thou shalt find them no more at all

1815 The merchants of these things which were made rich by her
shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing
1816 And saying Alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine
linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls  1817 For in one hour so great riches is come to
nought And every shipmaster and all the company in ships and
sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off 1818 And cried
when they saw the smoke of her burning saying What city is like unto
this great city  1819 And they cast dust on their heads and cried
weeping and wailing saying Alas alas that great city wherein were
made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness
for in one hour is she made desolate

1820 Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and
prophets for God hath avenged you on her

1821 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and
cast it into the sea saying Thus with violence shall that great city
Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all

1822 And the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and
trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman
