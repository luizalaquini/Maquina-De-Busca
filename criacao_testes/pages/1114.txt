Lord Frey’s son Olyvar will be coming with us she went on He is to serve as your personal squire His father would like to see him knighted in good time

A squire He shrugged Fine that’s fine if he’s—

Also if your sister Arya is returned to us safely it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder’s youngest son Elmar when the two of them come of age

Robb looked nonplussed Arya won’t like that one bit

And you are to wed one of his daughters once the fighting is done she finished His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer He has a number he thinks might be suitable

To his credit Robb did not flinch I see

Do you consent

Can I refuse

Not if you wish to cross

I consent Robb said solemnly He had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment Boys might play with swords but it took a lord to make a marriage pact knowing what it meant

They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river The double column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake slithering across the courtyard into the keep and over the bridge to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank

Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent with her son and her uncle Ser Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey Behind followed nine tenths of their horse knights lancers freeriders and mounted bowmen It took hours for them all to cross Afterward Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass the glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the Water Tower

The larger part of the northern host pikes and archers and great masses of men-at-arms on foot remained upon the east bank under the command of Roose Bolton Robb had commanded him to continue the march south to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin

For good or ill her son had thrown the dice





JON

Are you well Snow Lord Mormont asked scowling

Well his raven squawked Well

I am my lord Jon lied… loudly as if that could make it true And you

Mormont frowned A dead man tried to kill me How well could I be He scratched under his chin His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire and he’d hacked it off The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old disreputable and grumpy You do not look well How is your hand

Healing Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow At the time he’d felt nothing the agony had come after His cracked red skin oozed fluid and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers big as roaches The maester says I’ll have scars but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before

A scarred hand is nothing On the Wall you’ll be wearing gloves often as not

As you say my lord It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon it was the rest of it Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy yet even so the pain had been hideous At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame burning day and night Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed whimpering from the pain And when at last he did sleep he dreamt and that was even worse In the dream the corpse he fought had blue eyes black hands and his father’s face but he dared not tell Mormont that

Dywen and Hake returned last night the Old Bear said They found no sign of your uncle no more than the others did

I know Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends and the failure of the rangers’ search had been all the men had been talking of

You know Mormont grumbled How is it that everyone knows everything around here He did not seem to expect an answer It would seem there were only the two of… of those creatures whatever they were I will not call them men And thank the gods for that Any more and… well that doesn’t bear thinking of There will be more though I can feel it in these old bones of mine and Maester Aemon agrees The cold winds are rising Summer is at an end and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen

Winter is coming The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now My lord he asked hesitantly it’s said there was a bird last night…

There was What of it

I had hoped for some word of my father

Father taunted the old raven bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont’s shoulders Father

The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut but the raven hopped up on his head fluttered its wings and flew across the chamber to light above a window Grief and noise Mormont grumbled That’s all they’re good for ravens Why I put up with that pestilential bird… if there was news of Lord Eddard don’t you think I would have sent for you Bastard or no you’re still his blood The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy It seems he’s been removed from the Kingsguard They gave his place to that black dog Clegane and now Selmy’s wanted for treason The fools sent some watchmen to seize him but he slew two of them and escaped Mormont snorted leaving no doubt of his view of men who’d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls and a boy sits the Iron Throne he said in disgust

The raven laughed shrilly Boy boy boy boy

Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear’s best hope Jon remembered if he had fallen what chance was there that Mormont’s letter would be heeded He curled his hand into a fist Pain shot through his burned fingers What of my sisters

The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls He gave an irritated shrug Perhaps they never got my letter Aemon sent two copies with his best birds but who can say More like Pycelle did not deign to reply It would not be the first time nor the last I fear we count for less than nothing in King’s Landing They tell us what they want us to know and that’s little enough

And you tell me what you want me to know and that’s less Jon thought resentfully His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war yet no word of that had been breathed to him… save by Samwell Tarly who’d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret all the time saying how he shouldn’t Doubtless they thought his brother’s war was none of his concern It troubled him more than he could say Robb was marching and he was not No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now with his new brothers on the Wall he still felt craven

Corn the raven was crying Corn corn

Oh be quiet the Old Bear told it Snow how soon does Maester Aemon say you’ll have use of that hand back

Soon Jon replied

Good On the table between them Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver Here You’ll be ready for this then

The raven flapped down and landed on the table strutting toward the sword head cocked curiously Jon hesitated He had no inkling what this meant My lord

The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip Well dry leather and old wood what could you expect The blade now… you’d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks I had the rest made anew Take it

Take it echoed his raven preening Take it take it

Awkwardly Jon took the sword in hand His left hand his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes

The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf’s head with chips of garnet set into the eyes The grip was virgin leather soft and black as yet unstained by sweat or blood The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to tapered to thrust as well as slash with three fullers deeply incised in the metal Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword this was a hand-and-a-halfer sometimes named a bastard sword Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before When Jon turned it sideways he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again This is Valyrian steel my lord he said wonderingly His father had let him handle Ice often enough he knew the look the feel

It is the Old Bear told him It was my father’s sword and his father’s before him The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black

He is giving me his son’s sword Jon could scarcely believe it The blade was exquisitely balanced The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light Your son—

My son brought dishonor to House Mormont but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled My sister returned it to my keeping but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah’s shame so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber The original pommel was a bear’s head silver yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable For you I thought a white wolf more apt One of our builders is a fair stonecarver

When Jon had been Bran’s age he had dreamed of doing great deeds as boys always did The details of his feats changed with every dreaming but quite often he imagined saving his father’s life Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark and place Ice in his hand Even then he had known it was only a child’s folly no bastard could ever hope to wield a father’s sword Even the memory shamed him What kind of man stole his own brother’s birthright I have no right to this he thought no more than to Ice He twitched his burned fingers feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin My lord you honor me but—

Spare me your but’s boy Lord Mormont interrupted I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours You fought bravely… and more to the point you thought quickly Fire Yes damn it We ought to have known We ought to have remembered The Long Night has come before Oh eight thousand years is a good while to be sure… yet if the Night’s Watch does not remember who will
