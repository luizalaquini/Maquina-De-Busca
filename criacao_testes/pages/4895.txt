anointed him to sanctify him

813 And Moses brought Aarons sons and put coats upon them and
girded them with girdles and put bonnets upon them as the LORD
commanded Moses

814 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering and Aaron and
his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin
offering

815 And he slew it and Moses took the blood and put it upon the
horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the
altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified
it to make reconciliation upon it

816 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul
above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and Moses burned
it upon the altar

817 But the bullock and his hide his flesh and his dung he burnt
with fire without the camp as the LORD commanded Moses

818 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering and Aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram

819 And he killed it and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about

820 And he cut the ram into pieces and Moses burnt the head and the
pieces and the fat

821 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water and Moses burnt
the whole ram upon the altar it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet
savour and an offering made by fire unto the LORD as the LORD
commanded Moses

822 And he brought the other ram the ram of consecration and Aaron
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram

823 And he slew it and Moses took of the blood of it and put it
upon the tip of Aarons right ear and upon the thumb of his right
hand and upon the great toe of his right foot

824 And he brought Aarons sons and Moses put of the blood upon the
tip of their right ear and upon the thumbs of their right hands and
upon the great toes of their right feet and Moses sprinkled the blood
upon the altar round about

825 And he took the fat and the rump and all the fat that was upon
the inwards and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys and
their fat and the right shoulder 826 And out of the basket of
unleavened bread that was before the LORD he took one unleavened
cake and a cake of oiled bread and one wafer and put them on the
fat and upon the right shoulder 827 And he put all upon Aarons
hands and upon his sons hands and waved them for a wave offering
before the LORD

828 And Moses took them from off their hands and burnt them on the
altar upon the burnt offering they were consecrations for a sweet
savour it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD

829 And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering
before the LORD for of the ram of consecration it was Moses part as
the LORD commanded Moses

830 And Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was
upon the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments
and upon his sons and upon his sons garments with him and
sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons
garments with him

831 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons Boil the flesh at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the
bread that is in the basket of consecrations as I commanded saying
Aaron and his sons shall eat it

832 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
burn with fire

833 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation in seven days until the days of your consecration be at
an end for seven days shall he consecrate you

834 As he hath done this day so the LORD hath commanded to do to
make an atonement for you

835 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the
LORD that ye die not for so I am commanded

836 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by
the hand of Moses

91 And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and
his sons and the elders of Israel 92 And he said unto Aaron Take
thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering
without blemish and offer them before the LORD

93 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak saying Take ye
a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of
