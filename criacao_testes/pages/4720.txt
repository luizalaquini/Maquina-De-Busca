Maybe we should try another castle Meera said to her brother Maybe we could get through the gate somewhere else I could go scout if you wanted I’d make better time by myself

Bran shook his head If you go east there’s Deep Lake then Queensgate West is Icemark But they’ll be the same only smaller All the gates are sealed except the ones at Castle Black Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower

Hodor said Hodor to that and the Reeds exchanged a look At least I should climb to the top of the Wall Meera decided Maybe I’ll see something up there

What could you hope to see Jojen asked

Something said Meera and for once she was adamant

It should be me Bran raised his head to look up at the Wall and imagined himself climbing inch by inch squirming his fingers into cracks in the ice and kicking footholds with his toes That made him smile in spite of everything the dreams and the wildlings and Jon and everything He had climbed the walls of Winterfell when he was little and all the towers too but none of them had been so high and they were only stone The Wall could look like stone all grey and pitted but then the clouds would break and the sun would hit it differently and all at once it would transform and stand there white and blue and glittering It was the end of the world Old Nan always said On the other side were monsters and giants and ghouls but they could not pass so long as the Wall stood strong I want to stand on top with Meera Bran thought I want to stand on top and see

But he was a broken boy with useless legs so all he could do was watch from below as Meera went up in his stead

She wasn’t really climbing the way he used to climb She was only walking up some steps that the Night’s Watch had hewn hundreds and thousands of years ago He remembered Maester Luwin saying the Nightfort was the only castle where the steps had been cut from the ice of the Wall itself Or maybe it had been Uncle Benjen The newer castles had wooden steps or stone ones or long ramps of earth and gravel Ice is too treacherous It was his uncle who’d told him that He said that the outer surface of the Wall wept icy tears sometimes though the core inside stayed frozen hard as rock The steps must have melted and refrozen a thousand times since the last black brothers left the castle and every time they did they shrunk a little and got smoother and rounder and more treacherous

And smaller It’s almost like the Wall was swallowing them back into itself Meera Reed was very surefooted but even so she was going slowly moving from nub to nub In two places where the steps were hardly there at all she got down on all fours It will be worse when she comes down Bran thought watching Even so he wished it was him up there When she reached the top crawling up the icy knobs that were all that remained of the highest steps Meera vanished from his sight

When will she come down Bran asked Jojen

When she is ready She will want to have a good look    at the Wall and what’s beyond We should do the same down here

Hodor said Hodor doubtfully

We might find something Jojen insisted

Or something might find us Bran couldn’t say it though he did not want Jojen to think he was craven

So they went exploring Jojen Reed leading Bran in his basket on Hodor’s back Summer padding by their side Once the direwolf bolted through a dark door and returned a moment later with a grey rat between his teeth The Rat Cook Bran thought but it was the wrong color and only as big as a cat The Rat Cook was white and almost as huge as a sow   

There were a lot of dark doors in the Nightfort and a lot of rats Bran could hear them scurrying through the vaults and cellars and the maze of pitch-black tunnels that connected them Jojen wanted to go poking around down there but Hodor said Hodor to that and Bran said No There were worse things than rats down in the dark beneath the Nightfort

This seems an old place Jojen said as they walked down a gallery where the sunlight fell in dusty shafts through empty windows

Twice as old as Castle Black Bran said remembering It was the first castle on the Wall and the largest But it had also been the first abandoned all the way back in the time of the Old King Even then it had been three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain Good Queen Alysanne had suggested that the Watch replace it with a smaller newer castle at a spot only seven miles east where the Wall curved along the shore of a beautiful green lake Deep Lake had been paid for by the queen’s jewels and built by the men the Old King had sent north and the black brothers had abandoned the Nightfort to the rats

That was two centuries past though Now Deep Lake stood as empty as the castle it had replaced and the Nightfort   

There are ghosts here Bran said Hodor had heard all the stories before but Jojen might not have Old ghosts from before the Old King even before Aegon the Dragon seventy-nine deserters who went south to be outlaws One was Lord Ryswell’s youngest son so when they reached the barrowlands they sought shelter at his castle but Lord Ryswell took them captive and returned them to the Nightfort The Lord Commander had holes hewn in the top of the Wall and he put the deserters in them and sealed them up alive in the ice They have spears and horns and they all face north The seventy-nine sentinels they’re called They left their posts in life so in death their watch goes on forever Years later when Lord Ryswell was old and dying he had himself carried to the Nightfort so he could take the black and stand beside his son He’d sent him back to the Wall for honor’s sake but he loved him still so he came to share his watch

They spent half the day poking through the castle Some of the towers had fallen down and others looked unsafe but they climbed the bell tower the bells were gone and the rookery the birds were gone Beneath the brewhouse they found a vault of huge oaken casks that boomed hollowly when Hodor knocked on them They found a library the shelves and bins had collapsed the books were gone and rats were everywhere They found a dank and dim-lit dungeon with cells enough to hold five hundred captives but when Bran grabbed hold of one of the rusted bars it broke off in his hand Only one crumbling wall remained of the great hall the bathhouse seemed to be sinking into the ground and a huge thornbush had conquered the practice yard outside the armory where black brothers had once labored with spear and shield and sword The armory and the forge still stood however though cobwebs rats and dust had taken the places of blades bellows and anvil Sometimes Summer would hear sounds that Bran seemed deaf to or bare his teeth at nothing the fur on the back of his neck bristling    but the Rat Cook never put in an appearance nor the seventy-nine sentinels nor Mad Axe Bran was much relieved Maybe it is only a ruined empty castle

By the time Meera returned the sun was only a sword’s breath above the western hills What did you see her brother Jojen asked her

I saw the haunted forest she said in a wistful tone Hills rising wild as far as the eye can see covered with trees that no axe has ever touched I saw the sunlight glinting off a lake and clouds sweeping in from the west I saw patches of old snow and icicles long as pikes I even saw an eagle circling I think he saw me too I waved at him

Did you see a way down asked Jojen

She shook her head No It’s a sheer drop and the ice is so smooth    I might be able to make the descent if I had a good rope and an axe to chop out handholds but   

   but not us Jojen finished

No his sister agreed Are you sure this is the place you saw in your dream Maybe we have the wrong castle

No This is the castle There is a gate here

Yes thought Bran but it’s blocked by stone and ice

As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan’s stories the tale of Night’s King He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night’s Watch she said a warrior who knew no fear And that was the fault in him she would add for all men must know fear A woman was his downfall a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars Fearing nothing he chased her and caught her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well

He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will For thirteen years they had ruled Night’s King and his corpse queen till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage After his fall when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others all records of Night’s King had been destroyed his very name forbidden

Some say he was a Bolton Old Nan would always end Some say a Magnar out of Skagos some say Umber Flint or Norrey Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came He never was He was a Stark the brother of the man who brought him down She always pinched Bran on the nose then he would never forget it He was a Stark of Winterfell and who can say Mayhaps his name was Brandon Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room

No Bran thought but he walked in this castle where we’ll sleep tonight He did not like that notion very much at all Night’s King was only a man by light of day Old Nan would always say but the night was his to rule And it’s getting dark

The Reeds decided that they would sleep in the kitchens a stone octagon with a broken dome It looked to offer better shelter than most of the other buildings even though a crooked weirwood had burst up through the slate floor beside the huge central well stretching slantwise toward the hole in the roof its bone-white branches reaching for the sun It was a queer kind of tree skinnier than any other weirwood that Bran had ever seen and faceless as well but it made him feel as if the old gods were with him here at least

That was the only thing he liked about the kitchens though The roof was mostly there so they’d be dry if it rained again but he didn’t think they would ever get warm here You could feel the cold seeping up through the slate floor Bran did not like the shadows either or the huge brick ovens that surrounded them like open mouths or the rusted meat hooks or the scars and stains he saw in the butcher’s block along one wall That was where the Rat Cook chopped the prince to pieces he knew and he baked the pie in one of these ovens

The well was the thing he liked the least though It was a good twelve feet across all stone with steps built into its side circling down and down into darkness The walls were damp and covered with niter but none of them could see the water at the bottom not even Meera with her sharp hunter’s eyes Maybe it doesn’t have a bottom Bran said uncertainly

Hodor peered over the knee-high lip of the well and said HODOR The word echoed down the well Hodorhodorhodorhodor fainter and fainter hodorhodorhodorhodor until it was less than a whisper Hodor looked startled Then he laughed and bent to scoop a broken piece of slate off the floor

Hodor don’t said Bran but too late Hodor tossed the slate over the edge You shouldn’t have done that You don’t know what’s down there You might have hurt something or    or woken something up

Hodor looked at him innocently Hodor

Far far far below they heard the sound as the stone found water It wasn’t a splash not truly It was more a gulp as if whatever was below had opened a quivering gelid mouth to swallow Hodor’s stone Faint echoes traveled up the well and for a moment Bran thought he heard something moving thrashing about in the water Maybe we shouldn’t stay here he said uneasily

By the well asked Meera Or in the Nightfort

Yes said Bran

She laughed and sent Hodor out to gather wood Summer went too It was almost dark by then and the direwolf wanted to hunt

Hodor returned alone with both arms full of deadwood and broken branches Jojen Reed took his flint and knife and set about lighting a fire while Meera boned the fish she’d caught at the last stream they’d crossed Bran wondered how many years had passed since there had last been a supper cooked in the kitchens of the Nightfort He wondered who had cooked it too though maybe it was better not to know

When the flames were blazing nicely Meera put the fish on At least it’s not a meat pie The Rat Cook had cooked the son of the Andal king in a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms lots of pepper and salt a rasher of bacon and a dark red Dornish wine Then he served him to his father who praised the taste and had a second slice Afterward the gods transformed the cook into a monstrous white rat who could only eat his own young He had roamed the Nightfort ever since devouring his children but still his hunger was not sated It was not for murder that the gods cursed him Old Nan said nor for serving the Andal king his son in a pie A man has a right to vengeance But he slew a guest beneath his roof and that the gods cannot forgive

We should sleep Jojen said solemnly after they were full The fire was burning low He stirred it with a stick Perhaps I’ll have another green dream to show us the way

Hodor was already curled up and snoring lightly From time to time he thrashed beneath his cloak and whimpered something that might have been Hodor Bran wriggled closer to the fire The warmth felt good and the soft crackling of flames soothed him but sleep would not come Outside the wind was sending armies of dead leaves marching across the courtyards to scratch faintly at the doors and windows The sounds made him think of Old Nan’s stories He could almost hear the ghostly sentinels calling to each other atop the Wall and winding their ghostly warhorns Pale moonlight slanted down through the hole in the dome painting the branches of the weirwood as they strained up toward the roof It looked as if the tree was trying to catch the moon and drag it down into the well Old gods Bran prayed if you hear me don’t send a dream tonight Or if you do make it a good dream The gods made no answer

Bran made himself close his eyes Maybe he even slept some or maybe he was just drowsing floating the way you do when you are half awake and half asleep trying not to think about Mad Axe or the Rat Cook or the thing that came in the night

Then he heard the noise

His eyes opened What was that He held his breath Did I dream it Was I having a stupid nightmare He didn’t want to wake Meera and Jojen for a bad dream but    there    a soft scuffling sound far off    Leaves it’s leaves rattling off the walls outside and rustling together    or the wind it could be the wind    The sound wasn’t coming from outside though Bran felt the hairs on his arm start to rise The sound’s inside it’s in here with us and it’s getting louder He pushed himself up onto an elbow listening There was wind and blowing leaves as well but this was something else Footsteps Someone was coming this way Something was coming this way
