Then I’ll pay

With what Arya wondered The outlaws had taken Clegane’s gold but maybe Lord Beric had left him some silver and copper A ferry ride shouldn’t cost more than a few coppers…

The ferrymen were talking again Finally the bent-backed one turned away and gave a shout Six more men appeared pulling up hoods to keep the rain off their heads Still more squirmed out the holdfast window and leapt down onto the deck Half of them looked enough like the bent-backed man to be his kin Some of them undid the chains and took up long poles while the others slid heavy wide-bladed oars through the locks The ferry swung about and began to creep slowly toward the shallows oars stroking smoothly on either side Sandor Clegane rode down the hill to meet it

When the aft end of the boat slammed into the hillside the ferrymen opened a wide door beneath the carved horse’s head and extended a heavy oaken plank Stranger balked at the water’s edge but the Hound put his heels into the courser’s flank and urged him up the gangway The bent-backed man was waiting for them on deck Wet enough for you ser he asked smiling

The Hound’s mouth gave a twitch I need your boat not your bloody wit He dismounted and pulled Arya down beside him One of the boatmen reached for Stranger’s bridle I wouldn’t Clegane said as the horse kicked The man leapt back slipped on the rain-slick deck and crashed onto his arse cursing

The ferryman with the bent back wasn’t smiling any longer We can get you across he said sourly It will cost you a gold piece Another for the horse A third for the boy

Three dragons Clegane gave a bark of laughter For three dragons I should own the bloody ferry

Last year might be you could But with this river I’ll need extra hands on the poles and oars just to see we don’t get swept a hundred miles out to sea Here’s your choice Three dragons or you teach that hellhorse how to walk on water

I like an honest brigand Have it your way Three dragons… when you put us ashore safe on the north bank

I’ll have them now or we don’t go The man thrust out a thick callused hand palm up

Clegane rattled his longsword to loosen the blade in the scabbard Here’s your choice Gold on the north bank or steel on the south

The ferryman looked up at the Hound’s face Arya could tell that he didn’t like what he saw there He had a dozen men behind him strong men with oars and hardwood poles in their hands but none of them were rushing forward to help him Together they could overwhelm Sandor Clegane though he’d likely kill three or four of them before they took him down How do I know you’re good for it the bent-backed man asked after a moment

He’s not she wanted to shout Instead she bit her lip

Knight’s honor the Hound said unsmiling

He’s not even a knight She did not say that either

That will do The ferryman spat Come on then we can have you across before dark Tie the horse up I don’t want him spooking when we’re under way There’s a brazier in the cabin if you and your son want to get warm

I’m not his stupid son said Arya furiously That was even worse than being taken for a boy She was so angry that she might have told them who she really was only Sandor Clegane grabbed her by the back of the collar and hoisted her one-handed off the deck How many times do I need to tell you to shut your bloody mouth He shook her so hard her teeth rattled then let her fall Get in there and get dry like the man said

Arya did as she was told The big iron brazier was glowing red filling the room with a sullen suffocating heat It felt pleasant to stand beside it to warm her hands and dry off a little bit but as soon as she felt the deck move under her feet she slipped back out through the forward door

The two-headed horse eased slowly through the shallows picking its way between the chimneys and rooftops of drowned Harroway A dozen men labored at the oars while four more used the long poles to push off whenever they came too close to a rock a tree or a sunken house The bent-backed man had the rudder Rain pattered against the smooth planks of the deck and splashed off the tall carved horseheads fore and aft Arya was getting soaked again but she didn’t care She wanted to see The man with the crossbow still stood in the window of the roundtower she saw His eyes followed her as the ferry slid by underneath She wondered if he was this Lord Roote that the Hound had mentioned He doesn’t look much like a lord But then she didn’t look much like a lady either

Once they were beyond the town and out in the river proper the current grew much stronger Through the grey haze of rain Arya could make out a tall stone pillar on the far shore that surely marked the ferry landing but no sooner had she seen it than she realized that they were being pushed away from it downstream The oarsmen were rowing more vigorously now fighting the rage of the river Leaves and broken branches swirled past as fast as if they’d been fired from a scorpion The men with the poles leaned out and shoved away anything that came too close It was windier out here too Whenever she turned to look upstream Arya got a face full of blowing rain Stranger was screaming and kicking as the deck moved underfoot

If I jumped over the side the river would wash me away before the Hound even knew that I was gone She looked back over a shoulder and saw Sandor Clegane struggling with his frightened horse trying to calm him She would never have a better chance to get away from him I might drown though Jon used to say that she swam like a fish but even a fish might have trouble in this river Still drowning might be better than King’s Landing She thought about Joffrey and crept up to the prow The river was murky brown with mud and lashed by rain looking more like soup than water Arya wondered how cold it would be I couldn’t get much wetter than I am now She put a hand on the rail

But a sudden shout snapped her head about before she could leap The ferrymen were rushing forward poles in hand For a moment she did not understand what was happening Then she saw it an uprooted tree huge and dark coming straight at them A tangle of roots and limbs poked up out of the water as it came like the reaching arms of a great kraken The oarsmen were backing water frantically trying to avoid a collision that could capsize them or stove their hull in The old man had wrenched the rudder about and the horse at the prow was swinging downstream but too slowly Glistening brown and black the tree rushed toward them like a battering ram

It could not have been more than ten feet from their prow when two of the boatmen somehow caught it with their long poles One snapped and the long splintering craaaack made it sound as if the ferry were breaking up beneath them But the second man managed to give the trunk a hard shove just enough to deflect it away from them The tree swept past the ferry with inches to spare its branches scrabbling like claws against the horsehead Only just when it seemed as if they were clear one of the monster’s upper limbs dealt them a glancing thump The ferry seemed to shudder and Arya slipped landing painfully on one knee The man with the broken pole was not so lucky She heard him shout as he stumbled over the side Then the raging brown water closed over him and he was gone in the time it took Arya to climb back to her feet One of the other boatmen snatched up a coil of rope but there was no one to throw it to

Maybe he’ll wash up someplace downstream Arya tried to tell herself but the thought had a hollow ring She had lost all desire to go swimming When Sandor Clegane shouted at her to get back inside before he beat her bloody she went meekly The ferry was fighting to turn back on course by then against a river that wanted nothing more than to carry it down to the sea

When they finally came ashore it was a good two miles downriver of their usual landing The boat slammed into the bank so hard that another pole snapped and Arya almost lost her feet again Sandor Clegane lifted her onto Stranger’s back as if she weighed no more than a doll The boatmen stared at them with dull exhausted eyes all but the bent-backed man who held his hand out Six dragons he demanded Three for the passage and three for the man I lost

Sandor Clegane rummaged in his pouch and shoved a crumpled wad of parchment into the boatman’s palm There Take ten

Ten The ferryman was confused What’s this now
