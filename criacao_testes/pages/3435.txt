Jon pulled himself to his feet Donal Noye stood glowering at them The yard is for fighting the armorer said Keep your quarrels out of my armory or I’ll make them my quarrels You won’t like that

Toad sat on the floor gingerly feeling the back of his head His fingers came away bloody He tried to kill me

’S true I saw it one of the rapers put in

He broke my wrist Grenn said again holding it out to Noye for inspection

The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances A bruise Perhaps a sprain Maester Aemon will give you a salve Go with him Todder that head wants looking after The rest of you return to your cells Not you Snow You stay

Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left oblivious to the looks they gave him the silent promises of future retribution His arm was throbbing

The Watch has need of every man it can get Donal Noye said when they were alone Even men like Toad You won’t win any honors killing him

Jon’s anger flared He said my mother was—

—a whore I heard him What of it

Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores Jon said icily His honor—

—did not prevent him from fathering a bastard Did it

Jon was cold with rage Can I go

You go when I tell you to go

Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier until Noye took him under the chin thick fingers twisting his head around Look at me when I’m talking to you boy

Jon looked The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match His nose was flat and broad and he always seemed in need of a shave The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword Words won’t make your mother a whore She was what she was and nothing Toad says can change that You know we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores

Not my mother Jon thought stubbornly He knew nothing of his mother Eddard Stark would not talk of her Yet he dreamed of her at times so often that he could almost see her face In his dreams she was beautiful and highborn and her eyes were kind

You think you had it hard being a high lord’s bastard the armorer went on That boy Jeren is a septon’s get and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea

I don’t care Jon said I don’t care about them and I don’t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it I hate it here It’s too… it’s cold

Yes Cold and hard and mean that’s the Wall and the men who walk it Not like the stories your wet nurse told you Well piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse This is the way it is and you’re here for life same as the rest of us

Life Jon repeated bitterly The armorer could talk about life He’d had one He’d only taken the black after he’d lost an arm at the siege of Storm’s End Before that he’d smithed for Stannis Baratheon the king’s brother He’d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other he’d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles They said it was Donal Noye who’d forged King Robert’s warhammer the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident He’d done all the things that Jon would never do and then when he was old well past thirty he’d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off Only then crippled had Donal Noye come to the Wall when his life was all but over

Yes life Noye said A long life or a short one it’s up to you Snow The road you’re walking one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night

They’re not my brothers Jon snapped They hate me because I’m better than they are

No They hate you because you act like you’re better than they are They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he’s a lordling The armorer leaned close You’re no lordling Remember that You’re a Snow not a Stark You’re a bastard and a bully

A bully Jon almost choked on the word The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away They were the ones who came after me Four of them

Four that you’ve humiliated in the yard Four who are probably afraid of you I’ve watched you fight It’s not training with you Put a good edge on your sword and they’d be dead meat you know it I know it they know it You leave them nothing You shame them Does that make you proud

Jon hesitated He did feel proud when he won Why shouldn’t he But the armorer was taking that away too making it sound as if he were doing something wrong They’re all older than me he said defensively

Older and bigger and stronger that’s the truth I’ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell though Who was he some old knight

Ser Rodrik Cassel Jon said warily There was a trap here He felt it closing around him

Donal Noye leaned forward into Jon’s face Now think on this boy None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley What they know of fighting they learned between decks in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here but I promise you not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword His look was grim So how do you like the taste of your victories now Lord Snow

Don’t call me that Jon said sharply but the force had gone out of his anger Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty I never… I didn’t think…

Best you start thinking Noye warned him That or sleep with a dagger by your bed Now go

By the time Jon left the armory it was almost midday The sun had broken through the clouds He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight Even after all these weeks the sight of it still gave him the shivers Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it covering it like a film and it often seemed a pale grey the color of an overcast sky… but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day it shone alive with light a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky

The largest structure ever built by the hands of man Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance And beyond a doubt the most useless Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer You could see it from miles off a pale blue line across the northern horizon stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance immense and unbroken This is the end of the world it seemed to say

When they finally spied Castle Black its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow beneath the vast wall of ice The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell no true castle at all Lacking walls it could not be defended not from the south or east or west but it was only the north that concerned the Night’s Watch and to the north loomed the Wall Almost seven hundred feet high it stood three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there like the skeletons of great birds and among them walked men in black as small as ants

As he stood outside the armory looking up Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad when he’d seen it for the first time The Wall was like that Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world It was older than the Seven Kingdoms and when he stood beneath it and looked up it made Jon dizzy He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him as if it were about to topple and somehow Jon knew that if it fell the world fell with it

Makes you wonder what lies beyond a familiar voice said

Jon looked around Lannister I didn’t see—I mean I thought I was alone

Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear There’s much to be said for taking people unawares You never know what you might learn

You won’t learn anything from me Jon told him He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended As the queen’s own brother Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night’s Watch The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King’s Tower—so-called though no king had visited it for a hundred years—and Lannister dined at Mormont’s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers

Oh I learn things everywhere I go The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick As I was saying… why is it that when one man builds a wall the next man immediately needs to know what’s on the other side He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes You do want to know what’s on the other side don’t you

It’s nothing special Jon said He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest wanted to fight Mance Rayder’s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted The rangers say it’s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes with lots of snow and ice

And the grumkins and the snarks Tyrion said Let us not forget them Lord Snow or else what’s that big thing for

Don’t call me Lord Snow

The dwarf lifted an eyebrow Would you rather be called the Imp Let them see that their words can cut you and you’ll never be free of the mockery If they want to give you a name take it make it your own Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore He gestured with his stick Come walk with me They’ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now and I could do with a bowl of something hot

Jon was hungry too so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf’s awkward waddling steps The wind was rising and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them and in the distance a heavy shutter banging over and over forgotten Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them

I don’t see your wolf Lannister said as they walked

I chain him up in the old stables when we’re training They board all the horses in the east stables now so no one bothers him The rest of the time he stays with me My sleeping cell is in Hardin’s Tower

That’s the one with the broken battlement no Shattered stone in the yard below and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night’s drinking I thought all those buildings had been abandoned

Jon shrugged No one cares where you sleep Most of the old keeps are empty you can pick any cell you want Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons Now it was home to a tenth that number and parts of it were falling into ruin

Tyrion Lannister’s laughter steamed in the cold air I’ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons before your tower collapses
