It has been shown Gray and Markel 1975 that the four-multiplier
configuration has some stability properties which are not shared by other
digital filter structures

Gray Markel 1975 Normalized digital filter structure

When a linear predictive filter is used for synthesis the parameters
of the filter em the k-parameters in the case of lattice filters
and the a-parameters in the case of direct ones em change with time
It is usually rather difficult to guarantee stability in the case of
time-varying filter parameters but some guarantees can be made for a
chain of four-multiplier lattices  Furthermore if the input is a
discrete delta function the cumulative energies at each stage of the
lattice are the same and so maximum dynamic range will be achieved
for the whole filter if each section is implemented with the same
word size
rh Lattice analysis
It is quite easy to construct a filter which is inverse to
a single-stage lattice
The structure of Figure 612a does the job
Ignore for a moment
the dashed lines connecting Figure 612a and b  Its matrix transfer
function is

Notice that this is exactly the same as the transfer function of the
synthesis lattice of Figure 69 which is reproduced
in Figure 612b except that the Xs and Ys are reversed

Hence if the filters of Figures 612a and b were connected together
as shown by the dashed lines they
would cancel each other out and the overall transfer would be unity

Actually such a connection is not possible in physical terms
for although the upper paths can be joined together the lower ones can not
The right-hand lower point of Figure 612a is an
ul
output
terminal and so is the left-hand lower one of Figure 612b  However
there is no need to envisage a physical connection of the lower paths
It is sufficient for cancellation just to assume that the signals at both
of the points turn out to be the same
pp
And they do
The general case of a p-stage analysis lattice
connected to a p-stage synthesis
lattice is shown in Figure 613
FC Figure 613
Notice that the forward and backward paths are connected together at both
of the extreme ends of the system
It is not difficult to show that under these
conditions the signal at the lower righthand
terminal of the analysis chain will equal that at the lower lefthand
terminal of the synthesis chain even though they are not connected
provided the upper terminals are connected together as shown by the dashed
line
Of course the reflection coefficients  k sub 1 k sub 2 
k sub p  in the analysis lattice must equal those in the synthesis
lattice and as Figure 613 shows the order is reversed in the synthesis
lattice
Successive analysis and synthesis sections pair off working from
the middle outwards  At each stage the sections cancel each other out
giving a unit transfer function as demonstrated above
