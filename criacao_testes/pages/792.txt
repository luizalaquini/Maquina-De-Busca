of the least of these ye did it not to me

2546 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the
righteous into life eternal

261 And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings
he said unto his disciples 262 Ye know that after two days is the
feast of the passover and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified

263 Then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and
the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was
called Caiaphas 264 And consulted that they might take Jesus by
subtilty and kill him

265 But they said Not on the feast day lest there be an uproar
among the people

266 Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
267 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat

268 But when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying To
what purpose is this waste  269 For this ointment might have been
sold for much and given to the poor

2610 When Jesus understood it he said unto them Why trouble ye the
woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me

2611 For ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always

2612 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it
for my burial

2613 Verily I say unto you Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done
be told for a memorial of her

2614 Then one of the twelve called Judas Iscariot went unto the
chief priests 2615 And said unto them What will ye give me and I
will deliver him unto you And they covenanted with him for thirty
pieces of silver

2616 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him

2617 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
came to Jesus saying unto him Where wilt thou that we prepare for
thee to eat the passover  2618 And he said Go into the city to such
a man and say unto him The Master saith My time is at hand I will
keep the passover at thy house with my disciples

2619 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made
ready the passover

2620 Now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve

2621 And as they did eat he said Verily I say unto you that one of
you shall betray me

2622 And they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them
to say unto him Lord is it I  2623 And he answered and said He
that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me

2624 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man
if he had not been born

2625 Then Judas which betrayed him answered and said Master is it
I  He said unto him Thou hast said

2626 And as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and
brake it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is
my body

2627 And he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them
saying Drink ye all of it 2628 For this is my blood of the new
testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins

2629 But I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers
kingdom

2630 And when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
Olives

2631 Then saith Jesus unto them All ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad

2632 But after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee

2633 Peter answered and said unto him Though all men shall be
offended because of thee yet will I never be offended

2634 Jesus said unto him Verily I say unto thee That this night
before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice

2635 Peter said unto him Though I should die with thee yet will I
not deny thee Likewise also said all the disciples

2636 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and
