But the gate was a crooked tunnel through the ice smaller than any castle gate in the Seven Kingdoms so narrow that rangers must lead their garrons through single file Three iron grates closed the inner passage each locked and chained and protected by a murder hole The outer door was old oak nine inches thick and studded with iron not easy to break through But Mance has mammoths he reminded himself and giants as well

Must be cold down there said Noye What say we warm them up lads A dozen jars of lamp oil had been lined up on the precipice Pyp ran down the line with a torch setting them alight Owen the Oaf followed shoving them over the edge one by one Tongues of pale yellow fire swirled around the jars as they plunged downward When the last was gone Grenn kicked loose the chocks on a barrel of pitch and sent it rumbling and rolling over the edge as well The sounds below changed to shouts and screams sweet music to their ears

Yet still the drums beat on the trebuchets shuddered and thumped and the sound of skinpipes came wafting through the night like the songs of strange fierce birds Septon Cellador began to sing as well his voice tremulous and thick with wine

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know   

Donal Noye rounded on him Any man here stays his sword I’ll chuck his puckered arse right off this Wall    starting with you Septon Archers Do we have any bloody archers

Here said Satin

And here said Mully But how can I find a target It’s black as the inside of a pig’s belly Where are they

Noye pointed north Loose enough arrows might be you’ll find a few At least you’ll make them fretful He looked around the ring of firelit faces I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if they break the gate More than ten stepped forward and the smith picked his four Jon you have the Wall till I return

For a moment Jon thought he had misheard It had sounded as if Noye were leaving him in command My lord

Lord I’m a blacksmith I said the Wall is yours

There are older men Jon wanted to say better men I am still as green as summer grass I’m wounded and I stand accused of desertion His mouth had gone bone dry Aye he managed

Afterward it would seem to Jon Snow as if he’d dreamt that night Side by side with the straw soldiers with longbows or crossbows clutched in half-frozen hands his archers launched a hundred flights of arrows against men they never saw From time to time a wildling arrow came flying back in answer He sent men to the smaller catapults and filled the air with jagged rocks the size of a giant’s fist but the darkness swallowed them as a man might swallow a handful of nuts Mammoths trumpeted in the gloom strange voices called out in stranger tongues and Septon Cellador prayed so loudly and drunkenly for the dawn to come that Jon was tempted to chuck him over the edge himself They heard a mammoth dying at their feet and saw another lurch burning through the woods trampling down men and trees alike The wind blew cold and colder Hobb rode up the chain with cups of onion broth and Owen and Clydas served them to the archers where they stood so they could gulp them down between arrows Zei took a place among them with her crossbow Hours of repeated jars and shocks knocked something loose on the right-hand trebuchet and its counterweight came crashing free suddenly and catastrophically wrenching the throwing arm sideways with a splintering crash The left-hand trebuchet kept throwing but the wildlings had quickly learned to shun the place where its loads were landing

We should have twenty trebuchets not two and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them It was a futile thought He might as well wish for another thousand men and maybe a dragon or three

Donal Noye did not return nor any of them who’d gone down with him to hold that black cold tunnel The Wall is mine Jon reminded himself whenever he felt his strength flagging He had taken up a longbow himself and his fingers felt crabbed and stiff half-frozen His fever was back as well and his leg would tremble uncontrollably sending a white-hot knife of pain right through him One more arrow and I’ll rest he told himself half a hundred times Just one more Whenever his quiver was empty one of the orphaned moles would bring him another One more quiver and I’m done It couldn’t be long until the dawn

When morning came none of them quite realized it at first The world was still dark but the black had turned to grey and shapes were beginning to emerge half-seen from the gloom Jon lowered his bow to stare at the mass of heavy clouds that covered the eastern sky He could see a glow behind them but perhaps he was only dreaming He notched another arrow

Then the rising sun broke through to send pale lances of light across the battleground Jon found himself holding his breath as he looked out over the half-mile swath of cleared land that lay between the Wall and the edge of the forest In half a night they had turned it into a wasteland of blackened grass bubbling pitch shattered stone and corpses The carcass of the burned mammoth was already drawing crows There were giants dead on the ground as well but behind them   

Someone moaned to his left and he heard Septon Cellador say Mother have mercy oh Oh oh oh Mother have mercy

Beneath the trees were all the wildlings in the world raiders and giants wargs and skinchangers mountain men salt sea sailors ice river cannibals cave dwellers with dyed faces dog chariots from the Frozen Shore Hornfoot men with their soles like boiled leather all the queer wild folk Mance had gathered to break the Wall This is not your land Jon wanted to shout at them There is no place for you here Go away He could hear Tormund Giantsbane laughing at that You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte would have said He flexed his sword hand opening and closing the fingers though he knew full well that swords would not come into it up here

He was chilled and feverish and suddenly the weight of the longbow was too much The battle with the Magnar had been nothing he realized and the night fight less than nothing only a probe a dagger in the dark to try and catch them unprepared The real battle was only now beginning

I never knew there would be so many Satin said

Jon had He had seen them before but not like this not drawn up in battle array On the march the wildling column had sprawled over long leagues like some enormous worm but you never saw all of it at once But now   

Here they come someone said in a hoarse voice

Mammoths centered the wildling line he saw a hundred or more with giants on their backs clutching mauls and huge stone axes More giants loped beside them pushing along a tree trunk on great wooden wheels its end sharpened to a point A ram he thought bleakly If the gate still stood below a few kisses from that thing would soon turn it into splinters On either side of the giants came a wave of horsemen in boiled leather harness with fire-hardened lances a mass of running archers hundreds of foot with spears slings clubs and leathern shields The bone chariots from the Frozen Shore clattered forward on the flanks bouncing over rocks and roots behind teams of huge white dogs The fury of the wild Jon thought as he listened to the skirl of skins to the dogs barking and baying the mammoths trumpeting the free folk whistling and screaming the giants roaring in the Old Tongue Their drums echoed off the ice like rolling thunder

He could feel the despair all around him There must be a hundred thousand Satin wailed How can we stop so many

The Wall will stop them Jon heard himself say He turned and said it again louder The Wall will stop them The Wall defends itself Hollow words but he needed to say them almost as much as his brothers needed to hear them Mance wants to unman us with his numbers Does he think we’re stupid He was shouting now his leg forgotten and every man was listening The chariots the horsemen all those fools on foot    what are they going to do to us up here Any of you ever see a mammoth climb a wall He laughed and Pyp and Owen and half a dozen more laughed with him They’re nothing they’re less use than our straw brothers here they can’t reach us they can’t hurt us and they don’t frighten us do they

NO Grenn shouted

They’re down there and we’re up here Jon said and so long as we hold the gate they cannot pass They cannot pass They were all shouting then roaring his own words back at him waving swords and longbows in the air as their cheeks flushed red Jon saw Kegs standing there with a warhorn slung beneath his arm Brother he told him sound for battle

Grinning Kegs lifted the horn to his lips and blew the two long blasts that meant wildlings Other horns took up the call until the Wall itself seemed to shudder and the echo of those great deep-throated moans drowned all other sound

Archers Jon said when the horns had died away you’ll aim for the giants with that ram every bloody one of you Loose at my command not before THE GIANTS AND THE RAM I want arrows raining on them with every step but we’ll wait till they’re in range Any man who wastes an arrow will need to climb down and fetch it back do you hear me

I do shouted Owen the Oaf I hear you Lord Snow

Jon laughed laughed like a drunk or a madman and his men laughed with him The chariots and the racing horsemen on the flanks were well ahead of the center now he saw The wildlings had not crossed a third of the half mile yet their battle line was dissolving Load the trebuchet with caltrops Jon said Owen Kegs angle the catapults toward the center Scorpions load with fire spears and loose at my command He pointed at the Mole’s Town boys You you and you stand by with torches

The wildling archers shot as they advanced they would dash forward stop loose then run another ten yards There were so many that the air was constantly full of arrows all falling woefully short A waste Jon thought Their want of discipline is showing The smaller horn-and-wood bows of the free folk were outranged by the great yew longbows of the Night’s Watch and the wildlings were trying to shoot at men seven hundred feet above them Let them shoot Jon said Wait Hold Their cloaks were flapping behind them The wind is in our faces it will cost us range Wait Closer closer The skins wailed the drums thundered the wildling arrows fluttered and fell

DRAW Jon lifted his own bow and pulled the arrow to his ear Satin did the same and Grenn Owen the Oaf Spare Boot Black Jack Bulwer Arron and Emrick Zei hoisted her crossbow to her shoulder Jon was watching the ram come on and on the mammoths and giants lumbering forward on either side They were so small he could have crushed them all in one hand it seemed If only my hand was big enough Through the killing ground they came A hundred crows rose from the carcass of the dead mammoth as the wildlings thundered past to either side of them Closer and closer until   

LOOSE

The black arrows hissed downward like snakes on feathered wings Jon did not wait to see where they struck He reached for a second arrow as soon as the first left his bow NOTCH DRAW LOOSE As soon as the arrow flew he found another NOTCH DRAW LOOSE Again and then again Jon shouted for the trebuchet and heard the creak and heavy thud as a hundred spiked steel caltrops went spinning through the air Catapults he called scorpions Bowmen loose at will Wildling arrows were striking the Wall now a hundred feet below them A second giant spun and staggered Notch draw loose A mammoth veered into another beside it spilling giants on the ground Notch draw loose The ram was down and done he saw the giants who’d pushed it dead or dying Fire arrows he shouted I want that ram burning The screams of wounded mammoths and the booming cries of giants mingled with the drums and pipes to make an awful music yet still his archers drew and loosed as if they’d all gone as deaf as dead Dick Follard They might be the dregs of the order but they were men of the Night’s Watch or near enough as made no matter That’s why they shall not pass

One of the mammoths was running berserk smashing wildlings with his trunk and crushing archers underfoot Jon pulled back his bow once more and launched another arrow at the beast’s shaggy back to urge him on To east and west the flanks of the wildling host had reached the Wall unopposed The chariots drew in or turned while the horsemen milled aimlessly beneath the looming cliff of ice At the gate a shout came Spare Boot maybe Mammoth at the gate

Fire Jon barked Grenn Pyp

Grenn thrust his bow aside wrestled a barrel of oil onto its side and rolled it to the edge of the Wall where Pyp hammered out the plug that sealed it stuffed in a twist of cloth and set it alight with a torch They shoved it over together A hundred feet below it struck the Wall and burst filling the air with shattered staves and burning oil Grenn was rolling a second barrel to the precipice by then and Kegs had one as well Pyp lit them both Got him Satin shouted his head sticking out so far that Jon was certain he was about to fall Got him got him GOT him He could hear the roar of fire A flaming giant lurched into view stumbling and rolling on the ground

Then suddenly the mammoths were fleeing running from the smoke and flames and smashing into those behind them in their terror Those went backward too the giants and wildlings behind them scrambling to get out of their way In half a heartbeat the whole center was collapsing The horsemen on the flanks saw themselves being abandoned and decided to fall back as well not one so much as blooded Even the chariots rumbled off having done nothing but look fearsome and make a lot of noise When they break they break hard Jon Snow thought as he watched them reel away The drums had all gone silent How do you like that music Mance How do you like the taste of the Dornishman’s wife Do we have anyone hurt he asked

The bloody buggers got my leg Spare Boot plucked the arrow out and waved it above his head The wooden one

A ragged cheer went up Zei grabbed Owen by the hands spun him around in a circle and gave him a long wet kiss right there for all to see She tried to kiss Jon too but he held her by the shoulder and pushed her gently but firmly away No he said I am done with kissing Suddenly he was too weary to stand and his leg was agony from knee to groin He fumbled for his crutch Pyp help me to the cage Grenn you have the Wall

Me said Grenn Him said Pyp It was hard to tell which of them was more horrified But Grenn stammered b-but what do I do if the wildlings attack again

Stop them Jon told him

As they rode down in the cage Pyp took off his helm and wiped his brow Frozen sweat Is there anything as disgusting as frozen sweat He laughed Gods I don’t think I have ever been so hungry I could eat an aurochs whole I swear it Do you think Hobb will cook up Grenn for us When he saw Jon’s face his smile died What’s wrong Is it your leg

My leg Jon agreed Even the words were an effort

Not the battle though We won the battle

Ask me when I’ve seen the gate Jon said grimly I want a fire a hot meal a warm bed and something to make my leg stop hurting he told himself But first he had to check the tunnel and find what had become of Donal Noye
