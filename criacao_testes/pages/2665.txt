3015 And David said to him Canst thou bring me down to this company
And he said Swear unto me by God that thou wilt neither kill me nor
deliver me into the hands of my master and I will bring thee down to
this company

3016 And when he had brought him down behold they were spread
abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because
of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the
Philistines and out of the land of Judah

3017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred
young men which rode upon camels and fled

3018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away
and David rescued his two wives

3019 And there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great
neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had
taken to them David recovered all

3020 And David took all the flocks and the herds which they drave
before those other cattle and said This is Davids spoil

3021 And David came to the two hundred men which were so faint that
they could not follow David whom they had made also to abide at the
brook Besor and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people
that were with him and when David came near to the people he saluted
them

3022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial of those
that went with David and said Because they went not with us we will
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every
man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and
depart

3023 Then said David Ye shall not do so my brethren with that
which the LORD hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the
company that came against us into our hand

3024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is
that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by
the stuff they shall part alike

3025 And it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute
and an ordinance for Israel unto this day

3026 And when David came to Ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of Judah even to his friends saying Behold a present for you
of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD 3027 To them which were in
Bethel and to them which were in south Ramoth and to them which were
in Jattir 3028 And to them which were in Aroer and to them which
were in Siphmoth and to them which were in Eshtemoa 3029 And to
them which were in Rachal and to them which were in the cities of the
Jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites
3030 And to them which were in Hormah and to them which were in
Chorashan and to them which were in Athach 3031 And to them which
were in Hebron and to all the places where David himself and his men
were wont to haunt

311 Now the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel
fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in mount Gilboa

312 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons
and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Melchishua
Sauls sons

313 And the battle went sore against Saul and the archers hit him
and he was sore wounded of the archers

314 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer Draw thy sword and thrust
me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me
through and abuse me But his armourbearer would not for he was sore
afraid Therefore Saul took a sword and fell upon it

315 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead he fell
likewise upon his sword and died with him

316 So Saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all
his men that same day together

317 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
valley and they that were on the other side Jordan saw that the men
of Israel fled and that Saul and his sons were dead they forsook the
cities and fled and the Philistines came and dwelt in them

318 And it came to pass on the morrow when the Philistines came to
strip the slain that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in
mount Gilboa

319 And they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent
into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the
house of their idols and among the people

3110 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth and they
fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan

3111 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
Philistines had done to Saul 3112 All the valiant men arose and
went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons
