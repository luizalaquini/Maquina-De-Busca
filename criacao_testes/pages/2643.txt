pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that
we should go

97 Then said Saul to his servant But behold if we go what shall
we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is
not a present to bring to the man of God what have we  98 And the
servant answered Saul again and said Behold I have here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of silver that will I give to the man of God
to tell us our way

99 Beforetime in Israel when a man went to enquire of God thus he
spake Come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a
Prophet was beforetime called a Seer  910 Then said Saul to his
servant Well said come let us go So they went unto the city where
the man of God was

911 And as they went up the hill to the city they found young
maidens going out to draw water and said unto them Is the seer here
912 And they answered them and said He is behold he is before
you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a
sacrifice of the people to day in the high place 913 As soon as ye
be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up
to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come
because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be
bidden Now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find
him

914 And they went up into the city and when they were come into the
city behold Samuel came out against them for to go up to the high
place

915 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came
saying 916 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of
the land of Benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my
people Israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the
Philistines for I have looked upon my people because their cry is
come unto me

917 And when Samuel saw Saul the LORD said unto him Behold the man
whom I spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people

918 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said Tell me I
pray thee where the seers house is

919 And Samuel answered Saul and said I am the seer go up before
me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow
I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart

920 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy
mind on them for they are found And on whom is all the desire of
Israel Is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house  921 And
Saul answered and said Am not I a Benjamite of the smallest of the
tribes of Israel and my family the least of all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me  922 And
Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour
and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden
which were about thirty persons

923 And Samuel said unto the cook Bring the portion which I gave
thee of which I said unto thee Set it by thee

924 And the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it
and set it before Saul And Samuel said Behold that which is left
set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for
thee since I said I have invited the people So Saul did eat with
Samuel that day

925 And when they were come down from the high place into the city
Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house

926 And they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the
day that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house saying Up that
I may send thee away And Saul arose and they went out both of them
he and Samuel abroad

927 And as they were going down to the end of the city Samuel said
to Saul Bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but
stand thou still a while that I may shew thee the word of God

101 Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and
kissed him and said Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance  102 When thou art departed from me
to day then thou shalt find two men by Rachels sepulchre in the
border of Benjamin at Zelzah and they will say unto thee The asses
which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left
the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying What shall I do
for my son  103 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou
shalt come to the plain of Tabor and there shall meet thee three men
going up to God to Bethel one carrying three kids and another
carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine
104 And they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread
which thou shalt receive of their hands

105 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God where is the
garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art
come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets
coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a
pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy 106 And the
Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with
them and shalt be turned into another man
