In fact there is a slightly different variant of the Cholesky decomposition
algorithm which guarantees bounded coefficients but suffers from the
disadvantage that it requires square roots to be taken Martin

However experience with the method indicates that it is rare for the elements
of L to exceed 16 times the maximum element of Q and the possibility of
occasional failure to adjust the coefficients may be tolerable in a practical
linear prediction system
rh Comparison of autocorrelation and covariance analysis
There are various factors which should be taken into account when
deciding whether to use the autocorrelation or covariance method for linear
predictive analysis  Furthermore there is a rather different technique
called the lattice method which will be discussed shortly
The autocorrelation method involves windowing which means that in
practice a rather longer stretch of speech should be used
for analysis  We have illustrated this by setting N=256 in the
autocorrelation algorithm and 100 in the covariance one
Offsetting the extra calculation that this entails is the
fact that the Durbin-Levinson method of inverting a matrix is much more
efficient than Cholesky decomposition  In practice this means
that similar amounts of computation are needed for each method em a
detailed comparison is made in Witten 1980

A factor which weighs against the covariance method is the
difficulty of scaling intermediate quantities within the algorithm
The autocorrelation method can be implemented quite satisfactorily
in fixed-point arithmetic and this makes it more suitable for
hardware implementation  Furthermore serious instabilities sometimes
arise with the covariance method whereas it can be shown that
the autocorrelation one is always stable  Nevertheless the approximations
inherent in the windowing operation and the smearing effect of taking a
larger number of sample points mean that covariance-method coefficients
tend to represent the speech more accurately if they can be obtained
pp
One way of using the covariance method which has proved to be rather
satisfactory in practice is to synchronize the analysis frame with
the beginning of a pitch period when the excitation is strongest
Pitch synchronous techniques were discussed in Chapter 4 in the context
of discrete Fourier transformation of speech  The snag of course is that
pitch peaks do not occur uniformly in time and furthermore it is difficult
to estimate their locations precisely

If the linear predictive coefficients and the error signal are available
it is easy to regenerate the original speech by

If the error signal is parametrized into the sound source type
voiced or unvoiced amplitude and pitch if voiced it can be
regenerated by an impulse repeated at the appropriate pitch
frequency if voiced or white noise if unvoiced
pp
However it may be that the filter represented by the coefficients a sub k is
unstable causing the output speech signal to oscillate wildly
In fact it is only possible for the covariance method to produce an
unstable filter and not the autocorrelation method em although even
with the latter truncation of the a sub ks for transmission may turn
a stable filter into an unstable one  Furthermore the coefficients
a sub k are not suitable candidates for quantization because small
changes in them can have a dramatic effect on the characteristics of
the synthesis filter
pp
Both of these problems can be solved by using a different set of numbers
called
ul
reflection coefficients
for quantization and transmission  Thus for example in Figures 61
and 63 these reflection coefficients could be derived at the
transmitter quantized and used by the receiver to reproduce
the speech waveform  They can be related to reflection and transmission
parameters at the junctions of an acoustic tube model of the vocal tract
hence the name  Procedure 63 shows an algorithm for calculating the
reflection coefficients from the filter coefficients a sub k
