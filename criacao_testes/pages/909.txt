God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us

56 For when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for
the ungodly

57 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die

58 But God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet
sinners Christ died for us

59 Much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be
saved from wrath through him

510 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by
his life

511 And not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ by whom we have now received the atonement

512 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by
sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned 513
For until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when
there is no law

514 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them
that had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression who
is the figure of him that was to come

515 But not as the offence so also is the free gift For if through
the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the
gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto
many

516 And not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the
judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many
offences unto justification

517 For if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they
which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ  518 Therefore as by the
offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by
the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life

519 For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous

520 Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound But
where sin abounded grace did much more abound 521 That as sin hath
reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness
unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord

61 What shall we say then Shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound  62 God forbid How shall we that are dead to sin live any
longer therein  63 Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized
into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death  64 Therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised
up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should
walk in newness of life

65 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection 66 Knowing
this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin
might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin

67 For he that is dead is freed from sin

68 Now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live
with him 69 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no
more death hath no more dominion over him

610 For in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he
liveth he liveth unto God

611 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord

612 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should
obey it in the lusts thereof

613 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from
the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God

614 For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under
the law but under grace

615 What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but
under grace God forbid

616 Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey
his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of
obedience unto righteousness  617 But God be thanked that ye were
the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you

618 Being then made free from sin ye became the servants of
