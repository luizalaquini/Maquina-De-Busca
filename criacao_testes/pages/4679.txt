Oh trout makes for a tasty supper Bolton lifted a pale finger toward his cupbearer Though my poor Elmar is bereft He was to wed Arya Stark but my good father of Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when King Robb betrayed him

Is there word of Arya Stark Brienne leaned forward Lady Catelyn had feared that    is the girl still alive

Oh yes said the Lord of the Dreadfort

You have certain knowledge of that my lord

Roose Bolton shrugged Arya Stark was lost for a time it was true but now she has been found I mean to see her returned safely to the north

Her and her sister both said Brienne Tyrion Lannister has promised us both girls for his brother

That seemed to amuse the Lord of the Dreadfort My lady has no one told you Lannisters lie

Is that a slight on the honor of my House Jaime picked up the cheese knife with his good hand A rounded point and dull he said sliding his thumb along the edge of the blade but it will go through your eye all the same Sweat beaded his brow He could only hope he did not look as feeble as he felt

Lord Bolton’s little smile paid another visit to his lips You speak boldly for a man who needs help to break his bread My guards are all around us I remind you

All around us and half a league away Jaime glanced down the vast length of the hall By the time they reach us you’ll be as dead as Aerys

’Tis scarcely chivalrous to threaten your host over his own cheese and olives the Lord of the Dreadfort scolded In the north we hold the laws of hospitality sacred still

I’m a captive here not a guest Your goat cut off my hand If you think some prunes will make me overlook that you’re bloody well mistaken

That took Roose Bolton aback Perhaps I am Perhaps I ought to make a wedding gift of you to Edmure Tully    or strike your head off as your sister did for Eddard Stark

I would not advise it Casterly Rock has a long memory

A thousand leagues of mountain sea and bog lie between my walls and your rock Lannister enmity means little to Bolton

Lannister friendship could mean much Jaime thought he knew the game they were playing now But does the wench know as well He dare not look to see

I am not certain you are the sort of friends a wise man would want Roose Bolton beckoned to the boy Elmar carve our guests a slice off the roast

Brienne was served first but made no move to eat My lord she said Ser Jaime is to be exchanged for Lady Catelyn’s daughters You must free us to continue on our way

The raven that came from Riverrun told of an escape not an exchange And if you helped this captive slip his bonds you are guilty of treason my lady

The big wench rose to her feet I serve Lady Stark

And I the King in the North Or the King Who Lost the North as some now call him Who never wished to trade Ser Jaime back to the Lannisters

Sit down and eat Brienne Jaime urged as Elmar placed a slice of roast before him dark and bloody If Bolton meant to kill us he wouldn’t be wasting his precious prunes on us at such peril to his bowels He stared at the meat and realized there was no way to cut it one-handed I am worth less than a girl now he thought The goat’s evened the trade though I doubt Lady Catelyn will thank him when Cersei returns her whelps in like condition The thought made him grimace I will get the blame for that as well I’ll wager

Roose Bolton cut his meat methodically the blood running across his plate Lady Brienne will you sit if I tell you that I hope to send Ser Jaime on just as you and Lady Stark desire

I    you’d send us on The wench sounded wary but she sat That is good my lord

It is However Lord Vargo has created me one small    difficulty He turned his pale eyes on Jaime Do you know why Hoat cut off your hand

He enjoys cutting off hands The linen that covered Jaime’s stump was spotted with blood and wine He enjoys cutting off feet as well He doesn’t seem to need a reason

Nonetheless he had one Hoat is more cunning than he appears No man commands a company such as the Brave Companions for long unless he has some wits about him Bolton stabbed a chunk of meat with the point of his dagger put it in his mouth chewed thoughtfully swallowed Lord Vargo abandoned House Lannister because I offered him Harrenhal a reward a thousand times greater than any he could hope to have from Lord Tywin As a stranger to Westeros he did not know the prize was poisoned

The curse of Harren the Black mocked Jaime

The curse of Tywin Lannister Bolton held out his goblet and Elmar refilled it silently Our goat should have consulted the Tarbecks or the Reynes They might have warned him how your lord father deals with betrayal

There are no Tarbecks or Reynes said Jaime

My point precisely Lord Vargo doubtless hoped that Lord Stannis would triumph at King’s Landing and thence confirm him in his possession of this castle in gratitude for his small part in the downfall of House Lannister He gave a dry chuckle He knows little of Stannis Baratheon either I fear That one might have given him Harrenhal for his service    but he would have given him a noose for his crimes as well

A noose is kinder than what he’ll get from my father

By now he has come to the same realization With Stannis broken and Renly dead only a Stark victory can save him from Lord Tywin’s vengeance but the chances of that grow perishingly slim

King Robb has won every battle Brienne said stoutly as stubbornly loyal of speech as she was of deed

Won every battle while losing the Freys the Karstarks Winterfell and the north A pity the wolf is so young Boys of sixteen always believe they are immortal and invincible An older man would bend the knee I’d think After a war there is always a peace and with peace there are pardons    for the Robb Starks at least Not for the likes of Vargo Hoat Bolton gave him a small smile Both sides have made use of him but neither will shed a tear at his passing The Brave Companions did not fight in the Battle of the Blackwater yet they died there all the same

You’ll forgive me if I don’t mourn

You have no pity for our wretched doomed goat Ah but the gods must    else why deliver you into his hands Bolton chewed another chunk of meat Karhold is smaller and meaner than Harrenhal but it lies well beyond the reach of the lion’s claws Once wed to Alys Karstark Hoat might be a lord in truth If he could collect some gold from your father so much the better but he would have delivered you to Lord Rickard no matter how much Lord Tywin paid His price would be the maid and safe refuge

But to sell you he must keep you and the riverlands are full of those who would gladly steal you away Glover and Tallhart were broken at Duskendale but remnants of their host are still abroad with the Mountain slaughtering the stragglers A thousand Karstarks prowl the lands south and east of Riverrun hunting you Elsewhere are Darry men left lordless and lawless packs of four-footed wolves and the lightning lord’s outlaw bands Dondarrion would gladly hang you and the goat together from the same tree The Lord of the Dreadfort sopped up some of the blood with a chunk of bread Harrenhal was the only place Lord Vargo could hope to hold you safe but here his Brave Companions are much outnumbered by my own men and by Ser Aenys and his Freys No doubt he feared I might return you to Ser Edmure at Riverrun    or worse send you on to your father

By maiming you he meant to remove your sword as a threat gain himself a grisly token to send to your father and diminish your value to me For he is my man as I am King Robb’s man Thus his crime is mine or may seem so in your father’s eyes And therein lies my    small difficulty He gazed at Jaime his pale eyes unblinking expectant chill

I see You want me to absolve you of blame To tell my father that this stump is no work of yours Jaime laughed My lord send me to Cersei and I’ll sing as sweet a song as you could want of how gently you treated me Any other answer he knew and Bolton would give him back to the goat Had I a hand I’d write it out How I was maimed by the sellsword my own father brought to Westeros and saved by the noble Lord Bolton

I will trust to your word ser

There’s something I don’t often hear How soon might we be permitted to leave And how do you mean to get me past all these wolves and brigands and Karstarks

You will leave when Qyburn says you are strong enough with a strong escort of picked men under the command of my captain Walton Steelshanks he is called A soldier of iron loyalty Walton will see you safe and whole to King’s Landing

Provided Lady Catelyn’s daughters are delivered safe and whole as well said the wench My lord your man Walton’s protection is welcome but the girls are my charge

The Lord of the Dreadfort gave her an uninterested glance The girls need not concern you any further my lady The Lady Sansa is the dwarf’s wife only the gods can part them now

His wife Brienne said appalled The Imp But    he swore before the whole court in sight of gods and men   

She is such an innocent Jaime was almost as surprised if truth be told but he hid it better Sansa Stark that ought to put a smile on Tyrion’s face He remembered how happy his brother had been with his little crofter’s daughter    for a fortnight

What the Imp did or did nor swear scarcely matters now said Lord Bolton Least of all to you The wench looked almost wounded Perhaps she finally felt the steel jaws of the trap when Roose Bolton beckoned to his guards Ser Jaime will continue on to King’s Landing I said nothing about you I fear It would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both his prizes The Lord of the Dreadfort reached out to pick another prune Were I you my lady I should worry less about Starks and rather more about sapphires
