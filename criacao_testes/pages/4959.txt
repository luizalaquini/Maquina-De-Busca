214 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea until we were
come over the brook Zered was thirty and eight years until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as
the LORD sware unto them

215 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them to destroy them
from among the host until they were consumed

216 So it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people 217 That the LORD spake unto me saying
218 Thou art to pass over through Ar the coast of Moab this day
219 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon
distress them not nor meddle with them for I will not give thee of
the land of the children of Ammon any possession because I have given
it unto the children of Lot for a possession

220 That also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein
in old time and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims 221 A people
great and many and tall as the Anakims but the LORD destroyed them
before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead 222
As he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir when he
destroyed the Horims from before them and they succeeded them and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day 223 And the Avims which
dwelt in Hazerim even unto Azzah the Caphtorims which came forth
out of Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead  224 Rise
ye up take your journey and pass over the river Arnon behold I
have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon and his
land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle

225 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear
report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee

226 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace saying 227 Let me pass
through thy land I will go along by the high way I will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left

228 Thou shalt sell me meat for money that I may eat and give me
water for money that I may drink only I will pass through on my
feet 229 As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir and the
Moabites which dwell in Ar did unto me until I shall pass over
Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us

230 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him for the
LORD thy God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that
he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day

231 And the LORD said unto me Behold I have begun to give Sihon and
his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his
land

232 Then Sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight
at Jahaz

233 And the LORD our God delivered him before us and we smote him
and his sons and all his people

234 And we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed
the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left
none to remain 235 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto
ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took

236 From Aroer which is by the brink of the river of Arnon and from
the city that is by the river even unto Gilead there was not one
city too strong for us the LORD our God delivered all unto us 237
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not nor unto
any place of the river Jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains
nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us

31 Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan and Og the king of
Bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at Edrei

32 And the LORD said unto me Fear him not for I will deliver him
and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at
Heshbon

33 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of
Bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to
him remaining

34 And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city
which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of
Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan

35 All these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars
beside unwalled towns a great many

36 And we utterly destroyed them as we did unto Sihon king of
Heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every
city

37 But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a
prey to ourselves

38 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan from the river of
Arnon unto mount Hermon 39 Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion
