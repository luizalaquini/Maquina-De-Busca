The envoys from Yunkai arrived as the sun was going down fifty men on magnificent black horses and one on a great white camel Their helms were twice as tall as their heads so as not to crush the bizarre twists and towers and shapes of their oiled hair beneath They dyed their linen skirts and tunics a deep yellow and sewed copper disks to their cloaks

The man on the white camel named himself Grazdan mo Eraz Lean and hard he had a white smile such as Kraznys had worn until Drogon burned off his face His hair was drawn up in a unicorn’s horn that jutted from his brow and his tokar was fringed with golden Myrish lace Ancient and glorious is Yunkai the queen of cities he said when Dany welcomed him to her tent Our walls are strong our nobles proud and fierce our common folk without fear Ours is the blood of ancient Ghis whose empire was old when Valyria was yet a squalling child You were wise to sit and speak Khaleesi You shall find no easy conquest here

Good My Unsullied will relish a bit of a fight She looked to Grey Worm who nodded

Grazdan shrugged expansively If blood is what you wish let it flow I am told you have freed your eunuchs Freedom means as much to an Unsullied as a hat to a haddock He smiled at Grey Worm but the eunuch might have been made of stone Those who survive we shall enslave again and use to retake Astapor from the rabble We can make a slave of you as well do not doubt it There are pleasure houses in Lys and Tyrosh where men would pay handsomely to bed the last Targaryen

It is good to see you know who I am said Dany mildly

I pride myself on my knowledge of the savage senseless west Grazdan spread his hands a gesture of conciliation And yet why should we speak thus harshly to one another It is true that you committed savageries in Astapor but we Yunkai’i are a most forgiving people Your quarrel is not with us Your Grace Why squander your strength against our mighty walls when you will need every man to regain your father’s throne in far Westeros Yunkai wishes you only well in that endeavor And to prove the truth of that I have brought you a gift He clapped his hands and two of his escort came forward bearing a heavy cedar chest bound in bronze and gold They set it at her feet Fifty thousand golden marks Grazdan said smoothly Yours as a gesture of friendship from the Wise Masters of Yunkai Gold given freely is better than plunder bought with blood surely So I say to you Daenerys Targaryen take this chest and go

Dany pushed open the lid of the chest with a small slippered foot It was full of gold coins just as the envoy said She grabbed a handful and let them run through her fingers They shone brightly as they tumbled and fell new minted most of them stamped with a stepped pyramid on one face and the harpy of Ghis on the other Very pretty I wonder how many chests like this I shall find when I take your city

He chuckled None for that you shall never do

I have a gift for you as well She slammed the chest shut Three days On the morning of the third day send out your slaves All of them Every man woman and child shall be given a weapon and as much food clothing coin and goods as he or she can carry These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters’ possessions as payment for their years of servitude When all the slaves have departed you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city to make certain none remain in bondage If you do this Yunkai will not be burned or plundered and none of your people shall be molested The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire and will have proved themselves wise indeed What say you

I say you are mad

Am I Dany shrugged and said Dracarys

The dragons answered Rhaegal hissed and smoked Viserion snapped and Drogon spat swirling red-black flame It touched the drape of Grazdan’s tokar and the silk caught in half a heartbeat Golden marks spilled across the carpets as the envoy stumbled over the chest shouting curses and beating at his arm until Whitebeard flung a flagon of water over him to douse the flames You swore I should have safe conduct the Yunkish envoy wailed

Do all the Yunkai’i whine so over a singed tokar I shall buy you a new one    if you deliver up your slaves within three days Elsewise Drogon shall give you a warmer kiss She wrinkled her nose You’ve soiled yourself Take your gold and go and see that the Wise Masters hear my message

Grazdan mo Eraz pointed a finger You shall rue this arrogance whore These little lizards will not keep you safe I promise you We will fill the air with arrows if they come within a league of Yunkai Do you think it is so hard to kill a dragon

Harder than to kill a slaver Three days Grazdan Tell them By the end of the third day I will be in Yunkai whether you open your gates for me or no

Full dark had fallen by the time the Yunkai’i departed from her camp It promised to be a gloomy night moonless starless with a chill wet wind blowing from the west A fine black night thought Dany The fires burned all around her small orange stars strewn across hill and field Ser Jorah she said summon my bloodriders Dany seated herself on a mound of cushions to await them her dragons all about her When they were assembled she said An hour past midnight should be time enough

Yes Khaleesi said Rakharo Time for what

To mount our attack

Ser Jorah Mormont scowled You told the sellswords—

—that I wanted their answers on the morrow I made no promises about tonight The Stormcrows will be arguing about my offer The Second Sons will be drunk on the wine I gave Mero And the Yunkai’i believe they have three days We will take them under cover of this darkness

They will have scouts watching for us

And in the dark they will see hundreds of campfires burning said Dany If they see anything at all

Khaleesi said Jhogo I will deal with these scouts They are no riders only slavers on horses

Just so she agreed I think we should attack from three sides Grey Worm your Unsullied shall strike at them from right and left while my kos lead my horse in wedge for a thrust through their center Slave soldiers will never stand before mounted Dothraki She smiled To be sure I am only a young girl and know little of war What do you think my lords

I think you are Rhaegar Targaryen’s sister Ser Jorah said with a rueful half smile

Aye said Arstan Whitebeard and a queen as well

It took an hour to work out all the details Now begins the most dangerous time Dany thought as her captains departed to their commands She could only pray that the gloom of the night would hide her preparations from the foe

Near midnight she got a scare when Ser Jorah bulled his way past Strong Belwas The Unsullied caught one of the sellswords trying to sneak into the camp

A spy That frightened her If they’d caught one how many others might have gotten away

He claims to come bearing gifts It’s the yellow fool with the blue hair

Daario Naharis That one I’ll hear him then

When the exile knight delivered him she asked herself whether two men had ever been so different The Tyroshi was fair where Ser Jorah was swarthy lithe where the knight was brawny graced with flowing locks where the other was balding yet smooth-skinned where Mormont was hairy And her knight dressed plainly while this other made a peacock look drab though he had thrown a heavy black cloak over his bright yellow finery for this visit He carried a heavy canvas sack slung over one shoulder

Khaleesi he cried I bring gifts and glad tidings The Stormcrows are yours A golden tooth gleamed in his mouth when he smiled And so is Daario Naharis

Dany was dubious If this Tyroshi had come to spy this declaration might be no more than a desperate plot to save his head What do Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor say of this

Little Daario upended the sack and the heads of Sallor the Bald and Prendahl na Ghezn spilled out upon her carpets My gifts to the dragon queen

Viserion sniffed the blood leaking from Prendahl’s neck and let loose a gout of flame that took the dead man full in the face blackening and blistering his bloodless cheeks Drogon and Rhaegal stirred at the smell of roasted meat

You did this Dany asked queasily

None other If her dragons discomfited Daario Naharis he hid it well For all the mind he paid them they might have been three kittens playing with a mouse

Why

Because you are so beautiful His hands were large and strong and there was something in his hard blue eyes and great curving nose that suggested the fierceness of some splendid bird of prey Prendahl talked too much and said too little His garb rich as it was had seen hard wear salt stains patterned his boots the enamel of his nails was chipped his lace was soiled by sweat and she could see where the end of his cloak was fraying And Sallor picked his nose as if his snot was gold He stood with his hands crossed at the wrists his palms resting on the pommels of his blades a curving Dothraki arakh on his left hip a Myrish stiletto on his right Their hilts were a matched pair of golden women naked and wanton

Are you skilled in the use of those handsome blades Dany asked him

Prendahl and Sallor would tell you so if dead men could talk I count no day as lived unless I have loved a woman slain a foeman and eaten a fine meal    and the days that I have lived are as numberless as the stars in the sky I make of slaughter a thing of beauty and many a tumbler and fire dancer has wept to the gods that they might be half so quick a quarter so graceful I would tell you the names of all the men I have slain but before I could finish your dragons would grow large as castles the walls of Yunkai would crumble into yellow dust and winter would come and go and come again

Dany laughed She liked the swagger she saw in this Daario Naharis Draw your sword and swear it to my service

In a blink Daario’s arakh was free of its sheath His submission was as outrageous as the rest of him a great swoop that brought his face down to her toes My sword is yours My life is yours My love is yours My blood my body my songs you own them all I live and die at your command fair queen

Then live Dany said and fight for me tonight

That would not be wise my queen Ser Jorah gave Daario a cold hard stare Keep this one here under guard until the battle’s fought and won

She considered a moment then shook her head If he can give us the Stormcrows surprise is certain

And if he betrays you surprise is lost

Dany looked down at the sellsword again He gave her such a smile that she flushed and turned away He won’t

How can you know that
