Davos shook his head A cough It will pass

The boy took him at his word We were playing monsters and maidens he explained I was the monster It’s a childish game but my cousin likes it Do you have a name

Ser Davos Seaworth

The boy looked him up and down dubiously Are you certain You don’t look very knightly

I am the knight of the onions my lord

The blue eyes blinked The one with the black ship

You know that tale

You brought my uncle Stannis fish to eat before I was born when Lord Tyrell had him under siege The boy drew himself up tall I am Edric Storm he announced King Robert’s son

Of course you are Davos had known that almost at once The lad had the prominent ears of a Florent but the hair the eyes the jaw the cheekbones those were all Baratheon

Did you know my father Edric Storm demanded

I saw him many a time while calling on your uncle at court but we never spoke

My father taught me to fight the boy said proudly He came to see me almost every year and sometimes we trained together On my last name day he sent me a warhammer just like his only smaller They made me leave it at Storm’s End though Is it true my uncle Stannis cut off your fingers

Only the last joint I still have fingers only shorter

Show me

Davos peeled his glove off The boy studied his hand carefully He did not shorten your thumb

No Davos coughed No he left me that

He should not have chopped any of your fingers the lad decided That was ill done

I was a smuggler

Yes but you smuggled him fish and onions

Lord Stannis knighted me for the onions and took my fingers for the smuggling He pulled his glove back on

My father would not have chopped your fingers

As you say my lord Robert was a different man than Stannis true enough The boy is like him Aye and like Renly as well That thought made him anxious

The boy was about to say something more when they heard steps Davos turned Ser Axell Florent was coming down the garden path with a dozen guards in quilted jerkins On their breasts they wore the fiery heart of the Lord of Light Queen’s men Davos thought A cough came on him suddenly

Ser Axell was short and muscular with a barrel chest thick arms bandy legs and hair growing from his ears The queen’s uncle he had served as castellan of Dragonstone for a decade and had always treated Davos courteously knowing he enjoyed the favor of Lord Stannis But there was neither courtesy nor warmth in his tone as he said Ser Davos and undrowned How can that be

Onions float ser Have you come to take me to the king

I have come to take you to the dungeon Ser Axell waved his men forward Seize him and take his dirk He means to use it on our lady
