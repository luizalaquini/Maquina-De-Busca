Ebben appeared grabbed him shook him Quiet You mean to bring the wildlings down on us What’s wrong with you boy

A dream said Jon feebly I was Ghost I was on the edge of the mountain looking down on a frozen river and something attacked me A bird    an eagle I think   

Squire Dalbridge smiled It’s always pretty women in my dreams Would that I dreamed more often

Qhorin came up beside him A frozen river you say

The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier Stonesnake put in

There was a tree with my brother’s face The wildlings    there were thousands more than I ever knew existed And giants riding mammoths From the way the light had shifted Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours His head ached and the back of his neck where the talons had burned through him But that was in the dream

Tell me all that you remember from first to last said Qhorin Halfhand

Jon was confused It was only a dream

A wolf dream the Halfhand said Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings were gathering at the source of the Milkwater That may be why you dreamed it Or it may be that you saw what waits for us a few hours farther on Tell me

It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers but he did as he was commanded None of the black brothers laughed at him however By the time he was done even Squire Dalbridge was no longer smiling

Skinchanger said Ebben grimly looking at the Halfhand Does he mean the eagle Jon wondered Or me Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan’s stories not in the world he had lived in all his life Yet here in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice it was not hard to believe

The cold winds are rising Mormont feared as much Benjen Stark felt it as well Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again Why should we balk at wargs and giants

Does this mean my dreams are true as well asked Squire Dalbridge Lord Snow can keep his mammoths I want my women

Man and boy I’ve served the Watch and ranged as far as any said Ebben I’ve seen the bones of giants and heard many a queer tale but no more I want to see them with my own eyes

Be careful they don’t see you Ebben Stonesnake said

Ghost did not reappear as they set out again The shadows covered the floor of the pass by then and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the rangers named Forktop If the dream was true    Even the thought scared him Could the eagle have hurt Ghost or knocked him off the precipice And what about the weirwood with his brother’s face that smelled of death and darkness

The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop Twilight filled the Skirling Pass It seemed to grow colder almost at once They were no longer climbing In fact the ground had begun to descend though as yet not sharply It was littered with cracks and broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock It will be dark soon and still no sight of Ghost It was tearing Jon apart yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked Other things might be listening as well

Qhorin Squire Dalbridge called softly There Look

The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them outlined against the darkening sky We’ve seen other eagles Jon thought That need not be the one I dreamed of

Even so Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it but the squire stopped him The bird’s well out of bowshot

I don’t like it watching us

The squire shrugged Nor me but you won’t stop it Only waste a good arrow

Qhorin sat in his saddle studying the eagle for a long time We press on he finally said The rangers resumed their descent

Ghost Jon wanted to shout where are you

He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders A patch of old snow he thought until he saw it stir He was off his horse at once As he went to his knees Ghost lifted his head His neck glistened wetly but he made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh but the bird had not been able to snap his neck

Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him How bad

As if in answer Ghost struggled to his feet

The wolf is strong the ranger said Ebben water Stonesnake your skin of wine Hold him still Jon

Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf’s fur Ghost struggled and bared his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him but Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words and soon enough the wolf quieted By the time they’d ripped a strip from Jon’s cloak to wrap the wounds full dark had settled Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone Do we press on Stonesnake wanted to know

Qhorin went to his garron Back not on

Back Jon was taken by surprise

Eagles have sharper eyes than men We are seen So now we run The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle

The other rangers exchanged a look but no man thought to argue One by one they mounted and turned their mounts toward home Ghost come he called and the direwolf followed a pale shadow moving through the night

All night they rode feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground The wind grew stronger Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot each man leading his garron Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve them well but Qhorin said No fire and that was the end of that They reached the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ’cats were giving answer Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead as big as harvest moons

In the black hour before dawn they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay We are not far from the place the wildlings died said Qhorin From there one man could hold a hundred The right man He looked at Squire Dalbridge

The squire bowed his head Leave me as many arrows as you can spare brothers He stroked his longbow And see my garron has an apple when you’re home He’s earned it poor beastie

He’s staying to die Jon realized

Qhorin clasped the squire’s forearm with a gloved hand If the eagle flies down for a look at you   

   he’ll sprout some new feathers

The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights

When dawn broke Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue Ebben saw it too and cursed but Qhorin told him to be quiet Listen

Jon held his breath and heard it Far away and behind them the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains

And now they come said Qhorin





TYRION

Pod dressed him for his ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him his chain of office Tyrion left it on the bedside table His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King’s Hand and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further

Varys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard My lord he said a little out of breath You had best read this at once He held out a parchment in a soft white hand A report from the north

Good news or bad Tyrion asked

That is not for me to judge
