hardly noticed its passage over his tongue  and
lifting the cup Coggan tilted his head gradually
backwards with closed eyes that his expectant soul
might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss
by irrelevant surroundings
Well I must be on again said Poorgmss Not
but that I should like another nip with ye but the
parish might lose confidence in me if I was seed
here
 Where be ye trading ot to to-day then Joseph 
Back to Weatherbury Ive got poor little Fanny
Robin in my waggon outside and I must be at the
churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her
Ay-ive heard of it And so shes nailed up in
parish boards after all and nobody to pay the bell
shilling and the grave half-crown
The parish pays the grave half-crown but not the
bell shilling because the bells a luxery but a can
hardly do without the grave poor body However I
expect our mistress will pay all
A pretty maid as ever I see But whats yer hurry
Joseph  The pore womans dead and you cant bring
her to life and you may as well sit down comfortable
and finish another with us
I dont mind taking just the least thimbleful ye
can dream of more with ye sonnies But only a few
minutes because tis as tis
Of course youll have another drop A mans
twice the man afterwards You feel so warm and
glorious and you whop and slap at your work without
any trouble and everything goes on like sticks a+
breaking Too much liquor is bad and leads us to
that horned man in the smoky house  but after all
many people havent the gift of enjoying a wet and
since we be highly favoured with a power that way
we should make the most ot
True said Mark Clark Tis a talent the Lord
P 345
has mercifully bestowed upon us and we ought not
to neglect it But what with the parsons and clerks
and schooipeople and serious tea-parties the merry
old ways of good life have gone to the dogs -- upon
my carcase they have
 Well really I must be onward again now said
Joseph
Now now Joseph nonsense The poor woman
is dead isnt she and whats your hurry
Well I hope Providence wont be in a way with
me for my doings said Joseph again sitting down
Ive been troubled with weak moments lately tis
true Ive been drinky once this month already and
I did not go to church a-Sunday and I dropped a
curse or two yesterday so I dont want to go too far
for my safety Your next world is your next world
and not to be squandered offhand
I believe ye to be a chapeimember Joseph That
I do
Oh no no I dont go so far as that
 For my part said Coggan Im staunch Church
of England
 Ay and faith so be I said Mark Clark
I wont say much for myself I dont wish to
Coggan continued with that tendency to talk on
principles which is characteristic of the barley-corn
But Ive never changed a single doctrine  Ive stuck
like a plaster to the old faith I was born in Yes
theres this to be said for the Church a man can
belong to the Church and bide in his cheerful old
inn and never trouble or worry his mind about
doctrines at all But to be a meetinger you must
go to chapel in all winds and weathers and make
yerself as frantic as a skit Not but that chapei
members be clever chaps enough in their way They
can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads all
about their families and shipwmcks in the newspaper
They can -- they can said Mark Clark with cor+
roborative feeling  but we Churchmen you see must
have it all printed aforehand or dang it all we should
no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the
Lord than babes unborn
 Chapeifolk be more hand-in-glove with them above
than we said Joseph thoughtfully
 Yes said Coggan  We know very well that if
anybody do go to heaven they will Theyve worked
hard for it and they
P 346
deserve to have it such as tis
I baint such a fool as to pretend that we who stick
to the Church have the same chance as they because
we know we have not But I hate a feller wholl
change his old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting
to heaven Id as soon turn kings-evidence for the
few pounds you get Why neighbours when every
one of my taties were frosted our Parson Thirdly
were the man who gave me a sack for seed though
he hardly had one for his own use and no money to
buy em If it hadnt been for him I shouldnt hae
had a tatie to put in my garden Dye think Id
turn after that No Ill stick to my side and if we
be in the wrong so be it  Ill fall with the fallen
