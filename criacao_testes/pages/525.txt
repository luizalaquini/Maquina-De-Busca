Theon narrowed his eyes How many

A hundred might be Two hundred Maybe more He smiled his pale eyes glinting I was born up north here I know many a man and many a man knows Reek

Two hundred men were not an army but you didn’t need thousands to hold a castle as strong as Winterfell So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing they might make all the difference Do as you say and you’ll not find me ungrateful You can name your own reward

Well m’lord I haven’t had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay Reek said I’ve had my eye on that Palla and I hear she’s already been had so…

He had gone too far with Reek to turn back now Two hundred men and she’s yours But a man less and you can go back to fucking pigs

Reek was gone before the sun went down carrying a bag of Stark silver and the last of Theon’s hopes Like as not I’ll never see the wretch again he thought bitterly but even so the chance had to be taken

That night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to Winterfell The hall rang with music and laughter though the cold winds were rising outside At first it was all wine and roast meat and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time… until he noticed that the room was growing darker The music did not seem so jolly then he heard discords and strange silences and notes that hung in the air bleeding Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead

King Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly and Lord Eddard was headless beside him Corpses lined the benches below grey-brown flesh sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast worms crawling in and out of the holes that were their eyes He knew them every one Jory Cassel and Fat Tom Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse and all the others who had ridden south to King’s Landing never to return Mikken and Chayle sat together one dripping blood and the other water Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table The miller’s wife was there as well and Farlen even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved Bran’s life

But there were others with faces he had never known in life faces he had seen only in stone The slim sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna Her brother Brandon stood beside her and their father Lord Rickard just behind Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows pale shades with long grim faces The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife And then the tall doors opened with a crash and a freezing gale blew down the hall and Robb came walking out of the night Grey Wind stalked beside eyes burning and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds

Theon woke with a scream startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room When his guards burst in with drawn swords he ordered them to bring him the maester By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy a cup of wine had steadied Theon’s hands and he was feeling ashamed of his panic A dream he muttered that was all it was It meant nothing

Nothing Luwin agreed solemnly He left a sleeping draught but Theon poured it down the privy shaft the moment he was gone Luwin was a man as well as a maester and the man had no love for him He wants me to sleep yes… to sleep and never wake He’d like that as much as Asha would

He sent for Kyra kicked shut the door climbed on top of her and fucked the wench with a fury he’d never known was in him By the time he finished she was sobbing her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks Theon shoved her from the bed and threw her a blanket Get out

Yet even then he could not sleep

Come dawn he dressed and went outside to walk along the outer walls A brisk autumn wind was swirling through the battlements It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes He watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees On his left he could see tower tops above the inner wall their roofs gilded by the rising sun The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green Ned Stark’s tree he thought and Stark’s wood Stark’s castle Stark’s sword Stark’s gods This is their place not mine I am a Greyjoy of Pyke born to paint a kraken on my shield and sail the great salt sea I should have gone with Asha

On their iron spikes atop the gatehouse the heads waited

Theon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on his cloak with small ghostly hands The miller’s boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon alike in size and coloring and once Reek had flayed the skin from their faces and dipped their heads in tar it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh People were such fools If we’d said they were rams’ heads they would have seen horns





SANSA

They had been singing in the sept all morning since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses the clank of steel and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music In the sept they sing for the Mother’s mercy but on the walls it’s the Warrior they pray to and all in silence She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god But if there is only one whose prayers will be heard

Ser Meryn Trant held the blood bay for Joffrey to mount Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate with matching golden lions on their heads The pale sunlight flashed off the golds and reds every time Joff moved Bright shining and empty Sansa thought

The Imp was mounted on a red stallion armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in his father’s clothes But there was nothing childish about the battle-axe slung below his shield Ser Mandon Moore rode at his side white steel icy bright When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way Lady Sansa he called from the saddle surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor’s

She has my lord but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off I mean to visit the sept as well to pray

I won’t ask for whom His mouth twisted oddly if that was a smile it was the queerest she had ever seen This day may change all For you as well as for House Lannister I ought to have sent you off with Tommen now that I think on it Still you should be safe enough in Maegor’s so long as—

Sansa The boyish shout rang across the yard Joffrey had seen her Sansa here

He calls me as if he were calling a dog she thought

His Grace has need of you Tyrion Lannister observed We’ll talk again after the battle if the gods permit
