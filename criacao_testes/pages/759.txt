speaketh the LORD of hosts saying Behold the man whose name is The
BRANCH and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the
temple of the LORD 613 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD
and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne
and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace
shall be between them both

614 And the crowns shall be to Helem and to Tobijah and to Jedaiah
and to Hen the son of Zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the
LORD

615 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of
the LORD and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto
you And this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice
of the LORD your God

71 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius that the
word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth
month even in Chisleu 72 When they had sent unto the house of God
Sherezer and Regemmelech and their men to pray before the LORD 73
And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of
hosts and to the prophets saying Should I weep in the fifth month
separating myself as I have done these so many years  74 Then came
the word of the LORD of hosts unto me saying 75 Speak unto all the
people of the land and to the priests saying When ye fasted and
mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did
ye at all fast unto me even to me  76 And when ye did eat and when
ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves
77 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and
the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and
the plain  78 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah saying
79 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts saying Execute true judgment
and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother 710 And
oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor
and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart

711 But they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and
stopped their ears that they should not hear

712 Yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should
hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his
spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the
LORD of hosts

713 Therefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would
not hear so they cried and I would not hear saith the LORD of
hosts 714 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the
nations whom they knew not Thus the land was desolate after them
that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant
land desolate

81 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me saying 82 Thus
saith the LORD of hosts I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy
and I was jealous for her with great fury

83 Thus saith the LORD I am returned unto Zion and will dwell in
the midst of Jerusalem and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth
and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain

84 Thus saith the LORD of hosts There shall yet old men and old
women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem and every man with his staff
in his hand for very age

85 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof

86 Thus saith the LORD of hosts If it be marvellous in the eyes of
the remnant of this people in these days should it also be marvellous
in mine eyes saith the LORD of hosts

87 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Behold I will save my people from
the east country and from the west country 88 And I will bring
them and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem and they shall
be my people and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness

89 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Let your hands be strong ye that
hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets which
were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts
was laid that the temple might be built

810 For before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for
beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in
because of the affliction for I set all men every one against his
neighbour

811 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the
former days saith the LORD of hosts

812 For the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit
and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give
their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all
these things

813 And it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the
heathen O house of Judah and house of Israel so will I save you
and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong

814 For thus saith the LORD of hosts As I thought to punish you
when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the LORD of hosts and I
