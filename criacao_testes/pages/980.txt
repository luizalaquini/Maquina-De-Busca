like him for we shall see him as he is

33 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even
as he is pure

34 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is
the transgression of the law

35 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in
him is no sin

36 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him neither known him

37 Little children let no man deceive you he that doeth
righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous

38 He that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from
the beginning For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he
might destroy the works of the devil

39 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed
remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God

310 In this the children of God are manifest and the children of the
devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he
that loveth not his brother

311 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we
should love one another

312 Not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother
And wherefore slew he him Because his own works were evil and his
brothers righteous

313 Marvel not my brethren if the world hate you

314 We know that we have passed from death unto life because we love
the brethren He that loveth not his brother abideth in death

315 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him

316 Hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life
for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren

317 But whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have
need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth
the love of God in him  318 My little children let us not love in
word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth

319 And hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our
hearts before him

320 For if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things

321 Beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence
toward God

322 And whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his
commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight

323 And this is his commandment That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us
commandment

324 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in
him

And hereby we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath
given us

41 Beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether
they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the
world

42 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God Every spirit that confesseth
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God 43 And every spirit
that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
God and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that
it should come and even now already is it in the world

44 Ye are of God little children and have overcome them because
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world

45 They are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the
world heareth them

46 We are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of
God heareth not us Hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit
of error

47 Beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every
one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God

48 He that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love

49 In this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through
