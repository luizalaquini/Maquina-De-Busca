Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants She held the sword in her left hand He seemed to approve The left is good All is reversed it will make your enemies more awkward Now you are standing wrong Turn your body sideface yes so You are skinny as the shaft of a spear do you know That is good too the target is smaller Now the grip Let me see He moved closer and peered at her hand prying her fingers apart rearranging them Just so yes Do not squeeze it so tight no the grip must be deft delicate

What if I drop it Arya said

The steel must be part of your arm the bald man told her Can you drop part of your arm No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos he knows these things Listen to him boy

It was the third time he had called her boy I’m a girl Arya objected

Boy girl Syrio Forel said You are a sword that is all He clicked his teeth together Just so that is the grip You are not holding a battle-axe you are holding a—

—needle Arya finished for him fiercely

Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember child this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are learning the knight’s dance hacking and hammering no This is the bravo’s dance the water dance swift and sudden All men are made of water do you know this When you pierce them the water leaks out and they die He took a step backward raised his own wooden blade Now you will try to strike me

Arya tried to strike him She tried for four hours until every muscle in her body was sore and aching while Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do

The next day their real work began





DAENERYS

The Dothraki sea Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge beneath them the plain stretched out immense and empty a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond It was a sea Dany thought Past here there were no hills no mountains no trees nor cities nor roads only the endless grasses the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew It’s so green she said

Here and now Ser Jorah agreed You ought to see it when it blooms all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon like a sea of blood Come the dry season and the world turns the color of old bronze And this is only hranna child There are a hundred kinds of grass out there grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai they say there are oceans of ghost grass taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world and then all life will end

That thought gave Dany the shivers I don’t want to talk about that now she said It’s so beautiful here I don’t want to think about everything dying

As you will Khaleesi Ser Jorah said respectfully

She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party and now the others were climbing the ridge below them Her handmaid Irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle Her brother was miserable out here He ought never have come Magister Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos had offered him the hospitality of his manse but Viserys would have none of it He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid until he had the crown he had been promised And if he tries to cheat me he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon Viserys had vowed laying a hand on his borrowed sword Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune

Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother’s complaints right now The day was too perfect The sky was a deep blue and high above them a hunting hawk circled The grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind the air was warm on her face and Dany felt at peace She would not let Viserys spoil it

Wait here Dany told Ser Jorah Tell them all to stay Tell them I command it

The knight smiled Ser Jorah was not a handsome man He had a neck and shoulders like a bull and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort You are learning to talk like a queen Daenerys

Not a queen said Dany A khaleesi She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone

The descent was steep and rocky but Dany rode fearlessly and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one

At first it had not come easy The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding moving east toward Vaes Dothrak and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die Saddle sores opened on her bottom hideous and bloody Her thighs were chafed raw her hands blistered from the reins the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit By the time dusk fell her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount

Even the nights brought no relief Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode even as he had ignored her during their wedding and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders racing his prize horses watching women dance and men die Dany had no place in these parts of his life She was left to sup alone or with Ser Jorah and her brother and afterward to cry herself to sleep Yet every night some time before the dawn Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion He always took her from behind Dothraki fashion for which Dany was grateful that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain When he was done he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him her body bruised and sore hurting too much for sleep

Day followed day and night followed night until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer She would kill herself rather than go on she decided one night…

Yet when she slept that night she dreamt the dragon dream again Viserys was not in it this time There was only her and the dragon Its scales were black as night wet and slick with blood Her blood Dany sensed Its eyes were pools of molten magma and when it opened its mouth the flame came roaring out in a hot jet She could hear it singing to her She opened her arms to the fire embraced it let it swallow her whole let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away could feel her blood boil and turn to steam and yet there was no pain She felt strong and new and fierce

And the next day strangely she did not seem to hurt quite so much It was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity Even her handmaids noticed the change Khaleesi Jhiqui said what is wrong Are you sick
