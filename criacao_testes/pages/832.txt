Robb looked more amused than afraid I have an army to protect me Mother I don’t need to trust in bread and salt But if it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots I’ll eat it and ask for a second bowl

Four Freys rode out from the western gatehouse wrapped in heavy cloaks of thick grey wool Catelyn recognized Ser Ryman son of the late Ser Stevron Lord Walder’s firstborn With his father dead Ryman was heir to the Twins The face she saw beneath his hood was fleshy broad and stupid The other three were likely his own sons Lord Walder’s great grandsons

Edmure confirmed as much Edwyn is eldest the pale slender man with the constipated look The wiry one with the beard is Black Walder a nasty bit of business Petyr is on the bay the lad with the unfortunate face Petyr Pimple his brothers call him Only a year or two older than Robb but Lord Walder married him off at ten to a woman thrice his age Gods I hope Roslin doesn’t take after him

They halted to let their hosts come to them Robb’s banner drooped on its staff and the steady sound of rainfall mingled with the rush of the swollen Green Fork on their right Grey Wind edged forward tail stiff watching through slitted eyes of dark gold When the Freys were a half-dozen yards away Catelyn heard him growl a deep rumble that seemed almost one with rush of the river Robb looked startled Grey Wind to me To me

Instead the direwolf leapt forward snarling

Ser Ryman’s palfrey shied off with a whinny of fear and Petyr Pimple’s reared and threw him Only Black Walder kept his mount in hand He reached for the hilt of his sword No Robb was shouting Grey Wind here Here Catelyn spurred between the direwolf and the horses Mud spattered from the hooves of her mare as she cut in front of Grey Wind The wolf veered away and only then seemed to hear Robb calling

Is this how a Stark makes amends Black Walder shouted with naked steel in hand A poor greeting I call it to set your wolf upon us Is this why you’ve come

Ser Ryman had dismounted to help Petyr Pimple back to his feet The lad was muddy but unhurt

I’ve come to make my apology for the wrong I did your House and to see my uncle wed Robb swung down from the saddle Petyr take my horse Yours is almost back to the stable

Petyr looked to his father and said I can ride behind one of my brothers

The Freys made no sign of obeisance You come late Ser Ryman declared

The rains delayed us said Robb I sent a bird

I do not see the woman

By the woman Ser Ryman meant Jeyne Westerling all knew Lady Catelyn smiled apologetically Queen Jeyne was weary after so much travel sers No doubt she will be pleased to visit when times are more settled

My grandfather will be displeased Though Black Walder had sheathed his sword his tone was no friendlier I’ve told him much of the lady and he wished to behold her with his own eyes

Edwyn cleared his throat We have chambers prepared for you in the Water Tower Your Grace he told Robb with careful courtesy as well as for Lord Tully and Lady Stark Your lords bannermen are also welcome to shelter under our roof and partake of the wedding feast

And my men asked Robb

My lord grandfather regrets that he cannot feed nor house so large a host We have been sore pressed to find fodder and provender for our own levies Nonetheless your men shall not be neglected If they will cross and set up their camp beside our own we will bring out enough casks of wine and ale for all to drink the health of Lord Edmure and his bride We have thrown up three great feast tents on the far bank to provide them with some shelter from the rains

Your lord father is most kind My men will thank him They have had a long wet ride

Edmure Tully edged his horse forward When shall I meet my betrothed

She waits for you within promised Edwyn Frey You will forgive her if she seems shy I know She has been awaiting this day most anxiously poor maid But perhaps we might continue this out of the rain

Truly Ser Ryman mounted up again pulling Petyr Pimple up behind him If you would follow me my father awaits He turned the palfrey’s head back toward the Twins

Edmure fell in beside Catelyn The Late Lord Frey might have seen fit to welcome us in person he complained I am his liege lord as well as his son-to-be and Robb’s his king

When you are one-and-ninety Brother see how eager you are to go riding in the rain Yet she wondered if that was the whole truth of it Lord Walder normally went about in a covered litter which would have kept the worst of the rain off him A deliberate slight If so it might be the first of many yet to come

There was more trouble at the gatehouse Grey Wind balked in the middle of the drawbridge shook the rain off and howled at the portcullis Robb whistled impatiently Grey Wind What is it Grey Wind with me But the direwolf only bared his teeth He does not like this place Catelyn thought Robb had to squat and speak softly to the wolf before he would consent to pass beneath the portcullis By then Lame Lothar and Walder Rivers had come up It’s the sound of the water he fears Rivers said Beasts know to avoid the river in flood

A dry kennel and a leg of mutton will see him right again said Lothar cheerfully Shall I summon our master of hounds

He’s a direwolf not a dog said Robb and dangerous to men he does not trust Ser Raynald stay with him I won’t take him into Lord Walder’s hall like this
