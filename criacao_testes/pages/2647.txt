1321 Yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and
for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads

1322 So it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with
Saul and Jonathan but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there
found

1323 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
Michmash

141 Now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan the son of Saul
said unto the young man that bare his armour Come and let us go over
to the Philistines garrison that is on the other side But he told
not his father

142 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
pomegranate tree which is in Migron and the people that were with him
were about six hundred men 143 And Ahiah the son of Ahitub
Ichabods brother the son of Phinehas the son of Eli the LORDs
priest in Shiloh wearing an ephod And the people knew not that
Jonathan was gone

144 And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one
side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was
Bozez and the name of the other Seneh

145 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
Michmash and the other southward over against Gibeah

146 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour Come
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be
that the LORD will work for us for there is no restraint to the LORD
to save by many or by few

147 And his armourbearer said unto him Do all that is in thine
heart turn thee behold I am with thee according to thy heart

148 Then said Jonathan Behold we will pass over unto these men and
we will discover ourselves unto them

149 If they say thus unto us Tarry until we come to you then we
will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them

1410 But if they say thus Come up unto us then we will go up for
the LORD hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign
unto us

1411 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines and the Philistines said Behold the Hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves

1412 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
armourbearer and said Come up to us and we will shew you a thing
And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer Come up after me for the
LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel

1413 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and
his armourbearer after him and they fell before Jonathan and his
armourbearer slew after him

1414 And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer
made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land
which a yoke of oxen might plow

1415 And there was trembling in the host in the field and among all
the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and
the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling

1416 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked and
behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one
another

1417 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him Number now
and see who is gone from us And when they had numbered behold
Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there

1418 And Saul said unto Ahiah Bring hither the ark of God For the
ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel

1419 And it came to pass while Saul talked unto the priest that the
noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased
and Saul said unto the priest Withdraw thine hand

1420 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
themselves and they came to the battle and behold every mans
sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture

1421 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
time which went up with them into the camp from the country round
about even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with
Saul and Jonathan

1422 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
Ephraim when they heard that the Philistines fled even they also
followed hard after them in the battle

1423 So the LORD saved Israel that day and the battle passed over
unto Bethaven
