Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments but instead he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast The bridge was down again Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat When Sansa peered down she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below She averted her eyes quickly afraid to ask afraid to look too long afraid he might be someone she knew

They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers seated at the head of a long table littered with papers candles and blocks of sealing wax The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door

Your Grace Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face I’ve brought the girl

Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her Her prince was not there but three of the king’s councillors were Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table while Lord Varys hovered over them smelling flowery All of them were clad in black she realized with a feeling of dread Mourning clothes…

The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice covering her from neck to bosom They were cut in the shape of teardrops as if the queen were weeping blood Cersei smiled to see her and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen Sansa my sweet child she said I know you’ve been asking for me I’m sorry that I could not send for you sooner Matters have been very unsettled and I have not had a moment I trust my people have been taking good care of you

Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant Your Grace thank you ever so much for asking Sansa said politely Only well no one will talk to us or tell us what’s happened…

Us Cersei seemed puzzled

We put the steward’s girl in with her Ser Boros said We did not know what else to do with her

The queen frowned Next time you will ask she said her voice sharp The gods only know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with

Jeyne’s scared Sansa said She won’t stop crying I promised her I’d ask if she could see her father

Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes

Her father is well isn’t he Sansa said anxiously She knew there had been fighting but surely no one would harm a steward Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword

Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn I won’t have Sansa fretting needlessly What shall we do with this little friend of hers my lords

Lord Petyr leaned forward I’ll find a place for her

Not in the city said the queen

Do you take me for a fool

The queen ignored that Ser Boros escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father that ought to calm her down I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber

As you command Your Grace Ser Boros said He bowed deeply spun on his heel and took his leave his long white cloak stirring the air behind him

Sansa was confused I don’t understand she said Where is Jeyne’s father Why can’t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it She had promised herself she would be a lady gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother the Lady Catelyn but all of a sudden she was scared again For a second she thought she might cry Where are you sending her She hasn’t done anything wrong she’s a good girl

She’s upset you the queen said gently We can’t be having that Not another word now Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne’s well taken care of I promise you She patted the chair beside her Sit down Sansa I want to talk to you

Sansa seated herself beside the queen Cersei smiled again but that did not make her feel any less anxious Varys was wringing his soft hands together Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him but she could feel Littlefinger staring Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on Goose bumps pimpled her skin

Sweet Sansa Queen Cersei said laying a soft hand on her wrist Such a beautiful child I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you

You do Sansa said breathless Littlefinger was forgotten Her prince loved her Nothing else mattered

The queen smiled I think of you almost as my own daughter And I know the love you bear for Joffrey She gave a weary shake of her head I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father You must be brave child

Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill What is it

Your father is a traitor dear Lord Varys said

Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head With my own ears I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons And yet the moment the king was dead he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne
