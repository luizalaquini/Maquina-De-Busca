I’ve always loved my sister and you owe me two answers Do all my kin still live

Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross I am told

Jaime was unmoved Uncle Dolt my sister called him It’s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me As well as my lord father

They live all three But not long if the gods are good

Jaime drank some more wine Ask your next

Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie How did my son Bran come to fall

I flung him from a window

The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant If I had a knife I would kill him now she thought until she remembered the girls Her throat constricted as she said You were a knight sworn to defend the weak and innocent

He was weak enough but perhaps not so innocent He was spying on us

Bran would not spy

Then blame those precious gods of yours who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see

Blame the gods she said incredulous Yours was the hand that threw him You meant for him to die

His chains chinked softly I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health Yes I meant for him to die

And when he did not you knew your danger was worse than ever so you gave your catspaw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake

Did I now Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow I won’t deny we talked of it but you were with the boy day and night your maester and Lord Eddard attended him frequently and there were guards even those damned direwolves    it would have required cutting my way through half of Winterfell And why bother when the boy seemed like to die of his own accord

If you lie to me this session is at an end Catelyn held out her hands to show him her fingers and palms The man who came to slit Bran’s throat gave me these scars You swear you had no part in sending him

On my honor as a Lannister

Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than this She kicked over the waste pail Foul-smelling brown ooze crept across the floor of the cell soaking into the straw

Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow I may indeed have shit for honor I won’t deny it but I have never yet hired anyone to do my killing Believe what you will Lady Stark but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him myself

Gods be merciful he’s telling the truth If you did not send the killer your sister did

If so I’d know Cersei keeps no secrets from me

Then it was the Imp

Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran He wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s window spying

Then why did the assassin have his dagger

What dagger was this

It was so long she said holding her hands apart plain but finely made with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day

Lannister poured drank poured and stared into his wine cup This wine seems to be improving as I drink it Imagine that I seem to remember that dagger now that you describe it Won it you say How

Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers Yet when she heard her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong No    was it the other way

Tyrion always backed me in the lists Jaime said but that day Ser Loras unhorsed me A mischance I took the boy too lightly but no matter Whatever my brother wagered he lost    but that dagger did change hands I recall it now Robert showed it to me that night at the feast His Grace loved to salt my wounds especially when drunk And when was he not drunk

Tyrion Lannister had said much the same thing as they rode through the Mountains of the Moon Catelyn remembered She had refused to believe him Petyr had sworn otherwise Petyr who had been almost a brother Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her hand    and yet if Jaime and Tyrion told the same tale what did that mean The brothers had not seen each other since departing Winterfell more than a year ago Are you trying to deceive me Somewhere there was a trap here

I’ve admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window what would it gain me to lie about this knife He tossed down another cup of wine Believe what you will I’m past caring what people say of me And it’s my turn Have Robert’s brothers taken the field

They have

Now there’s a niggardly response Give me more than that or your next answer will be as poor

Stannis marches against King’s Landing she said grudgingly Renly is dead murdered at Bitterbridge by his brother through some black art I do not understand

A pity Jaime said I rather liked Renly though Stannis is quite another tale What side have the Tyrells taken

Renly at first Now I could not say

Your boy must be feeling lonely

Robb was sixteen a few days past    a man grown and a king He’s won every battle he’s fought The last word we had from him he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings

He hasn’t faced my father yet has he

When he does he’ll defeat him As he did you

He took me unawares A craven’s trick

You dare talk of tricks Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoy’s garb under a peace banner

If it were one of your sons in this cell wouldn’t his brothers do as much for him

My son has no brothers she thought but she would not share her pain with a creature such as this

Jaime drank some more wine What’s a brother’s life when honor is at stake eh Another sip Tyrion is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom me

Catelyn could not deny it Robb’s bannermen would sooner see you dead Rickard Karstark in particular You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood

The two with the white sunburst were they Jaime gave a shrug If truth be told it was your son that I was trying to slay The others got in my way I killed them in fair fight in the heat of battle Any other knight would have done the same

How can you still count yourself a knight when you have forsaken every vow you ever swore

Jaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup So many vows    they make you swear and swear Defend the king Obey the king Keep his secrets Do his bidding Your life for his But obey your father Love your sister Protect the innocent Defend the weak Respect the gods Obey the laws It’s too much No matter what you do you’re forsaking one vow or the other He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed his eyes for an instant leaning his head back against the patch of nitre on the wall I was the youngest man ever to wear the white cloak

And the youngest to betray all it stood for Kingslayer
