At least they gave her a sword The wench held it one-handed moving sideways trying to put some distance between her and the bear That’s no good the ring’s too small She needed to attack to make a quick end to it Good steel was a match for any bear But the wench seemed afraid to close The Mummers showered her with insults and obscene suggestions

This is none of our concern Steelshanks warned Jaime Lord Bolton said the wench was theirs to do with as they liked

Her name’s Brienne Jaime descended the steps past a dozen startled sellswords Vargo Hoat had taken the lord’s box in the lowest tier Lord Vargo he called over the shouts

The Qohorik almost spilt his wine Kingthlayer The left side of his face was bandaged clumsily the linen over his ear spotted with blood

Pull her out of there

Thay out of thith Kingthlayer unleth you’d like another thump He waved a wine cup Your thee-mooth bit oth my ear Thmall wonder her father will not ranthom thuch a freak

A roar turned Jaime back around The bear was eight feet tall Gregor Clegane with a pelt he thought though likely smarter The beast did not have the reach the Mountain had with that monster greatsword of his though

Bellowing in fury the bear showed a mouth full of great yellow teeth then fell back to all fours and went straight at Brienne There’s your chance Jaime thought Strike Now

Instead she poked out ineffectually with the point of her blade The bear recoiled then came on rumbling Brienne slid to her left and poked again at the bear’s face This time he lifted a paw to swat the sword aside

He’s wary Jaime realized He’s gone up against other men He knows swords and spears can hurt him But that won’t keep him off her long Kill him he shouted but his voice was lost amongst all the other shouts If Brienne heard she gave no sign She moved around the pit keeping the wall at her back Too close If the bear pins her by the wall…

The beast turned clumsily too far and too fast Quick as a cat Brienne changed direction There’s the wench I remember She leapt in to land a cut across the bear’s back Roaring the beast went up on his hind legs again Brienne scrambled back away Where’s the blood Then suddenly he understood Jaime rounded on Hoat You gave her a tourney sword

The goat brayed laughter spraying him with wine and spittle Of courth

I’ll pay her bloody ransom Gold sapphires whatever you want Pull her out of there

You want her Go get her

So he did

He put his good hand on the marble rail and vaulted over rolling as he hit the sand The bear turned at the thump sniffing watching this new intruder warily Jaime scrambled to one knee Well what in seven hells do I do now He filled his fist with sand Kingslayer he heard Brienne say astonished

Jaime He uncoiled flinging the sand at the bear’s face The bear mauled the air and roared like blazes

What are you doing here

Something stupid Get behind me He circled toward her putting himself between Brienne and the bear

You get behind I have the sword

A swordwith no point and no edge Get behind me He saw something half-buried in the sand and snatched it up with his good hand It proved to be a human jawbone with some greenish flesh still clinging to it crawling with maggots Charming he thought wondering whose face he held The bear was edging closer so Jaime whipped his arm around and flung bone meat and maggots at the beast’s head He missed by a good yard I ought to lop my left hand off as well for all the good it does me

Brienne tried to dart around but he kicked her legs out from under her She fell in the sand clutching the useless sword Jaime straddled her and the bear came charging

There was a deep twang and a feathered shaft sprouted suddenly beneath the beast’s left eye Blood and slaver ran from his open mouth and another bolt took him in the leg The bear roared reared He saw Jaime and Brienne again and lumbered toward them More crossbows fired the quarrels ripping through fur and flesh At such short range the bowmen could hardly miss The shafts hit as hard as maces but the bear took another step The poor dumb brave brute When the beast swiped at him he danced aside shouting kicking sand The bear turned to follow his tormentor and took another two quarrels in the back He gave one last rumbling growl settled back onto his haunches stretched out on the bloodstained sand and died

Brienne got back to her knees clutching the sword and breathing short ragged breaths Steelshanks’s archers were winding their crossbows and reloading while the Bloody Mummers shouted curses and threats at them Rorge and Three Toes had swords out Jaime saw and Zollo was uncoiling his whip

You thlew my bear Vargo Hoat shrieked

And I’ll serve you the same if you give me trouble Steelshanks threw back We’re taking the wench

Her name is Brienne Jaime said Brienne the maid of Tarth You are still maiden I hope
