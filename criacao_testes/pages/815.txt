casting lots upon them what every man should take

1525 And it was the third hour and they crucified him

1526 And the superscription of his accusation was written over THE
KING OF THE JEWS

1527 And with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right
hand and the other on his left

1528 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith And he was
numbered with the transgressors

1529 And they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and
saying Ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three
days 1530 Save thyself and come down from the cross

1531 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
with the scribes He saved others himself he cannot save

1532 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross that
we may see and believe And they that were crucified with him reviled
him

1533 And when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour

1534 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying
Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted My God my
God why hast thou forsaken me  1535 And some of them that stood by
when they heard it said Behold he calleth Elias

1536 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a
reed and gave him to drink saying Let alone let us see whether
Elias will come to take him down

1537 And Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost

1538 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom

1539 And when the centurion which stood over against him saw that
he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said Truly this man was
the Son of God

1540 There were also women looking on afar off among whom was Mary
Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses and
Salome 1541 Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and
ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto
Jerusalem

1542 And now when the even was come because it was the preparation
that is the day before the sabbath 1543 Joseph of Arimathaea an
honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of God came
and went in boldly unto Pilate and craved the body of Jesus

1544 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto
him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead

1545 And when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to
Joseph

1546 And he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in
the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock
and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre

1547 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he
was laid

161 And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the
mother of James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might
come and anoint him

162 And very early in the morning the first day of the week they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun

163 And they said among themselves Who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre  164 And when they looked they saw
that the stone was rolled away for it was very great

165 And entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on
the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were
affrighted

166 And he saith unto them Be not affrighted Ye seek Jesus of
Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the
place where they laid him

167 But go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you

168 And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they
trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for
they were afraid

169 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven
devils

1610 And she went and told them that had been with him as they
