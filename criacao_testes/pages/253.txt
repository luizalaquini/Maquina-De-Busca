She is frightened my lord In the Eyrie she feels safe She kissed his wrinkled brow Robb will be waiting Will you see him And Brynden

Your son he whispered Yes Cat’s child… he had my eyes I remember When he was born Bring him… yes

And your brother

Her father glanced out over the rivers Blackfish he said Has he wed yet Taken some… girl to wife

Even on his deathbed Catelyn thought sadly He has not wed You know that Father Nor will he ever

I told him… commanded him Marry I was his lord He knows My right to make his match A good match A Redwyne Old House Sweet girl pretty… freckles… Bethany yes Poor child Still waiting Yes Still…

Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago Catelyn reminded him She has three children by him

Even so Lord Hoster muttered Even so Spit on the girl The Redwynes Spit on me His lord his brother… that Blackfish I had other offers Lord Bracken’s girl Walder Frey… any of three he said… Has he wed Anyone Anyone

No one Catelyn said yet he has come many leagues to see you fighting his way back to Riverrun I would not be here now if Ser Brynden had not helped us

He was ever a warrior her father husked That he could do Knight of the Gate yes He leaned back and closed his eyes inutterably weary Send him Later I’ll sleep now Too sick to fight Send him up later the Blackfish…

Catelyn kissed him gently smoothed his hair and left him there in the shade of his keep with his rivers flowing beneath He was asleep before she left the solar

When she returned to the lower bailey Ser Brynden Tully stood on the water stairs with wet boots talking with the captain of Riverrun’s guards He came to her at once Is he—

Dying she said As we feared

Her uncle’s craggy face showed his pain plain He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair Will he see me

She nodded He says he is too sick to fight

Brynden Blackfish chuckled I am too old a soldier to believe that Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre damn his bones

Catelyn smiled knowing it was true I do not see Robb

He went with Greyjoy to the hall I believe

Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun’s Great Hall enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her father’s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood Some tried to flee but we’d pinched the valley shut at both ends and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb’s got in among them I saw him tear one man’s arm from his shoulder and their horses went mad at the scent of him I couldn’t tell you how many men were thrown—

Theon she interrupted where might I find my son

Lord Robb went to visit the godswood my lady

It was what Ned would have done He is his father’s son as much as mine I must remember Oh gods Ned…

She found Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms kneeling before the heart tree a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce His longsword was before him the point thrust in the earth his gloved hands clasped around the hilt Around him others knelt Greatjon Umber Rickard Karstark Maege Mormont Galbart Glover and more Even Tytos Blackwood was among them the great raven cloak fanned out behind him These are the ones who keep the old gods she realized She asked herself what gods she kept these days and could not find an answer

It would not do to disturb them at their prayers The gods must have their due… even cruel gods who would take Ned from her and her lord father as well So Catelyn waited The river wind moved through the high branches and she could see the Wheel Tower to her right ivy crawling up its side As she stood there all the memories came flooding back to her Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm and over there beneath that bower she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr

She had not thought of that in years How young they all had been—she no older than Sansa Lysa younger than Arya and Petyr younger still yet eager The girls had traded him between them serious and giggling by turns It came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath There was always mint growing in the godswood and Petyr had liked to chew it He had been such a bold little boy always in trouble He tried to put his tongue in my mouth Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward when they were alone He did with me too Lysa had whispered shy and breathless I liked it

Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword and Catelyn found herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood Surely he must have She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances and some of the serving girls even ones as old as eighteen… he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword surely he had been kissed There were tears in her eyes She wiped them away angrily

Mother Robb said when he saw her standing there We must call a council There are things to be decided
