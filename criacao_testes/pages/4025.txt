down the chimney--Nay I shant YOU do it--That I wont
then--Bills to go down--Here Bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

  `Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he said
Alice to herself  `Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her  then saying to herself `This is Bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes
Bill then the Rabbits voice along--`Catch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his head--Brandy now--Dont choke him--How was it old fellow
What happened to you  Tell us all about it

  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice `Thats Bill
thought Alice `Well I hardly know--No more thank ye Im
better now--but Im a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
is something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes
like a sky-rocket

  `So you did old fellow said the others

  `We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could `If you do  Ill set
Dinah at you

  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
herself `I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they
began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say `A
barrowful will do to begin with

  `A barrowful of WHAT thought Alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
`Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
`Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  `If I eat one of these cakes she
thought `its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
suppose

  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by
two guinea-pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood

  `The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood `is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best plan

  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
`Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a cart-horse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
