56 Therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be
sober

57 For they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night

58 But let us who are of the day be sober putting on the
breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of
salvation

59 For God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by
our Lord Jesus Christ 510 Who died for us that whether we wake or
sleep we should live together with him

511 Wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another
even as also ye do

512 And we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among
you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you 513 And to
esteem them very highly in love for their works sake And be at peace
among yourselves

514 Now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort
the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men

515 See that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow
that which is good both among yourselves and to all men

516 Rejoice evermore

517 Pray without ceasing

518 In every thing give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you

519 Quench not the Spirit

520 Despise not prophesyings

521 Prove all things hold fast that which is good

522 Abstain from all appearance of evil

523 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ

524 Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it

525 Brethren pray for us

526 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss

527 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
holy brethren

528 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you Amen




The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


11 Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ 12 Grace
unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

13 We are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is meet
because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other aboundeth 14 So that we ourselves
glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure 15 Which is a
manifest token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer 16
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you 17 And to you who are troubled rest with us
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty
angels 18 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ 19 Who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord and from the glory of his power 110 When he shall come to
be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe
because our testimony among you was believed in that day

111 Wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count
you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness and the work of faith with power 112 That the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to
the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ

21 Now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and by our gathering together unto him 22 That ye be not
soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word
nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand

23 Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come
except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be
revealed the son of perdition 24 Who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God
