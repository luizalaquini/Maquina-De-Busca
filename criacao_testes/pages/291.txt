His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects Tyrion said with a crooked smile Was it Joffrey’s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too

Cersei sighed Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert’s death Varys suggested Ser Barristan Why not It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog He is very fond of Sandor Clegane We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse more than the useless old fool deserved

I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt’s gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud Gate

His sister looked very unhappy Janos should have sent more men He is not as competent as might be wished

Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon’s Kingsguard Tyrion reminded her pointedly He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen’s seven The smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight What do you imagine they’ll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon

Cersei glanced away I had not considered that

Father did said Tyrion That is why he sent me To put an end to these follies and bring your son to heel

Joff will be no more tractable for you than for me

He might

Why should he

He knows you would never hurt him

Cersei’s eyes narrowed If you believe I’d ever allow you to harm my son you’re sick with fever

Tyrion sighed She’d missed the point as she did so often Joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you he assured her but so long as the boy feels threatened he’ll be more inclined to listen He took her hand I am your brother you know You need me whether you care to admit it or no Your son needs me if he’s to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair

His sister seemed shocked that he would touch her You have always been cunning

In my own small way He grinned

It may be worth the trying… but make no mistake Tyrion If I accept you you shall be the King’s Hand in name but my Hand in truth You will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act and you will do nothing without my consent Do you understand

Oh yes

Do you agree

Certainly he lied I am yours sister For as long as I need to be So now that we are of one purpose we ought have no more secrets between us You say Joffrey had Lord Eddard killed Varys dismissed Ser Barristan and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt Who murdered Jon Arryn 

Cersei yanked her hand back How should I know

The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me Where did she come by that notion I wonder

I’m sure I don’t know That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing He hinted that Lord Arryn suspected or… well believed…

That you were fucking our sweet Jaime

She slapped him

Did you think I was as blind as Father Tyrion rubbed his cheek Who you lie with is no matter to me… although it doesn’t seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other

She slapped him

Be gentle Cersei I’m only jesting with you If truth be told I’d sooner have a nice whore I never understood what Jaime saw in you apart from his own reflection
