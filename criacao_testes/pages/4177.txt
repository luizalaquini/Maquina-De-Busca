sneer at me -- -the very hills and sky seem to laugh at
me till I blush shamefuly for my folly I have lost my
respect my good name my standing -- -lost it never to
get it again Go and marry your man -- go on  
O sir -- -Mr Boldwood
 You may as well I have no further claim upon you
As for me I had better go somewhere alone and hide --
and pray I loved a woman once I am now ashamed
When I am dead theyll say Miserable love-sick man
that he was Heaven -- -heaven -- -if I had got jilted
secretly and the dishonour not known and my position

gone and the woman not
gained Shame upon him -- shame  
His unreasonable anger terrified her and she glided
from him without obviously moving as she said I am
only a girl -- do not speak to me so
All the time you knew -- how very well you knew --
that your new freak was my misery Dazzled by brass
and scarlet -- O Bathsheba -- this is womans folly
indeed  
She fired up at once You are taking too much
upon yourself   she said veheniently  Everybody is
upon me  -- everybody It is unmanly to attack a
woman so  I have nobody in the world to fight my
battles for me but no mercy is shown Yet if a
thousand of you sneer and say things against me I 1will1
1not1 be put down 
 Youll chatter with him doubtless about me Say to
him Boldwood would have died for me Yes and
you have given way to him knowing him to be not the
man for you He has kissed you -- claimed you as his
Do you hear -- he has kissed you Deny it  
The most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man
and although Boldwood was in vehemence and glow
nearly her own self rendered into another sex
Bathshebas cheek quivered She gasped  Leave me
sir -- leave me  I am nothing to you Let me go on 
Deny that he has kissed you
I shall not
 Ha -- then he has   came hoarsely from the farmer
He has she said slowly and in spite of her fear
defiantly I am not ashamed to speak the truth
Then curse him and curse him   said Boldwood
breaking into a whispered fury  Whilst I would have
given worlds to touch your hand you have let a rake come
in without right or ceremony and -- kiss you  Heavens
mercy -- kiss you   Ah a time of his life shall come
when he will have to repent and think wretchedly of
the pain he has caused another man  and then may he
ache and wish and curse and yearn -- as I do now  
Dont dont O dont pray down evil upon him

implored in a miserable cry Anything but that --
anything O be kind to him sir for I love him true 
Boldwoods ideas had reached that point of fusion at
which outline and consistency entirely disappear The
impending night appeared to concentrate in his eye
He did not hear her at all now
Ill punish him -- -by my soul that will I Ill meet
him soldier or no and Ill horsewhip the untimely
stripling for this reckless theft of my one delight If he
were a hundred men Id horsewhip him --  --  He
dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally Bath+
sheba sweet lost coquette pardon me  Ive been
blaming you threatening you behaving like a churl to
you when hes the greatest sinner He stole your dear
heart away with his unfathomable lies  lt is a
fortunate thing for him that hes gone back to his
regiment -- -that hes away up the country and not here
I hope he may not return here just yet I pray God
he may not come into my sight for I may be tempted
beyond myself O Bathsheba keep him away -- yes
keep him away from me
For a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this
that his soul seemed to have been entirely exhaled with
the breath of his passionate words He turned his face
away and withdrew and his form was soon covered over
by the twilight as his footsteps mixed in with the low
hiss of the leafy trees
Bathsheba who had been standing motionless as a
model all this latter time flung her hands to her face
and wildly attempted to ponder on the exhibition which
had just passed away Such astounding wells of fevered
feeling in a still man like Mr Boldwood were incompre+
hensible dreadful Instead of being a man trained to
repression he was -- what she had seen him
The force of the farmers threats lay in their relation to a
circumstance known at present only to herself her lover was
coming back to Weatherby in the course of the very next
day or two Troy had not returned to his distant barracks as
Boldwood and others supposed but had merely gone to visit
P 264
some acquaintance in Bath and had yet a wek or more
remaining to his furlough
 She felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at
this nick of time and came into contact with Boldwooda
