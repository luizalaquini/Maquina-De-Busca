THEON

There was no safe anchorage at Pyke but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on his father’s castle from the sea to see it as he had seen it last ten years before when Robert Baratheon’s war galley had borne him away to be a ward of Eddard Stark On that day he had stood beside the rail listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master’s drum while he watched Pyke dwindle in the distance Now he wanted to see it grow larger to rise from the sea before him

Obedient to his wishes the Myraham beat her way past the point with her sails snapping and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings Theon drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray and looked for home

The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs and the castle seemed one with the rest its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone wet by the same salt waves festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered thousands of years past All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god’s temple while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them

Drear dark forbidding Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars almost a part of them its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep each on its own island Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not

The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword the oldest part of the castle round and tall the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire

Above the Sea Tower snapped his father’s banner The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself but he knew the device it bore the golden kraken of House Greyjoy arms writhing and reaching against a black field The banner streamed from an iron mast shivering and twisting as the wind gusted like a bird struggling to take flight And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above casting its shadow down upon the Greyjoy kraken

Theon had never seen a more stirring sight In the sky behind the castle the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin scuttling clouds All the way from Riverrun to Seagard the Mallisters had argued about its meaning It is my comet Theon told himself sliding a hand into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given him paper as good as a crown

Does the castle look as you remember it milord the captain’s daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm

It looks smaller Theon confessed though perhaps that is only the distance The Myraham was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver so he stayed well out farther than Theon would have liked An ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the Great Keep but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft the crew nor the courage to attempt such a thing So they sailed past at a safe distance and Theon must content himself with seeing Pyke from afar Even so the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks

It must be windy there the captain’s daughter observed

He laughed Windy and cold and damp A miserable hard place in truth… but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men and hard men rule the world

The captain’s face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked May we make for port now milord

You may Theon said a faint smile playing about his lips The promise of gold had turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he’d hoped Ironborn captains were proud and willful and did not go in awe of a man’s blood The islands were too small for awe and a longship smaller still If every captain was a king aboard his own ship as was often said it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings And when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods The Drowned God makes men old King Urron Redhand had once said thousands of years ago but it’s men who make crowns

A longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well The Myraham was a wallowing tub if truth be told and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm Still Theon could not be too unhappy He was here undrowned and the voyage had offered certain other amusements He put an arm around the captain’s daughter Summon me when we make Lordsport he told her father We’ll be below in my cabin He led the girl away aft while her father watched them go in sullen silence

The cabin was the captain’s in truth but it had been turned over to Theon’s use when they sailed from Seagard The captain’s daughter had not been turned over to his use but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same A cup of wine a few whispers and there she was The girl was a shade plump for his taste with skin as splotchy as oatmeal but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her That was surprising at her age but Theon found it diverting He did not think the captain approved and that was amusing as well watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord the rich purse of gold he’d been promised never far from his thoughts

As Theon shrugged out of his wet cloak the girl said You must be so happy to see your home again milord How many years have you been away 

Ten or close as makes no matter he told her I was a boy of ten when I was taken to Winterfell as a ward of Eddard Stark A ward in name a hostage in truth Half his days a hostage… but no longer His life was his own again and nowhere a Stark to be seen He drew the captain’s daughter close and kissed her on her ear Take off your cloak

She dropped her eyes suddenly shy but did as he bid her When the heavy garment sodden with spray fell from her shoulders to the deck she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously She looked rather stupid when she smiled but he had never required a woman to be clever Come here he told her

She did I have never seen the Iron Islands

Count yourself fortunate Theon stroked her hair it was fine and dark though the wind had made a tangle of it The islands are stern and stony places scant of comfort and bleak of prospect Death is never far here and life is mean and meager Men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil If truth be told the miners have it worse than either breaking their backs down in the dark and for what Iron lead tin those are our treasures Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding

The stupid girl did not seem to be listening I could go ashore with you she said I would if it please you…

You could go ashore Theon agreed squeezing her breast but not with me I fear

I’d work in your castle milord I can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter Father says my peppercrab stew is the best he’s ever tasted You could find me a place in your kitchens and I could make you peppercrab stew

And warm my bed by night He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo them his fingers deft and practiced Once I might have carried you home as a prize and kept you to wife whether you willed it or no The ironmen of old did such things A man had his rock wife his true bride ironborn like himself but he had his salt wives too women captured on raids

The girl’s eyes grew wide and not because he had bared her breasts I would be your salt wife milord

I fear those days are gone Theon’s finger circled one heavy teat spiraling in toward the fat brown nipple No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword taking what we want Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter He took her nipple in his mouth and bit it until she gasped
