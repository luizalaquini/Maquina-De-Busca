Her broad homely face turned red Yes

Oh good Jaime said I only rescue maidens To Hoat he said You’ll have your ransom For both of us A Lannister pays his debts Now fetch some ropes and get us out of here

Bugger that Rorge growled Kill them Hoat Or you’ll bloody well wish you had

The Qohorik hesitated Half his men were drunk the northmen stone sober and there were twice as many Some of the crossbowmen had reloaded by now Pull them out Hoat said and then to Jaime I hath chothen to be merthiful Tell your lord father

I will my lord Not that it will do you any good

Not until they were half a league from Harrenhal and out of range of archers on the walls did Steelshanks Walton let his anger show Are you mad Kingslayer Did you mean to die No man can fight a bear with his bare hands

One bare hand and one bare stump Jaime corrected But I hoped you’d kill the beast before the beast killed me Elsewise Lord Bolton would have peeled you like an orange no

Steelshanks cursed him roundly for a fool of Lannister spurred his horse and galloped away up the column

Ser Jaime Even in soiled pink satin and torn lace Brienne looked more like a man in a gown than a proper woman I am grateful but… you were well away Why come back

A dozen quips came to mind each crueler than the one before but Jaime only shrugged I dreamed of you he said





Catelyn


Rob bid farewell to his young queen thrice Once in the godswood before the heart tree in sight of gods and men The second time beneath the portcullis where Jeyne sent him forth with a long embrace and a longer kiss And finally an hour beyond the Tumblestone when the girl came galloping up on a well-lathered horse to plead with her young king to take her along

Robb was touched by that Catelyn saw but abashed as well The day was damp and grey a drizzle had begun to fall and the last thing he wanted was to call a halt to his march so he could stand in the wet and console a tearful young wife in front of half his army He speaks her gently she thought as she watched them together but there is anger underneath

All the time the king and queen were talking Grey Wind prowled around them stopping only to shake the water from his coat and bare his teeth at the rain When at last Robb gave Jeyne one final kiss dispatched a dozen men to take her back to Riverrun and mounted his horse once more the direwolf raced off ahead as swift as an arrow loosed from a longbow

Queen Jeyne has a loving heart I see said Lame Lothar Frey to Catelyn Not unlike my own sisters Why I would wager a guess that even now Roslin is dancing round the Twins chanting ‘Lady Tully Lady Tully Lady Roslin Tully’ By the morrow she’ll be holding swatches of Riverrun red-and-blue to her cheek to picture how she’ll look in her bride’s cloak He turned in the saddle to smile at Edmure But you are strangely quiet Lord Tully How do you feel I wonder

Much as I did at the Stone Mill just before the warhorns sounded Edmure said only half in jest

Lothar gave a good-natured laugh Let us pray your marriage ends as happily my lord

And may the gods protect us if it does not Catelyn pressed her heels into her horse leaving her brother and Lame Lothar to each other’s company

It had been her who had insisted that Jeyne remain at Riverrun when Robb would sooner have kept her by his side Lord Walder might well construe the queen’s absence from the wedding as another slight yet her presence would have been a different sort of insult salt in the old man’s wound Walder Frey has a sharp tongue and a long memory she had warned her son I do not doubt that you are strong enough to suffer an old man’s rebukes as the price of his allegiance but you have too much of your father in you to sit there while he insults Jeyne to her face

Robb could not deny the sense of that Yet all the same he resents me for it Catelyn thought wearily He misses Jeyne already and some part of him blames me for her absence though he knows it was good counsel

Of the six Westerlings who had come with her son from the Crag only one remained by his side Ser Raynald Jeyne’s brother the royal banner-bearer Robb had dispatched Jeyne’s uncle Rolph Spicer to deliver young Martyn Lannister to the Golden Tooth the very day he received Lord Tywin’s assent to the exchange of captives It was deftly done Her son was relieved of his fear for Martyn’s safety Galbart Glover was relieved to hear that his brother Robett had been put on a ship at Duskendale Ser Rolph had important and honorable employment… and Grey Wind was at the king’s side once more Where he belongs

Lady Westerling had remained at Riverrun with her children Jeyne her little sister Eleyna and young Rollam Robb’s squire who complained bitterly about being left Yet that was wise as well Olyvar Frey had squired for Robb previously and would doubtless be present for his sister’s wedding to parade his replacement before him would be as unwise as it was unkind As for Ser Raynald he was a cheerful young knight who swore that no insult of Walder Frey’s could possibly provoke him And let us pray that insults are all we need to contend with

Catelyn had her fears on that score though Her lord father had never trusted Walder Frey after the Trident and she was ever mindful of that Queen Jeyne would be safest behind the high strong walls of Riverrun with the Blackfish to protect her Robb had even created him a new title Warden of the Southern Marches Ser Brynden would hold the Trident if any man could

All the same Catelyn would miss her uncle’s craggy face and Robb would miss his counsel Ser Brynden had played a part in every victory her son had won Galbart Glover had taken command of the scouts and outriders in his place a good man loyal and steady but without the Blackfish’s brilliance
