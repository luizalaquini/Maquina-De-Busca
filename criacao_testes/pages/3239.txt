rebuke him and if he repent forgive him

174 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven
times in a day turn again to thee saying I repent thou shalt
forgive him

175 And the apostles said unto the Lord Increase our faith

176 And the Lord said If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
might say unto this sycamine tree Be thou plucked up by the root and
be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you

177 But which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field Go and
sit down to meat  178 And will not rather say unto him Make ready
wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me till I have eaten
and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink  179 Doth he
thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him
I trow not

1710 So likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which
are commanded you say We are unprofitable servants we have done
that which was our duty to do

1711 And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed
through the midst of Samaria and Galilee

1712 And as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men
that were lepers which stood afar off 1713 And they lifted up their
voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us

1714 And when he saw them he said unto them Go shew yourselves unto
the priests And it came to pass that as they went they were
cleansed

1715 And one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back
and with a loud voice glorified God 1716 And fell down on his face
at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan

1717 And Jesus answering said Were there not ten cleansed but where
are the nine  1718 There are not found that returned to give glory
to God save this stranger

1719 And he said unto him Arise go thy way thy faith hath made
thee whole

1720 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of
God should come he answered them and said The kingdom of God cometh
not with observation 1721 Neither shall they say Lo here or lo
there for behold the kingdom of God is within you

1722 And he said unto the disciples The days will come when ye
shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man and ye shall
not see it

1723 And they shall say to you See here or see there go not after
them nor follow them

1724 For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under
heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the
Son of man be in his day

1725 But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this
generation

1726 And as it was in the days of Noe so shall it be also in the
days of the Son of man

1727 They did eat they drank they married wives they were given in
marriage until the day that Noe entered into the ark and the flood
came and destroyed them all

1728 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot they did eat they
drank they bought they sold they planted they builded 1729 But
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone
from heaven and destroyed them all

1730 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
revealed

1731 In that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff
in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in
the field let him likewise not return back

1732 Remember Lots wife

1733 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and
whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it

1734 I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the
one shall be taken and the other shall be left

1735 Two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken
and the other left

1736 Two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the
other left

1737 And they answered and said unto him Where Lord And he said
unto them Wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be
