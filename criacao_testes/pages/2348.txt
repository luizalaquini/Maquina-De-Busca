The best dressed perhaps Jaime thought but for once he did not say it The arrogance had gone out of Ser Loras the moment he began to speak of Renly He answered truly He is proud and reckless and full of piss but he is not false Not yet As you say One more thing and you may return to your duties

Yes my lord

I still have Brienne of Tarth in a tower cell

The boy’s mouth hardened A black cell would be better

You are certain that’s what she deserves

She deserves death I told Renly that a woman had no place in the Rainbow Guard She won the mêlée with a trick

I seem to recall another knight who was fond of tricks He once rode a mare in heat against a foe mounted on a bad-tempered stallion What sort of trickery did Brienne use

Ser Loras flushed She leapt    it makes no matter She won I grant her that His Grace put a rainbow cloak around her shoulders And she killed him Or let him die

A large difference there The difference between my crime and the shame of Boros Blount

She had sworn to protect him Ser Emmon Cuy Ser Robar Royce Ser Parmen Crane they’d sworn as well How could anyone have hurt him with her inside his tent and the others just outside Unless they were part of it

There were five of you at the wedding feast Jaime pointed out How could Joffrey die Unless you were part of it

Ser Loras drew himself up stiffly There was nothing we could have done

The wench says the same She grieves for Renly as you do I promise you I never grieve for Aerys Brienne’s ugly and pighead stubborn But she lacks the wits to be a liar and she is loyal past the point of sense She swore an oath to bring me to King’s Landing and here I sit This hand I lost    well that was my doing as much as hers Considering all she did to protect me I have no doubt that she would have fought for Renly had there been a foe to fight But a shadow Jaime shook his head Draw your sword Ser Loras Show me how you’d fight a shadow I should like to see that

Ser Loras made no move to rise She fled he said She and Catelyn Stark they left him in his blood and ran Why would they if it was not their work He stared at the table Renly gave me the van Otherwise it would have been me helping him don his armor He often entrusted that task to me We had    we had prayed together that night I left him with her Ser Parmen and Ser Emmon were guarding the tent and Ser Robar Royce was there as well Ser Emmon swore Brienne had    although   

Yes Jaime prompted sensing a doubt

The gorget was cut through One clean stroke through a steel gorget Renly’s armor was the best the finest steel How could she do that I tried myself and it was not possible She’s freakish strong for a woman but even the Mountain would have needed a heavy axe And why armor him and then cut his throat He gave Jaime a confused look If not her though    how could it be a shadow

Ask her Jaime came to a decision Go to her cell Ask your questions and hear her answers If you are still convinced that she murdered Lord Renly I will see that she answers for it The choice will be yours Accuse her or release her All I ask is that you judge her fairly on your honor as a knight

Ser Loras stood I shall On my honor

We are done then

The younger man started for the door But there he turned back Renly thought she was absurd A woman dressed in man’s mail pretending to be a knight

If he’d ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace he would not have complained

I asked him why he kept her close if he thought her so grotesque He said that all his other knights wanted things of him castles or honors or riches but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him When I saw him all bloody with her fled and the three of them unharmed    if she’s innocent then Robar and Emmon    He could not seem to say the words

Jaime had not stopped to consider that aspect of it I would have done the same ser The lie came easy but Ser Loras seemed grateful for it

When he was gone the Lord Commander sat alone in the white room wondering The Knight of Flowers had been so mad with grief for Renly that he had cut down two of his own Sworn Brothers but it had never occurred to Jaime to do the same with the five who had failed Joffrey He was my son my secret son    What am I if I do not lift the hand I have left to avenge mine own blood and seed He ought to kill Ser Boros at least just to be rid of him

He looked at his stump and grimaced I must do something about that If the late Ser Jacelyn Bywater could wear an iron hand he should have a gold one Cersei might like that A golden hand to stroke her golden hair and hold her hard against me

His hand could wait though There were other things to tend to first There were other debts to pay





SANSA

The ladder to the forecastle was steep and splintery so Sansa accepted a hand up from Lothor Brune Ser Lothor she had to remind herself the man had been knighted for his valor in the Battle of the Blackwater Though no proper knight would wear those patched brown breeches and scuffed boots nor that cracked and water-stained leather jerkin A square-faced stocky man with a squashed nose and a mat of nappy grey hair Brune spoke seldom He is stronger than he looks though She could tell by the ease with which he lifted her as if she weighed nothing at all

Off the bow of the Merling King stretched a bare and stony strand windswept treeless and uninviting Even so it made a welcome sight They had been a long while clawing their way back on course The last storm had swept them out of sight of land and sent such waves crashing over the sides of the galley that Sansa had been certain they were all going to drown Two men had been swept overboard she had heard old Oswell saying and another had fallen from the mast and broken his neck

She had seldom ventured out on deck herself Her little cabin was dank and cold but Sansa had been sick for most of the voyage    sick with terror sick with fever or seasick    she could keep nothing down and even sleep came hard Whenever she closed her eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at his collar clawing at the soft skin of his throat dying with flakes of pie crust on his lips and wine stains on his doublet And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he’d made as he fought to draw in air Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well He did nothing she told Littlefinger once when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were feeling any better

He did not kill Joffrey true but the dwarf’s hands are far from clean He had a wife before you did you know that

He told me

And did he tell you that when he grew bored with her he made a gift of her to his father’s guardsmen He might have done the same to you in time Shed no tears for the Imp my lady

The wind ran salty fingers through her hair and Sansa shivered Even this close to shore the rolling of the ship made her tummy queasy She desperately needed a bath and a change of clothes I must look as haggard as a corpse and smell of vomit

Lord Petyr came up beside her cheerful as ever Good morrow The salt air is bracing don’t you think It always sharpens my appetite He put a sympathetic arm about her shoulders Are you quite well You look so pale

It’s only my tummy The seasickness

A little wine will be good for that We’ll get you a cup as soon as we’re ashore Petyr pointed to where an old flint tower stood outlined against a bleak grey sky the breakers crashing on the rocks beneath it Cheerful is it not I fear there’s no safe anchorage here We’ll put ashore in a boat

Here She did not want to go ashore here The Fingers were a dismal place she’d heard and there was something forlorn and desolate about the little tower Couldn’t I stay on the ship until we make sail for White Harbor

From here the King turns east for Braavos Without us

But    my lord you said    you said we were sailing home

And there it stands miserable as it is My ancestral home It has no name I fear A great lord’s seat ought to have a name wouldn’t you agree Winterfell the Eyrie Riverrun those are castles Lord of Harrenhal now that has a sweet ring to it but what was I before Lord of Sheepshit and Master of the Drearfort It lacks a certain something His grey-green eyes regarded her innocently You look distraught Did you think we were making for Winterfell sweetling Winterfell has been taken burned and sacked All those you knew and loved are dead What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen are warring amongst themselves Even the Wall is under attack Winterfell was the home of your childhood Sansa but you are no longer a child You’re a woman grown and you need to make your own home

But not here she said dismayed It looks so   

   small and bleak and mean It’s all that and less The Fingers are a lovely place if you happen to be a stone But have no fear we shan’t stay more than a fortnight I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us He smiled The Lady Lysa and I are to be wed

Wed Sansa was stunned You and my aunt

The Lord of Harrenhal and the Lady of the Eyrie

You said it was my mother you loved But of course Lady Catelyn was dead so even if she had loved Petyr secretly and given him her maidenhood it made no matter now

So silent my lady said Petyr I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing It is a rare thing for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon Arryn

I    I pray you will have long years together and many children and be very happy in one another It had been years since Sansa last saw her mother’s sister She will be kind to me for my mother’s sake surely She’s my own blood And the Vale of Arryn was beautiful all the songs said so Perhaps it would not be so terrible to stay here for a time
