 the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves one
might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the
staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of
those under them It seemed that the omen was an
unpropitious one for as the rather untoward commence+
ment of Oaks overtures just as he arrived by the garden
gate he saw a cat inside going into various arched shapes
and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George
The dog took no notice  for he had arrived at an age
at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided
as a waste of breath -- -in fact he never barked even
at the sheep except to order when it was done with
an absolutely neutral countenance as a sort of Com+
mination-service which though offensive had to be
gone through once now and then to frighten the flock
for their own good
A voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into
which the cat had run
Poor dear Did a nasty brute of a dog want to
kill it -- did he poor dear 
I beg your pardon said Oak to the voice but
George was walking on behind me with a temper as
mild as milk
Almost before he had ceased speaking Oak was
seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient
of his answer Nobody appeared and he heard the
person retreat among the bushes
Gabriel meditated and so deeply that he brought
small furrows into his forehead by sheer force of
reverie Where the
P 76
issue of an interview is as likely
to be a vast change for the worse as for the better
any initial difference from expectation causes nipping
sensations of failure Oak went up to the door a little
abashed  his mental rehearsal and the reality had had
no common grounds of opening
Bathshebas aunt was indoors  Will you tell Miss
Everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to
her said Mr Oak Calling ones self merely Some+
body without giving a name is not to be taken as
an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world it
springs from a refined modesty of which townspeople
with their cards and announcements have no notion
whatever
Bathsheba was out The voice had evidently been
hers
 Will you come in Mr Oak  
Oh thank ee said Gabriel following her to the
fireplace Ive brought a lamb for Miss Everdene
I thought she might like one to rear girls do
 She might said Mrs Hurst musingly   though
shes only a visitor here If you will wait a minute
Bathsheba will be in
 Yes I will wait said Gabriel sitting down  The
lamb isnt really the business I came about Mrs Hurst
In short I was going to ask her if shed like to be
married
And were you indeed 
 Yes Because if she would I should be very glad
to marry her Dye know if shes got any other young
man hanging about her at all 
Let me think said Mrs Hurst poking the fire
superfluously  Yes -- bless you ever so many young
men You see Farmer Oak shes so good-looking and
an excellent scholar besides -- she was going to be a
governess once you know only she was too wild Not
that her young men ever come here -- but Lord in the
nature of women she must have a dozen  
 Thats unfortunate said Farmer Oak contemplating
a crack in the stone floor with sorrow Im only an
every-day sort of man and my only chance was in being
the first comer  Well theres no use in my waiting
for that was all I came about so Ill take myself off
home-along Mrs Hurst
When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards
along the
P 77
down he heard a hoi-hoi   uttered behind
him in a piping note of more treble quality than that
in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when
shouted across a field He looked round and saw a girl
racing after him waving a white handkerchief
Oak stood still -- and the runner drew nearer It was
Bathsheba Everdene Gabriels colour deepened hers
was already deep not as it appeared from emotion
but from running
Farmer Oak -- I --  she said pausing for want of
breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face
and putting her hand to her side
I have just called to see you  said Gabriel pending
her further speech
Yes-I know that she said panting like a robin
her face red and moist from her exertions like a peony
petal before the sun dries off the dew I didnt know
you had come to ask to have me or I should have come
in from the garden instantly I ran after you to say --
that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from
courting me --  --  -- 
Gabriel expandedIm sorry to have made you
