All but one have certainly been used as the basis for synthesis and
the table includes reference to published descriptions

Each method has advantages and disadvantages  Series decomposition obviates
the need for control over the amplitudes of individual formants but does
not allow synthesis of sounds which use the nasal tract as well as the oral
one for these are in parallel  Analogue implementation of series synthesizers
is complicated by the need for higher-pole correction and the fact that
the gains at different frequencies can vary widely throughout the system
Higher-pole correction is not so important for digital synthesizers
Parallel decomposition eliminates some of these problems  higher-pole correction
can be implemented individually for each formant  However the formant
amplitudes must be controlled rather precisely to simulate the vocal tract
which is essentially serial
Time-domain synthesis is associated with low hardware costs but does not
easily allow proper control over the excitation sources  In particular
it cannot simulate dynamical movement of the spectrum during aspiration
Implementation of the entire vocal tract model as a single high-order filter
without breaking it down into individual formants in series or parallel
is attractive from the computational point of view because less arithmetic
operations are required  It is best analysed in terms of linear predictive
coding which is the subject of the next chapter

Historically-minded readers should look at the early speech synthesizer
designed by Lawrence 1953
This and other classic papers on the subject
are reprinted in Flanagan and Rabiner 1973
A good description of a quite sophisticated parallel synthesizer can
be found in Holmes 1973 above and another of a switchable
seriesparallel one in Klatt 1980 who even includes a listing of
the Fortran program that implements it
Here are some useful books on speech synthesizers

and this book marks the beginning of modern speech synthesis

This book is the speech researchers bible and like the bible its not
all that easy to read
However it is an essential reference source for speech acoustics and
speech synthesis as well as for human speech perception
