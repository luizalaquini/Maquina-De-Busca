You can put it in me again if it please you she whispered in his ear as he sucked

When he raised his head from her breast the skin was dark red where his mouth had marked her It would please me to teach you something new Unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth

With my mouth

His thumb brushed lightly over her full lips It’s what those lips were made for sweetling If you were my salt wife you’d do as I command

She was timid at first but learned quickly for such a stupid girl which pleased him Her mouth was as wet and sweet as her cunt and this way he did not have to listen to her mindless prattle Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair Once When we still kept the Old Way lived by the axe instead of the pick taking what we would be it wealth women or glory In those days the ironborn did not work mines that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep War was an ironman’s proper trade The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song

Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren gave Harren’s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands even behind the high stone halls of Pyke Theon’s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow

It had been to bring back the Old Way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that Lord Balon had staged his great rebellion Robert Baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope with the help of his friend Eddard Stark but both men were dead now Mere boys ruled in their stead and the realm that Aegon the Conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered This is the season Theon thought as the captain’s daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him the season the year the day and I am the man He smiled crookedly wondering what his father would say when Theon told him that he the last-born babe and hostage he had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed

His climax came on him sudden as a storm and he filled the girl’s mouth with his seed Startled she tried to pull away but Theon held her tight by the hair Afterward she crawled up beside him Did I please milord

Well enough he told her

It tasted salty she murmured

Like the sea

She nodded I have always loved the sea milord

As I have he said rolling her nipple idly between his fingers It was true The sea meant freedom to the men of the Iron Islands He had forgotten that until the Myraham had raised sail at Seagard The sounds brought old feelings back the creak of wood and rope the captain’s shouted commands the snap of the sails as the wind filled them each as familiar as the beating of his own heart and as comforting I must remember this Theon vowed to himself I must never go far from the sea again

Take me with you milord the captain’s daughter begged I don’t need to go to your castle I can stay in some town and be your salt wife She reached out to stroke his cheek

Theon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk My place is Pyke and yours is on this ship

I can’t stay here now

He laced up his breeches Why not

My father she told him Once you’re gone he’ll punish me milord He’ll call me names and hit me

Theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders Fathers are like that he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp Tell him he should be pleased As many times as I’ve fucked you you’re likely with child It’s not every man who has the honor of raising a king’s bastard She looked at him stupidly so he left her there

The Myraham was rounding a wooded point Below the pine-clad bluffs a dozen fishing boats were pulling in their nets The big cog stayed well out from them tacking Theon moved to the bow for a better view He saw the castle first the stronghold of the Botleys When he was a boy it had been timber and wattle but Robert Baratheon had razed that structure to the ground Lord Sawane had rebuilt in stone for now a small square keep crowned the hill Pale green flags drooped from the squat corner towers each emblazoned with a shoal of silvery fish

Beneath the dubious protection of the fish-ridden little castle lay the village of Lordsport its harbor aswarm with ships When last he’d seen Lordsport it had been a smoking wasteland the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes After ten years few traces of the war remained The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old and cut fresh sod for their roofs A new inn had risen beside the landing twice the size of the old one with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber The sept beyond had never been rebuilt though only a seven-sided foundation remained where it had stood Robert Baratheon’s fury had soured the ironmen’s taste for the new gods it would seem

Theon was more interested in ships than gods Among the masts of countless fishing boats he spied a Tyroshi trading galley off-loading beside a lumbering Ibbenese cog with her black-tarred hull A great number of longships fifty or sixty at the least stood out to sea or lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north Some of the sails bore devices from the other islands the blood moon of Wynch Lord Goodbrother’s banded black warhorn Harlaw’s silver scythe Theon searched for his uncle Euron’s Silence Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign but his father’s Great Kraken was there her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake

Had Lord Balon anticipated him and called the Greyjoy banners His hand went inside his cloak again to the oilskin pouch No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark they were no fools to entrust their secrets to a bird Still Lord Balon was no fool either He might well have guessed why his son was coming home at long last and acted accordingly

The thought did not please him His father’s war was long done and lost This was Theon’s hour—his plan his glory and in time his crown Yet if the longships are hosting…

It might be only a caution now that he thought on it A defensive move lest the war spill out across the sea Old men were cautious by nature His father was old now and so too his uncle Victarion who commanded the Iron Fleet His uncle Euron was a different song to be sure but the Silence did not seem to be in port It’s all for the good Theon told himself This way I shall be able to strike all the more quickly

As the Myraham made her way landward Theon paced the deck restlessly scanning the shore He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside but surely his father would have sent someone to meet him Sylas Sourmouth the steward Lord Botley perhaps even Dagmer Cleftjaw It would be good to look on Dagmer’s hideous old face again It was not as though they had no word of his arrival Robb had sent ravens from Riverrun and when they’d found no longship at Seagard Jason Mallister had sent his own birds to Pyke supposing that Robb’s were lost

Yet he saw no familiar faces no honor guard waiting to escort him from Lordsport to Pyke only smallfolk going about their small business Shorehands rolled casks of wine off the Tyroshi trader fisherfolk cried the day’s catch children ran and played A priest in the seawater robes of the Drowned God was leading a pair of horses along the pebbled shore while above him a slattern leaned out a window in the inn calling out to some passing Ibbenese sailors
