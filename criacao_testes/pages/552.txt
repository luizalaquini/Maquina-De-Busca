There is a way

I am ironborn Theon reminded him I have my own way What choice have they left me No don’t answer I’ve heard enough of your counsel Go and send those birds as I commanded and tell Lorren I want to see him And Wex as well I’ll have my mail scoured clean and my garrison assembled in the yard

For a moment he thought the maester was going to defy him But finally Luwin bowed stiffly As you command

They made a pitifully small assembly the ironmen were few the yard large The northmen will be on us before nightfall he told them Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to his call I will not run from them I took this castle and I mean to hold it to live or die as Prince of Winterfell But I will not command any man to die with me If you leave now before Ser Rodrik’s main force is upon us there’s still a chance you may win free He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt Those who would stay and fight step forward

No one spoke The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather as still as if they were made of stone A few exchanged looks Urzen shuffled his feet Dykk Harlaw hawked and spat A finger of wind ruffled Endehar’s long fair hair

Theon felt as though he were drowning Why am I surprised he thought bleakly His father had forsaken him his uncles his sister even that wretched creature Reek Why should his men prove any more loyal There was nothing to say nothing to do He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky sword in hand waiting waiting…

Wex was the first to cross the line Three quick steps and he stood at Theon’s side slouching Shamed by the boy Black Lorren followed all scowls Who else he demanded Red Rolfe came forward Kromm Werlag Tymor and his brothers Ulf the Ill Harrag Sheepstealer Four Harlaws and two Botleys Kenned the Whale was the last Seventeen in all

Urzen was among those who did not move and Stygg and every man of the ten that Asha had brought from Deepwood Motte Go then Theon told them Run to my sister She’ll give you all a warm welcome I have no doubt

Stygg had the grace at least to look ashamed The rest moved off without a word Theon turned to the seventeen who remained Back to the walls If the gods should spare us I shall remember every man of you

Black Lorren stayed when the others had gone The castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins

I know that What would you have me do

Put them out said Lorren Every one

Theon shook his head Is the noose ready

It is You mean to use it

Do you know a better way

Aye I’ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge and let them come try me One at a time two three it makes no matter None will pass the moat while I still draw breath

He means to die thought Theon It’s not victory he wants it’s an end worthy of a song We’ll use the noose

As you say Lorren replied contempt in his eyes

Wex helped garb him for battle Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather Once armed and armored Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle It was hard to judge their numbers A thousand at least perhaps twice that many Against seventeen They’d brought catapults and scorpions He saw no siege towers rumbling up the kingsroad but there was timber enough in the wolfswood to build as many as were required

Theon studied their banners through Maester Luwin’s Myrish lens tube The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever he looked and there were Tallhart trees as well and mermen from White Harbor Less common were the sigils of Flint and Karstark Here and there he even saw the bull moose of the Hornwoods But no Glovers Asha saw to them no Boltons from the Dreadfort no Umbers come down from the shadow of the Wall Not that they were needed Soon enough the boy Cley Cerwyn appeared before the gates carrying a peace banner on a tall staff to announce that Ser Rodrik Cassel wished to parley with Theon Turncloak

Turncloak The name was bitter as bile He had gone to Pyke to lead his father’s longships against Lannisport he remembered I shall be out shortly he shouted down Alone

Black Lorren disapproved Only blood can wash out blood he declared Knights may keep their truces with other knights but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing with those they deem outlaw

Theon bristled I am the Prince of Winterfell and heir to the Iron Islands Now go find the girl and do as I told you

Black Lorren gave him a murderous look Aye Prince

He’s turned against me too Theon realized Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones of Winterfell had turned against him If I die I die friendless and abandoned What choice did that leave him but to live

He rode to the gatehouse with his crown on his head A woman was drawing water from the well and Gage the cook stood in the door of the kitchens They hid their hatred behind sullen looks and faces blank as slate yet he could feel it all the same

When the drawbridge was lowered a chill wind sighed across the moat The touch of it made him shiver It is the cold nothing more Theon told himself a shiver not a tremble Even brave men shiver Into the teeth of that wind he rode under the portcullis over the drawbridge The outer gates swung open to let him pass As he emerged beneath the walls he could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been
