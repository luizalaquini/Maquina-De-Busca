and Simon called Zelotes 616 And Judas the brother of James and
Judas Iscariot which also was the traitor

617 And he came down with them and stood in the plain and the
company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all
Judaea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon which
came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases 618 And they
that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed

619 And the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went
virtue out of him and healed them all

620 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said Blessed be
ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God

621 Blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled Blessed
are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh

622 Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall
separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out
your name as evil for the Son of mans sake

623 Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your
reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets

624 But woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your
consolation

625 Woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger Woe unto you
that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep

626 Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did
their fathers to the false prophets

627 But I say unto you which hear Love your enemies do good to them
which hate you 628 Bless them that curse you and pray for them
which despitefully use you

629 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat
also

630 Give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh
away thy goods ask them not again

631 And as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them
likewise

632 For if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for
sinners also love those that love them

633 And if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have
ye  for sinners also do even the same

634 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank
have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again

635 But love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for
nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the
children of the Highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the
evil

636 Be ye therefore merciful as your Father also is merciful

637 Judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall
not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven 638 Give and it
shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken
together and running over shall men give into your bosom For with
the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you
again

639 And he spake a parable unto them Can the blind lead the blind
shall they not both fall into the ditch  640 The disciple is not
above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his
master

641 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye  642 Either how
canst thou say to thy brother Brother let me pull out the mote that
is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in
thine own eye Thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine
own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is
in thy brothers eye

643 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit

644 For every tree is known by his own fruit For of thorns men do
not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes

645 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his
heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the
heart his mouth speaketh

646 And why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I
say  647 Whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth
them I will shew you to whom he is like 648 He is like a man which
built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock
