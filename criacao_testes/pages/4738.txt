His uncle it’s said The Imp

Stannis ground his teeth A dangerous man I learned that on the Blackwater How do you come by this report

The Lyseni still trade at King’s Landing Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me

I suppose not The king ran his fingers across the table Joffrey    I remember once this kitchen cat    the cooks were wont to feed her scraps and fish heads One told the boy that she had kittens in her belly thinking he might want one Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if it were true When he found the kittens he brought them to show to his father Robert hit the boy so hard I thought he’d killed him The king took off his crown and placed it on the table Dwarf or leech this killer served the kingdom well They must send for me now

They will not said Melisandre Joffrey has a brother

Tommen The king said the name grudgingly

They will crown Tommen and rule in his name

Stannis made a fist Tommen is gentler than Joffrey but born of the same incest Another monster in the making Another leech upon the land Westeros needs a man’s hand not a child’s

Melisandre moved closer Save them sire Let me wake the stone dragons Three is three Give me the boy

Edric Storm Davos said

Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury I know his name Spare me your reproaches I like this no more than you do but my duty is to the realm My duty    He turned back to Melisandre You swear there is no other way Swear it on your life for I promise you shall die by inches if you lie

You are he who must stand against the Other The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago The red comet was your herald You are the prince that was promised and if you fail the world fails with you Melisandre went to him her red lips parted her ruby throbbing Give me this boy she whispered and I will give you your kingdom

He can’t said Davos Edric Storm is gone

Gone Stannis turned What do you mean gone

He is aboard a Lyseni galley safely out to sea Davos watched Melisandre’s pale heart-shaped face He saw the flicker of dismay there the sudden uncertainty She did not see it

The king’s eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of his face The bastard was taken from Dragonstone without my leave A galley you say If that Lysene pirate thinks to use the boy to squeeze gold from me—

This is your Hand’s work sire Melisandre gave Davos a knowing look You will bring him back my lord You will

The boy is out of my reach said Davos And out of your reach as well my lady

Her red eyes made him squirm I should have left you to the dark ser Do you know what you have done

My duty

Some might call it treason Stannis went to the window to stare out into the night Is he looking for the ship I raised you up from dirt Davos He sounded more tired than angry Was loyalty too much to hope for

Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater I might have died myself You have my loyalty always Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words he said next he knew his life depended on them Your Grace you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience to defend your realm against your foes to protect your people Is not Edric Storm one of your people One of those I swore to protect I kept my oath How could that be treason

Stannis ground his teeth again I never asked for this crown Gold is cold and heavy on the head but so long as I am the king I have a duty    If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark    Sacrifice    is never easy Davos Or it is no true sacrifice Tell him my lady

Melisandre said Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart’s blood of his own beloved wife If a man with a thousand cows gives one to god that is nothing But a man who offers the only cow he owns   

She talks of cows Davos told the king I am speaking of a boy your daughter’s friend your brother’s son

A king’s son with the power of kingsblood in his veins Melisandre’s ruby glowed like a red star at her throat Do you think you’ve saved this boy Onion Knight When the long night falls Edric Storm shall die with the rest wherever he is hidden Your own sons as well Darkness and cold will cover the earth You meddle in matters you do not understand

There’s much I don’t understand Davos admitted I have never pretended elsewise I know the seas and rivers the shapes of the coasts where the rocks and shoals lie I know hidden coves where a boat can land unseen And I know that a king protects his people or he is no king at all

Stannis’s face darkened Do you mock me to my face Must I learn a king’s duty from an onion smuggler

Davos knelt If I have offended take my head I’ll die as I lived your loyal man But hear me first Hear me for the sake of the onions I brought you and the fingers you took

Stannis slid Lightbringer from its scabbard Its glow filled the chamber Say what you will but say it quickly The muscles in the king’s neck stood out like cords

Davos fumbled inside his cloak and drew out the crinkled sheet of parchment It seemed a thin and flimsy thing yet it was all the shield he had A King’s Hand should be able to read and write Maester Pylos has been teaching me He smoothed the letter flat upon his knee and began to read by the light of the magic sword





JON

He dreamt he was back in Winterfell limping past the stone kings on their thrones Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps You are no Stark he could hear them mutter in heavy granite voices There is no place for you here Go away He walked deeper into the darkness Father he called Bran Rickon No one answered A chill wind was blowing on his neck Uncle he called Uncle Benjen Father Please Father help me Up above he heard drums They are feasting in the Great Hall but I am not welcome there I am no Stark and this is not my place His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees The crypts were growing darker A light has gone out somewhere Ygritte he whispered Forgive me Please But it was only a direwolf grey and ghastly spotted with blood his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark   

The cell was dark the bed hard beneath him His own bed he remembered his own bed in his steward’s cell beneath the Old Bear’s chambers By rights it should have brought him sweeter dreams Even beneath the furs he was cold Ghost had shared his cell before the ranging warming it against the chill of night And in the wild Ygritte had slept beside him Both gone now He had burned Ygritte himself as he knew she would have wanted and Ghost    Where are you Was he dead as well was that what his dream had meant the bloody wolf in the crypts But the wolf in the dream had been grey not white Grey like Bran’s wolf Had the Thenns hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown If so Bran was lost to him for good and all

Jon was trying to make sense of that when the horn blew

The Horn of Winter he thought still confused from sleep But Mance never found Joramun’s horn so that couldn’t be A second blast followed as long and deep as the first Jon had to get up and go to the Wall he knew but it was so hard   

He shoved aside his furs and sat The pain in his leg seemed duller nothing he could not stand He had slept in his breeches and tunic and smallclothes for the added warmth so he had only to pull on his boots and don leather and mail and cloak The horn blew again two long blasts so he slung Longclaw over one shoulder found his crutch and hobbled down the steps

It was the black of night outside bitter cold and overcast His brothers were spilling out of towers and keeps buckling their swordbelts and walking toward the Wall Jon looked for Pyp and Grenn but could not find them Perhaps one of them was the sentry blowing the horn It is Mance he thought He has come at last That was good We will fight a battle and then we’ll rest Alive or dead we’ll rest

Where the stair had been only an immense tangle of charred wood and broken ice remained below the Wall The winch raised them up now but the cage was only big enough for ten men at a time and it was already on its way up by the time Jon arrived He would need to wait for its return Others waited with him Satin Mully Spare Boot Kegs big blond Hareth with his buck teeth Everyone called him Horse He had been a stablehand in Mole’s Town one of the few moles who had stayed at Castle Black The rest had run back to their fields and hovels or their beds in the underground brothel Horse wanted to take the black though the great buck-toothed fool Zei remained as well the whore who’d proved so handy with a crossbow and Noye had kept three orphan boys whose father had died on the steps They were young—nine and eight and five—but no one else seemed to want them

As they waited for the cage to come back Clydas brought them cups of hot mulled wine while Three-Finger Hobb passed out chunks of black bread Jon took a heel from him and gnawed on it

Is it Mance Rayder Satin asked anxiously

We can hope so There were worse things than wildlings in the dark Jon remembered the words the wildling king had spoken on the Fist of the First Men as they stood amidst that pink snow When the dead walk walls and stakes and swords mean nothing You cannot fight the dead Jon Snow No man knows that half so well as me Just thinking of it made the wind seem a little colder

Finally the cage came clanking back down swaying at the end of the long chain and they crowded in silently and shut the door

Mully yanked the bell rope three times A moment later they began to rise by fits and starts at first then more smoothly No one spoke At the top the cage swung sideways and they clambered out one by one Horse gave Jon a hand down onto the ice The cold hit him in the teeth like a fist

A line of fires burned along the top of the Wall contained in iron baskets on poles taller than a man The cold knife of the wind stirred and swirled the flames so the lurid orange light was always shifting Bundles of quarrels arrows spears and scorpion bolts stood ready on every hand Rocks were piled ten feet high big wooden barrels of pitch and lamp oil lined up beside them Bowen Marsh had left Castle Black well supplied in everything save men The wind was whipping at the black cloaks of the scarecrow sentinels who stood along the ramparts spears in hand I hope it wasn’t one of them who blew the horn Jon said to Donal Noye when he limped up beside him

Did you hear that Noye asked

There was the wind and horses and something else A mammoth Jon said That was a mammoth

The armorer’s breath was frosting as it blew from his broad flat nose North of the Wall was a sea of darkness that seemed to stretch forever Jon could make out the faint red glimmer of distant fires moving through the wood It was Mance certain as sunrise The Others did not light torches
