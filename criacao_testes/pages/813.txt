vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God

1426 And when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
Olives

1427 And Jesus saith unto them All ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scattered

1428 But after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee

1429 But Peter said unto him Although all shall be offended yet
will not I

1430 And Jesus saith unto him Verily I say unto thee That this day
even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me
thrice

1431 But he spake the more vehemently If I should die with thee I
will not deny thee in any wise Likewise also said they all

1432 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane and he
saith to his disciples Sit ye here while I shall pray

1433 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John and began to be
sore amazed and to be very heavy 1434 And saith unto them My soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch

1435 And he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed
that if it were possible the hour might pass from him

1436 And he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee
take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what
thou wilt

1437 And he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter
Simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour  1438 Watch
ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation The spirit truly is ready
but the flesh is weak

1439 And again he went away and prayed and spake the same words

1440 And when he returned he found them asleep again for their
eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him

1441 And he cometh the third time and saith unto them Sleep on now
and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the Son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners

1442 Rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand

1443 And immediately while he yet spake cometh Judas one of the
twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from
the chief priests and the scribes and the elders

1444 And he that betrayed him had given them a token saying
Whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away
safely

1445 And as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and
saith Master master and kissed him

1446 And they laid their hands on him and took him

1447 And one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant
of the high priest and cut off his ear

1448 And Jesus answered and said unto them Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and with staves to take me  1449 I was
daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the
scriptures must be fulfilled

1450 And they all forsook him and fled

1451 And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth
cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him 1452
And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked

1453 And they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes

1454 And Peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the
high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the
fire

1455 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
against Jesus to put him to death and found none

1456 For many bare false witness against him but their witness
agreed not together

1457 And there arose certain and bare false witness against him
saying 1458 We heard him say I will destroy this temple that is
made with hands and within three days I will build another made
without hands

1459 But neither so did their witness agree together

1460 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus
saying Answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against
