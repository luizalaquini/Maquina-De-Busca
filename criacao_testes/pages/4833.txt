hated him yet the more

dreamed 377 For behold we were binding sheaves in the field and
lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves
stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf

shalt thou indeed have dominion over us And they hated him yet the

bow down ourselves to thee to the earth  3711 And his brethren
envied him but his father observed the saying
