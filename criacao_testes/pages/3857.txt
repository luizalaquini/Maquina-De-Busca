The supper ended in a strained silence as so many of their suppers did Afterward as Pod was removing the cups and platters Sansa asked Tyrion for leave to visit the godswood

As you wish He had become accustomed to his wife’s nightly devotions She prayed at the royal sept as well and often lit candles to Mother Maid and Crone Tyrion found all this piety excessive if truth be told but in her place he might want the help of the gods as well I confess I know little of the old gods he said trying to be pleasant Perhaps someday you might enlighten me I could even accompany you

No Sansa said at once You… you are kind to offer but… there are no devotions my lord No priests or songs or candles Only trees and silent prayer You would be bored

No doubt you’re right She knows me better than I thought Though the sound of rustling leaves might be a pleasant change from some septon droning on about the seven aspects of grace Tyrion waved her off I won’t intrude Dress warmly my lady the wind is brisk out there He was tempted to ask what she prayed for but Sansa was so dutiful she might actually tell him and he didn’t think he wanted to know

He went back to work after she left trying to track some golden dragons through the labyrinth of Littlefinger’s ledgers Petyr Baelish had not believed in letting gold sit about and grow dusty that was for certain but the more Tyrion tried to make sense of his accounts the more his head hurt It was all very well to talk of breeding dragons instead of locking them up in the treasury but some of these ventures smelled worse than week-old fish I wouldn’t have been so quick to let Joffrey fling the Antler Men over the walls if I’d known how many of the bloody bastards had taken loans from the crown He would have to send Bronn to find their heirs but he feared that would prove as fruitful as trying to squeeze silver from a silverfish

When the summons from his lord father arrived it was the first time Tyrion could ever recall being pleased to see Ser Boros Blount He closed the ledgers gratefully blew out the oil lamp tied a cloak around his shoulders and waddled across the castle to the Tower of the Hand The wind was brisk just as he’d warned Sansa and there was a smell of rain in the air Perhaps when Lord Tywin was done with him he should go to the godswood and fetch her home before she got soaked

But all that went straight out of his head when he entered the Hand’s solar to find Cersei Ser Kevan and Grand Maester Pycelle gathered about Lord Tywin and the king Joffrey was almost bouncing and Cersei was savoring a smug little smile though Lord Tywin looked as grim as ever I wonder if he could smile even if he wanted to What’s happened Tyrion asked

His father offered him a roll of parchment Someone had flattened it but it still wanted to curl Roslin caught a fine fat trout the message read Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding Tyrion turned it over to inspect the broken seal The wax was silvery-grey and pressed into it were the twin towers of House Frey Does the Lord of the Crossing imagine he’s being poetic Or is this meant to confound us Tyrion snorted The trout would be Edmure Tully the pelts…

He’s dead Joffrey sounded so proud and happy you might have thought he’d skinned Robb Stark himself

First Greyjoy and now Stark Tyrion thought of his child wife praying in the godswood even now Praying to her father’s gods to bring her brother victory and keep her mother safe no doubt The old gods paid no more heed to prayer than the new ones it would seem Perhaps he should take comfort in that Kings are falling like leaves this autumn he said It would seem our little war is winning itself

Wars do not win themselves Tyrion Cersei said with poisonous sweetness Our lord father won this war

Nothing is won so long as we have enemies in the field Lord Tywin warned them

The river lords are no fools the queen argued Without the northmen they cannot hope to stand against the combined power of Highgarden Casterly Rock and Dorne Surely they will choose submission rather than destruction

Most agreed Lord Tywin Riverrun remains but so long as Walder Frey holds Edmure Tully hostage the Blackfish dare not mount a threat Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood will fight on for honor’s sake but the Freys can keep the Mallisters penned up at Seagard and with the right inducement Jonos Bracken can be persuaded to change his allegiance and attack the Blackwoods In the end they will bend the knee yes I mean to offer generous terms Any castle that yields to us will be spared save one

Harrenhal said Tyrion who knew his sire

The realm is best rid of these Brave Companions I have commanded Ser Gregor to put the castle to the sword

Gregor Clegane It appeared as if his lord father meant to mine the Mountain for every last nugget of ore before turning him over to Dornish justice The Brave Companions would end as heads on spikes and Littlefinger would stroll into Harrenhal without so much as a spot of blood on those fine clothes of his He wondered if Petyr Baelish had reached the Vale yet If the gods are good he ran into a storm at sea and sank But when had the gods ever been especially good

They should all be put to the sword Joffrey declared suddenly The Mallisters and Blackwoods and Brackens… all of them They’re traitors I want them killed Grandfather I won’t have any generous terms The king turned to Grand Maester Pycelle And I want Robb Stark’s head too Write to Lord Frey and tell him The king commands I’m going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast

Sire Ser Kevan said in a shocked voice the lady is now your aunt by marriage

A jest Cersei smiled Joff did not mean it

Yes I did Joffrey insisted He was a traitor and I want his stupid head I’m going to make Sansa kiss it

No Tyrion’s voice was hoarse Sansa is no longer yours to torment Understand that monster

Joffrey sneered You’re the monster Uncle

Am I Tyrion cocked his head Perhaps you should speak more softly to me then Monsters are dangerous beasts and just now kings seem to be dying like flies

I could have your tongue out for saying that the boy king said reddening I’m the king

Cersei put a protective hand on her son’s shoulder Let the dwarf make all the threats he likes Joff I want my lord father and my uncle to see what he is

Lord Tywin ignored that it was Joffrey he addressed Aerys also felt the need to remind men that he was king And he was passing fond of ripping tongues out as well You could ask Ser Ilyn Payne about that though you’ll get no reply

Ser Ilyn never dared provoke Aerys the way your Imp provokes Joff said Cersei You heard him ‘Monster’ he said To the King’s Grace And he threatened him…

Be quiet Cersei Joffrey when your enemies defy you you must serve them steel and fire When they go to their knees however you must help them back to their feet Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you And any man who must say ‘I am the king’ is no true king at all Aerys never understood that but you will When I’ve won your war for you we will restore the king’s peace and the king’s justice The only head that need concern you is Margaery Tyrell’s maidenhead

Joffrey had that sullen sulky look he got Cersei had him firmly by the shoulder but perhaps she should have had him by the throat The boy surprised them all Instead of scuttling safely back under his rock Joff drew himself up defiantly and said You talk about Aerys Grandfather but you were scared of him

Oh my hasn’t this gotten interesting Tyrion thought

Lord Tywin studied his grandchild in silence gold flecks shining in his pale green eyes Joffrey apologize to your grandfather said Cersei

He wrenched free of her Why should I Everyone knows it’s true My father won all the battles He killed Prince Rhaegar and took the crown while your father was hiding under Casterly Rock The boy gave his grandfather a defiant look A strong king acts boldly he doesn’t just talk

Thank you for that wisdom Your Grace Lord Tywin said with a courtesy so cold it was like to freeze their ears off Ser Kevan I can see the king is tired Please see him safely back to his bedchamber Pycelle perhaps some gentle potion to help His Grace sleep restfully

Dreamwine my lord

I don’t want any dreamwine Joffrey insisted

Lord Tywin would have paid more heed to a mouse squeaking in the corner Dreamwine will serve Cersei Tyrion remain

Ser Kevan took Joffrey firmly by the arm and marched him out the door where two of the Kingsguard were waiting Grand Maester Pycelle scurried after them as fast as his shaky old legs could take him Tyrion remained where he was

Father I am sorry Cersei said when the door was shut Joff has always been willful I did warn you…

There is a long league’s worth of difference between willful and stupid ‘A strong king acts boldly’ Who told him that

Not me I promise you said Cersei Most like it was something he heard Robert say…

The part about you hiding under Casterly Rock does sound like Robert Tyrion didn’t want Lord Tywin forgetting that bit

Yes I recall now Cersei said Robert often told Joff that a king must be bold

And what were you telling him pray I did not fight a war to seat Robert the Second on the Iron Throne You gave me to understand the boy cared nothing for his father

Why would he Robert ignored him He would have beat him if I’d allowed it That brute you made me marry once hit the boy so hard he knocked out two of his baby teeth over some mischief with a cat I told him I’d kill him in his sleep if he ever did it again and he never did but sometimes he would say things…

It appears things needed to be said Lord Tywin waved two fingers at her a brusque dismissal Go

She went seething

Not Robert the Second Tyrion said Aerys the Third

The boy is thirteen There is time yet Lord Tywin paced to the window That was unlike him he was more upset than he wished to show He requires a sharp lesson

Tyrion had gotten his own sharp lesson at thirteen He felt almost sorry for his nephew On the other hand no one deserved it more Enough of Joffrey he said Wars are won with quills and ravens wasn’t that what you said I must congratulate you How long have you and Walder Frey been plotting this
