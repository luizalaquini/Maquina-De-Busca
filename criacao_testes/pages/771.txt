The eighth Lady Frey is still alive and well so far as I know she replied Thankfully Otherwise it might well have come to that knowing Lord Walder

The Blackfish said I am the last man in the Seven Kingdoms to tell anyone who they must wed Nephew Nonetheless you did say something of making amends for your Battle of the Fords

I had in mind a different sort of amends Single combat with the Kingslayer Seven years of penace as a begging brother Swimming the sunset sea with my legs tied When he saw that no one was smiling Edmure threw up his hands The Others take you all Very well I’ll wed the wench As amends





Davos


Lord Alester looked up sharply Voices he said Do you hear Davos Someone is coming for us

Lamprey said Davos It’s time for our supper or near enough Last night Lamprey had brought them half a beef-and-bacon pie and a flagon of mead as well Just the thought of it made his belly start to rumble

No there’s more than one

He’s right Davos heard two voices at least and footsteps growing louder He got to his feet and moved to the bars

Lord Alester brushed the straw from his clothes The king has sent for me Or the queen yes Selyse would never let me rot here her own blood

Outside the cell Lamprey appeared with a ring of keys in hand Ser Axell Florent and four guardsmen followed close behind him They waited beneath the torch while Lamprey searched for the correct key

Axell Lord Alester said Gods be good Is it the king who sends for me or the queen

No one has sent for you traitor Ser Axell said

Lord Alester recoiled as if he’d been slapped No I swear to you I committed no treason Why won’t you listen If His Grace would only let me explain—

Lamprey thrust a great iron key into the lock turned it and pulled open the cell The rusted hinges screamed in protest You he said to Davos Come

Where Davos looked to Ser Axell Tell me true ser do you mean to burn me

You are sent for Can you walk

I can walk Davos stepped from the cell Lord Alester gave a cry of dismay as Lamprey slammed the door shut once more

Take the torch Ser Axell commanded the gaoler Leave the traitor to the darkness

No his brother said Axell please don’t take the light… gods have mercy…

Gods There is only R’hllor and the Other Ser Axell gestured sharply and one of his guardsmen pulled the torch from its sconce and led the way to the stair

Are you taking me to Melisandre Davos asked

She will be there Ser Axell said She is never far from the king But it is His Grace himself who asked for you

Davos lifted his hand to his chest where once his luck had hung in a leather bag on a thong Gone now he remembered and the ends of four fingers as well But his hands were still long enough to wrap about a woman’s throat he thought especially a slender throat like hers

Up they went climbing the turnpike stair in single file The walls were rough dark stone cool to the touch The light of the torches went before them and their shadows marched beside them on the walls At the third turn they passed an iron gate that opened on blackness and another at the fifth turn Davos guessed that they were near the surface by then perhaps even above it The next door they came to was made of wood but still they climbed Now the walls were broken by arrow slits but no shafts of sunlight pried their way through the thickness of the stone It was night outside

His legs were aching by the time Ser Axell thrust open a heavy door and gestured him through Beyond a high stone bridge arched over emptiness to the massive central tower called the Stone Drum A sea wind blew restlessly through the arches that supported the roof and Davos could smell the salt water as they crossed He took a deep breath filling his lungs with the clean cold air Wind and water give me strength he prayed A huge nightfire burned in the yard below to keep the terrors of the dark at bay and the queen’s men were gathered around it singing praises to their new red god
