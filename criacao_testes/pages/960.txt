The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus


11 Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according
to the faith of Gods elect and the acknowledging of the truth which
is after godliness 12 In hope of eternal life which God that
cannot lie promised before the world began 13 But hath in due times
manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me
according to the commandment of God our Saviour 14 To Titus mine
own son after the common faith Grace mercy and peace from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour

15 For this cause left I thee in Crete that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as
I had appointed thee 16 If any be blameless the husband of one
wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly

17 For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God not
selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given
to filthy lucre 18 But a lover of hospitality a lover of good men
sober just holy temperate 19 Holding fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers

110 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers
specially they of the circumcision 111 Whose mouths must be stopped
who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for
filthy lucres sake

112 One of themselves even a prophet of their own said The
Cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies

113 This witness is true Wherefore rebuke them sharply that they
may be sound in the faith 114 Not giving heed to Jewish fables and
commandments of men that turn from the truth

115 Unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is
defiled

116 They profess that they know God but in works they deny him
being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate

21 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine 22 That
the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity
in patience

23 The aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good
things 24 That they may teach the young women to be sober to love
their husbands to love their children 25 To be discreet chaste
keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word
of God be not blasphemed

26 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded

27 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity 28 Sound speech that
cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be
ashamed having no evil thing to say of you

29 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to
please them well in all things not answering again 210 Not
purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all things

211 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men 212 Teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we
should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
213 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ 214 Who gave himself for us
that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a
peculiar people zealous of good works

215 These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority
Let no man despise thee

31 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to
obey magistrates to be ready to every good work 32 To speak evil of
no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all
men
