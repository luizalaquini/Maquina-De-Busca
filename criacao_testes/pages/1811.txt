 Well said -- very well said observed Joseph --
 However folks I must be moving now upon my life
I must Pason Thirdly will be waiting at the church
gates and theres the woman a-biding outside in the
waggon
 Joseph Poorgmss dont be so miserable Pason
Thirdly wont mind Hes a generous man  hes found
me in tracts for years and Ive consumed a good many
in the course of a long and shady life but hes never
been the man to cry out at the expense Sit down
The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained the less his
spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
him this afternoon The minutes glided by uncounted
until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen
and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points
on the surface of darkness Coggans repeater struck
six from his pocket in the usual still small tones
At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry
and the door opened to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak
followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle He
stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces
of the sitters which confronted him with the expressions
of a fiddle and a couple of warming-pans Joseph Poor+
grass blinked and shrank several inches into the back+
ground
 Upon my soul Im ashamed of you  tis disgraceful
Joseph disgraceful  said Gabriel indignantly  Coggan
you call yourself a man and dont know better than this
P 347
Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak one or other
of his eyes occasionally opening and closing of its own
accord as if it were not a member but a dozy individual
with a distinct personality
 Dont take on so shepherd said Mark Clark
looking reproachfully at the candle which appeared
to possess special features of interest for his eyes
Nobody can hurt a dead woman at length said
Coggan with the precision of a machine All that
could be done for her is done -- shes beyond us  and
why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for
lifeless clay that can neither feel nor see and dont
know what you do with her at all If shed been
alive I would have been the first to help her If she
now wanted victuals and drink Id pay for it money
down But shes dead and no speed of ours will
bring her to life The womans past us -- time spent
upon her is throwed away why should we hurry to
do whats not required  Drink shepherd and be
friends for to-morrow we may be like her
 We may added Mark Clark emphatically at once
drinking himself to run no further risk of losing his
chance by the event alluded to Jan meanwhile merging
his additional thoughts of to-morrow in a song  --
To-mor-row to-mor-row 
And while peace and plen-ty I find at my board
With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row
With my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford
And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row
To-mor -- row to-mor -- +
Do hold thy horning Jan said Oak and turning
upon Poorgrass  as for you Joseph who do your wicked
deeds in such confoundedly holy ways you are as drunk
as you can stand
No Shepherd Oak no Listen to reason shepherd
All thats the matter with me is the affliction called a
multiplying eye and thats how it is I look double to
you-i mean you look double to me
A multiplying eye is a very bad thing said Mark
Clark
P 348
It always comes on when I have been in a public --
house a little time said Joseph Poorgrass meekly
Yes I see two of every sort as if I were some holy
man living in the times of King Noah and entering
into the ark Y-y-y-yes he added becoming much
affected by the picture of himself as a person thrown
away and shedding tears I feel too good for England 
I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights like the other
men of sacrifice and then I shouldnt have b-b-been
called a d-d-drunkard in such a way
I wish youd show yourself a man of spirit and not
sit whining there
Show myself a man of spirit   Ah well let
me take the name of drunkard humbly-iet me be a
man of contrite knees-iet it be  l know that I always
do say Please God afore I do anything from my
getting up to my going down of the same and I be
willing to take as much disgrace as there is in that
holy act Hah yes  But not a man of spirit 
Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted
against my hinder parts without groaning manfully that
I question the right to do so I inquire that query
boldly
 We cant say that you have Hero Poorgrass
admitted Jan
Never have I allowed such treatment to pass un+
questioned Yet the shepherd says in the face of that
rich testimony that I be not a man of spirit Well
let it pass by and death is a kind friend 
Gabriel seeing that neither of the three was in a fit
