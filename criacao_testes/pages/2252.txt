Showing you how old I am She unlaced her doeskin shirt tossed it aside pulled her three woolen undershirts up over her head all at once I want you should see me

We shouldn’t—

We should Her breasts bounced as she stood on one leg to pull one boot then hopped onto her other foot to attend to the other Her nipples were wide pink circles You as well Ygritte said as she yanked down her sheepskin breeches If you want to look you have to show You know nothing Jon Snow

I know I want you he heard himself say all his vows and all his honor forgotten She stood before him naked as her name day and he was as hard as the rock around them He had been in her half a hundred times by now but always beneath the furs with others all around them He had never seen how beautiful she was Her legs were skinny but well muscled the hair at the juncture of her thighs a brighter red than that on her head Does that make it even luckier He pulled her close I love the smell of you he said I love your red hair I love your mouth and the way you kiss me I love your smile I love your teats He kissed them one and then the other I love your skinny legs and what’s between them He knelt to kiss her there lightly on her mound at first but Ygritte moved her legs apart a little and he saw the pink inside and kissed that as well and tasted her She gave a little gasp If you love me all so much why are you still dressed she whispered You know nothing Jon Snow Noth—oh Oh OHHH

Afterward she was almost shy or as shy as Ygritte ever got That thing you did she said when they lay together on their piled clothes With your    mouth She hesitated Is that    is it what lords do to their ladies down in the south

I don’t think so No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies I only    wanted to kiss you there that’s all You seemed to like it

Aye I    I liked it some No one taught you such

There’s been no one he confessed Only you

A maid she teased You were a maid

He gave her closest nipple a playful pinch I was a man of the Night’s Watch Was he heard himself say What was he now He did not want to look at that Were you a maid

Ygritte pushed herself onto an elbow I am nineteen and a spearwife and kissed by fire How could I be maiden

Who was he

A boy at a feast five years past He’d come trading with his brothers and he had hair like mine kissed by fire so I thought he would be lucky But he was weak When he came back t’ try and steal me Longspear broke his arm and ran him off and he never tried again not once

It wasn’t Longspear then Jon was relieved He liked Longspear with his homely face and friendly ways

She punched him That’s vile Would you bed your sister

Longspear’s not your brother

He’s of my village You know nothing Jon Snow A true man steals a woman from afar t’ strengthen the clan Women who bed brothers or fathers or clan kin offend the gods and are cursed with weak and sickly children Even monsters

Craster weds his daughters Jon pointed out

She punched him again Craster’s more your kind than ours His father was a crow who stole a woman out of Whitetree village but after he had her he flew back t’ his Wall She went t’ Castle Black once t’ show the crow his son but the brothers blew their horns and run her off Craster’s blood is black and he bears a heavy curse She ran her fingers lightly across his stomach I feared you’d do the same once Fly back to the Wall You never knew what t’ do after you stole me

Jon sat up Ygritte I never stole you

Aye you did You jumped down the mountain and killed Orell and afore I could get my axe you had a knife at my throat I thought you’d have me then or kill me or maybe both but you never did And when I told you the tale o’ Bael the Bard and how he plucked the rose o’ Winterfell I thought you’d know to pluck me then for certain but you didn’t You know nothing Jon Snow She gave him a shy smile You might be learning some though

The light was shifting all about her Jon noticed suddenly He looked around We had best go up The torch is almost done

Is the crow afeared o’ Gendel’s children she said with a grin It’s only a little way up and I’m not done with you Jon Snow She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him Would you    She hesitated

What he prompted as the torch began to gutter

Do it again Ygritte blurted With your mouth The lord’s kiss And I    I could see if you liked it any

By the time the torch burned out Jon Snow no longer cared

His guilt came back afterward but weaker than before If this is so wrong he wondered why did the gods make it feel so good

The grotto was pitch-dark by the time they finished The only light was the dim glow of the passage back up to the larger cavern where a score of fires burned They were soon fumbling and bumping into each other as they tried to dress in the dark Ygritte stumbled into the pool and screeched at the cold of the water When Jon laughed she pulled him in too They wrestled and splashed in the dark and then she was in his arms again and it turned out they were not finished after all

Jon Snow she told him when he’d spent his seed inside her don’t move now sweet I like the feel of you in there I do Let’s not go back t’ Styr and Jarl Let’s go down inside and join up with Gendel’s children I don’t ever want t’ leave this cave Jon Snow Not ever





DAENERYS

All The slave girl sounded wary Your Grace did this one’s worthless ears mishear you

Cool green light filtered down through the diamond-shaped panes of colored glass set in the sloping triangular walls and a breeze was blowing gently through the terrace doors carrying the scents of fruit and flowers from the garden beyond Your ears heard true said Dany I want to buy them all Tell the Good Masters if you will

She had chosen a Qartheen gown today The deep violet silk brought out the purple of her eyes The cut of it bared her left breast While the Good Masters of Astapor conferred among themselves in low voices Dany sipped tart persimmon wine from a tall silver flute She could not quite make out all that they were saying but she could hear the greed

Each of the eight brokers was attended by two or three body slaves    though one Grazdan the eldest had six So as not to seem a beggar Dany had brought her own attendants Irri and Jhiqui in their sandsilk trousers and painted vests old Whitebeard and mighty Belwas her bloodriders Ser Jorah stood behind her sweltering in his green surcoat with the black bear of Mormont embroidered upon it The smell of his sweat was an earthy answer to the sweet perfumes that drenched the Astapori

All growled Kraznys mo Nakloz who smelled of peaches today The slave girl repeated the word in the Common Tongue of Westeros Of thousands there are eight Is this what she means by all There are also six centuries who shall be part of a ninth thousand when complete Would she have them too

I would said Dany when the question was put to her The eight thousands the six centuries    and the ones still in training as well The ones who have not earned the spikes

Kraznys turned back to his fellows Once again they conferred among themselves The translator had told Dany their names but it was hard to keep them straight Four of the men seemed to be named Grazdan presumably after Grazdan the Great who had founded Old Ghis in the dawn of days They all looked alike thick fleshy men with amber skin broad noses dark eyes Their wiry hair was black or a dark red or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari All wrapped themselves in tokars a garment permitted only to freeborn men of Astapor

It was the fringe on the tokar that proclaimed a man’s status Dany had been told by Captain Groleo In this cool green room atop the pyramid two of the slavers wore tokars fringed in silver five had gold fringes and one the oldest Grazdan displayed a fringe of fat white pearls that clacked together softly when he shifted in his seat or moved an arm

We cannot sell half-trained boys one of the silver-fringe Grazdans was saying to the others

We can if her gold is good said a fatter man whose fringe was gold

They are not Unsullied They have not killed their sucklings If they fail in the field they will shame us And even if we cut five thousand raw boys tomorrow it would be ten years before they are fit for sale What would we tell the next buyer who comes seeking Unsullied

We will tell him that he must wait said the fat man Gold in my purse is better than gold in my future

Dany let them argue sipping the tart persimmon wine and trying to keep her face blank and ignorant I will have them all no matter the price she told herself The city had a hundred slave traders but the eight before her were the greatest When selling bed slaves fieldhands scribes craftsmen and tutors these men were rivals but their ancestors had allied one with the other for the purpose of making and selling the Unsullied Brick and blood built Astapor and brick and blood her people

It was Kraznys who finally announced their decision Tell her that the eight thousands she shall have if her gold proves sufficient And the six centuries if she wishes Tell her to come back in a year and we will sell her another two thousand

In a year I shall be in Westeros said Dany when she had heard the translation My need is now The Unsullied are well trained but even so many will fall in battle I shall need the boys as replacements to take up the swords they drop She put her wine aside and leaned toward the slave girl Tell the Good Masters that I will want even the little ones who still have their puppies Tell them that I will pay as much for the boy they cut yesterday as for an Unsullied in a spiked helm

The girl told them The answer was still no

Dany frowned in annoyance Very well Tell them I will pay double so long as I get them all

Double The fat one in the gold fringe all but drooled
