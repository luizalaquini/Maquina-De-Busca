These three sounds are all made
at the front of the mouth while
ul
t
ul
d
and
ul
n
which bear the
same resemblance to each other are made in the middle and
ul
k
ul
g
and
ul
ng
are made at the back  This introduces another
possible classification according to
ul
place of articulation
pp
The unvoiced fricatives are quite straightforward except perhaps
for
ul
th
which is the sound at the beginning of thigh
They are paired with the voiced fricatives on the basis of place
of articulation  The voiced version of
ul
th
is the
ul
dh
at
the beginning of thy
ul
zh
is a fairly rare phoneme which
is heard in the middle of vision  Affricates are similar to
fricatives but begin with a stopped posture and we mentioned earlier
the controversy as to whether they should be considered to be
single phonemes or
sequences of stop phonemes and fricatives
Finally comes the lonely aspirate
ul
h
Aspiration does occur
elsewhere in speech during the plosive burst of unvoiced stops
rh Narrow phonetic transcription
The phonological classification outlined above is based upon a clear
rationale for distinguishing between sounds according to how
they affect meaning em although the rationale does become
somewhat muddied in difficult cases
Narrower transcriptions are not so systematic
They use units called
ul
allophones
which are defined by reference to physical acoustic criteria rather
than purely logical ones
Phone is a more old-fashioned term for the same thing
and the misused word phoneme is often employed where allophone is
meant that is as a physical rather than a logical
unit  Each phoneme has several allophones
more or less depending on how narrow or broad the transcription is
and the allophones are different acoustic realizations of the same
logical unit
For example the
ul
kc
s in key and caw may be considered as different
allophones in a slightly narrow transcription
Although we will not use symbols for allophones here
they are often indicated by diacritical marks in a text
which modify the basic phoneme classes
For example a tilde  over a vowel means that it is nasalized while a small
circle underneath a consonant means that it is devoiced
pp
Allophonic variation in speech is governed by a mechanism called
ul
coarticulation
where a sound is affected by those that come either side of it
Key-caw is a clear example of this where the tongue
position in the
ul
k
anticipates that of the following vowel em high
in the first case low in the second
Most allophonic variation in English is anticipatory in that the sound
is influenced by the following articulation rather than by
preceding ones
pp
Nasalization is a feature which applies to vowels in English through
anticipatory coarticulation
In many languages for example French it is a
ul
distinctive
feature for vowels in that it serves to distinguish one vowel phoneme class
