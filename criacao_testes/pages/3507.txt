You wound me Chella Tyrion said Here I thought we had become such friends But as you will You shall ride with me and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows Ulf for the Moon Brothers and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them The rest shall wait here until I send for you Try not to kill and maim each other while I’m gone

He put his heels to his horse and trotted off giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind Either was fine with him so long as they did not sit down to talk for a day and a night That was the trouble with the clans they had an absurd notion that every man’s voice should be heard in council so they argued about everything endlessly Even their women were allowed to speak Small wonder that it had been hundreds of years since they last threatened the Vale with anything beyond an occasional raid Tyrion meant to change that

Brorm rode with him Behind them—after a quick bit of grumbling—the five clansmen followed on their undersize garrons scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats

The Stone Crows rode together and Chella and Ulf stayed close as well as the Moon Brothers and Black Ears had strong bonds between them Timett son of Timett rode alone Every clan in the Mountains of the Moon feared the Burned Men who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and the others said roasted babies at their feasts And even the other Burned Men feared Timett who had put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when he reached the age of manhood Tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple a finger or if he was truly brave or truly mad an ear Timett’s fellow Burned Men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him a red hand which seemed to be some sort of a war chief

I wonder what their king burned off Tyrion said to Bronn when he heard the tale Grinning the sellsword had tugged at his crotch… but even Bronn kept a respectful tongue around Timett If a man was mad enough to put out his own eye he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies

Distant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party descended through the foothills and once Tyrion saw a raven take wing Where the high road twisted between two rocky outcrops they came to the first strong point A low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road and a dozen crossbowmen manned the heights Tyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to the wall alone Who commands here he shouted up

The captain was quick to appear and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lord’s son They trotted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts down to the riverlands and the Green Fork of the Trident Tyrion saw no bodies but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows there had been fighting here and recently

Half a league from the crossroads a barricade of sharpened stakes had been erected manned by pikemen and archers Behind the line the camp spread out to the far distance Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires mailed men sat under trees and honed their blades and familiar banners fluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground

A party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they approached the stakes The knight who led them wore silver armor inlaid with amethysts and a striped purple-and-silver cloak His shield bore a unicorn sigil and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of his horsehead helm Tyrion reined up to greet him Ser Flement

Ser Flement Brax lifted his visor Tyrion he said in astonishment My lord we all feared you dead or… He looked at the clansmen uncertainly These… companions of yours…

Bosom friends and loyal retainers Tyrion said Where will I find my lord father

He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters

Tyrion laughed The inn at the crossroads Perhaps the gods were just after all I will see him at once

As you say my lord Ser Flement wheeled his horse about and shouted commands Three rows of stakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the line Tyrion led his party through

Lord Tywin’s camp spread over leagues Chella’s estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far wrong The common men camped out in the open but the knights had thrown up tents and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as large as houses Tyrion spied the red ox of the Presters Lord Crakehall’s brindled boar the burning tree of Marbrand the badger of Lydden Knights called out to him as he cantered past and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment

Shagga was gaping back beyond a certainty he had never seen so many men horses and weapons in all his days The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces but Tyrion had no doubts that they were full as much in awe Better and better The more impressed they were with the power of the Lannisters the easier they would be to command

The inn and its stables were much as he remembered though little more than tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of the village had stood A gibbet had been erected in the yard and the body that swung there was covered with ravens At Tyrion’s approach they took to the air squawking and flapping their black wings He dismounted and glanced up at what remained of the corpse The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smile A room a meal and a flagon of wine that was all I asked he reminded her with a sigh of reproach

Boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses Shagga did not want to give his up The lad won’t steal your mare Tyrion assured him He only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat Shagga’s coat could have used a good brushing too but it would have been less than tactful to mention it You have my word the horse will not be harmed

Glaring Shagga let go his grip on the reins This is the horse of Shagga son of Dolf he roared at the stableboy

If he doesn’t give her back chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats Tyrion promised Provided you can find some

A pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms stood under the inn’s sign on either side of the door Tyrion recognized their captain My father

In the common room m’lord

My men will want meat and mead Tyrion told him See that they get it He entered the inn and there was Father

Tywin Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West was in his middle fifties yet hard as a man of twenty Even seated he was tall with long legs broad shoulders a flat stomach His thin arms were corded with muscle When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede he had commanded his barber to shave his head Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures He razored his lip and chin as well but kept his side-whiskers two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks from ear to jaw His eyes were a pale green flecked with gold A fool more foolish than most had once jested that even Lord Tywin’s shit was flecked with gold Some said the man was still alive deep in the bowels of Casterly Rock

Ser Kevan Lannister his father’s only surviving brother was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room His uncle was portly and balding with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of his massive jaw Ser Kevan saw him first Tyrion he said in surprise

Uncle Tyrion said bowing And my lord father What a pleasure to find you here

Lord Tywin did not stir from his chair but he did give his dwarf son a long searching look I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded

Sorry to disappoint you Father Tyrion said No need to leap up and embrace me I wouldn’t want you to strain yourself He crossed the room to their table acutely conscious of the way his stunted legs made him waddle with every step Whenever his father’s eyes were on him he became uncomfortably aware of all his deformities and shortcomings Kind of you to go to war for me he said as he climbed into a chair and helped himself to a cup of his father’s ale

By my lights it was you who started this Lord Tywin replied Your brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman

That’s one way we differ Jaime and I He’s taller as well you may have noticed

His father ignored the sally The honor of our House was at stake I had no choice but to ride No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity

Hear Me Roar Tyrion said grinning The Lannister words Truth be told none of my blood was actually shed although it was a close thing once or twice Morrec and Jyck were killed

I suppose you will be wanting some new men

Don’t trouble yourself Father I’ve acquired a few of my own He tried a swallow of the ale It was brown and yeasty so thick you could almost chew it Very fine in truth A pity his father had hanged the innkeep How is your war going

His uncle answered Well enough for the nonce Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup

Your brother has been covering himself with glory his father said He smashed the Lords Vance and Piper at the Golden Tooth and met the massed power of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun The lords of the Trident have been put to rout Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive with many of his knights and bannermen Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun where Jaime has them under siege The rest fled to their own strongholds

Your father and I have been marching on each in turn Ser Kevan said With Lord Blackwood gone Raventree fell at once and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend it Ser Gregor burnt out the Pipers and the Brackens…

Leaving you unopposed Tyrion said

Not wholly Ser Kevan said The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins

No matter Lord Tywin said Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air and all he smells now is ruin And Jason Mallister lacks the strength to fight alone Once Jaime takes Riverrun they will both be quick enough to bend the knee Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us this war is good as won

I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you Tyrion said The Starks are another matter Lord Eddard—

—is our hostage his father said He will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon under the Red Keep

No Ser Kevan agreed but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host around him

No sword is strong until it’s been tempered Lord Tywin declared The Stark boy is a child No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind but in the end it comes down to butcher’s work I doubt he has the stomach for it

Things had gotten interesting while he’d been away Tyrion reflected And what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this ‘butcher’s work’ is being done he wondered How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend Ned

Robert Baratheon is dead his father told him Your nephew reigns in King’s Landing

That did take Tyrion aback My sister you mean He took another gulp of ale The realm would be a much different place with Cersei ruling in place of her husband

If you have a mind to make yourself of use I will give you a command his father said Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear raiding our lands across the Red Fork

Tyrion made a tsking sound The gall of them fighting back Ordinarily I’d be glad to punish such rudeness Father but the truth is I have pressing business elsewhere

Do you Lord Tywin did not seem awed We also have a pair of Ned Stark’s afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties Beric Dondarrion some young lordling with delusions of valor He has that fat jape of a priest with him the one who likes to set his sword on fire Do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off Without making too much a botch of it
