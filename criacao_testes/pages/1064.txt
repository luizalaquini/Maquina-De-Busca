Robert’s face was purple Out he croaked choking on his rage Out damn you I’m done with you What are you waiting for Go run back to Winterfell And make certain I never look on your face again or I swear I’ll have your head on a spike

Ned bowed and turned on his heel without another word He could feel Robert’s eyes on his back As he strode from the council chambers the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men Grand Maester Pycelle offered

Do you have any idea how costly they are Littlefinger complained You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price and that’s for a merchant I don’t dare think what they might ask for a princess

The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices Ser Boros Blount was stationed outside the chamber wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard He gave Ned a quick curious glance from the corner of his eye but asked no questions

The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the Hand He could feel the threat of rain in the air Ned would have welcomed it It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean When he reached his solar he summoned Vayon Poole The steward came at once You sent for me my lord Hand

Hand no longer Ned told him The king and I have quarreled We shall be returning to Winterfell

I shall begin making arrangements at once my lord We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey

We may not have a fortnight We may not have a day The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike Ned frowned He did not truly believe the king would harm him not Robert He was angry now but once Ned was safely out of sight his rage would cool as it always did

Always Suddenly uncomfortably he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen Fifteen years dead yet Robert hates him as much as ever It was a disturbing notion… and there was the other matter the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night That would come to light soon as sure as sunrise and with the king in such a black fury… Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion Lannister but it would touch on his pride and there was no telling what the queen might do

It might be safest if I went on ahead he told Poole I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen The rest of you can follow when you are ready Inform Jory but tell no one else and do nothing until the girls and I have gone The castle is full of eyes and ears and I would rather my plans were not known

As you command my lord

When he had gone Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding Robert had left him no choice that he could see He ought to thank him It would be good to return to Winterfell He ought never have left His sons were waiting there Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned they were not so old yet And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night

And yet the thought of leaving angered him as well So much was still undone Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked… or worse sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans And the truth of Jon Arryn’s death still eluded him Oh he had found a few pieces enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor He had not sighted the beast itself yet though he sensed it was there lurking hidden treacherous

It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea Ned was no sailor and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad but if he took ship he could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council As yet there had been no reply but the silence only deepened his suspicions Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for he was certain of it The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen

And when you have it what then Some secrets are safer kept hidden Some secrets are too dangerous to share even with those you love and trust Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt The Imp’s knife Why would the dwarf want Bran dead To silence him surely Another secret or only a different strand of the same web

Could Robert be part of it He would not have thought so but once he would not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either Catelyn had tried to warn him You knew the man she had said The king is a stranger to you The sooner he was quit of King’s Landing the better If there was a ship sailing north on the morrow it would be well to be on it

He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries quietly but quickly Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain he told the steward I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments so long as it is swift and safe I wish to leave at once

Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor Lord Baelish to see you m’lord

Ned was half-tempted to turn him away but thought better of it He was not free yet until he was he must play their games Show him in Tom

Lord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning He wore a slashed velvet doublet in cream-and-silver a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox and his customary mocking smile

Ned greeted him coldly Might I ask the reason for this visit Lord Baelish

I won’t detain you long I’m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter so her table is always astonishing If truth be told I’d sooner marry the pig but don’t tell her I do love lamprey pie

Don’t let me keep you from your eels my lord Ned said with icy disdain At the moment I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours

Oh I’m certain if you put your mind to it you could come up with a few names Varys say Cersei Or Robert His Grace is most wroth with you He went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently I seem to recall

Ned did not honor that with a reply Nor did he offer his guest a seat but Littlefinger took one anyway After you stormed out it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men he continued blithely Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we’ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl

Ned was disgusted So now we grant titles to assassins

Littlefinger shrugged Titles are cheap The Faceless Men are expensive If truth be told I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her Likely he’ll make a botch of it and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard If we’d sent a Faceless Man after her she’d be as good as buried

Ned frowned You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl How big a fool do you take me for

Well quite an enormous one actually said Littlefinger laughing

Do you always find murder so amusing Lord Baelish

It’s not murder I find amusing Lord Stark it’s you You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice I daresay you will make a noble splash I believe I heard the first crack this morning

The first and last said Ned I’ve had my fill

When do you mean to return to Winterfell my lord

As soon as I can What concern is that of yours

None… but if perchance you’re still here come evenfall I’d be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually Littlefinger smiled And I won’t even tell the Lady Catelyn





CATELYN

My lady you should have sent word of your coming Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass We would have sent an escort The high road is not as safe as it once was for a party as small as yours

We learned that to our sorrow Ser Donnel Catelyn said Sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone six brave men had died to bring her this far and she could not even find it in her to weep for them Even their names were fading The clansmen harried us day and night We lost three men in the first attack and two more in the second and Lannister’s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered When we heard your men approaching I thought us doomed for certain They had drawn up for a last desperate fight blades in hand and backs to the rock The dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn sky-blue and white Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight

The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died Ser Donnel said He was a stocky youth of twenty years earnest and homely with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair If it were up to me I would take a hundred men into the mountains root them out of their fastnesses and teach them some sharp lessons but your sister has forbidden it She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand’s tourney She wants all our swords kept close to home to defend the Vale… against what no one is certain Shadows some say He looked at her anxiously as if he had suddenly remembered who she was I hope I have not spoken out of turn my lady I meant no offense

Frank talk does not offend me Ser Donnel Catelyn knew what her sister feared Not shadows Lannisters she thought to herself glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn The two of them had grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died The little man was more cunning than she liked When they had entered the mountains he had been her captive bound and helpless What was he now Her captive still yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle wearing the shadowskin cloak he’d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he’d taken off Chiggen’s corpse Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn’s young son and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear Could I be wrong Catelyn wondered not for the first time Could he be innocent after all of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest And if he was what did that make her Six men had died to bring him here

Resolute she pushed her doubts away When we reach your keep I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate but Catelyn would not hear of it They had tied him in the saddle instead and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him

Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times to care for Lord Robert he said We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded He can see to your man’s hurts

Catelyn had more faith in a maester’s learning than a septon’s prayers She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower battlements and bridge When they had climbed almost to the top a knight rode out to meet them His horse and his armor were grey but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun and a shiny black fish wrought in gold and obsidian pinned its folds against his shoulder Who would pass the Bloody Gate he called

Ser Donnel Waynwood with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions the young knight answered

The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor I thought the lady looked familiar You are far from home little Cat

And you Uncle she said smiling despite all she had been through Hearing that hoarse smoky voice again took her back twenty years to the days of her childhood

My home is at my back he said gruffly

Your home is in my heart Catelyn told him Take off your helm I would look on your face again
