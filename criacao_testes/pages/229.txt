They will not come They say she is accursed

They’ll come or I’ll have their heads

Doreah wept They are gone my lord

The maegi someone else said Was that Aggo Take her to the maegi

No Dany wanted to say no not that you mustn’t but when she opened her mouth a long wail of pain escaped and the sweat broke over her skin What was wrong with them couldn’t they see Inside the tent the shapes were dancing circling the brazier and the bloody bath dark against the sandsilk and some did not look human She glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf and another like a man wreathed in flames

The Lamb Woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed Irri said She said so I heard her

Yes Doreah agreed I heard her too

No she shouted or perhaps she only thought it for no whisper of sound escaped her lips She was being carried Her eyes opened to gaze up at a flat dead sky black and bleak and starless Please no The sound of Mirri Maz Duur’s voice grew louder until it filled the world The shapes she screamed The dancers

Ser Jorah carried her inside the tent





ARYA

The scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the Street of Flour was sweeter than any perfume Arya had ever smelled She took a deep breath and stepped closer to the pigeon It was a plump one speckled brown busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones but when Arya’s shadow touched it it took to the air

Her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers She was on it in the blink of an eye grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered It pecked at her hand She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap

Compared with catching cats pigeons were easy

A passing septon was looking at her askance Here’s the best place to find pigeon Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword They come for the crumbs He hurried away

She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise Could I have one she heard herself say A lemon or… or any kind

The pushcart man looked her up and down Plainly he did not like what he saw Three coppers

Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot I’ll trade you a fat pigeon she said

The Others take your pigeon the pushcart man said

The tarts were still warm from the oven The smells were making her mouth water but she did not have three coppers… or one She gave the pushcart man a look remembering what Syrio had told her about seeing He was short with a little round belly and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said You be keepin’ your filthy hands off The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats that they do

Arya glanced warily behind her Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley Their cloaks hung almost to the ground the heavy wool dyed a rich gold their mail and boots and gloves were black One wore a longsword at his hip the other an iron cudgel With a last wistful glance at the tarts Arya edged back from the cart and hurried off The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots Arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head thick as flies The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters their commander raised to a lord with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king’s council

She had also heard other things scary things things that made no sense to her Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly Others insisted that Renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting another that he’d died eating a boar stuffing himself so full that he’d ruptured at the table No the king had died at table others said but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him No it had been the queen who poisoned him No he had died of a pox No he had choked on a fish bone

One thing all the stories agreed on King Robert was dead The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king a tanner’s boy told Arya

All she wanted was to go home but leaving King’s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped Talk of war was on every lip and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on… well her for one She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom on rooftops and in stables wherever she could find a place to lie down and it hadn’t taken her long to learn that the district was well named

Every day since her escape from the Red Keep Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn The Dragon Gate the Lion Gate and the Old Gate were closed and barred The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open but only to those who wanted to enter the city the guards let no one out Those who were allowed to leave left by the King’s Gate or the Iron Gate but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King’s Gate Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages forcing riders to open their saddlebags and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot

Sometimes she thought about swimming the river but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship
