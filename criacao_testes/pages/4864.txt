1712 But Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it
under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands
the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun

1713 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword

1714 And the LORD said unto Moses Write this for a memorial in a
book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven

1715 And Moses built an altar and called the name of it
Jehovahnissi 1716 For he said Because the LORD hath sworn that the
LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation

181 When Jethro the priest of Midian Moses father in law heard of
all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people and that
the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt 182 Then Jethro Moses
father in law took Zipporah Moses wife after he had sent her back
183 And her two sons of which the name of the one was Gershom for
he said I have been an alien in a strange land 184 And the name of
the other was Eliezer for the God of my father said he was mine
help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh 185 And Jethro
Moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into
the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of God 186 And he
said unto Moses I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee and thy
wife and her two sons with her

187 And Moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance
and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they
came into the tent

188 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israels sake and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way and how the LORD delivered them

189 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
to Israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians

1810 And Jethro said Blessed be the LORD who hath delivered you out
of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians

1811 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods for in the
thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them

1812 And Jethro Moses father in law took a burnt offering and
sacrifices for God and Aaron came and all the elders of Israel to
eat bread with Moses father in law before God

1813 And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the
people and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
evening

1814 And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people
he said What is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest
thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
even  1815 And Moses said unto his father in law Because the people
come unto me to enquire of God 1816 When they have a matter they
come unto me and I judge between one and another and I do make them
know the statutes of God and his laws

1817 And Moses father in law said unto him The thing that thou
doest is not good

1818 Thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is
with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone

1819 Hearken now unto my voice I will give thee counsel and God
shall be with thee Be thou for the people to God-ward that thou
mayest bring the causes unto God 1820 And thou shalt teach them
ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must
walk and the work that they must do

1821 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such
as fear God men of truth hating covetousness and place such over
them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of
fifties and rulers of tens 1822 And let them judge the people at
all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring
unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be
easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee

1823 If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so then thou
shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their
place in peace

1824 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did
all that he had said

1825 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads
over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of
fifties and rulers of tens

1826 And they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they
brought unto Moses but every small matter they judged themselves

1827 And Moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into
his own land
