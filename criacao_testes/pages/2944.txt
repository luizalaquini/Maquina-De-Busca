snares of death

is hard

1316 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge but a fool layeth open
his folly

1317 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief but a faithful
ambassador is health

down with her hands

is perverse in his ways despiseth him

the wise shall preserve them

strength of the ox

lies

in him the lips of knowledge

of fools is deceit

149 Fools make a mock at sin but among the righteous there is
favour

intermeddle with his joy

of the upright shall flourish

1412 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the ways of death

mirth is heaviness
