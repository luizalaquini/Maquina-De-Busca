foal of an ass

216 And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them 217 And
brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they
set him thereon

218 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way
others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way

219 And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried
saying Hosanna to the son of David Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest

2110 And when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved
saying Who is this  2111 And the multitude said This is Jesus the
prophet of Nazareth of Galilee

2112 And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the
moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves 2113 And said
unto them It is written My house shall be called the house of
prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves

2114 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he
healed them

2115 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying
Hosanna to the son of David they were sore displeased 2116 And said
unto him Hearest thou what these say And Jesus saith unto them Yea
have ye never read Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise  2117 And he left them and went out of the city
into Bethany and he lodged there

2118 Now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered

2119 And when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found
nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it Let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever And presently the fig tree withered
away

2120 And when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying How soon
is the fig tree withered away  2121 Jesus answered and said unto
them Verily I say unto you If ye have faith and doubt not ye shall
not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall
say unto this mountain Be thou removed and be thou cast into the
sea it shall be done

2122 And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye
shall receive

2123 And when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the
elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said By
what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this
authority  2124 And Jesus answered and said unto them I also will
ask you one thing which if ye tell me I in like wise will tell you
by what authority I do these things

2125 The baptism of John whence was it from heaven or of men And
they reasoned with themselves saying If we shall say From heaven
he will say unto us Why did ye not then believe him  2126 But if we
shall say Of men we fear the people for all hold John as a prophet

2127 And they answered Jesus and said We cannot tell And he said
unto them Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things

2128 But what think ye A certain man had two sons and he came to
the first and said Son go work to day in my vineyard

2129 He answered and said I will not but afterward he repented and
went

2130 And he came to the second and said likewise And he answered
and said I go sir and went not

2131 Whether of them twain did the will of his father They say unto
him The first Jesus saith unto them Verily I say unto you That the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you

2132 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye
believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and
ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe
him

2133 Hear another parable There was a certain householder which
planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress
in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into
a far country 2134 And when the time of the fruit drew near he sent
his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of
it

2135 And the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed
another and stoned another

2136 Again he sent other servants more than the first and they did
unto them likewise

2137 But last of all he sent unto them his son saying They will
reverence my son
