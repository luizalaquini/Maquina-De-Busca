a position of captivity
I like you the better for that incivility miss he
said
 I should have liked -- I wish -- you had never shown
yourself to me by intruding here She pulled again
and the gathers of her dress began to give way like
liliputian musketry
 I deserve the chastisement your words give me
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
an aversion to her fathers sex  
Go on your way please
 What Beauty and drag you after me  Do but
look I never saw such a tangle
O tis shameful of you  you have been making
it worse on purpose to keep me here -- you have  
Indeed I dont think so said the sergeant with a
merry twinkle
P 216
I tell you you have she exclaimed in high
temper I insist upon undoing it Now allow me
Certainly miss I am not of steel He added a
sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh could
possess without losing its nature altogether I am
thankful for beauty even when tis thrown to me like
a bone to a dog These moments will be over too
soon
She closed her lips in a determined silence
Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a
bold and desperate rush she could free herself at the
risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her The
thought was too dreadful The dress -- which she had
put on to appear stately at the supper -- was the head
and front of her wardrobe  not another in her stock
became her so well What woman in Bathshebas
position not naturally timid and within call of her
retainers would have bought escape from a dashing
soldier at so dear a price 
All in good time  it will soon be done I perceive
said her cool friend
 This trifling provokes and -- and --  -- 
 Not too cruel
 --  Insults me
It is done in order that I may have the pleasure
of apologizing to so charming a woman which I
straightway do most humbly madam he said bowing
low
Bathsheba really knew not what to say
Ive seen a good many women in my time
continued the young man in a murmur and more
thoughtfully than hitherto critically regarding her bent
head at the same time but Ive never seen a woman
so beautiful as you Take it or leave it -- be offended
or like it -- I dont care
 Who are you then who can so well afford to
despise opinion  
 No stranger Sergeant Troy I am staying in
this place -- There  it is undone at last you see
Your light fingers were more eager than mine I wish it
had been the knot of knots which theres no untying  
This was worse and worse She started up and so
did he
P 217
How to decently get away from him -- that
was her difficulty now She sidled off inch by inch
the lantern in her hand till she could see the redness
of his coat no longer
 Ah Beauty  good-bye   he said
She made no reply and reaching a distance of
twenty or thirty yards turned about and ran indoors
Liddy had just retired to rest In ascending to her
own chamber Bathsheba opened the girls door an
inch or two and panting said --
 Liddy is any soldier staying in the village --
sergeant somebody -- rather gentlemanly for a sergeant
and good looking -- a red coat with blue facings 
No miss  No I say but really it might be
Sergeant Troy home on furlough though I have not
seen him He was here once in that way when the
regiment was at Casterbridge
 Yes thats the name Had he a moustache -- no
whiskers or beard 
 He had
 What kind of a person is he 
O  miss -- I blush to name it -- a gay man But
I know him to be very quick and trim who might have
made his thousands like a squire Such a clever
young dand as he is Hes a doctors son by name
which is a great deal and hes an earls son by
nature
 Which is a great deal more Fancy Is it true  
 Yes And he was brought up so well and sent to
Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years
Learnt all languages while he was there  and it was
said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese
in shorthand  but that I dont answer for as it was
only reported However he wasted his gifted lot
and listed a soldier but even then he rose to be a
sergeant without trying at all Ah such a blessing it
is to be high-born  nobility of blood will shine out even
in the ranks and files And is he really come home
