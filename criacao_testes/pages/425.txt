No doubt she will And why wait Joffrey shall we send for your mother 

The king flushed

Nothing to say Your Grace his uncle went on Good Learn to use your ears more and your mouth less or your reign will be shorter than I am Wanton brutality is no way to win your people’s love… or your queen’s

Fear is better than love Mother says Joffrey pointed at Sansa She fears me

The Imp sighed Yes I see A pity Stannis and Renly aren’t twelve-year-old girls as well Bronn Timett bring her

Sansa moved as if in a dream She thought the Imp’s men would take her back to her bedchamber in Maegor’s Holdfast but instead they conducted her to the Tower of the Hand She had not set foot inside that place since the day her father fell from grace and it made her feel faint to climb those steps again

Some serving girls took charge of her mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair As they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head all she could see were the faces from the bailey Knights are sworn to defend the weak protect women and fight for the right but none of them did a thing Only Ser Dontos had tried to help and he was no longer a knight no more than the Imp was nor the Hound… the Hound hated knights… I hate them too Sansa thought They are no true knights not one of them

After she was clean plump ginger-headed Maester Frenken came to see her He bid her lie facedown on the mattress while he spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered the backs of her legs Afterward he mixed her a draught of dreamwine with some honey so it might go down easier Sleep a bit child When you wake all this will seem a bad dream

No it won’t you stupid man Sansa thought but she drank the drearnwine anyway and slept

It was dark when she woke again not quite knowing where she was the room both strange and strangely familiar As she rose a stab of pain went through her legs and brought it all back Tears filled her eyes Someone had laid out a robe for her beside the bed Sansa slipped it on and opened the door Outside stood a hard-faced woman with leathery brown skin three necklaces looped about her scrawny neck One was gold and one was silver and one was made of human ears Where does she think she’s going the woman asked leaning on a tall spear

The godswood She had to find Ser Dontos beg him to take her home now before it was too late

The halfman said you’re not to leave the woman said Pray here the gods will hear

Meekly Sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside She realized suddenly why this place seemed so familiar They’ve put me in Arya’s old bedchamber from when Father was the Hand of the King All her things are gone and the furnishings have been moved around but it’s the same…

A short time later a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives with a flagon of cold water Take it away Sansa commanded but the girl left the food on a table She was thirsty she realized Every step sent knives through her thighs but she made herself cross the room She drank two cups of water and was nibbling on an olive when the knock came

Anxiously she turned toward the door smoothed down the folds of her robe Yes

The door opened and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside My lady I trust I am not disturbing you

Am I your prisoner

My guest He was wearing his chain of office a necklace of linked golden hands I thought we might talk

As my lord commands Sansa found it hard not to stare his face was so ugly it held a queer fascination for her

The food and garments are to your satisfaction he asked If there is anything else you need you have only to ask

You are most kind And this morning… it was very good of you to help me

You have a right to know why Joffrey was so wroth Six nights gone your brother fell upon my uncle Stafford encamped with his host at a village called Oxcross not three days ride from Casterly Rock Your northerners won a crushing victory We received word only this morning

Robb will kill you all she thought exulting It’s… terrible my lord My brother is a vile traitor

The dwarf smiled wanly Well he’s no fawn he’s made that clear enough

Ser Lancel said Robb led an army of wargs…

The Imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter Ser Lancel’s a wineskin warrior who wouldn’t know a warg from a wart Your brother had his direwolf with him but I suspect that’s as far as it went The northmen crept into my uncle’s camp and cut his horse lines and Lord Stark sent his wolf among them Even war-trained destriers went mad Knights were trampled to death in their pavilions and the rabble woke in terror and fled casting aside their weapons to run the faster Ser Stafford was slain as he chased after a horse Lord Rickard Karstark drove a lance through his chest Ser Rubert Brax is also dead along with Ser Lymond Vikary Lord Crakehall and Lord Jast Half a hundred more have been taken captive including Jast’s sons and my nephew Martyn Lannister Those who survived are spreading wild tales and swearing that the old gods of the north march with your brother

Then… there was no sorcery
