Arm us Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm You will need every sword

She knew he was right Tyrion could see it The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor as they slaughtered each other They might spare Catelyn herself she was still young enough to bear sons Still she hesitated

I hear them Ser Rodrik called out Tyrion turned his head to listen and there it was hoofbeats a dozen horses or more coming nearer Suddenly everyone was moving reaching for weapons running to their mounts

Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap Twenty men maybe twenty-five he said breathless Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers by my guess They must have eyes out m’lady… hidden watchers… they know we’re here

Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse a longsword in hand Mohor crouched behind a boulder both hands on his iron-tipped spear a dagger between his teeth You singer Ser Willis Wode called out Help me with this breastplate Marillion sat frozen clutching his woodharp his face as pale as milk but Tyrion’s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor

Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark You have no choice he told her Three of us and a fourth man wasted guarding us… four men can be the difference between life and death up here

Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done

My word The hoofbeats were louder now Tyrion grinned crookedly Oh that you have my lady… on my honor as a Lannister

For a moment he thought she would spit at him but instead she snapped Arm them and as quick as that she was pulling away Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard and wheeled to meet the foe Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver and went to one knee beside the road He was a better archer than swordsman And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe

I have never fought with an axe The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands It had a short haft a heavy head a nasty spike on top

Pretend you’re splitting logs Bronn said drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back He spat and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik Ser Willis mounted up to join them fumbling with his helmet a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume

Logs don’t bleed Tyrion said to no one in particular He felt naked without armor He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding Move over

Go away the boy screamed back at him I’m a singer I want no part of this fight

What lost your taste for adventure Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over and not a moment too soon A heartbeat later the riders were on them

There were no heralds no banners no horns nor drums only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor faces hidden behind barred halfhelms In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons longswords and lances and sharpened scythes spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak armed with a two-handed greatsword

Ser Rodrik shouted Winterfell and rode to meet him with Bronn and Chiggen beside him screaming some wordless battle cry Ser Willis Wode followed swinging a spiked morningstar around his head Harrenhal Harrenhal he sang Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up brandish his axe and boom out Casterly Rock but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower

He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal Chiggen’s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind cutting down foes right and left Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak When he opened his mouth to scream only blood came out By the time he fell Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else

Suddenly Marillion shrieked covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them hefting a spiked maul Tyrion swung his axe with both hands The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk angling upward and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way Marillion was less fortunate Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer Tyrion danced back in while the brigand’s leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount and buried the axe in the man’s neck just above the shoulder blades

As he struggled to yank the blade loose he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies Someone help me the singer gasped Gods have mercy I’m bleeding

I believe that’s horse blood Tyrion said The singer’s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead animal scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch Close your eyes and pretend you’re dead he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away

After that things ran together The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood and the world had turned to chaos Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks He saw Bronn unhorsed fighting with a sword in each hand Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses He found a wounded clansman and left him dead helping himself to the man’s halfhelm It fit too snugly but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket’s body The pig face had been smashed in with a mace but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man’s dead fingers He was sliding it through his belt when he heard a woman’s scream

Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her one still mounted and the other two on foot She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides Let them have the bitch Tyrion thought and welcome to her yet somehow he was moving He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he was there and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood Logs that bleed Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him Tyrion ducked under his sword lashed out with the axe the man reeled backward… and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly

Tyrion looked around The enemy were all vanquished or vanished Somehow the fighting had ended when he wasn’t looking Dying horses and wounded men lay all around screaming or moaning To his vast astonishment he was not one of them He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground His hands were sticky with blood He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all

Your first battle Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck’s body pulling off his boots They were good boots as befit one of Lord Tywin’s men heavy leather oiled and supple much finer than what Bronn was wearing

Tyrion nodded My father will be so proud he said His legs were cramping so badly he could scarcely stand Odd he had never once noticed the pain during the battle

You need a woman now Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes He shoved the boots into his saddlebag Nothing like a woman after a man’s been blooded take my word

Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips
