Varys gave me the same report

He could be here by the full moon

Not at his present leisurely pace Tyrion assured her He feasts every night in a different castle and holds court at every crossroads he passes

And every day more men rally to his banners His host is now said to be a hundred thousand strong

That seems rather high

He has the power of Storm’s End and Highgarden behind him you little fool Cersei snapped down at him All the Tyrell bannermen but for the Redwynes and you have me to thank for that So long as I hold those poxy twins of his Lord Paxter will squat on the Arbor and count himself fortunate to be out of it

A pity you let the Knight of Flowers slip through your pretty fingers Still Renly has other concerns besides us Our father at Harrenhal Robb Stark at Riverrun… were I he I would do much as he is doing Make my progress flaunt my power for the realm to see watch wait Let my rivals contend while I bide my own sweet time If Stark defeats us the south will fall into Renly’s hands like a windfall from the gods and he’ll not have lost a man And if it goes the other way he can descend on us while we are weakened

Cersei was not appeased I want you to make Father bring his army to King’s Landing

Where it will serve no purpose but to make you feel safe When have I ever been able to make Father do anything

She ignored the question And when do you plan to free Jaime He’s worth a hundred of you

Tyrion grinned crookedly Don’t tell Lady Stark I beg you We don’t have a hundred of me to trade

Father must have been mad to send you You’re worse than useless The queen jerked on her reins and wheeled her palfrey around She rode out the gate at a brisk trot ermine cloak streaming behind her Her retinue hastened after

In truth Renly Baratheon did not frighten Tyrion half so much as his brother Stannis did Renly was beloved of the commons but he had never before led men in war Stannis was otherwise hard cold inexorable if only they had some way of knowing what was happening on Dragonstone… but not one of the fisherfolk he had paid to spy out the island had ever returned and even the informers the eunuch claimed to have placed in Stannis’s household had been ominously silent The striped hulls of Lysene war galleys had been seen offshore though and Varys had reports from Myr of sellsail captains taking service with Dragonstone If Stannis attacks by sea while his brother Renly storms the gates they’ll soon be mounting Joffrey’s head on a spike Worse mine will be beside him A depressing thought He ought to make plans to get Shae safely out of the city should the worst seem likely

Podrick Payne stood at the door of his solar studying the floor He’s inside he announced to Tyrion’s belt buckle Your solar My lord Sorry

Tyrion sighed Look at me Pod It unnerves me when you talk to my codpiece especially when I’m not wearing one Who is inside my solar

Lord Littlefinger Podrick managed a quick look at his face then hastily dropped his eyes I meant Lord Petyr Lord Baelish The master of coin 

You make him sound a crowd The boy hunched down as if struck making Tyrion feel absurdly guilty

Lord Petyr was seated on his window seat languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape one gloved hand resting on his knee The king is fighting hares with a crossbow he said The hares are winning Come see

Tyrion had to stand on his toes to get a look A dead hare lay on the ground below another long ears twitching was about to expire from the bolt in his side Spent quarrels lay strewn across the hard-packed earth like straws scattered by a storm Now Joff shouted The gamesman released the hare he was holding and he went bounding off Joffrey jerked the trigger on the crossbow The bolt missed by two feet The hare stood on his hind legs and twitched his nose at the king Cursing Joff spun the wheel to winch back his string but the animal was gone before he was loaded Another The gamesman reached into the hutch This one made a brown streak against the stones while Joffrey’s hurried shot almost took Ser Preston in the groin

Littlefinger turned away Boy are you fond of potted hare he asked Podrick Payne

Pod stared at the visitor’s boots lovely things of red-dyed leather ornamented with black scrollwork To eat my lord

Invest in pots Littlefinger advised Hares will soon overrun the castle We’ll be eating hare thrice a day

Better than rats on a skewer said Tyrion Pod leave us Unless Lord Petyr would care for some refreshment

Thank you but no Littlefinger flashed his mocking smile Drink with the dwarf it’s said and you wake up walking the Wall Black brings out my unhealthy pallor

Have no fear my lord Tyrion thought it’s not the Wall I have in mind for you He seated himself in a high chair piled with cushions and said You look very elegant today my lord

I’m wounded I strive to look elegant every day

Is the doublet new

It is You’re most observant

Plum and yellow Are those the colors of your House

No But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out or so I’ve found

That’s a handsome knife as well

Is it There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes He drew the knife and glanced at it casually as if he had never seen it before Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt A trifle plain though It’s yours if you would like it

Mine Tyrion gave him a long look No I think not Never mine He knows the insolent wretch He knows and he knows that I know and he thinks that I cannot touch him

If ever truly a man had armored himself in gold it was Petyr Baelish not Jaime Lannister Jaime’s famous armor was but gilded steel but Littlefinger ah… Tyrion had learned a few things about sweet Petyr to his growing disquiet

Ten years ago Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king’s other collectors King Robert had been a prodigious spender A man like Petyr Baelish who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third was invaluable to his Hand Littlefinger’s rise had been arrow-swift Within three years of his coming to court he was master of coin and a member of the small council and today the crown’s revenues were ten times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor… though the crown’s debts had grown vast as well A master juggler was Petyr Baelish

Oh he was clever He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault no He paid the king’s debts in promises and put the king’s gold to work He bought wagons shops ships houses He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys stored it moved it dyed it sold it The golden dragons bred and multiplied and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings

And in the process he moved his own men into place The Keepers of the Keys were his all four The King’s Counter and the King’s Scales were men he’d named The officers in charge of all three mints Harbormasters tax farmers customs sergeants wool factors toll collectors pursers wine factors nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger They were men of middling birth by and large merchants’ sons lesser lordlings sometimes even foreigners but judging from their results far more able than their highborn predecessors

No one had ever thought to question the appointments and why should they Littlefinger was no threat to anyone A clever smiling genial man everyone’s friend always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required and yet of such undistinguished birth one step up from a hedge knight he was not a man to fear He had no banners to call no army of retainers no great stronghold no holdings to speak of no prospects of a great marriage

But do I dare touch him Tyrion wondered Even if he is a traitor He was not at all certain he could least of all now while the war raged Given time he could replace Littlefinger’s men with his own in key positions but…

A shout rang up from the yard Ah His Grace has killed a hare Lord Baelish observed

No doubt a slow one Tyrion said My lord you were fostered at Riverrun I’ve heard it said that you grew close to the Tullys

You might say so The girls especially

How close

I had their maidenhoods Is that close enough

The lie—Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie—was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied About her defloration and the dagger as well The longer he lived the more Tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true Lord Hoster’s daughters do not love me he confessed I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make Yet coming from you the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears 

That would depend on the words If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother waste someone else’s time Joffrey will never surrender his plaything and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl

I mean to have Arya as well I have men searching

Searching is not finding

I’ll keep that in mind my lord In any case it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway For her I have a sweeter offer

Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn true… but also more fearful and I understand she hates you
