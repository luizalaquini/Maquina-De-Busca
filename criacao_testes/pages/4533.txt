Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth’s wing to them Dany said remembering

Stubborn child You will be lost and never found

She walked away from him to the door on the right

No Pyat screeched No to me come to me to meeeeeee His face crumbled inward changing to something pale and wormlike

Dany left him behind entering a stairwell She began to climb Before long her legs were aching She recalled that the House of the Undying Ones had seemed to have no towers

Finally the stair opened To her right a set of wide wooden doors had been thrown open They were fashioned of ebony and weirwood the black and white grains swirling and twisting in strange interwoven patterns They were very beautiful yet somehow frightening The blood of the dragon must not be afraid Dany said a quick prayer begging the Warrior for courage and the Dothraki horse god for strength She made herself walk forward

Beyond the doors was a great hall and a splendor of wizards Some wore sumptuous robes of ermine ruby velvet and cloth of gold Others fancied elaborate armor studded with gemstones or tall pointed hats speckled with stars There were women among them dressed in gowns of surpassing loveliness Shafts of sunlight slanted through windows of stained glass and the air was alive with the most beautiful music she had ever heard

A kingly man in rich robes rose when he saw her and smiled Daenerys of House Targaryen be welcome Come and share the food of forever We are the Undying of Qarth

Long have we awaited you said a woman beside him clad in rose and silver The breast she had left bare in the Qartheen fashion was as perfect as a breast could be

We knew you were to come to us the wizard king said A thousand years ago we knew and have been waiting all this time We sent the comet to show you the way

We have knowledge to share with you said a warrior in shining emerald armor and magic weapons to arm you with You have passed every trial Now come and sit with us and all your questions shall be answered

She took a step forward But then Drogon leapt from her shoulder He flew to the top of the ebony-and-weirwood door perched there and began to bite at the carved wood

A willful beast laughed a handsome young man Shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind Come come

Doubt seized her The great door was so heavy it took all of Dany’s strength to budge it but finally it began to move Behind was another door hidden It was old grey wood splintery and plain    but it stood to the right of the door through which she’d entered The wizards were beckoning her with voices sweeter than song She ran from them Drogon flying back down to her Through the narrow door she passed into a chamber awash in gloom

A long stone table filled this room Above it floated a human heart swollen and blue with corruption yet still alive It beat a deep ponderous throb of sound and each pulse sent out a wash of indigo light The figures around the table were no more than blue shadows As Dany walked to the empty chair at the foot of the table they did not stir nor speak nor turn to face her There was no sound but the slow deep beat of the rotting heart

   mother of dragons    came a voice part

whisper and part moan    dragons    drag-

ons    dragons    other voices echoed in the gloom Some were male and some female One spoke with the timbre of a child The floating heart pulsed from dimness to darkness It was hard to summon the will to speak to recall the words she had practiced so assiduously I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros Do they hear me Why don’t they move She sat folding her hands in her lap Grant me your counsel and speak to me with the wisdom of those who have conquered death

Through the indigo murk she could make out the wizened features of the Undying One to her right an old old man wrinkled and hairless His flesh was a ripe violet-blue his lips and nails bluer still so dark they were almost black Even the whites of his eyes were blue They stared unseeing at the ancient woman on the opposite side of the table whose gown of pale silk had rotted on her body One withered breast was left bare in the Qartheen manner to show a pointed blue nipple hard as leather

She is not breathing Dany listened to the silence None of them are breathing and they do not move and those eyes see nothing Could it be that the Undying Ones were dead

Her answer was a whisper as thin as a mouse’s whisker    we live    live    live    it sounded Myriad other voices whispered echoes    and know    know    know    know   

I have come for the gift of truth Dany said In the long hall the things I saw    were they true visions or lies Past things or things to come What did they mean

   the shape of shadows    morrows not yet made    drink from the cup of ice    drink from the cup of fire   

   mother of dragons    child of three   

Three She did not understand

   three heads has the dragon    the ghost chorus yammered inside her skull with never a lip moving never a breath stirring the still blue air    mother of dragons    child of storm    The whispers became a swirling song    three fires must you light    one for life and one for death and one to love    Her own heart was beating in unison to the one that floated before her blue and corrupt    three mounts must you ride    one to bed and one to dread and one to love    The voices were growing louder she realized and it seemed her heart was slowing and even her breath    three treasons will you know    once for blood and once for gold and once for love   

I don’t    Her voice was no more than a whisper almost as faint as theirs What was happening to her I don’t understand she said more loudly Why was it so hard to talk here Help me Show me

   help her    the whispers mocked    show her   

Then phantoms shivered through the murk images in indigo Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion a burning city behind him Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman’s name    mother of dragons daughter of death    Glowing like sunset a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd From a smoking tower a great stone beast took wing breathing shadow fire    mother of dragons slayer of lies    Her silver was trotting through the grass to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars A corpse stood at the prow of a ship eyes bright in his dead face grey lips smiling sadly A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice and filled the air with sweetness    mother of dragons bride of fire   

Faster and faster the visions came one after the other until it seemed as if the very air had come alive Shadows whirled and danced inside a tent boneless and terrible A little girl ran barefoot toward a big house with a red door Mirri Maz Duur shrieked in the flames a dragon bursting from her brow Behind a silver horse the bloody corpse of a naked man bounced and dragged A white lion ran through grass taller than a man Beneath the Mother of Mountains a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before her their grey heads bowed Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on her silver riding like the wind Mother they cried Mother mother They were reaching for her touching her tugging at her cloak the hem of her skirt her foot her leg her breast They wanted her needed her the fire the life and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them   

But then black wings buffeted her round the head and a scream of fury cut the indigo air and suddenly the visions were gone ripped away and Dany’s gasp turned to horror The Undying were all around her blue and cold whispering as they reached for her pulling stroking tugging at her clothes touching her with their dry cold hands twining their fingers through her hair All the strength had left her limbs She could not move Even her heart had ceased to beat She felt a hand on her bare breast twisting her nipple Teeth found the soft skin of her throat A mouth descended on one eye licking sucking biting   

Then indigo turned to orange and whispers turned to screams Her heart was pounding racing the hands and mouths were gone heat washed over her skin and Dany blinked at a sudden glare Perched above her the dragon spread his wings and tore at the terrible dark heart ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons and when his head snapped forward fire flew from his open jaws bright and hot She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead Their flesh was crumbling parchment their bones dry wood soaked in tallow They danced as the flames consumed them they staggered and writhed and spun and raised blazing hands on high their fingers bright as torches

Dany pushed herself to her feet and bulled through them They were light as air no more than husks and they fell at a touch The whole room was ablaze by the time she reached the door Drogon she called and he flew to her through the fire

Outside a long dim passageway stretched serpentine before her lit by the flickering orange glare from behind Dany ran searching for a door a door to her right a door to her left any door but there was nothing only twisty stone walls and a floor that seemed to move slowly under her feet writhing as if to trip her She kept her feet and ran faster and suddenly the door was there ahead of her a door like an open mouth

When she spilled out into the sun the bright light made her stumble Pyat Pree was gibbering in some unknown tongue and hopping from one foot to the other When Dany looked behind her she saw thin tendrils of smoke forcing their way through cracks in the ancient stone walls of the Palace of Dust and rising from between the black tiles of the roof

Howling curses Pyat Pree drew a knife and danced toward her but Drogon flew at his face Then she heard the crack of Jhogo’s whip and never was a sound so sweet The knife went flying and an instant later Rakharo was slamming Pyat to the ground Ser Jorah Mormont knelt beside Dany in the cool green grass and put his arm around her shoulder





TYRION

If you die stupidly I’m going to feed your body to the goats Tyrion threatened as the first load of Stone Crows pushed off from the quay

Shagga laughed The Halfman has no goats

I’ll get some just for you

Dawn was breaking and pale ripples of light shimmered on the surface of the river shattering under the poles and re-forming when the ferry had passed Timett had taken his Burned Men into the kingswood two days before Yesterday the Black Ears and Moon Brothers followed today the Stone Crows



Whatever you do don’t try and fight a battle Tyrion said Strike at their camps and baggage train Ambush their scouts and hang the bodies from trees ahead of their line of march loop around and cut down stragglers I want night attacks so many and so sudden that they’ll be afraid to sleep—

Shagga laid a hand atop Tyrion’s head All this I learned from Dolf son of Holger before my beard had grown This is the way of war in the Mountains of the Moon

The kingswood is not the Mountains of the Moon and you won’t be fighting Milk Snakes and Painted Dogs And listen to the guides I’m sending they know this wood as well as you know your mountains Heed their counsel and they’ll serve you well

Shagga will listen to the Halfman’s pets the clansman promised solemnly And then it was time for him to lead his garron onto the ferry Tyrion watched them push off and pole out toward the center of the Blackwater He felt a queer twinge in the pit of his stomach as Shagga faded in the morning mist He was going to feel naked without his clansmen

He still had Bronn’s hirelings near eight hundred of them now but sellswords were notoriously fickle Tyrion had done what he could to buy their continued loyalty promising Bronn and a dozen of his best men lands and knighthoods when the battle was won They’d drunk his wine laughed at his jests and called each other ser until they were all staggering    all but Bronn himself who’d only smiled that insolent dark smile of his and afterward said They’ll kill for that knighthood but don’t ever think they’ll die for it

Tyrion had no such delusion
