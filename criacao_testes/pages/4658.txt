Stoney Sept was the biggest town Arya had seen since King’s Landing and Harwin said her father had won a famous battle here

The Mad King’s men had been hunting Robert trying to catch him before he could rejoin your father he told her as they rode toward the gate He was wounded being tended by some friends when Lord Connington the Hand took the town with a mighty force and started searching house by house Before they could find him though Lord Eddard and your grandfather came down on the town and stormed the walls Lord Connington fought back fierce They battled in the streets and alleys even on the rooftops and all the septons rang their bells so the smallfolk would know to lock their doors Robert came out of hiding to join the fight when the bells began to ring He slew six men that day they say One was Myles Mooton a famous knight who’d been Prince Rhaegar’s squire He would have slain the Hand too but the battle never brought them together Connington wounded your grandfather Tully sore though and killed Ser Denys Arryn the darling of the Vale But when he saw the day was lost he flew off as fast as the griffins on his shield The Battle of the Bells they called it after Robert always said your father won it not him

More recent battles had been fought here as well Arya thought from the look of the place The town gates were made of raw new wood outside the walls a pile of charred planks remained to tell what had happened to the old ones

Stoney Sept was closed up tight but when the captain of the gate saw who they were he opened a sally port for them How you fixed for food Tom asked as they entered

Not so bad as we were The Huntsman brought in a flock o’ sheep and there’s been some trading across the Blackwater The harvest wasn’t burned south o’ the river Course there’s plenty want to take what we got Wolves one day Mummers the next Them that’s not looking for food are looking for plunder or women to rape and them that’s not out for gold or wenches are looking for the bloody Kingslayer Talk is he slipped right through Lord Edmure’s fingers

Lord Edmure Lem frowned Is Lord Hoster dead then

Dead or dying Think Lannister might be making for the Blackwater It’s the quickest way to King’s Landing the Huntsman swears The captain did not wait for an answer He took his dogs out for a sniff round If Ser Jaime’s hereabouts they’ll find him I’ve seen them dogs rip bears apart Think they’ll like the taste of lion blood

A chewed-up corpse’s no good to no one said Lem The Huntsman bloody well knows that too

When the westermen came through they raped the Huntsman’s wife and sister put his crops to the torch ate half his sheep and killed the other half for spite Killed six dogs too and threw the carcasses down his well A chewed-up corpse would be plenty good enough for him I’d say Me as well

He’d best not said Lem That’s all I got to say He’d best not and you’re a bloody fool

Arya rode between Harwin and Anguy as the outlaws moved down the streets where her father once had fought She could see the sept on its hill and below it a stout strong holdfast of grey stone that looked much too small for such a big town But every third house they passed was a blackened shell and she saw no people Are all the townfolk dead

Only shy Anguy pointed out two bowmen on a roof and some boys with sooty faces crouched in the rubble of an alehouse Farther on a baker threw open a shuttered window and shouted down to Lem The sound of his voice brought more people out of hiding and Stoney Sept slowly seemed to come to life around them

In the market square at the town’s heart stood a fountain in the shape of a leaping trout spouting water into a shallow pool Women were filling pails and flagons there A few feet away a dozen iron cages hung from creaking wooden posts Crow cages Arya knew The crows were mostly outside the cages splashing in the water or perched atop the bars inside were men Lem reined up scowling What’s this now

Justice answered a woman at the fountain

What did you run short o’ hempen rope

Was this done at Ser Wilbert’s decree asked Tom

A man laughed bitterly The lions killed Ser Wilbert a year ago His sons are all off with the Young Wolf getting fat in the west You think they give a damn for the likes of us It was the Mad Huntsman caught these wolves

Wolves Arya went cold Robb’s men and my father’s She felt drawn toward the cages The bars allowed so little room that prisoners could neither sit nor turn they stood naked exposed to sun and wind and rain The first three cages held dead men Carrion crows had eaten out their eyes yet the empty sockets seemed to follow her The fourth man in the row stirred as she passed Around his mouth his ragged beard was thick with blood and flies They exploded when he spoke buzzing around his head Water The word was a croak Please    water   

The man in the next cage opened his eyes at the sound Here he said Here me An old man he was his beard was grey and his scalp was bald and mottled brown with age

There was another dead man beyond the old one a big red-bearded man with a rotting grey bandage covering his left ear and part of his temple But the worst thing was between his legs where nothing remained but a crusted brown hole crawling with maggots Farther down was a fat man The crow cage was so cruelly narrow it was hard to see how they’d ever gotten him inside The iron dug painfully into his belly squeezing bulges out between the bars Long days baking in the sun had burned him a painful red from head to heel When he shifted his weight his cage creaked and swayed and Arya could see pale white stripes where the bars had shielded his flesh from the sun

Whose men were you she asked them

At the sound of her voice the fat man opened his eyes The skin around them was so red they looked like boiled eggs floating in a dish of blood Water    a drink   

Whose she said again

Pay them no mind boy the townsman told her They’re none o’ your concern Ride on by

What did they do she asked him

They put eight people to the sword at Tumbler’s Falls he said They wanted the Kingslayer but he wasn’t there so they did some rape and murder He jerked a thumb toward the corpse with maggots where his manhood ought to be That one there did the raping Now move along

A swallow the fat one called down Ha’ mercy boy a swallow The old one slid an arm up to grasp the bars The motion made his cage swing violently Water gasped the one with the flies in his beard

She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes at their dry cracked bleeding lips Wolves she thought again Like me Was this her pack How could they be Robb’s men She wanted to hit them She wanted to hurt them She wanted to cry They all seemed to be looking at her the living and the dead alike The old man had squeezed three fingers out between the bars Water he said water

Arya swung down from her horse They can’t hurt me they’re dying She took her cup from her bedroll and went to the fountain What do you think you’re doing boy the townsman snapped They’re no concern o’ yours She raised the cup to the fish’s mouth The water splashed across her fingers and down her sleeve but Arya did not move until the cup was brimming over When she turned back toward the cages the townsman moved to stop her You get away from them boy—

She’s a girl said Harwin Leave her be

Aye said Lem Lord Beric don’t hold with caging men to die of thirst Why don’t you hang them decent

There was nothing decent ’bout them things they did at Tumbler’s Falls the townsman growled right back at him

The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up She planted a foot in Harwin’s cupped hands vaulted onto Gendry’s shoulders and grabbed the bars on top of the cage The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron and Arya poured the water over him He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over his head and cheeks and hands and then he licked the dampness off the bars He would have licked Arya’s fingers if she hadn’t snatched them back By the time she served the other two the same a crowd had gathered to watch her The Mad Huntsman will hear of this a man threatened He won’t like it No he won’t

He’ll like this even less then Anguy strung his longbow slid an arrow from his quiver nocked drew loosed The fat man shuddered as the shaft drove up between his chins but the cage would not let him fall Two more arrows ended the other two northmen The only sound in the market square was the splash of falling water and the buzzing of flies

Valar morghulis Arya thought

On the east side of the market square stood a modest inn with whitewashed walls and broken windows Half its roof had burnt off recently but the hole had been patched over Above the door hung a wooden shingle painted as a peach with a big bite taken out of it They dismounted at the stables sitting catty-corner and Greenbeard bellowed for grooms

The buxom red-haired innkeep howled with pleasure at the sight of them then promptly set to tweaking them Greenbeard is it Or Greybeard Mother take mercy when did you get so old Lem is that you Still wearing the same ratty cloak are you I know why you never wash it I do You’re afraid all the piss will wash out and we’ll see you’re really a knight o’ the Kingsguard And Tom o’ Sevens you randy old goat You come to see that son o’ yours Well you’re too late he’s off riding with that bloody Huntsman And don’t tell me he’s not yours

He hasn’t got my voice Tom protested weakly

He’s got your nose though Aye and t’other parts as well to hear the girls talk She spied Gendry then and pinched him on the cheek Look at this fine young ox Wait till Alyce sees those arms Oh and he blushes like a maid too Well Alyce will fix that for you boy see if she don’t

Arya had never seen Gendry turn so red Tansy you leave the Bull alone he’s a good lad said Tom Sevenstrings All we need from you is safe beds for a night

Speak for yourself singer Anguy slid his arm around a strapping young serving girl as freckly as he was

Beds we got said red-haired Tansy There’s never been no lack o’ beds at the Peach But you’ll all climb in a tub first Last time you lot stayed under my roof you left your fleas behind She poked Greenbeard in the chest And yours was green too You want food

If you can spare it we won’t say no Tom conceded

Now when did you ever say no to anything Tom the woman hooted I’ll roast some mutton for your friends and an old dry rat for you It’s more than you deserve but if you gargle me a song or three might be I’ll weaken I always pity the afflicted Come on come on Cass Lanna put some kettles on Jyzene help me get the clothes off them we’ll need to boil those too

She made good on all her threats Arya tried to tell them that she’d been bathed twice at Acorn Hall not a fortnight past but the red-haired woman was having none of it Two serving wenches carried her up the stairs bodily arguing about whether she was a girl or a boy The one called Helly won so the other had to fetch the hot water and scrub Arya’s back with a stiff bristly brush that almost took her skin off Then they stole all the clothes that Lady Smallwood had given her and dressed her up like one of Sansa’s dolls in linen and lace But at least when they were done she got to go down and eat

As she sat in the common room in her stupid girl clothes Arya remembered what Syrio Forel had told her the trick of looking and seeing what was there When she looked she saw more serving wenches than any inn could want and most of them young and comely And come evenfall lots of men started coming and going at the Peach They did not linger long in the common room not even when Tom took out his woodharp and began to sing Six Maids in a Pool The wooden steps were old and steep and creaked something fierce whenever one of the men took a girl upstairs I bet this is a brothel she whispered to Gendry

You don’t even know what a brothel is

I do so she insisted It’s like an inn with girls

He was turning red again What are you doing here then he demanded A brothel’s no fit place for no bloody highborn lady everybody knows that

One of the girls sat down on the bench beside him Who’s a highborn lady The little skinny one She looked at Arya and laughed I’m a king’s daughter myself
