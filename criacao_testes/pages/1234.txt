What about water my lord Jon wondered

We crossed a brook at the foot of the hill

A long climb for a drink Jon pointed out and outside the ring of stones

Thoren said Are you too lazy to climb a hill boy

When Lord Mormont said We’re not like to find another place as strong We’ll carry water and make certain we are well supplied Jon knew better than to argue So the command was given and the brothers of the Night’s Watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made Black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines and saw them fed and watered Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night A score of builders set to clearing brush digging latrines and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes I will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark the Old Bear had commanded

Once he’d put up the Lord Commander’s tent and seen to their horses Jon Snow descended the hill in search of Ghost The direwolf came at once all in silence One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees whistling and shouting alone in the green pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet the next the great white direwolf was walking beside him pale as morning mist

But when they reached the ringfort Ghost balked again He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones and then retreated as if he did not like what he’d smelled Jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring no easy task the wolf weighed as much as he did and was stronger by far Ghost what’s wrong with you It was not like him to be so unsettled In the end Jon had to give it up As you will he told the wolf Go hunt The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones

They ought to be safe here The hill offered commanding views and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east Yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees Jon’s sense of foreboding grew This is the haunted forest he told himself Maybe there are ghosts here the spirits of the First Men This was their place once

Stop acting the boy he told himself Clambering atop the piled rocks Jon gazed off toward the setting sun He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south Upriver the land was more rugged the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow Even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable

Closer at hand it was the trees that ruled To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn When the wind blew he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was A thousand leaves fluttered and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea storm-tossed and heaving eternal and unknowable

Ghost was not like to be alone down there he thought Anything could be moving under that sea creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood concealed beneath those trees Anything How would they ever know He stood there for a long time until the sun vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest

Jon Samwell Tarly called up I thought it looked like you Are you well

Well enough Jon hopped down How did you fare today

Well I fared well Truly

Jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find his courage The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow Tower

It seems a strong place said Sam A ringfort of the First Men Do you think there were battles fought here

No doubt You’d best get a bird ready Mormont will want to send back word

I wish I could send them all They hate being caged

You would too if you could fly

If I could fly I’d be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie said Sam

Jon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand They walked back through the camp together Cookfires were being lit all around them Overhead the stars were coming out The long red tail of Mormont’s Torch burned as bright as the moon Jon heard the ravens before he saw them Some were calling his name The birds were not shy when it came to making noise

They feel it too I’d best see to the Old Bear he said He gets noisy when he isn’t fed as well

He found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers There you are the old man said gruffly Bring us some hot wine if you would The night is chilly

Yes my lord Jon built a cookfire claimed a small cask of Mormont’s favorite robust red from stores and poured it into a kettle He hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey not a drop more Raisins and nuts and dried berries but no lemon that was the rankest sort of southron heresy—which was queer since he always took lemon in his morning beer The drink must be hot to warm a man properly the Lord Commander insisted but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle

As he worked he could hear the voices from inside the tent Jarman Buckwell said The easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source Yet if we go that path Rayder will know of our approach certain as sunrise

The Giant’s Stair might serve said Ser Mallador Locke or the Skirling Pass if it’s clear

The wine was steaming Jon lifted the kettle off the fire filled eight cups and carried them into the tent The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn him that night back in Craster’s Keep He took a cup from Jon’s tray tried a swallow of wine and gave a brusque nod of approval His raven hopped down his arm Corn it said Corn Corn

Ser Ottyn Wythers waved the wine away I would not go into the mountains at all he said in a thin tired voice The Frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer and now… if we should be caught by a storm…

I do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must said Mormont Wildlings can no more live on snow and stone than we can They will emerge from the heights soon and for a host of any size the only route is along the Milkwater If so we are strongly placed here They cannot hope to slip by us

They may not wish to They are thousands and we will be three hundred when the Halfhand reaches us Ser Mallador accepted a cup from Jon

If it comes to battle we could not hope for better ground than here declared Mormont We’ll strengthen the defenses Pits and spikes caltrops scattered on the slopes every breach mended Jarman I’ll want your sharpest eyes as watchers A ring of them all around us and along the river to warn of any approach Hide them up in trees And we had best start bringing up water too more than we need We’ll dig cisterns It will keep the men occupied and may prove needful later

My rangers— started Thoren Smallwood

Your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us After that we’ll see I will not lose more of my men

Mance Rayder might be massing his host a day’s ride from here and we’d never know Smallwood complained

We know where the wildlings are massing Mormont came back We had it from Craster I mislike the man but I do not think he lied to us in this

As you say Smallwood took a sullen leave The others finished their wine and followed more courteously

Shall I bring you supper my lord Jon asked

Corn the raven cried Mormont did not answer at once When he did he said only Did your wolf find game today

He’s not back yet

We could do with fresh meat Mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful of corn You think I’m wrong to keep the rangers close

That’s not for me to say my lord

It is if you’re asked

If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist I don’t see how they can hope to find my uncle Jon admitted

They can’t The raven pecked at the kernels in the Old Bear’s palm Two hundred men or ten thousand the country is too vast The corn gone Mormont turned his hand over

You would not give up the search

Maester Aemon thinks you clever Mormont moved the raven to his shoulder The bird tilted its head to one side little eyes a-glitter

The answer was there Is it… it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred than for two hundred to find one

The raven gave a cackling scream but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of his beard This many men and horses leave a trail even Aemon could follow On this hill our fires ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the Frostfangs If Ben Stark is alive and free he will come to us I have no doubt

Yes said Jon but… what if…

…he’s dead Mormont asked not unkindly
