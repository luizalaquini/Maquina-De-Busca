What’s dead may never die Esgred said

What’s dead may never die

Theon muttered the words with them You seem well known he said to the woman when the men had passed on

Every man loves the shipwright’s wife He had better lest he wants his ship to sink If you need men to pull your oars you could do worse than those three

Lordsport has no lack of strong arms Theon had given the matter no little thought It was fighters he wanted and men who would be loyal to him not to his lord father or his uncles He was playing the part of a dutiful young prince for the moment while he waited for Lord Balon to reveal the fullness of his plans If it turned out that he did not like those plans or his part in them however well…

Strength is not enough A longship’s oars must move as one if you would have her best speed Choose men who have rowed together before if you’re wise

Sage counsel Perhaps you’d help me choose them Let her believe I want her wisdom women fancy that

I may If you treat me kindly

How else

Theon quickened his stride as they neared the Myraham rocking high and empty by the quay Her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past but Lord Balon would not permit it None of the merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike

Milord a plaintive voice called down from the forecastle of the merchanter The captain’s daughter leaned over the rail gazing after him Her father had forbidden her to come ashore but whenever Theon came to Lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the deck Milord a moment she called after him As it please milord…

Did she Esgred asked as Theon hurried her past the cog Please milord

He saw no sense in being coy with this one For a time Now she wants to be my salt wife

Oho Well she’d profit from some salting no doubt Too soft and bland that one Or am I wrong

You’re not wrong Soft and bland Precisely How had she known

He had told Wex to wait at the inn The common room was so crowded that Theon had to push his way through the door Not a seat was to be had at bench nor table Nor did he see his squire Wex he shouted over the din and clatter If he’s up with one of those poxy whores I’ll strip the hide off him he was thinking when he finally spied the boy dicing near the hearth… and winning too by the look of the pile of coins before him

Time to go Theon announced When the boy paid him no mind he seized him by the ear and pulled him from the game Wex grabbed up a fistful of coppers and came along without a word That was one of the things Theon liked best about him Most squires have loose tongues but Wex had been born dumb… which didn’t seem to keep him from being clever as any twelve-year-old had a right to be He was a baseborn son of one of Lord Botley’s half brothers Taking him as squire had been part of the price Theon had paid for his horse

When Wex saw Esgred his eyes went round You’d think he’d never seen a woman before Theon thought Esgred will be riding with me back to Pyke Saddle the horses and be quick about it

The boy had ridden in on a scrawny little garron from Lord Balon’s stable but Theon’s mount was quite another sort of beast Where did you find that hellhorse Esgred asked when she saw him but from the way she laughed he knew she was impressed

Lord Botley bought him in Lannisport a year past but he proved to be too much horse for him so Botley was pleased to sell The Iron Islands were too sparse and rocky for breeding good horses Most of the islanders were indifferent riders at best more comfortable on the deck of a longship than in the saddle Even the lords rode garrons or shaggy Harlaw ponies and ox carts were more common than drays The smallfolk too poor to own either one pulled their own plows through the thin stony soil

But Theon had spent ten years in Winterfell and did not intend to go to war without a good mount beneath him Lord Botley’s misjudgment was his good fortune a stallion with a temper as black as his hide larger than a courser if not quite so big as most destriers As Theon was not quite so big as most knights that suited him admirably The animal had fire in his eyes When he’d met his new owner he’d pulled back his lips and tried to bite off his face

Does he have a name Esgred asked Theon as he mounted

Smiler He gave her a hand and pulled her up in front of him where he could put his arms around her as they rode I knew a man once who told me that I smiled at the wrong things

Do you

Only by the lights of those who smile at nothing He thought of his father and his uncle Aeron

Are you smiling now my lord prince

Oh yes Theon reached around her to take the reins She was almost of a height with him Her hair could have used a wash and she had a faded pink scar on her pretty neck but he liked the smell of her salt and sweat and woman
