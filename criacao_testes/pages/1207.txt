It would seem that you are the one who has forgotten Stannis Catelyn said more sharply than she’d intended

His claim you mean Renly laughed Let us be blunt my lady Stannis would make an appalling king Nor is he like to become one Men respect Stannis even fear him but precious few have ever loved him

He is still your elder brother If either of you can be said to have a right to the Iron Throne it must be Lord Stannis

Renly shrugged Tell me what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron Throne He did not wait for an answer Oh there was talk of the blood ties between Baratheon and Targaryen of weddings a hundred years past of second sons and elder daughters No one but the maesters care about any of it Robert won the throne with his warhammer He swept a hand across the campfires that burned from horizon to horizon Well there is my claim as good as Robert’s ever was If your son supports me as his father supported Robert he’ll not find me ungenerous I will gladly confirm him in all his lands titles and honors He can rule in Winterfell as he pleases He can even go on calling himself King in the North if he likes so long as he bends the knee and does me homage as his overlord King is only a word but fealty loyalty service… those I must have

And if he will not give them to you my lord

I mean to be king my lady and not of a broken kingdom I cannot say it plainer than that Three hundred years ago a Stark king knelt to Aegon the Dragon when he saw he could not hope to prevail That was wisdom Your son must be wise as well Once he joins me this war is good as done We— Renly broke off suddenly distracted What’s this now

The rattle of chains heralded the raising of the portcullis Down in the yard below a rider in a winged helm urged his well-lathered horse under the spikes Summon the king he called

Renly vaulted up into a crenel I’m here ser

Your Grace The rider spurred his mount closer I came swift as I could From Storm’s End We are besieged Your Grace Ser Cortnay defies them but…

But… that’s not possible I would have been told if Lord Tywin left Harrenhal

These are no Lannisters my liege It’s Lord Stannis at your gates King Stannis he calls himself now





JON

A blowing rain lashed at Jon’s face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream Beside him Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug muttering curses on the weather His raven sat on his shoulder feathers ruffled as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds The haunted forest Jon thought ruefully The drowned forest more like it

He hoped Sam was holding up back down the column He was not a good rider even in fair weather and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous all soft mud and hidden rocks When the wind blew it drove the water right into their eyes The Wall would be flowing off to the south the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and rivers Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room drinking cups of mulled wine before their supper Jon envied them His wet wool clung to him sodden and itching his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword and he was sick of salt cod salt beef and hard cheese

Up ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note half drowned beneath the constant patter of the rain Buckwell’s horn the Old Bear announced The gods are good Craster’s still there His raven gave a single flap of his big wings croaked Corn and ruffled his feathers up again

Jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and his keep Now he would see it with his own eyes After seven empty villages they had all come to dread finding Craster’s as dead and desolate as the rest but it seemed they would be spared that Perhaps the Old Bear will finally get some answers he thought Anyway we’ll be out of the rain

Thoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch despite his unsavory reputation The man’s half-mad I won’t deny it he’d told the Old Bear but you’d be the same if you’d spent your life in this cursed wood Even so he’s never turned a ranger away from his fire nor does he love Mance Rayder He’ll give us good counsel

So long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes I’ll be happy Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer liar raper and craven and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons And worse the old forester would add clacking his wooden teeth There’s a cold smell to that one there is

Jon Lord Mormont commanded ride back along the column and spread the word And remind the officers that I want no trouble about Craster’s wives The men are to mind their hands and speak to these women as little as need be

Aye my lord Jon turned his horse back the way they’d come It was pleasant to have the rain out of his face if only for a little while Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping The march was strung out through half a mile of woods

In the midst of the baggage train Jon passed Samwell Tarly slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat He was riding one dray horse and leading the others The drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering You put a fox in with them Jon called out

Water ran off the brim of Sam’s hat as he lifted his head Oh hullo Jon No they just hate the rain the same as us

How are you faring Sam

Wetly The fat boy managed a smile Nothing has killed me yet though

Good Craster’s Keep is just ahead If the gods are good he’ll let us sleep by his fire

Sam looked dubious Dolorous Edd says Craster’s a terrible savage He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself And Dywen told Grenn he’s got black blood in his veins His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger so he’s a bas… Suddenly he realized what he was about to say

A bastard Jon said with a laugh You can say it Sam I’ve heard the word before He put the spurs to his surefooted little garron I need to hunt down Ser Ottyn Be careful around Craster’s women As if Samwell Tarly needed warning on that score We’ll talk later after we’ve made camp

Jon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers plodding along with the rear guard A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont Ser Ottyn always looked tired even at Castle Black and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully Welcome tidings he said This wet has soaked my bones and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores

On his way back Jon swung wide of the column’s line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood The sounds of man and horse diminished swallowed up by the wet green wild and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock It was midafternoon yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk Jon wove a path between rocks and puddles past great oaks grey-green sentinels and black-barked ironwoods In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment’s respite from the drumming of the rain against his head As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses he heard something rustling in the underbrush Ghost he called out Ghost to me

But it was Dywen who emerged from the greenery forking a shaggy grey garron with Grenn ahorse beside him The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies and even there he took no chances sending the men out in pairs

Ah it’s you Lord Snow Dywen smiled an oaken smile his teeth were carved of wood and fit badly Thought me and the boy had us one o’ them Others to deal with Lose your wolf

He’s off hunting Ghost did not like to travel with the column but he would not be far When they made camp for the night he’d find his way to Jon at the Lord Commander’s tent

Fishing I’d call it in this wet Dywen said

My mother always said rain was good for growing crops Grenn put in hopefully

Aye a good crop of mildew Dywen said The best thing about a rain like this it saves a man from taking baths He made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth

Buckwell’s found Craster Jon told them

Had he lost him Dywen chuckled See that you young bucks don’t go nosing about Craster’s wives you hear

Jon smiled Want them all for yourself Dywen

Dywen clacked his teeth some more Might be I do Craster’s got ten fingers and one cock so he don’t count but to eleven He’d never miss a couple

How many wives does he have truly Grenn asked

More’n you ever will brother Well it’s not so hard when you breed your own There’s your beast Snow

Ghost was trotting along beside Jon’s horse with tail held high his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared Grenn’s mount shied at the scent of him even now after more than a year the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf With me Ghost Jon spurred off to Craster’s Keep

He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall but he had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep What they found instead was a midden heap a pigsty an empty sheepfold and a windowless daub-and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name It was long and low chinked together from logs and roofed with sod The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill surrounded by an earthen dike Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains

On the southwest he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles a bear to one side a ram to the other Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull Jon noted as he joined the line riding past Within Jarmen Buckwell’s scouts and men from Thoren Smallwood’s van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents A host of piglets rooted about three huge sows in the sty Nearby a small girl pulled carrots from a garden naked in the rain while two women tied a pig for slaughter The animal’s squeals were high and horrible almost human in their distress Chett’s hounds barked wildly in answer snarling and snapping despite his curses with a pair of Craster’s dogs barking back When they saw Ghost some of the dogs broke off and ran while others began to bay and growl The direwolf ignored them as did Jon

Well thirty of us will be warm and dry Jon thought once he’d gotten a good look at the hall Perhaps as many as fifty The place was much too small to sleep two hundred men so most would need to remain outside And where to put them The rain had turned half the compound yard to ankle-deep puddles and the rest to sucking mud Another dismal night was in prospect

The Lord Commander had entrusted his mount to Dolorous Edd He was cleaning mud out of the horse’s hooves as Jon dismounted Lord Mormont’s in the hall he announced He said for you to join him Best leave the wolf outside he looks hungry enough to eat one of Craster’s children Well truth be told I’m hungry enough to eat one of Craster’s children so long as he was served hot Go on I’ll see to your horse If it’s warm and dry inside don’t tell me I wasn’t asked in He flicked a glob of wet mud out from under a horseshoe Does this mud look like shit to you Could it be that this whole hill is made of Craster’s shit

Jon smiled Well I hear he’s been here a long time

You cheer me not Go see the Old Bear
