The Smith he labors day and night

to put the world of men to right

With hammer plow and fire bright

he builds for little children





The Maiden dances through the sky

she lives in every lover’s sigh

Her smiles teach the birds to fly

and give dreams to little children





The Seven Gods who made us all

are listening if we should call

So close your eyes you shall not fall

they see you little children

Just close your eyes you shall not fall

they see you little children





Sam remembered the last time he’d sung the song with his mother to lull baby Dickon to sleep His father had heard their voices and come barging in angry I will have no more of that Lord Randyll told his wife harshly You ruined one boy with those soft septon’s songs do you mean to do the same to this babe Then he looked at Sam and said Go sing to your sisters if you must sing I don’t want you near my son

Gilly’s babe had gone to sleep He was such a tiny thing and so quiet that Sam feared for him He didn’t even have a name He had asked Gilly about that but she said it was bad luck to name a child before he was two So many of them died

She tucked her nipple back inside her furs That was pretty Sam You sing good

You should hear Dareon His voice is sweet as mead

We drank the sweetest mead the day Craster made me a wife It was summer then and not so cold Gilly gave him a puzzled look Did you only sing of six gods Craster always told us you southrons had seven

Seven he agreed but no one sings of the Stranger The Stranger’s face was the face of death Even talking of him made Sam uncomfortable We should eat something A bite or two

Nothing was left but a few black sausages as hard as wood Sam sawed off a few thin slices for each of them The effort made his wrist ache but he was hungry enough to persist If you chewed the slices long enough they softened up and tasted good Craster’s wives seasoned them with garlic
