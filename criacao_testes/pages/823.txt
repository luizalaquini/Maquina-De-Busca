up thy couch and go into thine house

525 And immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon
he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God

526 And they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled
with fear saying We have seen strange things to day

527 And after these things he went forth and saw a publican named
Levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him Follow
me

528 And he left all rose up and followed him

529 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a
great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them

530 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples
saying Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners  531 And
Jesus answering said unto them They that are whole need not a
physician but they that are sick

532 I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance

533 And they said unto him Why do the disciples of John fast often
and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees but
thine eat and drink  534 And he said unto them Can ye make the
children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them
535 But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then shall they fast in those days

536 And he spake also a parable unto them No man putteth a piece of
a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a
rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the
old

537 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine
will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish

538 But new wine must be put into new bottles and both are
preserved

539 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for
he saith The old is better

61 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he
went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of
corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands

62 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them Why do ye that which
is not lawful to do on the sabbath days  63 And Jesus answering them
said Have ye not read so much as this what David did when himself
was an hungred and they which were with him 64 How he went into the
house of God and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to
them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the
priests alone  65 And he said unto them That the Son of man is Lord
also of the sabbath

66 And it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into
the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was
withered

67 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him whether he would heal
on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him

68 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the
withered hand Rise up and stand forth in the midst And he arose and
stood forth

69 Then said Jesus unto them I will ask you one thing Is it lawful
on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to
destroy it  610 And looking round about upon them all he said unto
the man Stretch forth thy hand And he did so and his hand was
restored whole as the other

611 And they were filled with madness and communed one with another
what they might do to Jesus

612 And it came to pass in those days that he went out into a
mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God

613 And when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of
them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles 614 Simon whom
he also named Peter and Andrew his brother James and John Philip
and Bartholomew 615 Matthew and Thomas James the son of Alphaeus
and Simon called Zelotes 616 And Judas the brother of James and
Judas Iscariot which also was the traitor

617 And he came down with them and stood in the plain and the
company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all
Judaea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon which
came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases 618 And they
that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed

619 And the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went
virtue out of him and healed them all

620 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said Blessed be
ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God
