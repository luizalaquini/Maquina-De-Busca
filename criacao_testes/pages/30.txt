The queen shuddered There is something unnatural about those animals she said They are dangerous I will not have any of them coming south with us

Jaime said You’ll have a hard time stopping them sister They follow those girls everywhere

Tyrion started on his fish Are you leaving soon then

Not near soon enough Cersei said Then she frowned Are we leaving she echoed What about you Gods don’t tell me you are staying here

Tyrion shrugged Benjen Stark is returning to the Night’s Watch with his brother’s bastard I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of

Jaime smiled I hope you’re not thinking of taking the black on us sweet brother

Tyrion laughed What me celibate The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock No I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world

Cersei stood abruptly The children don’t need to hear this filth Tommen Myrcella come She strode briskly from the morning room her train and her pups trailing behind her

Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death

He will if Robert commands it Tyrion said And Robert will command it There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case

He could end his torment Jaime said I would if it were my son It would be a mercy

I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard sweet brother Tyrion said He would not take it kindly

Even if the boy does live he will be a cripple Worse than a cripple A grotesque Give me a good clean death

Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders Speaking for the grotesques he said I beg to differ Death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

Jaime smiled You are a perverse little imp aren’t you

Oh yes Tyrion admitted I hope the boy does wake I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say

His brother’s smile curdled like sour milk Tyrion my sweet brother he said darkly there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on

Tyrion’s mouth was full of bread and fish He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime Why Jaime my sweet brother he said you wound me You know how much I love my family





JON

Jon climbed the steps slowly trying not to think that this might be the last time ever Ghost padded silently beside him Outside snow swirled through the castle gates and the yard was all noise and chaos but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet Too quiet for Jon’s liking

He reached the landing and stood for a long moment afraid Ghost nuzzled at his hand He took courage from that He straightened and entered the room

Lady Stark was there beside his bed She had been there day and night for close on a fortnight Not for a moment had she left Bran’s side She had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all She fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life Not once did she leave the room So Jon had stayed away

But now there was no more time

He stood in the door for a moment afraid to speak afraid to come closer The window was open Below a wolf howled Ghost heard and lifted his head

Lady Stark looked over For a moment she did not seem to recognize him Finally she blinked What are you doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless
