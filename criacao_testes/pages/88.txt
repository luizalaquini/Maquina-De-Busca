These two are Grenn and Pypar Jon said

Grenn’s the ugly one Pyp said

Grenn scowled You’re uglier than me At least I don’t have ears like a bat

My thanks to all of you the fat boy said gravely

Why didn’t you get up and fight Grenn demanded

I wanted to truly I just… I couldn’t I didn’t want him to hit me anymore He looked at the ground I… I fear I’m a coward My lord father always said so

Grenn looked thunderstruck Even Pyp had no words to say to that and Pyp had words for everything What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward

Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces His eyes met Jon’s and darted away quick as frightened animals I… I’m sorry he said I don’t mean to… to be like I am He walked heavily toward the armory

Jon called after him You were hurt he said Tomorrow you’ll do better

Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder No I won’t he said blinking back tears I never do better

When he was gone Grenn frowned Nobody likes cravens he said uncomfortably I wish we hadn’t helped him What if they think we’re craven too

You’re too stupid to be craven Pyp told him

I am not Grenn said

Yes you are If a bear attacked you in the woods you’d be too stupid to run away

I would not Grenn insisted I’d run away faster than you He stopped suddenly scowling when he saw Pyp’s grin and realized what he’d just said His thick neck flushed a dark red Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory hung up his sword and stripped off his battered armor

Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns the mornings were for swordplay the afternoons for work The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks to learn where their skills lay Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander’s table but for every day spent hunting he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword Other times he ran messages stood at guard mucked out stables fletched arrows assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories

That afternoon the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall It was lonely and boring work even with Ghost along for company but Jon found he did not mind On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall and the air was always cold and bracing He could think here and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly… and oddly of Tyrion Lannister He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it the dwarf had told him grinning The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had

His sore shoulder made the work go slowly It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the paths He lingered on high to watch the sun go down turning the western sky the color of blood Finally as dusk was settling over the north Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him

The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall laughing Pyp was in the middle of a story The mummer’s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices and he did not tell his tales so much as live them playing all the parts as needed a king one moment and a swineherd the next When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp’s antics as anyone… yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench where Samwell Tarly sat alone as far from the others as he could get

He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him The fat boy’s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost Is that a wolf

A direwolf Jon said His name is Ghost The direwolf is the sigil of my father’s House

Ours is a striding huntsman Samwell Tarly said

Do you like to hunt

The fat boy shuddered I hate it He looked as though he was going to cry again

What’s wrong now Jon asked him Why are you always so frightened

Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head too scared even to talk A burst of laughter filled the hall Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice He stood Let’s go outside

The round fat face looked up at him suspicious Why What will we do outside
