made his thousands like a squire Such a clever
young dand as he is Hes a doctors son by name
which is a great deal and hes an earls son by
nature
 Which is a great deal more Fancy Is it true  
 Yes And he was brought up so well and sent to
Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years
Learnt all languages while he was there  and it was
said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese
in shorthand  but that I dont answer for as it was
only reported However he wasted his gifted lot
and listed a soldier but even then he rose to be a
sergeant without trying at all Ah such a blessing it
is to be high-born  nobility of blood will shine out even
in the ranks and files And is he really come home

 I believe so Good-night Liddy
After all how could a cheerful wearer of skirts
be permanently offended with the man  There are
occasions when girls like Bathsheba will put up with
a great deal of
P 218
unconventional behaviour When they
want to be praised which is often when they want to
be mastered which is sometimes  and when they want
no nonsense which is seldom Just now the first
feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba with a dash
of the second Moreover by chance or by devilry the
ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better
days
So she could not clearly decide whether it was her
opinion that he had insulted her or not 
Was ever anything so odd  she at last exclaimed
to herself in her own room And was ever anything
so meanly done as what I did to to sulk away like that
from a man who was only civil and kind Clearly she
did not think his barefaced praise of her person an
insult now
It was a fatal omission of Boldwoods that he had
never once told her she was beautiful

THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED
IDIOSYNCRASY and vicissitude had combined to
stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being
He was a man to whom memories were an in+
cumbrance and anticipations a superfluity Simply
feeling considering and caring for what was before his
eyes he was vulnerable only in the present His out+
look upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now
and then  that projection of consciousness into days
gone by and to come which makes the past a synonym
for the pathetic and the future a word for circum+
spection was foreign to Troy With him the past
was yesterday  the future to-morrow  never the day
after
On this account he might in certain lights have
been regarded as one of the most fortunate of his
order For it may be argued with great plausibility
that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease
and that expectation in its only comfortable form -- that
of absolute faith -- is practically an impossibility whilst
in the form of hope and the secondary compounds
patience impatience resolve curiosity it is a constant
fluctuation between pleasure and pain
Sergeant Troy being entirely innocent of the
practice of expectation was never disappointed To
set against this negative gain there may have been
some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the
higher tastes and sensations which it entailed But
limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss
by the loser therefrom  in this attribute moral or
aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material since
those who suffer do not mind it whilst those who mind
it soon cease to suffer It is not a denial of anything
to have been always without it and what Troy had
never enjoyed he did not miss but being fully
conscious that what sober
P 220
people missed he enjoyed
his capacity though really less seemed greater than
theirs
He was moderately truthful towards men but to
women lied like a Cretan -- a system of ethics above all
others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of
admission into lively society  and the possibility of the
favour gained being transitory had reference only to
the future
He never passed the line which divides the spruce
vices from the ugly  and hence though his morals had
hardly been applauded disapproval of them had fre+
quently been tempered with a smile This treatment
had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other
mens gallantries to his own aggrandizement as a
Corinthian rather than to the moral profit of his
hearers
His reason and his propensities had seldom any
reciprocating influence having separated by mutual
consent long ago  thence it sometimes happened that
