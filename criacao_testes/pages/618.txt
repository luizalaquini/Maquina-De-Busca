No right Edmure repeated He was Robb’s captive your king’s captive and Robb charged me to keep him safe

Brienne will keep him safe She swore it on her sword

That woman

She will deliver Jaime to King’s Landing and bring Arya and Sansa back to us safely

Cersei will never give them up

Not Cersei Tyrion He swore it in open court And the Kingslayer swore it as well

Jaime’s word is worthless As for the Imp it’s said he took an axe in the head during the battle He’ll be dead before your Brienne reaches King’s Landing if she ever does

Dead Could the gods truly be so merciless She had made Jaime swear a hundred oaths but it was his brother’s promise she had pinned her hopes on

Edmure was blind to her distress Jaime was my charge and I mean to have him back I’ve sent ravens—

Ravens to whom How many

Three he said so the message will be certain to reach Lord Bolton By river or road the way from Riverrun to King’s Landing must needs take them close by Harrenhal

Harrenhal The very word seemed to darken the room Horror thickened her voice as she said Edmure do you know what you have done

Have no fear I left your part out I wrote that Jaime had escaped and offered a thousand dragons for his recapture

Worse and worse Catelyn thought in despair My brother is a fool Unbidden unwanted tears filled her eyes If this was an escape she said softly and not an exchange of hostages why should the Lannisters give my daughters to Brienne

It will never come to that The Kingslayer will be returned to us I have made certain of it

All you have made certain is that I shall never see my daughters again Brienne might have gotten him to King’s Landing safely… so long as no one was hunting for them But now… Catelyn could not go on Leave me Edmure She had no right to command him here in the castle that would soon be his yet her tone would brook no argument Leave me to Father and my grief I have no more to say to you Go Go All she wanted was to lie down to close her eyes and sleep and pray no dreams would come





Arya


The sky was as black as the walls of Harrenhal behind them and the rain fell soft and steady muffling the sound of their horses’ hooves and running down their faces

They rode north away from the lake following a rutted farm road across the torn fields and into the woods and streams Arya took the lead kicking her stolen horse to a brisk heedless trot until the trees closed in around her Hot Pie and Gendry followed as best they could Wolves howled off in the distance and she could hear Hot Pie’s heavy breathing No one spoke From time to time Arya glanced over her shoulder to make sure the two boys had not fallen too far behind and to see if they were being pursued

They would be she knew She had stolen three horses from the stables and a map and a dagger from Roose Bolton’s own solar and killed a guard on the postern gate slitting his throat when he knelt to pick up the worn iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her Someone would find him lying dead in his own blood and then the hue and cry would go up They would wake Lord Bolton and search Harrenhal from crenel to cellar and when they did they would find the map and the dagger missing along with some swords from the armory bread and cheese from the kitchens a baker boy a ’prentice smith and a cupbearer called Nan… or Weasel or Arry depending on who you asked

The Lord of the Dreadfort would not come after them himself Roose Bolton would stay abed his pasty flesh dotted with leeches giving commands in his whispery soft voice His man Walton might lead the hunt the one they called Steelshanks for the greaves he always wore on his long legs Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and his sellswords who named themselves the Brave Companions Others called them Bloody Mummers though never to their faces and sometimes the Footmen for Lord Vargo’s habit of cutting off the hands and feet of men who displeased him

If they catch us he’ll cut off our hands and feet Arya thought and then Roose Bolton will peel the skin off us She was still dressed in her page’s garb and on the breast over her heart was sewn Lord Bolton’s sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort

Every time she looked back she half expected to see a blaze of torches pouring out the distant gates of Harrenhal or rushing along the tops of its huge high walls but there was nothing Harrenhal slept on until it was lost in darkness and hidden behind the trees

When they crossed the first stream Arya turned her horse aside and led them off the road following the twisting course of the water for a quarter-mile before finally scrambling out and up a stony bank If the hunters brought dogs that might throw them off the scent she hoped They could not stay on the road There is death on the road she told herself death on all the roads
