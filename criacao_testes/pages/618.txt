thou not remove

42 And thou shalt swear The LORD liveth in truth in judgment and
in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and
in him shall they glory

43 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem Break
up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns

44 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD and take away the foreskins of
your heart ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my fury
come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the
evil of your doings

45 Declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say Blow ye
the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say Assemble
yourselves and let us go into the defenced cities

46 Set up the standard toward Zion retire stay not for I will
bring evil from the north and a great destruction

47 The lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the
Gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy
land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an
inhabitant

48 For this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce
anger of the LORD is not turned back from us

49 And it shall come to pass at that day saith the LORD that the
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the
priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder

410 Then said I Ah Lord GOD surely thou hast greatly deceived this
people and Jerusalem saying Ye shall have peace whereas the sword
reacheth unto the soul

411 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem A
dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of
my people not to fan nor to cleanse 412 Even a full wind from
those places shall come unto me now also will I give sentence against
them

413 Behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as
a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles Woe unto us for we
are spoiled

414 O Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest
be saved How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee  415
For a voice declareth from Dan and publisheth affliction from mount
Ephraim

416 Make ye mention to the nations behold publish against
Jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their
voice against the cities of Judah

417 As keepers of a field are they against her round about because
she hath been rebellious against me saith the LORD

418 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this
is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto
thine heart

419 My bowels my bowels I am pained at my very heart my heart
maketh a noise in me I cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard
O my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war

420 Destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is
spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment

421 How long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the
trumpet  422 For my people is foolish they have not known me they
are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise
to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge

423 I beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and
the heavens and they had no light

424 I beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills
moved lightly

425 I beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the
heavens were fled

426 I beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all
the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD and
by his fierce anger

427 For thus hath the LORD said The whole land shall be desolate
yet will I not make a full end

428 For this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black
because I have spoken it I have purposed it and will not repent
neither will I turn back from it

429 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks
every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein

430 And when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do Though thou
