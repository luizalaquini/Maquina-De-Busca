then spake I with my tongue

394 LORD make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what
it is that I may know how frail I am

395 Behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is
as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity

Selah

396 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are
disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall
gather them

397 And now Lord what wait I for my hope is in thee

398 Deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach
of the foolish

399 I was dumb I opened not my mouth because thou didst it

3910 Remove thy stroke away from me I am consumed by the blow of
thine hand

3911 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is
vanity Selah

3912 Hear my prayer O LORD and give ear unto my cry hold not thy
peace at my tears for I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as
all my fathers were

3913 O spare me that I may recover strength before I go hence and
be no more



401 I waited patiently for the LORD and he inclined unto me and
heard my cry

402 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry
clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings

403 And he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God
many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the LORD

404 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust and
respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies

405 Many O LORD my God are thy wonderful works which thou hast
done and thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee if I would declare and speak of them they are
more than can be numbered

406 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou
opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required

407 Then said I Lo I come in the volume of the book it is written
of me

408 I delight to do thy will O my God yea thy law is within my
heart

409 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo I
have not refrained my lips O LORD thou knowest

4010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation

4011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me O LORD let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me

4012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me so that I am not able to look up they are
more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me

4013 Be pleased O LORD to deliver me O LORD make haste to help
me

4014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil

4015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
me Aha aha

4016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let
such as love thy salvation say continually The LORD be magnified

4017 But I am poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art
my help and my deliverer make no tarrying O my God



411 Blessed is he that considereth the poor the LORD will deliver
him in time of trouble

412 The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be
