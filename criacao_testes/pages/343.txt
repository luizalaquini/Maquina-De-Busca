the LORD

2220 Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou
shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not
see all the evil which I will bring upon this place And they brought
the king word again

231 And the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of
Judah and of Jerusalem

232 And the king went up into the house of the LORD and all the men
of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the
priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
which was found in the house of the LORD

233 And the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the
LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul
to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book
And all the people stood to the covenant

234 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests
of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out
of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal and
for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them
without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried the ashes of
them unto Bethel

235 And he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah
had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of
Judah and in the places round about Jerusalem them also that burned
incense unto Baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets
and to all the host of heaven

236 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD without
Jerusalem unto the brook Kidron and burned it at the brook Kidron
and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the
graves of the children of the people

237 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the
house of the LORD where the women wove hangings for the grove

238 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and
defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from
Geba to Beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that
were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the
city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city

239 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
altar of the LORD in Jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened
bread among their brethren

2310 And he defiled Topheth which is in the valley of the children
of Hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass
through the fire to Molech

2311 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to
the sun at the entering in of the house of the LORD by the chamber
of Nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned
the chariots of the sun with fire

2312 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
Ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh
had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD did the king beat
down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into
the brook Kidron

2313 And the high places that were before Jerusalem which were on
the right hand of the mount of corruption which Solomon the king of
Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians and
for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites and for Milcom the
abomination of the children of Ammon did the king defile

2314 And he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and
filled their places with the bones of men

2315 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which
Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin had made both that
altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and
stamped it small to powder and burned the grove

2316 And as Josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were
there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the
sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according
to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed who
proclaimed these words

2317 Then he said What title is that that I see And the men of the
city told him It is the sepulchre of the man of God which came from
Judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the
altar of Bethel

2318 And he said Let him alone let no man move his bones So they
let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of
Samaria

2319 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
cities of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the
Lord to anger Josiah took away and did to them according to all the
