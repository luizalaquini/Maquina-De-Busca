Another smith spoke up Her Grace commanded us to make chainmail and armor swords and daggers and axes all in great numbers For arming her new gold cloaks m’lord

That work can wait Tyrion said The chain first

M’lord begging your pardon Her Grace said those as didn’t meet their numbers would have their hands crushed the anxious Smith persisted Smashed on their own anvils she said

Sweet Cersei always striving to make the smallfolk love us No one will have their hands smashed You have my word on it

Iron is grown dear Ironbelly declared and this chain will be needing much of it and coke beside for the fires

Lord Baelish will see that you have coin as you need it Tyrion promised He could count on Littlefinger for that much he hoped I will command the City Watch to help you find iron Melt down every horseshoe in this city if you must

An older man moved forward richly dressed in a damask tunic with silver fastenings and a cloak lined with foxfur He knelt to examine the great steel links Tyrion had dumped on the floor My lord he announced gravely this is crude work at best There is no art to it Suitable labor for common smiths no doubt for men who bend horseshoes and hammer out kettles but I am a master armorer as it please my lord This is no work for me nor my fellow masters We make swords as sharp as song armor such as a god might wear Not this

Tyrion tilted his head to the side and gave the man a dose of his mismatched eyes What is your name master armorer

Salloreon as it please my lord If the King’s Hand will permit I should be most honored to forge him a suit of armor suitable to his House and high office Two of the others sniggered but Salloreon plunged ahead heedless Plate and scale I think The scales gilded bright as the sun the plate enameled a deep Lannister crimson I would suggest a demon’s head for a helm crowned with tall golden horns When you ride into battle men will shrink away in fear

A demon’s head Tyrion thought ruefully now what does that say of me Master Salloreon I plan to fight the rest of my battles from this chair It’s links I need not demon horns So let me put it to you this way You will make chains or you will wear them The choice is yours He rose and took his leave with nary a backward glance

Bronn was waiting by the gate with his litter and an escort of mounted Black Ears You know where we’re bound Tyrion told him He accepted a hand up into the litter He had done all he could to feed the hungry city—he’d set several hundred carpenters to building fishing boats in place of catapults opened the kingswood to any hunter who dared to cross the river even sent gold cloaks foraging to the west and south—yet he still saw accusing eyes everywhere he rode The litter’s curtains shielded him from that and besides gave him leisure to think

As they wound their slow way down twisty Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon’s High Hill Tyrion reflected on the events of the morning His sister’s ire had led her to overlook the true significance of Stannis Baratheon’s letter Without proof his accusations were nothing what mattered was that he had named himself a king And what will Renly make of that They could not both sit the Iron Throne

Idly he pushed the curtain back a few inches to peer out at the streets Black Ears rode on both sides of him their grisly necklaces looped about their throats while Bronn went in front to clear the way He watched the passersby watching him and played a little game with himself trying to sort the informers from the rest The ones who look the most suspicious are likely innocent he decided It’s the ones who look innocent I need to beware

His destination was behind the hill of Rhaenys and the streets were crowded Almost an hour had passed before the litter swayed to a stop Tyrion was dozing but he woke abruptly when the motion ceased rubbed the sand from his eyes and accepted Bronn’s hand to climb down

The house was two stories tall stone below and timber above A round turret rose from one corner of the structure Many of the windows were leaded Over the door swung an ornate lamp a globe of gilded metal and scarlet glass

A brothel Bronn said What do you mean to do here

What does one usually do in a brothel

The sellsword laughed Shae’s not enough

She was pretty enough for a camp follower but I’m no longer in camp Little men have big appetites and I’m told the girls here are fit for a king

Is the boy old enough

Not Joffrey Robert This house was a great favorite of his Although Joffrey may indeed be old enough An interesting notion that If you and the Black Ears care to amuse yourselves feel free but Chataya’s girls are costly You’ll find cheaper houses all along the street Leave one man here who’ll know where to find the others when I wish to return

Bronn nodded As you say The Black Ears were all grins

Inside the door a tall woman in flowing silks was waiting for him She had ebon skin and sandalwood eyes I am Chataya she announced bowing deeply And you are—

Let us not get into the habit of names Names are dangerous The air smelled of some exotic spice and the floor beneath his feet displayed a mosaic of two women entwined in love You have a pleasant establishment

I have labored long to make it so I am glad the Hand is pleased Her voice was flowing amber liquid with the accents of the distant Summer Isles

Titles can be as dangerous as names Tyrion warned Show me a few of your girls

It will be my great delight You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful and skilled in every art of love She swept off gracefully leaving Tyrion to waddle after as best he could on legs half the length of hers
