Yes Lord Tywin said in a tone of deep satisfaction

At long last Father Valyrian steel blades were scarce and costly yet thousands remained in the world perhaps two hundred in the Seven Kingdoms alone It had always irked his father that none belonged to House Lannister The old Kings of the Rock had owned such a weapon but the greatsword Brightroar had been lost when the second King Tommen carried it back to Valyria on his fool’s quest He had never returned nor had Uncle Gery the youngest and most reckless of his father’s brothers who had gone seeking after the lost sword some eight years past

Thrice at least Lord Tywin had offered to buy Valyrian longswords from impoverished lesser houses but his advances had always been firmly rebuffed The little lordlings would gladly part with their daughters should a Lannister come asking but they cherished their old family swords

Tyrion wondered where the metal for this one had come from A few master armorers could rework old Valyrian steel but the secrets of its making had been lost when the Doom came to old Valyria The colors are strange he commented as he turned the blade in the sunlight Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black as was true here as well But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching each ripple distinct like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore How did you get this patterning I’ve never seen anything like it

Nor I my lord said the armorer I confess these colors were not what I intended and I do not know that I could duplicate them Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House and it was that color I set out to infuse into the metal But Valyrian steel is stubborn These old swords remember it is said and they do not change easily I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again but always the color would darken as if the blade was drinking the sun from it And some folds would not take the red at all as you can see If my lords of Lannister are displeased I will of course try again as many times as you should require but—

No need Lord Tywin said This will serve

A crimson sword might flash prettily in the sun but if truth be told I like these colors better said Tyrion They have an ominous beauty… and they make this blade unique There is no other sword like it in all the world I should think

There is one The armorer bent over the table and unfolded the bundle of oilcloth to reveal a second longsword

Tyrion put down Joffrey’s sword and took up the other If not twins the two were at least close cousins This one was thicker and heavier a half-inch wider and three inches longer but they shared the same fine clean lines and the same distinctive color the ripples of blood and night Three fullers deeply incised ran down the second blade from hilt to point the king’s sword had only two Joff’s hilt was a good deal more ornate the arms of its crossguard done as lions’ paws with ruby claws unsheathed but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions’ heads for pommels

Magnificent Even in hands as unskilled as Tyrion’s the blade felt alive I have never felt better balance

It is meant for my son

No need to ask which son Tyrion placed Jaime’s sword back on the table beside Joffrey’s wondering if Robb Stark would let his brother live long enough to wield it Our father must surely think so else why have this blade forged

You have done good work Master Mott Lord Tywin told the armorer My steward will see to your payment And remember rubies for the scabbards

I shall my lord You are most generous The man folded the swords up in the oilcloth tucked the bundle under one arm and went to his knee It is an honor to serve the King’s Hand I shall deliver the swords the day before the wedding

See that you do

When the guards had seen the armorer out Tyrion clambered up onto a chair So… a sword for Joff a sword for Jaime and not even a dagger for the dwarf Is that the way of it Father

The steel was sufficient for two blades not three If you have need of a dagger take one from the armory Robert left a hundred when he died Gerion gave him a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a sapphire pommel for a wedding gift and half the envoys who came to court tried to curry favor by presenting His Grace with jewel-encrusted knives and silver inlay swords

Tyrion smiled They’d have pleased him more if they’d presented him with their daughters

No doubt The only blade he ever used was the hunting knife he had from Jon Arryn when he was a boy Lord Tywin waved a hand dismissing King Robert and all his knives What did you find at the riverfront

Mud said Tyrion and a few dead things no one’s bothered to bury Before we can open the port again the Blackwater’s going to have to be dredged the sunken ships broken up or raised Three-quarters of the quays need repair and some may have to be torn down and rebuilt The entire fish market is gone and both the River Gate and the King’s Gate are splintered from the battering Stannis gave them and should be replaced I shudder to think of the cost If you do shit gold Father find a privy and get busy he wanted to say but he knew better

You will find whatever gold is required

Will I Where The treasury is empty I’ve told you that We’re not done paying the alchemists for all that wildfire or the smiths for my chain and Cersei’s pledged the crown to pay half the costs of Joff’s wedding—seventy-seven bloody courses a thousand guests a pie full of doves singers jugglers…

Extravagance has its uses We must demonstrate the power and wealth of Casterly Rock for all the realm to see

Then perhaps Casterly Rock should pay

Why I have seen Littlefinger’s accounts Crown incomes are ten times higher than they were under Aerys

As are the crown’s expenses Robert was as generous with his coin as he was with his cock Littlefinger borrowed heavily From you amongst others Yes the incomes are considerable but they are barely sufficient to cover the usury on Littlefinger’s loans Will you forgive the throne’s debt to House Lannister

Don’t be absurd

Then perhaps seven courses would suffice Three hundred guests instead of a thousand I understand that a marriage can be just as binding without a dancing bear

The Tyrells would think us niggardly I will have the wedding and the waterfront If you cannot pay for them say so and I shall find a master of coin who can

The disgrace of being dismissed after so short a time was not something Tyrion cared to suffer I will find your money

You will his father promised and while you are about it see if you can find your wife’s bed as well

So the talk has reached even him I have thank you It’s that piece of furniture between the window and the hearth with the velvet canopy and the mattress stuffed with goose down

I am pleased you know of it Now perhaps you ought to try and know the woman who shares it with you

Woman Child you mean Has a spider been whispering in your ear or do I have my sweet sister to thank Considering the things that went on beneath Cersei’s blankets you would think she’d have the decency to keep her nose out of his Tell me why is it that all of Sansa’s maids arc women in Cersei’s service I am sick of being spied upon in my own chambers

If you mislike your wife’s servants dismiss them and hire ones more to your liking That is your right It is your wife’s maidenhood that concerns me not her maids This… delicacy puzzles me You seem to have no difficulty bedding whores Is the Stark girl made differently

Why do you take so much bloody interest in where I put my cock Tyrion demanded Sansa is too young

She is old enough to be Lady of Winterfell once her brother is dead Claim her maidenhood and you will be one step closer to claiming the north Get her with child and the prize is all but won Do I need to remind you that a marriage that has not been consummated can be set aside

By the High Septon or a Council of Faith Our present High Septon is a trained seal who barks prettily on command Moon Boy is more like to annul my marriage than he is

Perhaps I should have married Sansa Stark to Moon Boy He might have known what to do with her

Tyrion’s hands clenched on the arms of his chair I have heard all I mean to hear on the subject of my wife’s maidenhead But so long as we are discussing marriage why is it that I hear nothing of my sister’s impending nuptials As I recall—

Lord Tywin cut him off Mace Tyrell has refused my offer to marry Cersei to his heir Willas

Refused our sweet Cersei That put Tyrion in a much better mood

When I first broached the match to him Lord Tyrell seemed well enough disposed his father said A day later all was changed The old woman’s work She hectors her son unmercifully Varys claims she told him that your sister was too old and too used for this precious one-legged grandson of hers

Cersei must have loved that He laughed

Lord Tywin gave him a chilly look She does not know Nor will she It is better for all of us if the offer was never made See that you remember that Tyrion The offer was never made

What offer Tyrion rather suspected that Lord Tyrell might come to regret this rebuff

Your sister will be wed The question is to whom I have several thoughts— Before he could get to them there was a rap at the door and a guardsman stuck in his head to announce Grand Maester Pycelle He may enter said Lord Tywin

Pycelle tottered in on a cane and stopped long enough to give Tyrion a look that would curdle milk His once-magnificent white beard which someone had unaccountably shaved off was growing back sparse and wispy leaving him with unsightly pink wattles to dangle beneath his neck My lord Hand the old man said bowing as deeply as he could without falling there has been another bird from Castle Black Mayhaps we could consult privily

There’s no need for that Lord Tywin waved Grand Maester Pycelle to a seat Tyrion may stay

Oooooh may I He rubbed his nose and waited
