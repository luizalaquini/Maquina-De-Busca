all things that belong to it they shall bear the tabernacle and all
the vessels thereof and they shall minister unto it and shall encamp
round about the tabernacle

it down and when the tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall
set it up and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death

his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their

testimony that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the

the ensign of their fathers house far off about the tabernacle of
