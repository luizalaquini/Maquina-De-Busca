I might have expected that Catelyn said Small wonder there Lysa was still young and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift Will Lysa take another husband

She says yes provided she finds a man who suits her Brynden Tully said but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband

You of all people can scarce fault her for that

Ser Brynden snorted Nor do I but… it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship She enjoys the sport but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name

A woman can rule as wisely as a man Catelyn said

The right woman can her uncle said with a sideways glance Make no mistake Cat Lysa is not you He hesitated a moment If truth be told I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like

She was puzzled What do you mean

The Lysa who came back from King’s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand Those years were hard for her You must know Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband but their marriage was made from politics not passion

As was my own

They began the same but your ending has been happier than your sister’s Two babes stillborn twice as many miscarriages Lord Arryn’s death… Catelyn the gods gave Lysa only the one child and he is all your sister lives for now poor boy Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters Your sister is afraid child and the Lannisters are what she fears most She ran to the Vale stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night and all to snatch her son out of the lion’s mouth… and now you have brought the lion to her door

In chains Catelyn said A crevasse yawned on her right falling away into darkness She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step

Oh Her uncle glanced back to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind them I see an axe on his saddle a dirk at his belt and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow Where are the chains sweet one

Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat The dwarf is here and not by choice Chains or no he is my prisoner Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered and her own letter that first warned us against them

Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile I hope you are right child he sighed in tones that said she was wrong

The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses The road widened and grew straight and for the first time Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses growing Once they reached the valley floor the going was faster and they made good time cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets past orchards and golden wheat fields splashing across a dozen sunlit streams Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them a double banner flying from his staff the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high and below it his own black fish Farm wagons and merchants’ carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass

Even so it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the Giant’s Lance Torches flickered atop its ramparts and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat The drawbridge was up and the portcullis down but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers beyond

The Gates of the Moon her uncle said as the party drew rein His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse Lord Nestor’s seat He should be expecting us Look up

Catelyn raised her eyes up and up and up At first all she saw was stone and trees the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night as black as a starless sky Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them a tower keep built upon the steep side of the mountain its lights like orange eyes staring down from above Above that was another higher and more distant and still higher a third no more than a flickering spark in the sky And finally up where the falcons soared a flash of white in the moonlight Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers so far above

The Eyrie she heard Marillion murmur awed

The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in The Arryns must not be overfond of company If you’re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark I’d rather you kill me here

We’ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow Brynden told him

I can scarcely wait the dwarf replied How do we get up there I’ve no experience at riding goats

Mules Brynden said smiling

There are steps carved into the mountain Catelyn said Ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn

Her uncle nodded It is too dark to see them but the steps are there Too steep and narrow for horses but mules can manage them most of the way The path is guarded by three waycastles Stone and Snow and Sky The mules will take us as far up as Sky

Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully And beyond that

Brynden smiled Beyond that the path is too steep even for mules We ascend on foot the rest of the way Or perchance you’d prefer to ride a basket The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below If you prefer my lord of Lannister I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples
