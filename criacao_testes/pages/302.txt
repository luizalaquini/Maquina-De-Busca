Except for you Arya pointed out That man said he’d take your head too

Well as to that Yoren said if he can get it off my shoulders he’s welcome to it





JON

Sam Jon called softly

The air smelled of paper and dust and years Before him tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp Jon blew out the taper he carried preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper Instead he followed the light wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings All in black he was a shadow among shadows dark of hair long of face grey of eye Black moleskin gloves covered his hands the right because it was burned the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove

Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall The glow came from the lamp hung over his head He looked up at the sound of Jon’s steps

Have you been here all night

Have I Sam looked startled

You didn’t break your fast with us and your bed hadn’t been slept in Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted but Jon never believed it Desertion required its own sort of courage and Sam had little enough of that

Is it morning Down here there’s no way to know

Sam you’re a sweet fool Jon said You’ll miss that bed when we’re sleeping on the cold hard ground I promise you

Sam yawned Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander I never thought… Jon the books have you ever seen their like There are thousands

He gazed about him The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred Did you find the maps

Oh yes Sam’s hand swept over the table fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him A dozen at the least He unfolded a square of parchment The paint has faded but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages and there’s another book… where is it now I was reading it a moment ago He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather This he said reverently is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore written by a ranger named Redwyn It’s not dated but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North so it must be from before the Conquest Jon they fought giants Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest it’s all here Ever so delicately he turned pages with a finger He drew maps as well see…

Maybe you could write an account of our ranging Sam

He’d meant to sound encouraging but it was the wrong thing to say The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly There’s more maps If I had time to search… everything’s a jumble I could set it all to order though I know I could but it would take time… well years in truth

Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that Jon plucked a scroll from a bin blew off the worst of the dust A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it Look this one is crumbling he said frowning over the faded script

Be gentle Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand holding it as if it were a wounded animal The important books used to be copied over when they needed them Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times probably

Well don’t bother copying that one Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod eighteen jars of fish oil a cask of salt…

An inventory Sam said or perhaps a bill of sale

Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago Jon wondered

I would Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it You can learn so much from ledgers like that truly you can it can tell you how many men were in the Night’s Watch then how they lived what they ate…

They ate food said Jon and they lived as we live

You’d be surprised This vault is a treasure Jon

If you say so Jon was doubtful Treasure meant gold silver and jewels not dust spiders and rotting leather
