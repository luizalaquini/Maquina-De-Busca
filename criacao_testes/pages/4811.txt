heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he
said unto him So shall thy seed be

156 And he believed in the LORD and he counted it to him for
righteousness

157 And he said unto him I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it

158 And he said LORD God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
it  159 And he said unto him Take me an heifer of three years old
and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a
turtledove and a young pigeon

1510 And he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst
and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not

1511 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases Abram drove them
away

1512 And when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram
and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him

1513 And he said unto Abram Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and
they shall afflict them four hundred years 1514 And also that
nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they
come out with great substance

1515 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried
in a good old age

1516 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for
the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full

1517 And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was
dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces

1518 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram saying
Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the
great river the river Euphrates 1519 The Kenites and the
Kenizzites and the Kadmonites 1520 And the Hittites and the
Perizzites and the Rephaims 1521 And the Amorites and the
Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites

161 Now Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children and she had an
handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar

162 And Sarai said unto Abram Behold now the LORD hath restrained
me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may
obtain children by her And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai

163 And Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her
husband Abram to be his wife

164 And he went in unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw
that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes

165 And Sarai said unto Abram My wrong be upon thee I have given my
maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was
despised in her eyes the LORD judge between me and thee

166 But Abram said unto Sarai Behold thy maid is in thine hand do
to her as it pleaseth thee And when Sarai dealt hardly with her she
fled from her face

167 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shur

168 And he said Hagar Sarais maid whence camest thou and whither
wilt thou go And she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai

169 And the angel of the LORD said unto her Return to thy mistress
and submit thyself under her hands

1610 And the angel of the LORD said unto her I will multiply thy
seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude

1611 And the angel of the LORD said unto her Behold thou art with
child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael because
the LORD hath heard thy affliction

1612 And he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man
and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren

1613 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her Thou
God seest me for she said Have I also here looked after him that
seeth me  1614 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi behold
it is between Kadesh and Bered

1615 And Hagar bare Abram a son and Abram called his sons name
which Hagar bare Ishmael

1616 And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bare
Ishmael to Abram

171 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine the LORD appeared
