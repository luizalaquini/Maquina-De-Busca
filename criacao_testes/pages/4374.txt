natural and artificial pitch contours using segmentals extracted from
natural utterances

There are many other topics which have not yet been fully investigated
It would be interesting for example to define rules for generating speech
at different tempos
Elisions where phonemes or even whole syllables are suppressed
occur in fast speech these have been analyzed by linguists
but not yet incorporated into synthetic models
It should be possible to simulate emotion by altering parameters such as
pitch range and mean pitch level but this seems exceptionally difficult
to evaluate  One situation where it would perhaps be possible to
measure emotion is in the reading of sports results em in fact a study
has already been made of intonation in soccer results Bonnet 1980

Bonnet 1980

Even the synthesis of voices with different pitch ranges requires
investigation for as noted earlier it is difficult to place
precise frequency specifications on phonological contours such as
those sketched in Figure 85
Clearly the topic of prosodic synthesis is a rich and potentially
rewarding area of research

There are quite a lot of books in the field of linguistics which
describe prosodic features
Here is a small but representative sample from both sides of the Atlantic

Abercrombie is one of the leading English authorities on phonetics
and this is a collection of essays which he has written over the years
Some of them treat prosodics explicitly and others show the influence
of verse structure on Abercrombies thinking

detail than has been possible in this chapter
