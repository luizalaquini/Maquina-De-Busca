Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck chasing your lie up the kingsroad… assuming there is a pursuit which is by no means certain Oh no doubt the word has reached my father… but my father does not love me overmuch and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself It was only half a lie Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his deformed son but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House This is a cruel land Lady Stark You’ll find no succor until you reach the Vale and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more Worse you risk losing me I am small and not strong and if I die then what’s the point That was no lie at all Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace

It might be said that your death is the point Lannister Catelyn Stark replied

I think not Tyrion said If you wanted me dead you had only to say the word and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile He looked at Kurleket but the man was too dim to taste the mockery

The Starks do not murder men in their beds

Nor do I he said I tell you again I had no part in the attempt to kill your son

The assassin was armed with your dagger

Tyrion felt the heat rise in him It was not my dagger he insisted How many times must I swear to that Lady Stark whatever you may believe of me I am not a stupid man Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade

Just for a moment he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes but what she said was Why would Petyr lie to me

Why does a bear shit in the woods he demanded Because it is his nature Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger You ought to know that you of all people

She took a step toward him her face tight And what does that mean Lannister

Tyrion cocked his head Why every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead my lady

That is a lie Catelyn Stark said

Oh wicked little imp Marillion said shocked

Kurleket drew his dirk a vicious piece of black iron At your word m’lady I’ll toss his lying tongue at your feet His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect

Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen Petyr Baelish loved me once He was only a boy His passion was a tragedy for all of us but it was real and pure and nothing to be made mock of He wanted my hand That is the truth of the matter You are truly an evil man Lannister

And you are truly a fool Lady Stark Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of it’s those ripe breasts of yours and that sweet mouth and the heat between your legs

Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk baring his throat Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin Shall I bleed him my lady

Kill me and the truth dies with me Tyrion gasped

Let him talk Catelyn Stark commanded

Kurleket let go of Tyrion’s hair reluctantly

Tyrion took a deep breath How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his Answer me that

You won it from him in a wager during the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day

When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers that was his story no

It was she admitted A line creased her brow

Riders

The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest

For a long second no one moved Catelyn Stark was the first to react Ser Rodrik Ser Willis to horse she shouted Get the other mounts behind us Mohor guard the prisoners—
