the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD and
by his fierce anger

427 For thus hath the LORD said The whole land shall be desolate
yet will I not make a full end

428 For this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black
because I have spoken it I have purposed it and will not repent
neither will I turn back from it

429 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks
every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein

430 And when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do Though thou
clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments
of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt
thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek
thy life

431 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of
the daughter of Zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her
hands saying Woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of
murderers

51 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now
and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man
if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and I
will pardon it

52 And though they say The LORD liveth surely they swear falsely

53 O LORD are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken
them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they
have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder
than a rock they have refused to return

54 Therefore I said Surely these are poor they are foolish for
they know not the way of the LORD nor the judgment of their God

55 I will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for
they have known the way of the LORD and the judgment of their God
but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds

56 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of
the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their
cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces
because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are
increased

57 How shall I pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me
and sworn by them that are no gods when I had fed them to the full
they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in
the harlots houses

58 They were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after
his neighbours wife

59 Shall I not visit for these things saith the LORD and shall not
my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  510 Go ye up upon her
walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her
battlements for they are not the LORDs

511 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
treacherously against me saith the LORD

512 They have belied the LORD and said It is not he neither shall
evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine 513 And the
prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it
be done unto them

514 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts Because ye speak this
word behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people
wood and it shall devour them

515 Lo I will bring a nation upon you from far O house of Israel
saith the LORD it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a
nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what
they say

516 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men

517 And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy
sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and
thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall
impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword

518 Nevertheless in those days saith the LORD I will not make a
full end with you

519 And it shall come to pass when ye shall say Wherefore doeth the
LORD our God all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them
Like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so
shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours

520 Declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah
saying 521 Hear now this O foolish people and without
understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear
not 522 Fear ye not me saith the LORD will ye not tremble at my
