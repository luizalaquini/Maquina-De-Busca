I need a whole tray Ser Amory is partial to them

She hated Ser Amory Let’s spit on them

Hot Pie looked around nervously The kitchens were full of shadows and echoes but the other cooks and scullions were all asleep in the cavernous lofts above the ovens He’ll know

He will not Arya said You can’t taste spit

If he does it’s me they’ll whip Hot Pie stopped his kneading You shouldn’t even be here It’s the black of night

It was but Arya never minded Even in the black of night the kitchens were never still there was always someone rolling dough for the morning bread stirring a kettle with a long wooden spoon or butchering a hog for Ser Amory’s breakfast bacon Tonight it was Hot Pie

If Pinkeye wakes and finds you gone— Hot Pie said

Pinkeye never wakes His true name was Mebble but everyone called him Pinkeye for his runny eyes Not once he’s passed out Each morning he broke his fast with ale Each evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper wine-colored spit running down his chin Arya would wait until she heard him snoring then creep barefoot up the servant’s stair making no more noise than the mouse she’d been She carried neither candle nor taper Syrio had told her once that darkness could be her friend and he was right If she had the moon and the stars to see by that was enough I bet we could escape and Pinkeye wouldn’t even notice I was gone she told Hot Pie

I don’t want to escape It’s better here than it was in them woods I don’t want to eat no worms Here sprinkle some flour on the board

Arya cocked her head What’s that

What I don’t—

Listen with your ears not your mouth That was a warhorn Two blasts didn’t you hear And there that’s the portcullis chains someone’s going out or coming in Want to go see The gates of Harrenhal had not been opened since the morning Lord Tywin had marched with his host

I’m making the morning bread Hot Pie complained Anyhow I don’t like it when it’s dark I told you

I’m going I’ll tell you after Can I have a tart

No

She filched one anyway and ate it on her way out It was stuffed with chopped nuts and fruit and cheese the crust flaky and still warm from the oven Eating Ser Amory’s tart made Arya feel daring Barefoot surefoot lightfoot she sang under her breath I am the ghost in Harrenhal

The horn had stirred the castle from sleep men were coming out into the ward to see what the commotion was about Arya fell in with the others A line of ox carts were rumbling under the portcullis Plunder she knew at once The riders escorting the carts spoke in a babble of queer tongues Their armor glinted pale in the moonlight and she saw a pair of striped black-and-white zorses The Bloody Mummers Arya withdrew a little deeper into the shadows and watched as a huge black bear rolled by caged in the back of a wagon Other carts were loaded down with silver plate weapons and shields bags of flour pens of squealing hogs and scrawny dogs and chickens Arya was thinking how long it had been since she’d had a slice off a pork roast when she saw the first of the prisoners

By his bearing and the proud way he held his head he must have been a lord She could see mail glinting beneath his torn red surcoat At first Arya took him for a Lannister but when he passed near a torch she saw his device was a silver fist not a lion His wrists were bound tightly and a rope around one ankle tied him to the man behind him and him to the man behind him so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep Many of the captives were wounded If any halted one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of the whip to get him moving again She tried to judge how many prisoners there were but lost count before she got to fifty There were twice that many at least Their clothing was stained with mud and blood and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all their badges and sigils but some of those Arya glimpsed she recognized Twin towers Sunburst Bloody man Battle-axe The battle-axe is for Cerwyn and the white sun on black is Karstark They’re northmen My father’s men and Robb’s She didn’t like to think what that might mean

The Bloody Mummers began to dismount Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to tend their lathered horses One of the riders was shouting for ale The noise brought Ser Amory Lorch out onto the covered gallery above the ward flanked by two torchbearers Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below him My lord cathellan the sellsword said He had a thick slobbery voice as if his tongue was too big for his mouth

What’s all this Hoat Ser Amory demanded frowning

Captiths Rooth Bolton thought to croth the river but my Brafe Companions cut his van to pieceth Killed many and thent Bolton running Thith ith their lord commander Glover and the one behind ith Ther Aenyth Frey

Ser Amory Lorch stared down at the roped captives with his little pig eyes Arya did not think he was pleased Everyone in the castle knew that he and Vargo Hoat hated each other Very well he said Ser Cadwyn take these men to the dungeons

The lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat raised his eyes We were promised honorable treatment— he began

Silenth Vargo Hoat screamed at him spraying spittle

Ser Amory addressed the captives What Hoat promised you is nothing to me Lord Tywin made me the castellan of Harrenhal and I shall do with you as I please He gestured to his guards The great cell under the Widow’s Tower ought to hold them all Any who do not care to go are free to die here

As his men herded off the captives at spearpoint Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the stairwell blinking at the torchlight If he found her missing he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her but she was not afraid He was no Weese He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one but Arya never actually knew him to hit Still it would be better if he never saw her She glanced around The oxen were being unharnessed the carts unloaded while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the curious gathered around the caged bear In the commotion it was not hard to slip off unseen She went back the way she had come wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her and thought to put her to work

Away from the gates and the stables the great castle was largely deserted The noise dwindled behind her A swirling wind gusted drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks in the Wailing Tower Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood and she could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones Now that Harrenhal was near empty once again sound did queer things here Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up noise shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence Other times the echoes had a life of their own so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army and every distant voice a ghostly feast The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie but not Arya

Quiet as a shadow she flitted across the middle bailey around the Tower of Dread and through the empty mews where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with ghostly wings She could go where she would The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal The Hall of a Hundred Hearths was closed off along with many of the lesser buildings even the Wailing Tower Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan’s chambers in Kingspyre themselves as spacious as a lord’s and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be close at hand While Lord Tywin had been in residence there was always a man-at-arms wanting to know your business But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a thousand doors and no one seemed to know who should be where or care much

As she passed the armory Arya heard the ring of a hammer A deep orange glow shone through the high windows She climbed to the roof and peeked down Gendry was beating out a breastplate When he worked nothing existed for him but metal bellows fire The hammer was like part of his arm She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made He’s strong she thought As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the breastplate into the quenching trough Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to the floor beside him

He did not seem surprised to see her You should be abed girl The breastplate hissed like a cat as he dipped it in the cold water What was all that noise

Vargo Hoat’s come back with prisoners I saw their badges There’s a Glover from Deepwood Motte he’s my father’s man The rest too mostly All of a sudden Arya knew why her feet had brought her here You have to help me get them out

Gendry laughed And how do we do that

Ser Amory sent them down to the dungeon The one under the Widow’s Tower that’s just one big cell You could smash the door open with your hammer—

While the guards watch and make bets on how many swings it will take me maybe

Arya chewed her lips We’d need to kill the guards

How are we supposed to do that

Maybe there won’t be a lot of them

If there’s two that’s too many for you and me You never learned nothing in that village did you You try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet the way he does Gendry took up the tongs again

You’re afraid

Leave me alone girl

Gendry there’s a hundred northmen Maybe more I couldn’t count them all That’s as many as Ser Amory has Well not counting the Bloody Mummers We just have to get them out and we can take over the castle and escape

Well you can’t get them out no more’n you could save Lommy Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely And if we did escape where would we go

Winterfell she said at once I’d tell Mother how you helped me and you could stay—

Would m’lady permit Could I shoe your horses for you and make swords for your lordly brothers

Sometimes he made her so angry You stop that

Why should I wager my feet for the chance to sweat in Winterfell in place of Harrenhal You know old Ben Blackthumb He came here as a boy Smithed for Lady Whent and her father before her and his father before him and even for Lord Lothston who held Harrenhal before the Whents Now he smiths for Lord Tywin and you know what he says A sword’s a sword a helm’s a helm and if you reach in the fire you get burned no matter who you’re serving Lucan’s a fair enough master I’ll stay here

The queen will catch you then She didn’t send gold cloaks after Ben Blackthumb

Likely it wasn’t even me they wanted

It was too you know it You’re somebody

I’m a ‘prentice smith and one day might be I’ll make a master armorer    if I don’t run off and lose my feet or get myself killed He turned away from her picked up his hammer once more and began to bang
