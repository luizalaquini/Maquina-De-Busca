72 For with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what
measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again

73 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye  74 Or how wilt
thou say to thy brother Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye
and behold a beam is in thine own eye  75 Thou hypocrite first
cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye

76 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your
pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn
again and rend you

77 Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock
and it shall be opened unto you 78 For every one that asketh
receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it
shall be opened

79 Or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he
give him a stone  710 Or if he ask a fish will he give him a
serpent  711 If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask him  712 Therefore all things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them
for this is the law and the prophets

713 Enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad
is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in
thereat 714 Because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which
leadeth unto life and few there be that find it

715 Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing
but inwardly they are ravening wolves

716 Ye shall know them by their fruits Do men gather grapes of
thorns or figs of thistles  717 Even so every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit

718 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit

719 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and
cast into the fire

720 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them

721 Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my Father which
is in heaven

722 Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in
thy name done many wonderful works  723 And then will I profess unto
them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity

724 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a
rock 725 And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds
blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded
upon a rock

726 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them
not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon
the sand 727 And the rain descended and the floods came and the
winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the
fall of it

728 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the
people were astonished at his doctrine 729 For he taught them as one
having authority and not as the scribes

81 When he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed
him

82 And behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying Lord
if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

83 And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be
thou clean And immediately his leprosy was cleansed

84 And Jesus saith unto him See thou tell no man but go thy way
shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded
for a testimony unto them

85 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a
centurion beseeching him 86 And saying Lord my servant lieth at
home sick of the palsy grievously tormented

87 And Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him

88 The centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant
shall be healed

89 For I am a man under authority having soldiers under me and I
say to this man Go and he goeth and to another Come and he
cometh and to my servant Do this and he doeth it
