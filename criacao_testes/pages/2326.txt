Shae kissed his maimed scarred nose A brave face A kind and good face I wish I could see it now

All the sweet innocence of the world was in her voice Innocence Fool she’s a whore all she knows of men is the bit between their legs Fool fool Better you than me Tyrion sat We have a long day before us both of us You shouldn’t have blown out that taper How are we to find our clothing

She laughed Maybe we’ll have to go naked

And if we’re seen my lord father will hang you Hiring Shae as one of Sansa’s maids had given him an excuse to be seen talking with her but Tyrion did not delude himself that they were safe Varys had warned him I gave Shae a false history but it was meant for Lollys and Lady Tanda Your sister is of a more suspicious mind If she should ask me what I know   

You will tell her some clever lie

No I will tell her that the girl is a common camp follower that you acquired before the battle on the Green Fork and brought to King’s Landing against your lord father’s express command I will not lie to the queen

You have lied to her before Shall I tell her that

The eunuch sighed That cuts more deeply than a knife my lord I have served you loyally but I must also serve your sister when I can How long do you think she would let me live if I were of no further use to her whatsoever I have no fierce sellsword to protect me no valiant brother to avenge me only some little birds who whisper in my ear With those whisperings I must buy my life anew each day

Pardon me if I do not weep for you

I shall but you must pardon me if I do not weep for Shae I confess I do not understand what there is in her to make a clever man like you act such a fool

You might if you were not a eunuch

Is that the way of it A man may have wits or a bit of meat between his legs but not both Varys tittered Perhaps I should be grateful I was cut then

The Spider was right Tyrion groped through the dragon-haunted darkness for his smallclothes feeling wretched The risk he was taking left him tight as a drumhead and there was guilt as well The Others can take my guilt he thought as he slipped his tunic over his head Why should I be guilty My wife wants no part of me and most especially not the part that seems to want her Perhaps he ought to tell her about Shae It was not as though he was the first man ever to keep a concubine Sansa’s own oh-so-honorable father had given her a bastard brother For all he knew his wife might be thrilled to learn that he was fucking Shae so long as it spared her his unwelcome touch

No I dare not Vows or no his wife could not be trusted She might be maiden between the legs but she was hardly innocent of betrayal she had once spilled her own father’s plans to Cersei And girls her age were not known for keeping secrets

The only safe course was to rid himself of Shae I might send her to Chataya Tyrion reflected reluctantly In Chataya’s brothel Shae would have all the silks and gems she could wish for and the gentlest highborn patrons It would be a better life by far than the one she had been living when he’d found her

Or if she was tired of earning her bread on her back he might arrange a marriage for her Bronn perhaps The sellsword had never balked at eating off his master’s plate and he was a knight now a better match than she could elsewise hope for Or Ser Tallad Tyrion had noticed that one gazing wistfully at Shae more than once Why not He’s tall strong not hard to look upon every inch the gifted young knight Of course Tallad knew Shae only as a pretty young lady’s maid in service at the castle If he wed her and then learned she was a whore   

M’lord where are you Did the dragons eat you up

No Here He groped at a dragon skull I have found a shoe but I believe it’s yours

M’lord sounds very solemn Have I displeased you

No he said too curtly You always please me And therein is our danger He might dream of sending her away at times like this but that never lasted long Tyrion saw her dimly through the gloom pulling a woolen sock up a slender leg I can see A vague light was leaking through the row of long narrow windows set high in the cellar wall The skulls of the Targaryen dragons were emerging from the darkness around them black amidst grey Day comes too soon A new day A new year A new century I survived the Green Fork and the Blackwater I can bloody well survive King Joffrey’s wedding

Shae snatched her dress down off the dragon’s tooth and slipped it over her head I’ll go up first Brella will want help with the bathwater She bent over to give him one last kiss upon the brow My giant of Lannister I love you so

And I love you as well sweetling A whore she might well be but she deserved better than what he had to give her I will wed her to Ser Tallad He seems a decent man And tall   





SANSA

That was such a sweet dream Sansa thought drowsily She had been back in Winterfell running through the godswood with her Lady Her father had been there and her brothers all of them warm and safe If only dreaming could make it so   

She threw back the coverlets I must be brave Her torments would soon be ended one way or the other If Lady was here I would not be afraid Lady was dead though Robb Bran Rickon Arya her father her mother even Septa Mordane All of them are dead but me She was alone in the world now

Her lord husband was not beside her but she was used to that Tyrion was a bad sleeper and often rose before the dawn Usually she found him in the solar hunched beside a candle lost in some old scroll or leatherbound book Sometimes the smell of the morning bread from the ovens took him to the kitchens and sometimes he would climb up to the roof garden or wander all alone down Traitor’s Walk

She threw back the shutters and shivered as gooseprickles rose along her arms There were clouds massing in the eastern sky pierced by shafts of sunlight They look like two huge castles afloat in the morning sky Sansa could see their walls of tumbled stone their mighty keeps and barbicans Wispy banners swirled from atop their towers and reached for the fast-fading stars The sun was coming up behind them and she watched them go from black to grey to a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson Soon the wind mushed them together and there was only one castle where there had been two

She heard the door open as her maids brought the hot water for her bath They were both new to her service Tyrion said the women who’d tended to her previously had all been Cersei’s spies just as Sansa had always suspected Come see she told them There’s a castle in the sky

They came to have a look It’s made of gold Shae had short dark hair and bold eyes She did all that was asked of her but sometimes she gave Sansa the most insolent looks A castle all of gold there’s a sight I’d like to see

A castle is it Brella had to squint That tower’s tumbling over looks like It’s all ruins that is

Sansa did not want to hear about falling towers and ruined castles She closed the shutters and said We are expected at the queen’s breakfast Is my lord husband in the solar

No m’lady said Brella I have not seen him

Might be he went to see his father Shae declared Might be the King’s Hand had need of his counsel

Brella gave a sniff Lady Sansa you’ll be wanting to get into the tub before the water gets too cool

Sansa let Shae pull her shift up over her head and climbed into the big wooden tub She was tempted to ask for a cup of wine to calm her nerves The wedding was to be at midday in the Great Sept of Baelor across the city And come evenfall the feast would be held in the throne room a thousand guests and seventy-seven courses with singers and jugglers and mummers But first came breakfast in the Queen’s Ballroom for the Lannisters and the Tyrell men—the Tyrell women would be breaking their fast with Margaery—and a hundred odd knights and lordlings They have made me a Lannister Sansa thought bitterly

Brella sent Shae to fetch more hot water while she washed Sansa’s back You are trembling m’lady

The water is not hot enough Sansa lied

Her maids were dressing her when Tyrion appeared Podrick Payne in tow You look lovely Sansa He turned to his squire Pod be so good as to pour me a cup of wine

There will be wine at the breakfast my lord Sansa said

There’s wine here You don’t expect me to face my sister sober surely It’s a new century my lady The three hundredth year since Aegon’s Conquest The dwarf took a cup of red from Podrick and raised it high To Aegon What a fortunate fellow Two sisters two wives and three big dragons what more could a man ask for He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand

The Imp’s clothing was soiled and unkempt Sansa noticed it looked as though he’d slept in it Will you be changing into fresh garb my lord Your new doublet is very handsome

The doublet is handsome yes Tyrion put the cup aside Come Pod let us see if we can find some garments to make me look less dwarfish I would not want to shame my lady wife

When the Imp returned a short time later he was presentable enough and even a little taller Podrick Payne had changed as well and looked almost a proper squire for once although a rather large red pimple in the fold beside his nose spoiled the effect of his splendid purple white and gold raiment He is such a timid boy Sansa had been wary of Tyrion’s squire at first he was a Payne cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne who had taken her father’s head off However she’d soon come to realize that Pod was as frightened of her as she was of his cousin Whenever she spoke to him he turned the most alarming shade of red

Are purple gold and white the colors of House Payne Podrick she asked him politely

No I mean yes He blushed The colors Our arms are purple and white chequy my lady With gold coins In the checks Purple and white Both He studied her feet

There’s a tale behind those coins said Tyrion No doubt Pod will confide it to your toes one day Just now we are expected at the Queen’s Ballroom however Shall we

Sansa was tempted to beg off I could tell him that my tummy was upset or that my moon’s blood had come She wanted nothing more than to crawl back in bed and pull the drapes I must be brave like Robb she told herself as she took her lord husband stiffly by the arm

In the Queen’s Ballroom they broke their fast on honeycakes baked with blackberries and nuts gammon steaks bacon fingerfish crisped in breadcrumbs autumn pears and a Dornish dish of onions cheese and chopped eggs cooked up with fiery peppers Nothing like a hearty breakfast to whet one’s appetite for the seventy-seven-course feast to follow Tyrion commented as their plates were filled There were flagons of milk and flagons of mead and flagons of a light sweet golden wine to wash it down Musicians strolled among the tables piping and fluting and fiddling while Ser Dontos galloped about on his broomstick horse and Moon Boy made farting sounds with his cheeks and sang rude songs about the guests
