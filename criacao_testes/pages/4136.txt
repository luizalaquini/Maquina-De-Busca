live in -- stirring times
And you can mind the old well that used to be in
the middle of the place Thats turned into a solid
iron pump with a large stone trough and all complete
Dear dear -- how the face of nations alter and
what we live to see nowadays Yes -- and tis the same
here Theyve been talking but now of the misesss
strange doings
 What have you been saying about her inquired
Oak sharply turning to the rest and getting very
warm
 These middle-aged men have been pulling her over
the coals for pride and vanity said Mark Clark but
I say let her have rope enough Bless her pretty face
shouldnt I like to do so -- upon her cherry lips
The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well
known sound with his own
 Mark said Gabriel sternly now you mind this 
none of that dalliance-talk -- that smack-and-coddle style
of yours -- about Miss Everdene I dont allow it Do
you hear 
 With all my heart as Ive got no chance replied
Mr Clark cordially
 I suppose youve been speaking against her  said
Oak turning to Joseph Poorgrass with a very grim
look
No no -- not a word I -- tis a real joyful thing that
shes no worse thats what I say said Joseph trembling
and blushing with terror  Matthew just said --  -- 
 Matthew Moon what have you been saying   asked
Oak
I Why ye know I wouldnt harm a worm -- no
not one underground worm  said Matthew Moon
looking very uneasy
Well somebody has -- and look here neighbours
Gabriel though one of the quietest and most gentle
men on earth rose to the occasion with martial
promptness and vigour Thats my fist Here he
placed his fist rather smaller in size than a common
loaf in the mathemarical centre of the maltsters little
table and with it gave a bump or two thereon as if
P 158
to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the
idea of fistiness before he went further Now -- the
first man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of
our mistress why here the fist was raised and let fall
as Thor might have done with his hammer in assaying
it -- hell smell and taste that -- or Im a Dutchman
All earnestly expressed by their features that their
minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on
account of this statement but were deploring the
difference which gave rise to the figure  and Mark
Clark cried Hear hear just what I should ha said
The dog George looked up at the same time after the
shepherds menace and though he understood English
but imperfectly began to growl
 Now dont ye take on so shepherd and sit down
said Henery with a deprecating peacefulness equal to
anything of the kind in Christianity
We hear that ye bc a extraordinary good and
clever man shepherd said Joseph Poorgrass with
considerable anxiety from behind the maltsters bed+
stead whither he had retired for safety Tis a great
thing to be clever Im sure he added making move+
ments associated with states of mind rather than body 
 we wish we were dont we neighbours  
Ay that we do sure said Matthew Moon with
a small anxious laugh towards Oak to show how very
friendly disposed he was likewise
 Whos been telling you Im clever said Oak
Tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common
said Matthew  We hear that ye can tell the t1me as
well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon
shepherd
 Yes I can do a little that way said Gabriel as a
man of medium sentiments on the subject
names upon their waggons almost like copper-plate
with beautiful flourishes and great long tails A
excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man
shepherd Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer
James Everdenes waggons before you came and a
could never mind which way to turn the Js and Es
 -- could ye Joseph Joseph shook his head to express
how absolute was
P 159
the fact that he couldnt And so
you used to do em the wrong way like this didnt ye
Joseph  Matthew marked on the dusty floor with his
whip-handle
LAMES
And how Farmer James would cuss and call thee a
fool wouldnt he Joseph when a seed his name
looking so inside-out-like  continued Matthew Moon
with feeling
Ay -- a would said Joseph meekly  But you see
I wasnt so much to blame for them Js and Es be
such trying sons o witches for the memory to mind
whether they face backward or forward  and I always
had such a forgetful memory too
Tis a bad afiction for ye being such a man of
