My handmaids say there are ghosts here

There are ghosts everywhere Ser Jorah said softly We carry them with us wherever we go

Yes she thought Viserys Khal Drogo my son Rhaego they are with me always Tell me the name of your ghost Jorah You know all of mine

His face grew very still Her name was Lynesse

Your wife

My second wife

It pains him to speak of her Dany saw but she wanted to know the truth Is that all you would say of her The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place Was she beautiful

Very beautiful Ser Jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face The first time I beheld her I thought she was a goddess come to earth the Maid herself made flesh Her birth was far above my own She was the youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower of Oldtown The White Bull who commanded your father’s Kingsguard was her great-uncle The Hightowers are an ancient family very rich and very proud

And loyal Dany said I remember Viserys said the Hightowers were among those who stayed true to my father

That’s so he admitted

Did your fathers make the match

No he said Our marriage    that makes a long tale and a dull one Your Grace I would not trouble you with it

I have nowhere to go she said Please

As my queen commands Ser Jorah frowned My home    you must understand that to understand the rest Bear Island is beautiful but remote Imagine old gnarled oaks and tall pines flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss little creeks running icy down steep hillsides The hall of the Mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen palisade Aside from a few crofters my people live along the coasts and fish the seas The island lies far to the north and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine Khaleesi

Still the island suited me well enough and I never lacked for women I had my share of fishwives and crofter’s daughters before and after I was wed I married young to a bride of my father’s choosing a Glover of Deepwood Motte Ten years we were wed or near enough as makes no matter She was a plain-faced woman but not unkind I suppose I came to love her after a fashion though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate Three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir The last time she never recovered She died not long after

Dany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze I am sorry for you truly

Ser Jorah nodded By then my father had taken the black so I was Lord of Bear Island in my own right I had no lack of marriage offers but before I could reach a decision Lord Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper and Ned Stark called his banners to help his friend Robert The final battle was on Pyke When Robert’s stonethrowers opened a breach in King Balon’s wall a priest from Myr was the first man through but I was not far behind For that I won my knighthood

To celebrate his victory Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport It was there I saw Lynesse a maid half my age She had come up from Oldtown with her father to see her brothers joust I could not take my eyes off her In a fit of madness I begged her favor to wear in the tourney never dreaming she would grant my request yet she did

I fight as well as any man Khaleesi but I have never been a tourney knight Yet with Lynesse’s favor knotted round my arm I was a different man I won joust after joust Lord Jason Mallister fell before me and Bronze Yohn Royce Ser Ryman Frey his brother Ser Hosteen Lord Whent Strongboar even Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard I unhorsed them all In the last match I broke nine lances against Jaime Lannister to no result and King Robert gave me the champion’s laurel I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand I was drunk as much on glory as on wine By rights I should have gotten a contemptuous refusal but Lord Leyton accepted my offer We were married there in Lannisport and for a fortnight I was the happiest man in the wide world

Only a fortnight asked Dany Even I was given more happiness than that with Drogo who was my sun-and-stars

A fortnight was how long it took us to sail from Lannisport back to Bear Island My home was a great disappointment to Lynesse It was too cold too damp too far away my castle no more than a wooden longhall We had no masques no mummer shows no balls or fairs Seasons might pass without a singer ever coming to play for us and there’s not a goldsmith on the island Even meals became a trial My cook knew little beyond his roasts and stews and Lynesse soon lost her taste for fish and venison

I lived for her smiles so I sent all the way to Oldtown for a new cook and brought a harper from Lannisport Goldsmiths jewelers dressmakers whatever she wanted I found for her but it was never enough Bear Island is rich in bears and trees and poor in aught else I built a fine ship for her and we sailed to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs and once even to Braavos where I borrowed heavily from the moneylenders It was as a tourney champion that I had won her hand and heart so I entered other tourneys for her sake but the magic was gone I never distinguished myself again and each defeat meant the loss of another charger and another suit of jousting armor which must needs be ransomed or replaced The cost could not be borne Finally I insisted we return home but there matters soon grew even worse than before I could no longer pay the cook and the harper and Lynesse grew wild when I spoke of pawning her jewels

The rest    I did things it shames me to speak of For gold So Lynesse might keep her jewels her harper and her cook In the end it cost me all When I heard that Eddard Stark was coming to Bear Island I was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face his judgment I took her with me into exile Nothing mattered but our love I told myself We fled to Lys where I sold my ship for gold to keep us

His voice was thick with grief and Dany was reluctant to press him any further yet she had to know how it ended Did she die there she asked him gently

Only to me he said In half a year my gold was gone and I was obliged to take service as a sellsword While I was fighting Braavosi on the Rhoyne Lynesse moved into the manse of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen They say she is his chief concubine now and even his wife goes in fear of her

Dany was horrified Do you hate her

Almost as much as I love her Ser Jorah answered Pray excuse me my queen I find I am very tired

She gave him leave to go but as he was lifting the flap of her tent she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question What did she look like your Lady Lynesse

Ser Jorah smiled sadly Why she looked a bit like you Daenerys He bowed low Sleep well my queen

Dany shivered and pulled the lionskin tight about her She looked like me It explained much that she had not truly understood He wants me she realized He loves me as he loved her not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman She tried to imagine herself in Ser Jorah’s arms kissing him pleasuring him letting him enter her It was no good When she closed her eyes his face kept changing into Drogo’s

Khal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars her first and perhaps he must be her last The maegi Mirri Maz Duur had sworn she should never bear a living child and what man would want a barren wife And what man could hope to rival Drogo who had died with his hair uncut and rode now through the night lands the stars his khalasar

She had heard the longing in Ser Jorah’s voice when he spoke of his Bear Island He can never have me but one day I can give him back his home and honor That much I can do for him

No ghosts troubled her sleep that night She dreamed of Drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were wed In the dream it was not horses they rode but dragons

The next morn she summoned her bloodriders Blood of my blood she told the three of them I have need of you Each of you is to choose three horses the hardiest and healthiest that remain to us Load as much water and food as your mounts can bear and ride forth for me Aggo shall strike southwest Rakharo due south Jhogo you are to follow shierak qiya on southeast

What shall we seek Khaleesi asked Jhogo

Whatever there is Dany answered Seek for other cities living and dead Seek for caravans and people Seek for rivers and lakes and the great salt sea Find how far this waste extends before us and what lies on the other side When I leave this place I do not mean to strike out blind again I will know where I am bound and how best to get there

And so they went the bells in their hair ringing softly while Dany settled down with her small band of survivors in the place they named Vaes Tolorro the city of bones Day followed night followed day Women harvested fruit from the gardens of the dead Men groomed their mounts and mended saddles stirrups and shoes Children wandered the twisty alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and stone flagons with handles carved like snakes One woman was stung by a red scorpion but hers was the only death The horses began to put on some flesh Dany tended Ser Jorah’s wound herself and it began to heal

Rakharo was the first to return Due south the red waste stretched on and on he reported until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water Between here and there lay only swirling sand wind-scoured rocks and plants bristly with sharp thorns He had passed the bones of a dragon he swore so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws Other than that he had seen nothing

Dany gave him charge of a dozen of her strongest men and set them to pulling up the plaza to get to the earth beneath If devilgrass could grow between the paving stones other grasses would grow when the stones were gone They had wells enough no lack of water Given seed they could make the plaza bloom

Aggo was back next The southwest was barren and burnt he swore He had found the ruins of two more cities smaller than Vaes Tolorro but otherwise the same One was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears so he dared not enter but he had explored the second for as long as he could He showed Dany an iron bracelet he had found set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb There were scrolls as well but they were dry and crumbling and Aggo had left them where they lay

Dany thanked him and told him to see to the repair of the gates If enemies had crossed the waste to destroy these cities in ancient days they might well come again If so we must be ready she declared

Jhogo was gone so long that Dany feared him lost but finally when they had all but ceased to look for him he came riding up from the southeast One of the guards that Aggo had posted saw him first and gave a shout and Dany rushed to the walls to see for herself It was true Jhogo came yet not alone Behind him rode three queerly garbed strangers atop ugly humped creatures that dwarfed any horse

They drew rein before the city gates and looked up to see Dany on the wall above them Blood of my blood Jhogo called I have been to the great city Qarth and returned with three who would look on you with their own eyes

Dany stared down at the strangers Here I stand Look if that is your pleasure    but first tell me your names

The pale man with the blue lips replied in guttural Dothraki I am Pyat Pree the great warlock

The bald man with the jewels in his nose answered in the Valyrian of the Free Cities I am Xaro Xhoan Daxos of the Thirteen a merchant prince of Qarth

The woman in the lacquered wooden mask said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms I am Quaithe of the Shadow We come seeking dragons

Seek no more Daenerys Targaryen told them You have found them
