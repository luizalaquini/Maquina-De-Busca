He was a traitor I never promised to spare him only that I’d be merciful and I was If he hadn’t been your father I would have had him torn or flayed but I gave him a clean death

Sansa stared at him seeing him for the first time He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed his face She wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain and his eyes were vain and cruel I hate you she whispered

King Joffrey’s face hardened My mother tells me that it isn’t fitting that a king should strike his wife Ser Meryn

The knight was on her before she could think yanking back her hand as she tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist Sansa did not remember failing yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes Her head was ringing Ser Meryn Trant stood over her with blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove

Will you obey now or shall I have him chastise you again

Sansa’s ear felt numb She touched it and her fingertips came away wet and red I… as… as you command my lord

Your Grace Joffrey corrected her I shall look for you in court He turned and left

Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet Save yourself some pain girl and give him what he wants

What… what does he want Please tell me

He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love the Hound rasped He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you He wants you to love him… and fear him

After he was gone Sansa sank back onto the rushes staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber I will need hot water for my bath please she told them and perfume and some powder to hide this bruise The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache but she knew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful

The hot water made her think of Winterfell and she took strength from that She had not washed since the day her father died and she was startled at how filthy the water became Her maids sluiced the blood off her face scrubbed the dirt from her back washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls Sansa did not speak to them except to give them commands they were Lannister servants not her own and she did not trust them When the time came to dress she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney She recalled how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the feast Perhaps it would make him remember as well and treat her more gently

She drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited to settle her stomach It was midday when Ser Meryn returned He had donned his white armor a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion His visor had been removed from his helm to better show his dour face pouchy bags under his eyes a wide sour mouth rusty hair spotted with grey My lady he said bowing as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room

Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come

Are you refusing to come my lady The look he gave her was without expression He did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her

He did not hate her Sansa realized neither did he love her He felt nothing for her at all She was only a… a thing to him No she said rising She wanted to rage to hurt him as he’d hurt her to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again… but she remembered what the Hound had told her so all she said was I shall do whatever His Grace commands

As I do he replied

Yes… but you are no true knight Ser Meryn

Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that Sansa knew Other men might have cursed her warned her to keep silent even begged for her forgiveness Ser Meryn Trant did none of these Ser Meryn Trant simply did not care

The balcony was deserted save for Sansa She stood with her head bowed fighting to hold back her tears while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him those he allowed his council to handle squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish Grand Maester Pycelle or Queen Cersei resolved the matter When he did choose to make a ruling though not even his queen mother could sway him

A thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off right there in court Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow To the death he added A woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor She had loved him she said and she wanted to see him decently buried If you loved a traitor you must be a traitor too Joffrey said Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons

Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence Sansa stared hard at his ugly face remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead wishing she could hurt him wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head But a voice inside her whispered There are no heroes and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her here in this very hall Life is not a song sweetling he’d told her You may learn that one day to your sorrow In life the monsters win she told herself and now it was the Hound’s voice she heard a cold rasp metal on stone Save yourself some pain girl and give him what he wants

The last case was a plump tavern singer accused of making a song that ridiculed the late King Robert Joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court The singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again but the king insisted It was sort of a funny song all about Robert fighting with a pig The pig was the boar who’d killed him Sansa knew but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen When the song was done Joffrey announced that he’d decided to be merciful The singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue He would have a day to make his choice Janos Slynt nodded

That was the final business of the afternoon Sansa saw with relief but her ordeal was not yet done When the herald’s voice dismissed the court she fled the balcony only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs The Hound was with him and Ser Meryn as well The young king examined her critically top to bottom You look much better than you did

Thank you Your Grace Sansa said Hollow words but they made him nod and smile

Walk with me Joffrey commanded offering her his arm She had no choice but to take it The touch of his hand would have thrilled her once now it made her flesh crawl My name day will be here soon Joffrey said as they slipped out the rear of the throne room There will be a great feast and gifts What are you going to give me

I… I had not thought my lord

Your Grace he said sharply You truly are a stupid girl aren’t you My mother says so

She does After all that had happened his words should have lost their power to hurt her yet somehow they had not The queen had always been so kind to her

Oh yes She worries about our children whether they’ll be stupid like you but I told her not to trouble herself The king gestured and Ser Meryn opened a door for them

Thank you Your Grace she murmured The Hound was right she thought I am only a little bird repeating the words they taught me The sun had fallen below the western wall and the stones of the Red Keep glowed dark as blood

I’ll get you with child as soon as you’re able Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard If the first one is stupid I’ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife When do you think you’ll be able to have children

Sansa could not look at him he shamed her so Septa Mordane says most… most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen

Joffrey nodded This way He led her into the gatehouse to the base of the steps that led up to the battlements

Sansa jerked back away from him trembling Suddenly she knew where they were going No she said her voice a frightened gasp Please no don’t make me I beg you…

Joffrey pressed his lips together I want to show you what happens to traitors

Sansa shook her head wildly I won’t I won’t

I can have Ser Meryn drag you up he said You won’t like that You had better do what I say Joffrey reached for her and Sansa cringed away from him backing into the Hound

Do it girl Sandor Clegane told her pushing her back toward the king His mouth twitched on the burned side of his face and Sansa could almost hear the rest of it He’ll have you up there no matter what so give him what he wants

She forced herself to take King Joffrey’s hand The climb was something out of a nightmare every step was a struggle as if she were pulling her feet out of ankle-deep mud and there were more steps than she would have believed a thousand thousand steps and horror waiting on the ramparts

From the high battlements of the gatehouse the whole world spread out below them Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s hill where her father had died At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit To the west the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods The salt sea was at her back and to the south was the fish market and the docks and the swirling torrent of the Blackwater Rush And to the north…

She turned that way and saw only the city streets and alleys and hills and bottoms and more streets and more alleys and the stone of distant walls Yet she knew that beyond them was open country farms and fields and forests and beyond that north and north and north again stood Winterfell

What are you looking at Joffrey said This is what I wanted you to see right here

A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart reaching as high as Sansa’s chin with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers The heads were mounted between the crenels along the top of the wall impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city Sansa had noted them the moment she’d stepped out onto the wallwalk but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier He can make me look at the heads she told herself but he can’t make me see them

This one is your father he said This one here Dog turn it around so she can see him

Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer Sansa looked at it calmly not seeing it at all It did not really look like Lord Eddard she thought it did not even look real How long do I have to look

Joffrey seemed disappointed Do you want to see the rest There was a long row of them

If it please Your Grace

Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes I’m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly he explained The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father Despite the tar most were long past being recognizable The king pointed to one and said That’s your septa there but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman The jaw had rotted off her face and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek

Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane although she supposed she had known all along Why did you kill her she asked She was godsworn…
