That took Tyrion by surprise He had been no more than an ugly boy at Casterly Rock when the city fell So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well

For the realm Once Rhaegar died the war was done Aerys was mad Viserys too young Prince Aegon a babe at the breast but the realm needed a king    I prayed it should be your good father but Robert was too strong and Lord Stark moved too swiftly   

How many have you betrayed I wonder Aerys Eddard Stark me    King Robert as well Lord Arryn Prince Rhaegar Where does it begin Pycelle He knew where it ended

The axe scratched at the apple of Pycelle’s throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under his jaw scraping away the last hairs You    were not here he gasped when the blade moved upward to his cheeks Robert    his wounds    if you had seen them smelled them you would have no doubt   

Oh I know the boar did your work for you    but if he’d left the job half done doubtless you would have finished it

He was a wretched king    vain drunken lecherous    he would have set your sister aside his own queen    please    Renly was plotting to bring the Highgarden maid to court to entice his brother    it is the gods’ own truth   

And what was Lord Arryn plotting

He knew Pycelle said About    about   

I know what he knew about snapped Tyrion who was not anxious for Shagga and Timett to know as well

He was sending his wife back to the Eyrie and his son to be fostered on Dragonstone    he meant to act   

So you poisoned him first

No Pycelle struggled feebly Shagga growled and grabbed his head The clansman’s hand was so big he could have crushed the maester’s skull like an eggshell had he squeezed

Tyrion tsked at him I saw the tears of Lys among your potions And you sent away Lord Arryn’s own maester and tended him yourself so you could make certain that he died

A falsehood

Shave him closer Tyrion suggested The throat again

The axe swept back down rasping over the skin A thin film of spit bubbled on Pycelle’s lips as his mouth trembled I tried to save Lord Arryn I vow—

Careful now Shagga you’ve cut him

Shagga growled Dolf fathered warriors not barbers

When he felt the blood trickling down his neck and onto his chest the old man shuddered and the last strength went out of him He looked shrunken both smaller and frailer than he had been when they burst in on him Yes he whimpered yes Colemon was purging so I sent him away The queen needed Lord Arryn dead she did not say so could not Varys was listening always listening but when I looked at her I knew It was not me who gave him the poison though I swear it The old man wept Varys will tell you it was the boy his squire Hugh he was called he must surely have done it ask your sister ask her

Tyrion was disgusted Bind him and take him away he commanded Throw him down in one of the black cells

They dragged him out the splintered door Lannister he moaned all I’ve done has been for Lannister   

When he was gone Tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few more small jars from his shelves The ravens muttered above his head as he worked a strangely peaceful noise He would need to find someone to tend the birds until the Citadel sent a man to replace Pycelle

He was the one I’d hoped to trust Varys and Littlefinger were no more loyal he suspected    only more subtle and thus more dangerous Perhaps his father’s way would have been best summon Ilyn Payne mount three heads above the gates and have done And wouldn’t that be a pretty sight he thought





ARYA

Fear cuts deeper than swords Arya would tell herself but that did not make the fear go away It was as much a part of her days as stale bread and the blisters on her toes after a long day of walking the hard rutted road

She had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid but she learned better in that storehouse beside the Gods Eye Eight days she had lingered there before the Mountain gave the command to march and every day she had seen someone die

The Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning The village folk would never look at him Maybe they thought that if they did not notice him he would not notice them    but he saw them anyway and picked whom he liked There was no place to hide no tricks to play no way to be safe

One girl shared a soldier’s bed three nights running the Mountain picked her on the fourth day and the soldier said nothing

A smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son off serving in the gold cloaks at King’s Landing A king’s man he is he would say a good king’s man like me all for Joffrey He said it so often the other captives began to call him All-for-Joffrey whenever the guards weren’t listening All-for-Joffrey was picked on the fifth day

A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they’d promise not to hurt her daughter The Mountain heard her out the next morning he picked her daughter to be certain she’d held nothing back

The ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives so they could see the fate of rebels and traitors A man the others called the Tickler asked the questions His face was so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers before she had seen him at his work Tickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them He was the man she’d tried to bite who’d called her a fierce little thing and smashed her head with a mailed fist Sometimes he helped the Tickler Sometimes others did that Ser Gregor Clegane himself would stand motionless watching and listening until the victim died

The questions were always the same Was there gold hidden in the village Silver gems Was there more food Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion Which of the village folk had aided him When he rode off where did he go How many men were with them How many knights how many bowmen how many men-at-arms How were they armed How many were horsed How many were wounded What other enemy had they seen How many When What banners did they fly Where did they go Was there gold hidden in the village Silver gems Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion How many men were with him By the third day Arya could have asked the questions herself

They found a little gold a little silver a great sack of copper pennies and a dented goblet set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to blows over They learned that Lord Beric had ten starvelings with him or else a hundred mounted knights that he had ridden west or north or south that he had crossed the lake in a boat that he was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux No one ever survived the Tickler’s questioning no man no woman no child The strongest lasted past evenfall Their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the wolves

By the time they marched Arya knew she was no water dancer Syrio Forel would never have let them knock him down and take his sword away nor stood by when they killed Lommy Greenhands Syrio would never have sat silent in that storehouse nor shuffled along meekly among the other captives The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks but Arya felt more a lamb surrounded by a herd of other sheep She hated the villagers for their sheepishness almost as much as she hated herself

The Lannisters had taken everything father friends home hope courage One had taken Needle while another had broken her wooden stick sword over his knee They had even taken her stupid secret The storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water in some corner when no one was looking but it was different on the road She held it as long as she could but finally she had to squat by a bush and skin down her breeches in front of all of them It was that or wet herself Hot Pie gaped at her with big moon eyes but no one else even troubled to look Girl sheep or boy sheep Ser Gregor and his men did not seem to care

Their captors permitted no chatter A broken lip taught Arya to hold her tongue Others never learned at all One boy of three would not stop calling for his father so they smashed his face in with a spiked mace Then the boy’s mother started screaming and Raff the Sweetling killed her as well

Arya watched them die and did nothing What good did it do you to be brave One of the women picked for questioning had tried to be brave but she had died screaming like all the rest There were no brave people on that march only scared and hungry ones Most were women and children The few men were very old or very young the rest had been chained to that gibbet and left for the wolves and the crows Gendry was only spared because he’d admitted to forging the horned helm himself smiths even apprentice smiths were too valuable to kill

They were being taken to serve Lord Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal the Mountain told them You’re traitors and rebels so thank your gods that Lord Tywin’s giving you this chance It’s more than you’d get from the outlaws Obey serve and live

It’s not just it’s not she heard one wizened old woman complain to another when they had bedded down for the night We never did no treason the others come in and took what they wanted same as this bunch

Lord Beric did us no hurt though her friend whispered And that red priest with him he paid for all they took

Paid He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper I ask you Will it give me eggs She looked about to see that no guards were near and spat three times There’s for the Tullys and there’s for the Lannisters and there’s for the Starks

It’s a sin and a shame an old man hissed When the old king was still alive he’d not have stood for this

King Robert Arya asked forgetting herself

King Aerys gods grace him the old man said too loudly A guard came sauntering over to shut them up The old man lost both his teeth and there was no more talk that night

Besides his captives Ser Gregor was bringing back a dozen pigs a cage of chickens a scrawny milk cow and nine wagons of salt fish The Mountain and his men had horses but the captives were all afoot and those too weak to keep up were killed out of hand along with anyone foolish enough to flee The guards took women off into the bushes at night and most seemed to expect it and went along meekly enough One girl prettier than the others was made to go with four or five different men every night until finally she hit one with a rock Ser Gregor made everyone watch while he took off her head with a sweep of his massive two-handed greatsword Leave the body for the wolves he commanded when the deed was done handing the sword to his squire to be cleaned

Arya glanced sidelong at Needle sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded balding man-at-arms called Polliver It’s good that they took it away she thought Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor and he would have cut her right in half and the wolves would eat her too

Polliver was not so bad as some of the others even though he’d stolen Needle The night she was caught the Lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as their nasal helms but she’d come to know them all You had to know who was lazy and who was cruel who was smart and who was stupid You had to learn that even though the one they called Shitmouth had the foulest tongue she’d ever heard he’d give you an extra piece of bread if you asked while jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff would just give you the back of their hand

Arya watched and listened and polished her hates the way Gendry had once polished his horned helm Dunsen wore those bull’s horns now and she hated him for it She hated Polliver for Needle and she hated old Chiswyck who thought he was funny And Raff the Sweetling who’d driven his spear through Lommy’s throat she hated even more She hated Ser Amory Lorch for Yoren and she hated Ser Meryn Trant for Syrio the Hound for killing the butcher’s boy Mycah and Ser Ilyn and Prince Joffrey and the queen for the sake of her father and Fat Tom and Desmond and the rest and even for Lady Sansa’s wolf The Tickler was almost too scary to hate At times she could almost forget he was still with them when he was not asking questions he was just another soldier quieter than most with a face like a thousand other men
