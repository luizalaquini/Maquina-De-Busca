Aggo’s arakh leapt to his hand Never have I killed a fat brown man Belwas will be the first

Sheath your steel blood of my blood said Dany this man comes to serve me Belwas you will accord all respect to my people or you will leave my service sooner than you’d wish and with more scars than when you came

The gap-toothed smile faded from the giant’s broad brown face replaced by a confused scowl Men did not often threaten Belwas it would seem and less so girls a third his size

Dany gave him a smile to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke Now tell me what would Magister Illyrio have of me that he would send you all the way from Pentos

He would have dragons said Belwas gruffly and the girl who makes them He would have you

Belwas has the truth of us Your Grace said Arstan We were told to find you and bring you back to Pentos The Seven Kingdoms have need of you Robert the Usurper is dead and the realm bleeds When we set sail from Pentos there were four kings in the land and no justice to be had

Joy bloomed in her heart but Dany kept it from her face I have three dragons she said and more than a hundred in my khalasar with all their goods and horses

it is no matter boomed Belwas We take all The fat man hires three ships for his little silverhair queen

It is so Your Grace Arstan Whitebeard said The great cog Saduleon is berthed at the end of the quay and the galleys Summer Sun and Joso’s Prank are anchored beyond the breakwater

Three heads has the dragon Dany thought wondering I shall tell my people to make ready to depart at once But the ships that bring me home must bear different names

As you wish said Arstan What names would you prefer

Vhagar Daenerys told him Meraxes And Balerion Paint the names on their hulls in golden letters three feet high Arstan I want every man who sees them to know the dragons are returned





ARYA

The heads had been dipped in tar to slow the rot Every morning when Arya went to the well to draw fresh water for Roose Bolton’s basin she had to pass beneath them They faced outward so she never saw their faces but she liked to pretend that one of them was Joffrey’s She tried to picture how his pretty face would look dipped in tar If I was a crow I could fly down and peck off his stupid fat pouty lips

The heads never lacked for attendants The carrion crows wheeled about the gatehouse in raucous unkindness and quarreled upon the ramparts over every eye screaming and cawing at each other and taking to the air whenever a sentry passed along the battlements Sometimes the maester’s ravens joined the feast as well flapping down from the rookery on wide black wings When the ravens came the crows would scatter only to return the moment the larger birds were gone

Do the ravens remember Maester Tothmure Arya wondered Are they sad for him When they quork at him do they wonder why he doesn’t answer Perhaps the dead could speak to them in some secret tongue the living could not hear

Tothmure had been sent to the axe for dispatching birds to Casterly Rock and King’s Landing the night Harrenhal had fallen Lucan the armorer for making weapons for the Lannisters Goodwife Harra for telling Lady Whent’s household to serve them the steward for giving Lord Tywin the keys to the treasure vault The cook was spared some said because he’d made the weasel soup but stocks were hammered together for pretty Pia and the other women who’d shared their favors with Lannister soldiers Stripped and shaved they were left in the middle ward beside the bear pit free for the use of any man who wanted them

Three Frey men-at-arms were using them that morning as Arya went to the well She tried not to look but she could hear the men laughing The pail was very heavy once full She was turning to bring it back to Kingspyre when Goodwife Amabel seized her arm The water went sloshing over the side onto Amabel’s legs You did that on purpose the woman screeched

What do you want Arya squirmed in her grasp Amabel had been half-crazed since they’d cut Harra’s head off

See there Arnabel pointed across the yard at Pia When this northman falls you’ll be where she is

Let me go She tried to wrench free but Amabel only tightened her fingers

He will fall too Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end Lord Tywin’s won now he’ll be marching back with all his power and then it will be his turn to punish the disloyal And don’t think he won’t know what you did The old woman laughed I may have a turn at you myself Harra had an old broom I’ll save it for you The handle’s cracked and splintery—

Arya swung the bucket The weight of the water made it turn in her hands so she didn’t smash Amabel’s head in as she wanted but the woman let go of her anyway when the water came out and drenched her Don’t ever touch me Arya shouted or I’ll kill you You get away

Sopping Goodwife Amabel jabbed a thin finger at the flayed man on the front of Arya’s tunic You think you’re safe with that little bloody man on your teat but you’re not The Lannisters are coming See what happens when they get here

Three-quarters of the water had splashed out on the ground so Arya had to return to the well If I told Lord Bolton what she said her head would be up next to Harra’s before it got dark she thought as she drew up the bucket again She wouldn’t though

Once when there had been only half as many heads Gendry had caught Arya looking at them Admiring your work he asked

He was angry because he’d liked Lucan she knew but it still wasn’t fair It’s Steelshanks Walton’s work she said defensively And the Mummers and Lord Bolton

And who gave us all them You and your weasel soup

Arya punched his arm It was just hot broth You hated Ser Amory too

I hate this lot worse Ser Amory was fighting for his lord but the Mummers are sellswords and turncloaks Half of them can’t even speak the Common Tongue Septon Utt likes little boys Qyburn does black magic and your friend Biter eats people

The worst thing was she couldn’t even say he was wrong The Brave Companions did most of the foraging for Harrenhal and Roose Bolton had given them the task of rooting out Lannisters Vargo Hoat had divided them into four bands to visit as many villages as possible He led the largest group himself and gave the others to his most trusted captains She had heard Rorge laughing over Lord Vargo’s way of finding traitors All he did was return to places he had visited before under Lord Tywin’s banner and seize those who had helped him Many had been bought with Lannister silver so the Mummers often returned with bags of coin as well as baskets of heads A riddle Shagwell would shout gleefully If Lord Bolton’s goat eats the men who fed Lord Lannister’s goat how many goats are there

One Arya said when he asked her

Now there’s a weasel clever as a goat the fool tittered

Rorge and Biter were as bad as the others Whenever Lord Bolton took a meal with the garrison Arya would see them there among the rest Biter gave off a stench like bad cheese so the Brave Companions made him sit down near the foot of the table where he could grunt and hiss to himself and tear his meat apart with fingers and teeth He would sniff at Arya when she passed but it was Rorge who scared her most He sat up near Faithful Ursywck but she could feel his eyes crawling over her as she went about her duties

Sometimes she wished she had gone off across the narrow sea with Jaqen H’ghar She still had the stupid coin he’d given her a piece of iron no larger than a penny and rusted along the rim One side had writing on it queer words she could not read The other showed a man’s head but so worn that all his features had rubbed off He said it was of great value but that was probably a lie too like his name and even his face That made her so angry that she threw the coin away but after an hour she got to feeling bad and went and found it again even though it wasn’t worth anything

She was thinking about the coin as she crossed the Flowstone Yard struggling with the weight of the water in her pail Nan a voice called out Put down that pail and come help me

Elmar Frey was no older than she was and short for his age besides He had been rolling a barrel of sand across the uneven stone and was red-faced from exertion Arya went to help him Together they pushed the barrel all the way to the wall and back again then stood it upright

She could hear the sand shifting around inside as Elmar pried open the lid and pulled out a chainmail hauberk Do you think it’s clean enough As Roose Bolton’s squire it was his task to keep his mail shiny bright

You need to shake out the sand There’s still spots of rust See She pointed You’d best do it again

You do it Elmar could be friendly when he needed help but afterward he would always remember that he was a squire and she was only a serving girl He liked to boast how he was the son of the Lord of the Crossing not a nephew or a bastard or a grandson but a trueborn son and on account of that he was going to marry a princess

Arya didn’t care about his precious princess and didn’t like him giving her commands I have to bring m’lord water for his basin He’s in his bedchamber being leeched Not the regular black leeches but the big pale ones

Elmar’s eyes got as big as boiled eggs Leeches terrified him especially the big pale ones that looked like jelly until they filled up with blood I forgot you’re too skinny to push such a heavy barrel

I forgot you’re stupid Arya picked up the pail Maybe you should get leeched too There’s leeches in the Neck as big as pigs She left him there with his barrel

The lord’s bedchamber was crowded when she entered Qyburn was in attendance and dour Walton in his mail shirt and greaves plus a dozen Freys all brothers half brothers and cousins Roose Bolton lay abed naked Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and dotted his pallid chest long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as they fed Bolton paid them no more mind than he did Arya

We must not allow Lord Tywin to trap us here at Harrenhal Ser Aenys Frey was saying as Arya filled the washbasin A grey stooped giant of a man with watery red eyes and huge gnarled hands Ser Aenys had brought fifteen hundred Frey swords south to Harrenhal yet it often seemed as if he were helpless to command even his own brothers The castle is so large it requires an army to hold it and once surrounded we cannot feed an army Nor can we hope to lay in sufficient supplies The country is ash the villages given over to wolves the harvest burnt or stolen Autumn is on us yet there is no food in store and none being planted We live on forage and if the Lannisters deny that to us we will be down to rats and shoe leather in a moon’s turn

I do not mean to be besieged here Roose Bolton’s voice was so soft that men had to strain to hear it so his chambers were always strangely hushed

What then demanded Ser Jared Frey who was lean balding and pockmarked Is Edmure Tully so drunk on his victory that he thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the open field

If he does he’ll beat them Arya thought He’ll beat them as he did on the Red Fork you’ll see Unnoticed she went to stand by Qyburn
