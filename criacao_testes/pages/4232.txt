the flocks began to change hands lightening the shep+
herds responsibilities  and they turned their attention
to this tent and inquired of a man at work there whose
soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in
no time what was going on
 The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpins
Ride to York and the Death of Black Bess replied the
man promptly without turning his eyes or leaving off
tying
As soon as the tent was completed the band struck
up highly stimulating harmonies and the announce+
ment was publicly made Black Bess standing in a con+
spicuous position on the outside as a living proof If
proof were wanted of the truth of the oracular utterances
from the stage over which the people were to enter
These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
heart and understanding both that they soon began to
crowd in abundantly among the foremost being visible
Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass who were holiday
keeping here to-day
Thats the great ruffen pushing me   screamed a
woman in front of Jan over her shoulder at him when
the rush was at its fiercest
How can I help pushing ye when the folk behind
push me  said Coggan in a deprecating tone turning
without turning his body which was jammed as in a vice
Tjere was a silence  then the drums and trumpets
again sent forth their echoing notes The crowd was
again ectasied

and gave another lurch in which Coggan
and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon
the women in front
O that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of
she swayed like a reed shaken by the wind
Now said Coggan appealing in an earnest voice
to the public at large as it stood clustered about his
shoulder-bladesded ye ever hear such onreasonable
woman as that  Upon my carcase neighbours if I
could onlyu get out of this cheesewring the damn women
might eat the show for me 
Dont ye lose yer temper Jan implored Joseph
Poorgrass in a whisper  They might get their men to
murder us for I think by the shine of their eyes that
they be a sinful form of womankind
Jan held his tongue as if he had no objection to be
pacified to please a friend and they gradually reached
the foot of the ladder Poorgrass being flattened like a
jumping-jack and the sixpence for admission which he
had got ready half-an-hour earlier having become so
reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that
the woman in spangles brazen rings set with glass
diamonds and with chalked face and shoulders who
took the money of him hastily dropped it again from
a fear that some trick had been played to burn her
fingers So they all entered and the cloth of the
tent to the eyes of an observer on the outside became
bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on
a sack of potatoes caused by the various human heads
backs and elbows at high pressure within
At the rear of the large tent there were two small
dressing-tents One of these alloted to the male per+
formers was partitioned into halves by a cloth  and in
one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass puli
ing on a pair of jack-boots a young man whom we
instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy
Troys appearance in this position may be briefly
accounted for The brig aboard which he was taken in
Budmouth Roads was about to start on a voyage though
somewhat short of hands Troy read the articles and
joined but before they sailed a boat was despatched
across the bay to Lulwind cove as he

had half expected
his clothes were gone He ultimately worked his passage
to the United States where he made a precarious living
in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics Sword
Exercise Fencing and Pugilism A few months were
sufficient to give him a distaste for this kind of life
There was a certain animal form of refinement in his
nature and however pleasant a strange condition might
be whilst privations were easily warded off it was dis+
advantageously coarse when money was short There
was ever present too the idea that he could claim a
home and its comforts did he but chose to return to
England and Weatherbury Farm Whether Bathsheba
thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious
conjecture To England he did return at last  but the
but the fact of drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its
fascinations and his intention to enter his old groove at
the place became modified It was with gloom he con+
sidered on landing at Liverpool that if he were to go home
his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con+
template  for what Troy had in the way of emotion was
an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused
him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and
healthy kind Bathsheba was not a women to be made
a fool of or a woman to suffer in silence and how
could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom
at first entering he would be beholden for food and
