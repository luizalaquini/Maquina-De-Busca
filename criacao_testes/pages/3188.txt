2229 Jesus answered and said unto them Ye do err not knowing the
scriptures nor the power of God

2230 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven

2231 But as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God saying 2232 I am the God of
Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob  God is not the
God of the dead but of the living

2233 And when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his
doctrine

2234 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
to silence they were gathered together

2235 Then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question
tempting him and saying 2236 Master which is the great commandment
in the law  2237 Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind

2238 This is the first and great commandment

2239 And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself

2240 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets

2241 While the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them
2242 Saying What think ye of Christ whose son is he They say unto
him The son of David

2243 He saith unto them How then doth David in spirit call him Lord
saying 2244 The LORD said unto my Lord Sit thou on my right hand
till I make thine enemies thy footstool  2245 If David then call him
Lord how is he his son  2246 And no man was able to answer him a
word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more
questions

231 Then spake Jesus to the multitude and to his disciples 232
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat 233 All
therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do
not ye after their works for they say and do not

234 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay
them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers

235 But all their works they do for to be seen of men they make
broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
236 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in
the synagogues 237 And greetings in the markets and to be called of
men Rabbi Rabbi

238 But be not ye called Rabbi for one is your Master even Christ
and all ye are brethren

239 And call no man your father upon the earth for one is your
Father which is in heaven

2310 Neither be ye called masters for one is your Master even
Christ

2311 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant

2312 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that
shall humble himself shall be exalted

2313 But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in

2314 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye devour
widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye
shall receive the greater damnation

2315 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves

2316 Woe unto you ye blind guides which say Whosoever shall swear
by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of
the temple he is a debtor  2317 Ye fools and blind for whether is
greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold  2318
And Whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever
sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty

2319 Ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the
altar that sanctifieth the gift  2320 Whoso therefore shall swear by
the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon

2321 And whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him
that dwelleth therein

2322 And he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of
God and by him that sitteth thereon

2323 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay
tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier
