Pycelle cleared his throat which involved a deal of coughing and hawking The letter is from the same Bowen Marsh who sent the last The castellan He writes that Lord Mormont has sent word of wildlings moving south in vast numbers

The lands beyond the Wall cannot support vast numbers said Lord Tywin firmly This warning is not new

This last is my lord Mormont sent a bird from the haunted forest to report that he was under attack More ravens have returned since but none with letters This Bowen Marsh fears Lord Mormont slain with all his strength

Tyrion had rather liked old Jeor Mormont with his gruff manner and talking bird Is this certain he asked

It is not Pycelle admitted but none of Mormont’s men have returned as yet Marsh fears the wildlings have killed them and that the Wall itself may be attacked next He fumbled in his robe and found the paper Here is his letter my lord a plea to all five kings He wants men as many men as we can send him

Five kings His father was annoyed There is one king in Westeros Those fools in black might try and remember that if they wish His Grace to heed them When you reply tell him that Renly is dead and the others are traitors and pretenders

No doubt they will be glad to learn it The Wall is a world apart and news oft reaches them late Pycelle bobbed his head up and down What shall I tell Marsh concerning the men he begs for Shall we convene the council…

There is no need The Night’s Watch is a pack of thieves killers and baseborn churls but it occurs to me that they could prove otherwise given proper discipline If Mormont is indeed dead the black brothers must choose a new Lord Commander

Pycelle gave Tyrion a sly glance An excellent thought my lord I know the very man Janos Slynt

Tyrion liked that notion not at all The black brothers choose their own commander he reminded them Lord Slynt is new to the Wall I know I sent him there Why should they pick him over a dozen more senior men

Because his father said in a tone that suggested Tyrion was quite the simpleton if they do not vote as they are told their Wall will melt before it sees another man

Yes that would work Tyrion hitched forward Janos Slynt is the wrong man Father We’d do better with the commander of the Shadow Tower Or Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

The commander of the Shadow Tower is a Mallister of Seagard Eastwatch is held by an ironman Neither would serve his purposes Lord Tywin’s tone said clear enough

Janos Slynt is a butcher’s son Tyrion reminded his father forcefully You yourself told me—

I recall what I told you Castle Black is not Harrenhal however The Night’s Watch is not the king’s council There is a tool for every task and a task for every tool

Tyrion’s anger flashed Lord Janos is a hollow suit of armor who will sell himself to the highest bidder

I count that a point in his favor Who is like to bid higher than us He turned to Pycelle Send a raven Write that King Joffrey was deeply saddened to hear of Lord Commander Mormont’s death but regrets that he can spare no men just now whilst so many rebels and usurpers remain in the field Suggest that matters might be quite different once the throne is secure… provided the king has full confidence in the leadership of the Watch In closing ask Marsh to pass along His Grace’s fondest regards to his faithful friend and servant Lord Janos Slynt

Yes my lord Pycelle bobbed his withered head once more I shall write as the Hand commands With great pleasure

I should have trimmed his head not his beard Tyrion reflected And Slynt should have gone for a swim with his dear friend Allar Deem At least he had not made the same foolish mistake with Symon Silver Tongue See there Father he wanted to shout See how fast I learn my lessons





Samwell


Up in the loft a woman was giving birth noisily while below a man lay dying by the fire Samwell Tarly could not say which frightened him more

They’d covered poor Bannen with a pile of furs and stoked the fire high yet all he could say was I’m cold Please I’m so cold Sam was trying to feed him onion broth but he could not swallow The broth dribbled over his lips and down his chin as fast as Sam could spoon it in

That one’s dead Craster eyed the man with indifference as he worried at a sausage Be kinder to stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat you ask me

I don’t recall as we did Giant was no more than five feet tall—his true name was Bedwyck—but a fierce little man for all that Slayer did you ask Craster for his counsel

Sam cringed at the name but shook his head He filled another spoon brought it to Bannen’s mouth and tried to ease it between his lips

Food and fire Giant was saying that was all we asked of you And you grudge us the food

Be glad I didn’t grudge you fire too Craster was a thick man made thicker by the ragged smelly sheepskins he wore day and night He had a broad flat nose a mouth that drooped to one side and a missing ear And though his matted hair and tangled beard might be grey going white his hard knuckly hands still looked strong enough to hurt I fed you what I could but you crows are always hungry I’m a godly man else I would have chased you off You think I need the likes of him dying on my floor You think I need all your mouths little man The wildling spat Crows When did a black bird ever bring good to a man’s hall I ask you Never Never

More broth ran from the corner of Bannen’s mouth Sam dabbed it away with a corner of his sleeve The ranger’s eyes were open but unseeing I’m cold he said again so faintly A maester might have known how to save him but they had no maester Kedge Whiteye had taken Bannen’s mangled foot off nine days past in a gout of pus and blood that made Sam sick but it was too little too late I’m so cold the pale lips repeated

About the hall a ragged score of black brothers squatted on the floor or sat on rough-hewn benches drinking cups of the same thin onion broth and gnawing on chunks of hardbread A couple were wounded worse than Bannen to look at them Fornio had been delirious for days and Ser Byam’s shoulder was oozing a foul yellow pus When they’d left Castle Black Brown Bernarr had been carrying bags of Myrish fire mustard salve ground garlic tansy poppy kingscopper and other healing herbs Even sweetsleep which gave the gift of painless death But Brown Bernarr had died on the Fist and no one had thought to search for Maester Aemon’s medicines Hake had known some herblore as well being a cook but Hake was also lost So it was left to the surviving stewards to do what they could for the wounded which was little enough At least they are dry here with a fire to warm them They need more food though

They all needed more food The men had been grumbling for days Clubfoot Karl kept saying how Craster had to have a hidden larder and Garth of Oldtown had begun to echo him when he was out of the Lord Commander’s hearing Sam had thought of begging for something more nourishing for the wounded men at least but he did not have the courage Craster’s eyes were cold and mean and whenever the wildling looked his way his hands twitched a little as if they wanted to curl up into fists Does he know I spoke to Gilly the last time we were here he wondered Did she tell him I said we’d take her Did he beat it out of her

I’m cold said Bannen Please I’m cold

For all the heat and smoke in Craster’s hall Sam felt cold himself And tired so tired He needed sleep but whenever he closed his eyes he dreamed of blowing snow and dead men shambling toward him with black hands and bright blue eyes

Up in the loft Gilly let out a shuddering sob that echoed down the long low windowless hall Push he heard one of Craster’s older wives tell her Harder Harder Scream if it helps She did so loud it made Sam wince

Craster turned his head to glare I’ve had a bellyful o’ that shrieking he shouted up Give her a rag to bite down on or I’ll come up there and give her a taste o’ my hand

He would too Sam knew Craster had nineteen wives but none who’d dare interfere once he started up that ladder No more than the black brothers had two nights past when he was beating one of the younger girls There had been mutterings to be sure He’s killing her Garth of Greenaway had said and Clubfoot Karl laughed and said If he don’t want the little sweetmeat he could give her to me Black Bernarr cursed in a low angry voice and Alan of Rosby got up and went outside so he wouldn’t have to hear His roof his rule the ranger Ronnel Harclay had reminded them Craster’s a friend to the Watch

A friend thought Sam as he listened to Gilly’s muffled shrieks Craster was a brutal man who ruled his wives and daughters with an iron hand but his keep was a refuge all the same Frozen crows Craster sneered when they straggled in those few who had survived the snow the wights and the bitter cold And not so big a flock as went north neither Yet he had given them space on his floor a roof to keep the snow off a fire to dry them out and his wives had brought them cups of hot wine to put some warmth in their bellies Bloody crows he called them but he’d fed them too meager though the fare might be

We are guests Sam reminded himself Gilly is his His daughter his wife His roof his rule

The first time he’d seen Craster’s Keep Gilly had come begging for help and Sam had lent her his black cloak to conceal her belly when she went to find Jon Snow Knights are supposed to defend women and children Only a few of the black brothers were knights but even so… We all say the words Sam thought I am the shield that guards the realms of men A woman was a woman even a wildling woman We should help her We should It was her child Gilly feared for she was frightened that it might be a boy Craster raised up his daughters to be his wives but there were neither men nor boys to be seen about his compound Gilly had told Jon that Craster gave his sons to the gods If the gods are good they will send her a daughter Sam prayed

Up in the loft Gilly choked back a scream That’s it a woman said Another push now Oh I see his head

Hers Sam thought miserably Her head hers

Cold said Bannen weakly Please I’m so cold Sam put the bowl and spoon aside tossed another fur across the dying man put another stick on the fire Gilly gave a shriek and began to pant Craster gnawed on his hard black sausage He had sausages for himself and his wives he said but none for the Watch Women he complained The way they wail… I had me a fat sow once birthed a litter of eight with no more’n a grunt Chewing he turned his head to squint contemptuously at Sam She was near as fat as you boy Slayer He laughed

It was more than Sam could stand He stumbled away from the firepit stepping awkwardly over and around the men sleeping and squatting and dying upon the hard-packed earthen floor The smoke and screams and moans were making him feel faint Bending his head he pushed through the hanging deerhide flaps that served Craster for a door and stepped out into the afternoon

The day was cloudy but still bright enough to blind him after the gloom of the hall Some patches of snow weighed down the limbs of surrounding trees and blanketed the gold and russet hills but fewer than there had been The storm had passed on and the days at Craster’s Keep had been… well not warm perhaps but not so bitter cold Sam could hear the soft drip-drip-drip of water melting off the icicles that bearded the edge of the thick sod roof He took a deep shuddering breath and looked around

To the west Ollo Lophand and Tim Stone were moving through the horselines feeding and watering the remaining garrons

Downwind other brothers were skinning and butchering the animals deemed too weak to go on Spearmen and archers walked sentry behind the earthen dikes that were Craster’s only defense against whatever hid in the wood beyond while a dozen firepits sent up thick fingers of blue-grey smoke Sam could hear the distant echoes of axes at work in the forest where a work detail was harvesting enough wood to keep the blazes burning all through the night Nights were the bad time When it got dark And cold

There had been no attacks while they had been at Craster’s neither wights nor Others Nor would there be Craster said A godly man got no cause to fear such I said as much to that Mance Rayder once when he come sniffing round He never listened no more’n you crows with your swords and your bloody fires That won’t help you none when the white cold comes Only the gods will help you then You best get right with the gods

Gilly had spoken of the white cold as well and she’d told them what sort of offerings Craster made to his gods Sam had wanted to kill him when he heard There are no laws beyond the Wall he reminded himself and Craster’s a friend to the Watch

A ragged shout went up from behind the daub-and-wattle hall Sam went to take a look The ground beneath his feet was a slush of melting snow and soft mud that Dolorous Edd insisted was made of Craster’s shit It was thicker than shit though it sucked at Sam’s boots so hard he felt one pull loose
