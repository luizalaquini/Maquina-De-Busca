2410 And the son of an Israelitish woman whose father was an
Egyptian went out among the children of Israel and this son of the
Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp
2411 And the Israelitish womans son blasphemed the name of the Lord
and cursed And they brought him unto Moses and his mothers name
was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan 2412 And
they put him in ward that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them

2413 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 2414 Bring forth him
that hath cursed without the camp and let all that heard him lay
their hands upon his head and let all the congregation stone him

2415 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel saying
Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin

2416 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD he shall surely be
put to death and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as
well the stranger as he that is born in the land when he blasphemeth
the name of the Lord shall be put to death

2417 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death

2418 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good beast for beast

2419 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour as he hath done
so shall it be done to him 2420 Breach for breach eye for eye
tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so shall it be
done to him again

2421 And he that killeth a beast he shall restore it and he that
killeth a man he shall be put to death

2422 Ye shall have one manner of law as well for the stranger as
for one of your own country for I am the LORD your God

2423 And Moses spake to the children of Israel that they should
bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with
stones And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses

251 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai saying 252 Speak
unto the children of Israel and say unto them When ye come into the
land which I give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
LORD

253 Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt
prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof 254 But in the
seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for
the LORD thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard

255 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a
year of rest unto the land

256 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and
for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee

257 And for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall
all the increase thereof be meat

258 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years

259 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land

2510 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be
a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession
and ye shall return every man unto his family

2511 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow
neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes
in it of thy vine undressed

2512 For it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field

2513 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession

2514 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of
thy neighbours hand ye shall not oppress one another 2515
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee 2516 According to the multitude of years thou
shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of
years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee

2517 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear
thy Godfor I am the LORD your God

2518 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do
them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety

2519 And the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill
