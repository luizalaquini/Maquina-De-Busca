Castles are not friendly places for the frail Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table atop the Stone Drum Dragonstone’s central keep so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms To reach him they must cross the gallery pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate Young men climbed steps two at a time for old men with bad hips every one was a torment But Lord Stannis would not think to come to him so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal He had Pylos to help him at the least and for that he was grateful

Shuffling along the gallery they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of the outer bailey the curtain wall and the fishing village beyond In the yard archers were firing at practice butts to the call of Notch draw loose Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing Guardsmen strode the wallwalks peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords Past the sprawl of the camp the anchorage was crowded with ships No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again Lord Stannis’s Fury a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars looked almost small beside some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her

The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight and passed them through Wait here Cressen told Pylos within It’s best I see him alone

It is a long climb Maester

Cressen smiled You think I have forgotten I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by name

Halfway up he regretted his decision He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth descending

Davos was a slight man his low birth written plain upon a common face A well-worn green cloak stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun draped his thin shoulders over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong His small beard was well peppered with grey and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand When he saw Cressen he checked his descent

Ser Davos the maester said When did you return

In the black of morning My favorite time It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand Before Lord Stannis had knighted him he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms

And

The man shook his head It is as you warned him They will not rise Maester Not for him They do not love him

No Cressen thought Nor will they ever He is strong able just    aye just past the point of wisdom    yet it is not enough It has never been enough You spoke to them all

All No Only those that would see me They do not love me either these highborns To them I’ll always be the Onion Knight His left hand closed stubby fingers locking into a fist Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint all but the thumb I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose and the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove The others—well Beric Dondarrion is gone missing some say dead and Lord Caron is with Renly Bryce the Orange of the Rainbow Guard

The Rainbow Guard

Renly’s made his own Kingsguard the onetime smuggler explained but these seven don’t wear white Each one has his own color Loras Tyrell’s their Lord Commander

It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon a splendid new order of knighthood with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it Even as a boy Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics and he had loved his games as well Look at me he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm’s End Look at me I’m a dragon or Look at me I’m a wizard or Look at me look at me I’m the rain god

The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now one-and-twenty and still he played his games Look at me I’m a king Cressen thought sadly Oh Renly Renly dear sweet child do you know what you are doing And would you care if you did Is there anyone who cares for him but me What reasons did the lords give for their refusals he asked Ser Davos

Well as to that some gave me soft words and some blunt some made excuses some promises some only lied He shrugged In the end words are just wind

You could bring him no hope

Only the false sort and I’d not do that Davos said He had the truth from me

Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted after the siege of Storm’s End Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne Even the sea was closed against them watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor Within Storm’s End the horses had long since been eaten the dogs and cats were gone and the garrison was down to roots and rats Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars Cloaked in that darkness Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike His little ship had a black hull black sails black oars and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish Little enough yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm’s End and break the siege

Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath a small keep and a knight’s honors    but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand to pay for all his years of smuggling Davos had submitted on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself he would accept no punishment from lesser hands The lord had used a butcher’s cleaver the better to cut clean and true Afterward Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field—with an onion on its sails The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim

No Cressen thought a man like that would give no false hope nor soften a hard truth Ser Davos truth can be a bitter draught even for a man like Lord Stannis He thinks only of returning to King’s Landing in the fullness of his power to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his Yet now   

If he takes this meager host to King’s Landing it will be only to die He does not have the numbers I told him as much but you know his pride Davos held up his gloved hand My fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense

The old man sighed You have done all you could Now I must add my voice to yours Wearily he resumed his climb

Lord Stannis Baratheon’s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass In the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long perhaps half that wide at its widest point but less than four feet across at its narrowest Aegon’s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight On its surface darkened by near three hundred years of varnish were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon’s day rivers and mountains castles and cities lakes and forests

There was a single chair in the room carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool When Maester Cressen entered he glanced up I knew you would come old man whether I summoned you or no There was no hint of warmth in his voice there seldom was

Stannis Baratheon Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis and hard he was Though he was not yet five-and-thirty only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown His brother the late King Robert had grown a beard in his final years Maester Cressen had never seen it but they said it was a wild thing thick and fierce As if in answer Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows a blue as dark as the sea by night His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands all thin pale lips and clenched muscles a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away

Once you would have woken me the old man said

Once you were young Now you are old and sick and need your sleep Stannis had never learned to soften his speech to dissemble or flatter he said what he thought and those that did not like it could be damned I knew you’d learn what Davos had to say soon enough You always do don’t you

I would be of no help to you if I did not Cressen said I met Davos on the stair

And he told all I suppose I should have had the man’s tongue shortened along with his fingers

He would have made you a poor envoy then

He made me a poor envoy in any case The storm lords will not rise for me It seems they do not like me and the justice of my cause means nothing to them The cravenly ones will sit behind their walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph The bold ones have already declared for Renly For Renly He spat out the name like poison on his tongue

Your brother has been the Lord of Storm’s End these past thirteen years These lords are his sworn bannermen—

His Stannis broke in when by rights they should be mine I never asked for Dragonstone I never wanted it I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out I built his fleet and did his work dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder as Renly should be to me And what was Robert’s thanks He names me Lord of Dragonstone and gives Storm’s End and its incomes to Renly Storm’s End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne

It was an old grievance deeply felt and never more so than now Here was the heart of his lord’s weakness for Dragonstone old and strong though it was commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister

Robert did you an injustice Maester Cressen replied carefully yet he had sound reasons Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen He needed a man’s strength to rule here and Renly was but a child

He is a child still Stannis declared his anger ringing loud in the empty hall a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow What has Renly ever done to earn a throne He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man That is the sum of my brother Renly who thinks he ought to be a king I ask you why did the gods inflict me with brothers

I cannot answer for the gods

You seldom answer at all these days it seems to me Who maesters for Renly Perchance I should send for him I might like his counsel better What do you think this maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine

It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel Your Grace The youngest of Lord Steffon’s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless who acted from impulse rather than calculation In that as in so much else Renly was like his brother Robert and utterly unlike Stannis

Your Grace Stannis repeated bitterly You mock me with a king’s style yet what am I king of Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea there is my kingdom He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King’s Landing now stood There he stood brooding over the realm he sought to claim so near at hand and yet so far away Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen such as they are Celtigar Velaryon Bar Emmon the whole paltry lot of them A poor crop if truth be told but they are what my brothers have left me That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of what I owe him and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining us Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once What am I to tell them What must I do now

Your true enemies are the Lannisters my lord Maester Cressen answered If you and your brother were to make common cause against them—

I will not treat with Renly Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument Not while he calls himself a king

Not Renly then the maester yielded His lord was stubborn and proud when he had set his mind there was no changing it Others might serve your needs as well Eddard Stark’s son has been proclaimed King in the North with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him

A green boy said Stannis and another false king Am I to accept a broken realm

Surely half a kingdom is better than none Cressen said and if you help the boy avenge his father’s murder—

Why should I avenge Eddard Stark The man was nothing to me Oh Robert loved him to be sure Loved him as a brother how often did I hear that I was his brother not Ned Stark but you would never have known it by the way he treated me I held Storm’s End for him watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls Did Robert thank me No He thanked Stark for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes I built a fleet at Robert’s command took Dragonstone in his name Did he take my hand and say Well done brother whatever should I do without you No he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe as if I could have stopped it I sat on his council for fifteen years helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored but when Jon died did my brother name me his Hand No he went galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark and offered him the honor And small good it did either of them

Be that as it may my lord Maester Cressen said gently Great wrongs have been done you but the past is dust The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks There are others you might sound out as well What of Lady Arryn If the queen murdered her husband surely she will want justice for him She has a young son Jon Arryn’s heir If you were to betroth Shireen to him—
