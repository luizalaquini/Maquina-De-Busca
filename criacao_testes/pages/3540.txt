DAENERYS

The land was red and dead and parched and good wood was hard to come by Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods purple brush sheaves of brown grass They took the two straightest trees hacked the limbs and branches from them skinned off their bark and split them laying the logs in a square Its center they filled with straw brush bark shavings and bundles of dry grass Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them he was not the equal of Khal Drogo’s red but few horses were In the center of the square Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes

Bound hand and foot Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes It is not enough to kill a horse she told Dany By itself the blood is nothing You do not have the words to make a spell nor the wisdom to find them Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children You call me maegi as if it were a curse but all it means is wise You are a child with a child’s ignorance Whatever you mean to do it will not work Loose me from these bonds and I will help you

I am tired of the maegi’s braying Dany told Jhogo He took his whip to her and after that the godswife kept silent

Over the carcass of the horse they built a platform of hewn logs trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater and the thickest straightest branches they could find They laid the wood east to west from sunrise to sunset On the platform they piled Khal Drogo’s treasures his great tent his painted vests his saddles and harness the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son a mighty dragonbone bow Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo’s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well but she forbade it Those are mine she told him and I mean to keep them Another layer of brush was piled about the khal’s treasures and bundles of dried grass scattered over them

Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith Princess… he began

Why do you call me that Dany challenged him My brother Viserys was your king was he not

He was my lady

Viserys is dead I am his heir the last blood of House Targaryen Whatever was his is mine now

My… queen Ser Jorah said going to one knee My sword that was his is yours Dacnerys And my heart as well that never belonged to your brother I am only a knight and I have nothing to offer you but exile but I beg you hear me Let Khal Drogo go You shall not be alone I promise you no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go You need not join the dosh khaleen Come east with me Yi Ti Qarth the Jade Sea Asshai by the Shadow We will see all the wonders yet unseen and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us Please Khaleesi I know what you intend Do not Do not

I must Dany told him She touched his face fondly sadly You do not understand

I understand that you loved him Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair I loved my lady wife once yet I did not die with her You are my queen my sword is yours but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo’s pyre I will not watch you burn

Is that what you fear Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead I am not such a child as that sweet ser

You do not mean to die with him You swear it my queen

I swear it she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers

The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger and covered with dry leaves and twigs They laid them north to south from ice to fire and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done Dany called the Dothraki around her Fewer than a hundred were left How many had Aegon started with she wondered It did not matter

You will be my khalasar she told them I see the faces of slaves I free you Take off your collars Go if you wish no one shall harm you If you stay it will be as brothers and sisters husbands and wives The black eyes watched her wary expressionless I see the children women the wrinkled faces of the aged I was a child yesterday Today I am a woman Tomorrow I will be old To each of you I say give me your hands and your hearts and there will always be a place for you She turned to the three young warriors of her khas Jhogo to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift and name you ko and ask your oath that you will live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

Jhogo took the whip from her hands but his face was confused Khaleesi he said hesitantly this is not done It would shame me to be bloodrider to a woman

Aggo Dany called paying no heed to Jhogo’s words If I look back I am lost To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift It was double-curved shiny black and exquisite taller than she was I name you ko and ask your oath that you should live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes I cannot say these words Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko

Rakharo Dany said turning away from the refusal you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift with hilt and blade chased in gold And you too I name my ko and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

You are khaleesi Rakharo said taking the arakh I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen No more can I promise

She nodded as calmly as if she had not heard his answer and turned to the last of her champions Ser Jorah Mormont she said first and greatest of my knights I have no bride gift to give you but I swear to you one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel And I would ask for your oath as well

You have it my queen Ser Jorah said kneeling to lay his sword at her feet I vow to serve you to obey you to die for you if need be

Whatever may come

Whatever may come

I shall hold you to that oath I pray you never regret the giving of it Dany lifted him to his feet Stretching on her toes to reach his lips she kissed the knight gently and said You are the first of my Queensguard

She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes They thought her mad Dany realized Perhaps she was She would know soon enough If I look back I am lost

Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud She liked the heat It made her feel clean Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak the steam rose moist and fragrant Doreah washed her hair and combed it out working loose the mats and tangles Irri scrubbed her back Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs She shuddered when it entered her and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve She floated

When she was clean her handmaids helped her from the water Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon a touch on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts The last dab was for her sex Irri’s finger felt as light and cool as a lover’s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips

Afterward Dany sent them all away so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair running her fingers through it for the last time feeling the weight of it remembering the first time she had touched it the night of their wedding ride His hair had never been cut How many men could die with their hair uncut She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils He smelled like grass and warm earth like smoke and semen and horses He smelled like Drogo Forgive me sun of my life she thought Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do I paid the price my star but it was too high too high…

Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one So many bells gold and silver and bronze Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest old and faded the one Drogo had loved best For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers sandals that laced halfway up her legs and a vest like Drogo’s

The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent Dany walked behind them They laid him down on his cushions and silks his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast

Oil she commanded and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance Bring my eggs Dany commanded her handmaids Something in her voice made them run

Ser Jorah took her arm My queen Drogo will have no use for dragon’s eggs in the night lands Better to sell them in Asshai Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days

They were not given to me to sell Dany told him

She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars The black beside his heart under his arm The green beside his head his braid coiled around it The cream-and-gold down between his legs When she kissed him for the last time Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips

As she climbed down off the pyre she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her You are mad the godswife said hoarsely

Is it so far from madness to wisdom Dany asked Ser Jorah take this maegi and bind her to the pyre

To the… my queen no hear me…

Do as I say Still he hesitated until her anger flared You swore to obey me whatever might come Rakharo help him

The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo’s pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures Dany poured the oil over the woman’s head herself I thank you Mirri Maz Duur she said for the lessons you have taught me

You will not hear me scream Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing

I will Dany said but it is not your screams I want only your life I remember what you told me Only death can pay for life Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth but made no reply As she stepped away Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi’s flat black eyes in its place was something that might have been fear Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star

When a horselord dies his horse is slain with him so he might ride proud into the night lands The bodies are burned beneath the open sky and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars The more fiercely the man burned in life the brighter his star will shine in the darkness

Jhogo spied it first There he said in a hushed voice Dany looked and saw it low in the east The first star was a comet burning red Bloodred fire red the dragon’s tail She could not have asked for a stronger sign

Dany took the torch from Aggo’s hand and thrust it between the logs The oil took the fire at once the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf A rising heat puffed at her face soft and sudden as a lover’s breath but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear Dany stepped backward The wood crackled louder and louder Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill ululating voice The flames whirled and writhed racing each other up the platform The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat Dany heard logs spit and crack The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur Her song grew louder shriller… then she gasped again and again and her song became a shuddering wail thin and high and full of agony

And now the flames reached her Drogo and now they were all around him His clothing took fire and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke grey and greasy Dany’s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one forever
