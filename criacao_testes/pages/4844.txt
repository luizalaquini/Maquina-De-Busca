4631 And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house
I will go up and shew Pharaoh and say unto him My brethren and my
fathers house which were in the land of Canaan are come unto me
4632 And the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed
cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all
that they have

4633 And it shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall call you and
shall say What is your occupation  4634 That ye shall say Thy
servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now
both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of
Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians

471 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said My father and my
brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have
are come out of the land of Canaan and behold they are in the land
of Goshen

472 And he took some of his brethren even five men and presented
them unto Pharaoh

473 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren What is your occupation And
they said unto Pharaoh Thy servants are shepherds both we and also
our fathers

474 They said morever unto Pharaoh For to sojourn in the land are we
come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the
famine is sore in the land of Canaan now therefore we pray thee let
thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen

475 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying Thy father and thy
brethren are come unto thee 476 The land of Egypt is before thee in
the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the
land of Goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity
among them then make them rulers over my cattle

477 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before
Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh

478 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob How old art thou  479 And Jacob
said unto Pharaoh The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an
hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of
my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the
life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage

4710 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh

4711 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a
possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land in the land
of Rameses as Pharaoh had commanded

4712 And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his
fathers household with bread according to their families

4713 And there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very
sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by
reason of the famine

4714 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land
of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they bought
and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohs house

4715 And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of
Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said Give us bread
for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth

4716 And Joseph said Give your cattle and I will give you for your
cattle if money fail

4717 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph and Joseph gave them
bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle
of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all
their cattle for that year

4718 When that year was ended they came unto him the second year
and said unto him We will not hide it from my lord how that our
money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not
ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
4719 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land
buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants
unto Pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that
the land be not desolate

4720 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh for the
Egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over
them so the land became Pharaohs

4721 And as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of
the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof

4722 Only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had
a portion assigned them of Pharaoh and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands

4723 Then Joseph said unto the people Behold I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall
sow the land

4724 And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give
