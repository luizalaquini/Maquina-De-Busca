Jon’s more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never so much as set eyes on Winterfell

Jon is a brother of the Night’s Watch sworn to take no wife and hold no lands Those who take the black serve for life

So do the knights of the Kingsguard That did not stop the Lannisters from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros Blount when they had no more use for them If I send the Watch a hundred men in Jon’s place I’ll wager they find some way to release him from his vows

He is set on this Catelyn knew how stubborn her son could be A bastard cannot inherit

Not unless he’s legitimized by a royal decree said Robb There is more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from his oath

Precedent she said bitterly Yes Aegon the Fourth legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed And how much pain grief war and murder grew from that I know you trust Jon But can you trust his sons Or their sons The Blackfyre pretenders troubled the Targaryens for five generations until Barristan the Bold slew the last of them on the Stepstones If you make Jon legitimate there is no way to turn him bastard again Should he wed and breed any sons you may have by Jeyne will never be safe

Jon would never harm a son of mine

No more than Theon Greyjoy would harm Bran or Rickon

Grey Wind leapt up atop King Tristifer’s crypt his teeth bared Robb’s own face was cold That is as cruel as it is unfair Jon is no Theon

So you pray Have you considered your sisters What of their rights I agree that the north must not be permitted to pass to the Imp but what of Arya By law she comes after Sansa… your own sister trueborn…

…and dead No one has seen or heard of Arya since they cut Father’s head off Why do you lie to yourself Arya’s gone the same as Bran and Rickon and they’ll kill Sansa too once the dwarf gets a child from her Jon is the only brother that remains to me Should I die without issue I want him to succeed me as King in the North I had hoped you would support my choice

I cannot she said In all else Robb In everything But not in this… this folly Do not ask it

I don’t have to I’m the king Robb turned and walked off Grey Wind bounding down from the tomb and loping after him

What have I done Catelyn thought wearily as she stood alone by Tristifer’s stone sepulcher First I anger Edmure and now Robb but all I have done is speak the truth Are men so fragile they cannot bear to hear it She might have wept then had not the sky begun to do it for her It was all she could do to walk back to her tent and sit there in the silence

In the days that followed Robb was everywhere and anywhere riding at the head of the van with the Greatjon scouting with Grey Wind racing back to Robin Flint and the rearguard Men said proudly that the Young Wolf was the first to rise each dawn and the last to sleep at night but Catelyn wondered whether he was sleeping at all He grows as lean and hungry as his direwolf

My lady Maege Mormont said to her one morning as they rode through a steady rain you seem so somber Is aught amiss

My lord husband is dead as is my father Two of my sons have been murdered my daughter has been given to a faithless dwarf to bear his vile children my other daughter is vanished and likely dead and my last son and my only brother are both angry with me What could possibly be amiss That was more truth than Lady Maege would wish to hear however This is an evil rain she said instead We have suffered much and there is more peril and more grief ahead We need to face it boldly with horns blowing and banners flying bravely But this rain beats us down The banners hang limp and sodden and the men huddle under their cloaks and scarcely speak to one another Only an evil rain would chill our hearts when most we need them to burn hot

Dacey Mormont looked up at the sky I would sooner have water raining down on me than arrows

Catelyn smiled despite herself You are braver than I am I fear Are all your Bear Island women such warriors

She-bears aye said Lady Maege We have needed to be In olden days the ironmen would come raiding in their longboats or wildlings from the Frozen Shore The men would be off fishing like as not The wives they left behind had to defend themselves and their children or else be carried off

There’s a carving on our gate said Dacey A woman in a bearskin with a child in one arm suckling at her breast In the other hand she holds a battleaxe She’s no proper lady that one but I always loved her

My nephew Jorah brought home a proper lady once said Lady Maege He won her in a tourney How she hated that carving

Aye and all the rest said Dacey She had hair like spun gold that Lynesse Skin like cream But her soft hands were never made for axes

Nor her teats for giving suck her mother said bluntly

Catelyn knew of whom they spoke Jorah Mormont had brought his second wife to Winterfell for feasts and once they had guested for a fortnight She remembered how young the Lady Lynesse had been how fair and how unhappy One night after several cups of wine she had confessed to Catelyn that the north was no place for a Hightower of Oldtown There was a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once she had answered gently trying to console but in time she found much here she could love

All lost now she reflected Winterfell and Ned Bran and Rickon Sansa Arya all gone Only Robb remains Had there been too much of Lynesse Hightower in her after all and too little of the Starks Would that I had known how to wield an axe perhaps I might have been able to protect them better

Day followed day and still the rain kept falling All the way up the Blue Fork they rode past Sevenstreams where the river unraveled into a confusion of rills and brooks then through Hag’s Mire where glistening green pools waited to swallow the unwary and the soft ground sucked at the hooves of their horses like a hungry babe at its mother’s breast The going was worse than slow Half the wayns had to be abandoned to the muck their loads distributed amongst mules and draft horses

Lord Jason Mallister caught up with them amidst the bogs of Hag’s Mire There was more than an hour of daylight remaining when he rode up with his column but Robb called a halt at once and Ser Raynald Westerling came to escort Catelyn to the king’s tent She found her son seated beside a brazier a map across his lap Grey Wind slept at his feet The Greatjon was with him along with Galbart Glover Maege Mormont Edmure and a man that Catelyn did not know a fleshy balding man with a cringing look to him No lordling this one she knew the moment she laid eyes on the stranger Not even a warrior

Jason Mallister rose to offer Catelyn his seat His hair had almost as much white in it as brown but the Lord of Seagard was still a handsome man tall and lean with a chiseled clean-shaven face high cheekbones and fierce blue-grey eyes Lady Stark it is ever a pleasure I bring good tidings I hope

We are in sore need of some my lord She sat listening to the rain patter down noisily against the canvas overhead

Robb waited for Ser Raynald to close the tent flap The gods have heard our prayers my lords Lord Jason has brought us the captain of the Myraham a merchanter out of Oldtown Captain tell them what you told me

Aye Your Grace He licked his thick lips nervously My last port of call afore Seagard that was Lordsport on Pyke The ironmen kept me there more’n half a year they did King Balon’s command Only well the long and the short of it is he’s dead

Balon Greyjoy Catelyn’s heart skipped a beat You are telling us that Balon Greyjoy is dead

The shabby little captain nodded You know how Pyke’s built on a headland and part on rocks and islands off the shore with bridges between The way I heard it in Lordsport there was a blow coming in from the west rain and thunder and old King Balon was crossing one of them bridges when the wind got hold of it and just tore the thing to pieces He washed up two days later all bloated and broken Crabs ate his eyes I hear

The Greatjon laughed King crabs I hope to sup upon such royal jelly eh

The captain bobbed his head Aye but that’s not all of it no He leaned forward The brother’s back

Victarion asked Galbart Glover surprised

Euron Crow’s Eye they call him as black a pirate as ever raised a sail He’s been gone for years but Lord Balon was no sooner cold than there he was sailing into Lordsport in his Silence Black sails and a red hull and crewed by mutes He’d been to Asshai and back I heard Wherever he was though he’s home now and he marched right into Pyke and sat his arse in the Seastone Chair and drowned Lord Botley in a cask of seawater when he objected That was when I ran back to Myraham and slipped anchor hoping I could get away whilst things were confused And so I did and here I am

Captain said Robb when the man was done you have my thanks and you will not go unrewarded Lord Jason will take you back to your ship when we are done Pray wait outside

That I will Your Grace That I will

No sooner had he left the king’s pavilion than the Greatjon began to laugh but Robb silenced him with a look Euron Greyjoy is no man’s notion of a king if half of what Theon said of him was true Theon is the rightful heir unless he’s dead… but Victarion commands the Iron Fleet I can’t believe he would remain at Moat Cailin while Euron Crow’s Eye holds the Seastone Chair He has to go back

There’s a daughter as well Galbart Glover reminded him The one who holds Deepwood Motte and Robett’s wife and child

If she stays at Deepwood Motte that’s all she can hope to hold said Robb What’s true for the brothers is even more true for her She will need to sail home to oust Euron and press her own claim Her son turned to Lord Jason Mallister You have a fleet at Seagard

A fleet Your Grace Half a dozen longships and two war galleys Enough to defend my own shores against raiders but I could not hope to meet the Iron Fleet in battle

Nor would I ask it of you The ironborn will be setting sail toward Pyke I expect Theon told me how his people think Every captain a king on his own deck They will all want a voice in the succession My lord I need two of your longships to sail around the Cape of Eagles and up the Neck to Greywater Watch

Lord Jason hesitated A dozen streams drain the wetwood all shallow silty and uncharted I would not even call them rivers The channels are ever drifting and changing There are endless sandbars deadfalls and tangles of rotting trees And Greywater Watch moves How are my ships to find it

Go upriver flying my banner The crannogmen will find you I want two ships to double the chances of my message reaching Howland Reed Lady Maege shall go on one Galbart on the second He turned to the two he’d named You’ll carry letters for those lords of mine who remain in the north but all the commands within will be false in case you have the misfortune to be taken If that happens you must tell them that you were sailing for the north Back to Bear Island or for the Stony Shore He tapped a finger on the map Moat Cailin is the key Lord Balon knew that which is why he sent his brother Victarion there with the hard heart of the Greyjoy strength

Succession squabbles or no the ironborn are not such fools as to abandon Moat Cailin said Lady Maege

No Robb admitted Victarion will leave the best part of his garrison I’d guess Every man he takes will be one less man we need to fight however And he will take many of his captains count on that The leaders He will need such men to speak for him if he hopes to sit the Seastone Chair

You cannot mean to attack up the causeway Your Grace said Galbart Glover The approaches are too narrow There is no way to deploy No one has ever taken the Moat
