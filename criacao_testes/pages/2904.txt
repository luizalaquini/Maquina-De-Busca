8942 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice

8943 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made
him to stand in the battle

8944 Thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to
the ground

8945 The days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him
with shame Selah

8946 How long LORD wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath
burn like fire

8947 Remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men
in vain

8948 What man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave Selah

8949 Lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth

8950 Remember Lord the reproach of thy servants how I do bear in
my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people

8951 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached O LORD wherewith they
have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed

8952 Blessed be the LORD for evermore Amen and Amen



901 Lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations

902 Before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting
thou art God

903 Thou turnest man to destruction and sayest Return ye children
of men

904 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past and as a watch in the night

905 Thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in
the morning they are like grass which groweth up

906 In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it
is cut down and withereth

907 For we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we
troubled

908 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance

909 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years
as a tale that is told

9010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength
labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away

9011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy
fear so is thy wrath

9012 So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom

9013 Return O LORD how long and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants

9014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be
glad all our days

9015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
us and the years wherein we have seen evil

9016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their
children

9017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands
establish thou it



911 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty

912 I will say of the LORD He is my refuge and my fortress my God
in him will I trust

913 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and
from the noisome pestilence

914 He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt
