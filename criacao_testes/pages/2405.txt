77 And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood

78 Of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 79 There went in two
and two unto Noah into the ark the male and the female as God had
commanded Noah

710 And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth

711 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life in the second month
the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened

712 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights

713 In the selfsame day entered Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth
the sons of Noah and Noahs wife and the three wives of his sons
with them into the ark 714 They and every beast after his kind
and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind
every bird of every sort

715 And they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of all
flesh wherein is the breath of life

716 And they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as
God had commanded him and the LORD shut him in

717 And the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters
increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth

718 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters

719 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the
high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered

720 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains
were covered

721 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and
of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth and every man 722 All in whose nostrils was the
breath of life of all that was in the dry land died

723 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the
fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah
only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark

724 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days

81 And God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over
the earth and the waters asswaged 82 The fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was
restrained 83 And the waters returned from off the earth
continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated

84 And the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of
the month upon the mountains of Ararat

85 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the
tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the
mountains seen

86 And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made 87 And he sent forth a raven
which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off
the earth

88 Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground 89 But the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his
hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark

810 And he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark 811 And the dove came in to him in the evening
and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so Noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth

812 And he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove
which returned not again unto him any more

813 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from
off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked
and behold the face of the ground was dry

814 And in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the
month was the earth dried

815 And God spake unto Noah saying 816 Go forth of the ark thou
and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
