81 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 82 Speak unto Aaron and
say unto him When thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give
light over against the candlestick

83 And Aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick as the LORD commanded Moses

84 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the
shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses so he made the
candlestick

85 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 86 Take the Levites from
among the children of Israel and cleanse them

87 And thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them Sprinkle water
of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let
them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean

88 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even
fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take
for a sin offering

89 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
of Israel together 810 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
LORD and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the
Levites 811 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
offering of the children of Israel that they may execute the service
of the LORD

812 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering unto the LORD to make an atonement for
the Levites

813 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons
and offer them for an offering unto the LORD

814 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
Israel and the Levites shall be mine

815 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer
them for an offering

816 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
Israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the
firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto me

817 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both
man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of
Egypt I sanctified them for myself

818 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
children of Israel

819 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
from among the children of Israel to do the service of the children
of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an
atonement for the children of Israel that there be no plague among
the children of Israel when the children of Israel come nigh unto the
sanctuary

820 And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of
Israel did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded
Moses concerning the Levites so did the children of Israel unto them

821 And the Levites were purified and they washed their clothes and
Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD and Aaron made an
atonement for them to cleanse them

822 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron and before his sons as
the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites so did they unto
them

823 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 824 This is it that
belongeth unto the Levites from twenty and five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation 825 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease
waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more 826 But
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service Thus shalt
thou do unto the Levites touching their charge

91 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
Egypt saying 92 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover
at his appointed season

93 In the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in
his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according
to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it

94 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel that they should keep
the passover

95 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the wilderness of Sinai according to all that the
