She sheathed her sword Why did you charge

Bowmen are fearless so long as they can hide behind walls and shoot at you from afar but if you come at them they run They know what will happen when you reach them You have an arrow in your back you know And another in your leg You ought to let me tend them

You

Who else The last I saw of cousin Cleos his palfrey was using his head to plow a furrow Though I suppose we ought to find him He is a Lannister of sorts

They found Cleos still tangled in his stirrup He had an arrow through his right arm and a second in his chest but it was the ground that had done for him The top of his head was matted with blood and mushy to the touch pieces of broken bone moving under the skin beneath the pressure of Jaime’s hand

Brienne knelt and held his hand He’s still warm

He’ll cool soon enough I want his horse and his clothes I’m weary of rags and fleas

He was your cousin The wench was shocked

Was Jaime agreed Have no fear I am amply provisioned in cousins I’ll have his sword as well You need someone to share the watches

You can stand a watch without weapons She rose

Chained to a tree Perhaps I could Or perhaps I could make my own bargain with the next lot of outlaws and let them slit that thick neck of yours wench

I will not arm you And my name is—

—Brienne I know I’ll swear an oath not to harm you if that will ease your girlish fears

Your oaths are worthless You swore an oath to Aerys

You haven’t cooked anyone in their armor so far as I know And we both want me safe and whole in King’s Landing don’t we He squatted beside Cleos and began to undo his swordbelt

Step away from him Now Stop that

Jaime was tired Tired of her suspicions tired of her insults tired of her crooked teeth and her broad spotty face and that limp thin hair of hers Ignoring her protests he grasped the hilt of his cousin’s longsword with both hands held the corpse down with his foot and pulled As the blade slid from the scabbard he was already pivoting bringing the sword around and up in a swift deadly arc Steel met steel with a ringing bone-jarring clang Somehow Brienne had gotten her own blade out in time Jaime laughed Very good wench

Give me the sword Kingslayer

Oh I will He sprang to his feet and drove at her the longsword alive in his hands Brienne jumped back parrying but he followed pressing the attack No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was upon her The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again Jaime’s blood was singing This was what he was meant for he never felt so alive as when he was fighting with death balanced on every stroke And with my wrists chained together the wench may even give me a contest for a time His chains forced him to use a two-handed grip though of course the weight and reach were less than if the blade had been a true two-handed greatsword but what did it matter His cousin’s sword was long enough to write an end to this Brienne of Tarth

High low overhand he rained down steel upon her Left right backslash swinging so hard that sparks flew when the swords came together upswing sideslash overhand always attacking moving into her step and slide strike and step step and strike hacking slashing faster faster faster…

…until breathless he stepped back and let the point of the sword fall to the ground giving her a moment of respite Not half bad he acknowledged For a wench

She took a slow deep breath her eyes watching him warily I would not hurt you Kingslayer

As if you could He whirled the blade back up above his head and flew at her again chains rattling

Jaime could not have said how long he pressed the attack It might have been minutes or it might have been hours time slept when swords woke He drove her away from his cousin’s corpse drove her across the road drove her into the trees She stumbled once on a root she never saw and for a moment he thought she was done but she went to one knee instead of falling and never lost a beat Her sword leapt up to block a downcut that would have opened her from shoulder to groin and then she cut at him again and again fighting her way back to her feet stroke by stroke

The dance went on He pinned her against an oak cursed as she slipped away followed her through a shallow brook half-choked with fallen leaves Steel rang steel sang steel screamed and sparked and scraped and the woman started grunting like a sow at every crash yet somehow he could not reach her It was as if she had an iron cage around her that stopped every blow

Not bad at all he said when he paused for a second to catch his breath circling to her right

For a wench

For a squire say A green one He laughed a ragged breathless laugh Come on come on my sweetling the music’s still playing Might I have this dance my lady

Grunting she came at him blade whirling and suddenly it was Jaime struggling to keep steel from skin One of her slashes raked across his brow and blood ran down into his right eye The Others take her and Riverrun as well His skills had gone to rust and rot in that bloody dungeon and the chains were no great help either His eye closed his shoulders were going numb from the jarring they’d taken and his wrists ached from the weight of chains manacles and sword His longsword grew heavier with every blow and Jaime knew he was not swinging it as quickly as he’d done earlier nor raising it as high

She is stronger than I am

The realization chilled him Robert had been stronger than him to be sure The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well in his heyday and Ser Arthur Dayne Amongst the living Greatjon Umber was stronger Strongboar of Crakehall most likely both Cleganes for a certainty The Mountain’s strength was like nothing human It did not matter With speed and skill Jaime could beat them all But this was a woman A huge cow of a woman to be sure but even so… by rights she should be the one wearing down

Instead she forced him back into the brook again shouting Yield Throw down the sword

A slick stone turned under Jaime’s foot As he felt himself falling he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge His point scraped past her parry and bit into her upper thigh A red flower blossomed and Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood before his knee slammed into a rock The pain was blinding Brienne splashed into him and kicked away his sword YIELD

Jaime drove his shoulder into her legs bringing her down on top of him They rolled kicking and punching until finally she was sitting astride him He managed to jerk her dagger from its sheath but before he could plunge it into her belly she caught his wrist and slammed his hands back on a rock so hard he thought she’d wrenched an arm from its socket Her other hand spread across his face Yield She shoved his head down held it under pulled it up Yield Jaime spit water into her face A shove a splash and he was under again kicking uselessly fighting to breathe Up again Yield or I’ll drown you

And break your oath he snarled Like me

She let him go and he went down with a splash

And the woods rang with coarse laughter

Brienne lurched to her feet She was all mud and blood below the waist her clothing askew her face red She looks as if they caught us fucking instead of fighting Jaime crawled over the rocks to shallow water wiping the blood from his eye with his chained hands Armed men lined both sides of the brook Small wonder we were making enough noise to wake a dragon Well met friends he called to them amiably My pardons if I disturbed you You caught me chastising my wife

Seemed to me she was doing the chastising The man who spoke was thick and powerful and the nasal bar of his iron halfhelm did not wholly conceal his lack of a nose

These were not the outlaws who had killed Ser Cleos Jaime realized suddenly The scum of the earth surrounded them swarthy Dornishmen and blond Lyseni Dothraki with bells in their braids hairy Ibbenese coal-black Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks He knew them The Brave Companions

Brienne found her voice I have a hundred stags—

A cadaverous man in a tattered leather cloak said We’ll take that for a start m’lady

Then we’ll have your cunt said the noseless man It can’t be as ugly as the rest of you

Turn her over and rape her arse Rorge urged a Dornish spearman with a red silk scarf wound about his helm That way you won’t need to look at her

And rob her o’ the pleasure o’ looking at me noseless said and the others laughed

Ugly and stubborn though she might be the wench deserved better than to be gang raped by such refuse as these Who commands here Jaime demanded loudly

I have that honor Ser Jaime The cadaver’s eyes were rimmed in red his hair thin and dry Dark blue veins could be seen through the pallid skin of his hands and face Urswyck I am Called Urswyck the Faithful

You know who I am

The sellsword inclined his head it takes more than a beard and a shaved head to deceive the Brave Companions

The Bloody Mummers you mean Jaime had no more use for these than he did for Gregor Clegane or Amory Lorch Dogs his father called them all and he used them like dogs to hound his prey and put fear in their hearts If you know me Urswyck you know you’ll have your reward A Lannister always pays his debts As for the wench she’s highborn and worth a good ransom
