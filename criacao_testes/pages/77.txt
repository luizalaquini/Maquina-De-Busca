I was she answered standing over the dragon’s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed She touched one the largest of the three running her hand lightly over the shelf Black-and-scarlet she thought like the dragon in my dream The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers… or was she still dreaming She pulled her hand back nervously

From that hour onward each day was easier than the one before it Her legs grew stronger her blisters burst and her hands grew callused her soft thighs toughened supple as leather

The khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion but it was the filly who was her real teacher The horse seemed to know her moods as if they shared a single mind With every passing day Dany felt surer in her seat The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people and it was not their custom to name their animals so Dany thought of her only as the silver She had never loved anything so much

As the riding became less an ordeal Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant

They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous camped beside a high blue waterfall skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns They raced down Valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow For half a moon they rode through the Forest of Qohor where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates There were great elk in that wood and spotted tigers and lemurs with silver fur and huge purple eyes but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no glimpse of them

By then her agony was a fading memory She still ached after a long day’s riding yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now and each morning she came willingly to her saddle eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead She began to find pleasure even in her nights and if she still cried out when Drogo took her it was not always in pain

At the bottom of the ridge the grasses rose around her tall and supple Dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain losing herself in the green blessedly alone In the khalasar she was never alone Khal Drogo came to her only after the sun went down but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent Drogo’s bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far and her brother was an unwelcome shadow day and night Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah She rode on submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea

The green swallowed her up The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass mixed with the smell of horseflesh and Dany’s sweat and the oil in her hair Dothraki smells They seemed to belong here Dany breathed it all in laughing She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her to curl her toes in that thick black soil Swinging down from her saddle she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots

Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard You dare he screamed at her You give commands to me To me He vaulted off the horse stumbling as he landed His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet He grabbed her shook her Have you forgotten who you are Look at you Look at you

Dany did not need to look She was barefoot with oiled hair wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift She looked as though she belonged here Viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail

He was still screaming You do not command the dragon Do you understand I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms I will not hear orders from some horselord’s slut do you hear me His hand went under her vest his fingers digging painfully into her breast Do you hear me

Dany shoved him away hard

Viserys stared at her his lilac eyes incredulous She had never defied him Never fought back Rage twisted his features He would hurt her now and badly she knew that

Crack

The whip made a sound like thunder The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him backward He went sprawling in the grass stunned and choking The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself The one with the whip young Jhogo rasped a question Dany did not understand his words but by then Irri was there and Ser Jorah and the rest of her khas Jhogo asks if you would have him dead Khaleesi Irri said

No Dany replied No

Jhogo understood that One of the others barked out a comment and the Dothraki laughed Irri told her Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect

Her brother was on his knees his fingers digging under the leather coils crying incoherently struggling for breath The whip was tight around his windpipe

Tell them I do not wish him harmed Dany said

Irri repeated her words in Dothraki Jhogo gave a pull on the whip yanking Viserys around like a puppet on a string He went sprawling again freed from the leather embrace a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep

I warned him what would happen my lady Ser Jorah Mormont said I told him to stay on the ridge as you commanded

I know you did Dany replied watching Viserys He lay on the ground sucking in air noisily red-faced and sobbing He was a pitiful thing He had always been a pitiful thing Why had she never seen that before There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been

Take his horse Dany commanded Ser Jorah Viserys gaped at her He could not believe what he was hearing nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying Yet the words came Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar Among the Dothraki the man who does not ride was no man at all the lowest of the low without honor or pride Let everyone see him as he is

No Viserys screamed He turned to Ser Jorah pleading in the Common Tongue with words the horsemen would not understand Hit her Mormont Hurt her Your king commands it Kill these Dothraki dogs and teach her

The exile knight looked from Dany to her brother she barefoot with dirt between her toes and oil in her hair he with his silks and steel Dany could see the decision on his face He shall walk Khaleesi he said He took her brother’s horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver

Viserys gaped at him and sat down in the dirt He kept his silence but he would not move and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away Soon he was lost in the tall grass When they could not see him anymore Dany grew afraid Will he find his way back she asked Ser Jorah as they rode

Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail he replied
