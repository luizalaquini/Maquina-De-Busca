year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations it
is most holy unto the LORD

3011 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3012 When thou takest
the sum of the children of Israel after their number then shall they
give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD when thou
numberest them that there be no plague among them when thou
numberest them

3013 This they shall give every one that passeth among them that are
numbered half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary a shekel
is twenty gerahs an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD

3014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered from twenty
years old and above shall give an offering unto the LORD

3015 The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less
than half a shekel when they give an offering unto the LORD to make
an atonement for your souls

3016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
Israel and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel
before the LORD to make an atonement for your souls

3017 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3018 Thou shalt also
make a laver of brass and his foot also of brass to wash withal and
thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the
altar and thou shalt put water therein

3019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
thereat 3020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation
they shall wash with water that they die not or when they come near
to the altar to minister to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD
3021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die
not and it shall be a statute for ever to them even to him and to
his seed throughout their generations

3022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3023 Take thou also
unto thee principal spices of pure myrrh five hundred shekels and of
sweet cinnamon half so much even two hundred and fifty shekels and
of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels 3024 And of cassia
five hundred shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary and of oil
olive an hin 3025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment an
ointment compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be an holy
anointing oil

3026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
therewith and the ark of the testimony 3027 And the table and all
his vessels and the candlestick and his vessels and the altar of
incense 3028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels
and the laver and his foot

3029 And thou shalt sanctify them that they may be most holy
whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy

3030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them
that they may minister unto me in the priests office

3031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel saying This
shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations

3032 Upon mans flesh shall it not be poured neither shall ye make
any other like it after the composition of it it is holy and it
shall be holy unto you

3033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it or whosoever putteth any of
it upon a stranger shall even be cut off from his people

3034 And the LORD said unto Moses Take unto thee sweet spices
stacte and onycha and galbanum these sweet spices with pure
frankincense of each shall there be a like weight 3035 And thou
shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apothecary
tempered together pure and holy 3036 And thou shalt beat some of it
very small and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of
the congregation where I will meet with thee it shall be unto you
most holy

3037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make ye shall not make
to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto
thee holy for the LORD

3038 Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto shall
even be cut off from his people

311 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 312 See I have called by
name Bezaleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah
313 And I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in
understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship
314 To devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in
brass 315 And in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of
timber to work in all manner of workmanship

316 And I behold I have given with him Aholiab the son of
Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all that are wise
hearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I have
commanded thee 317 The tabernacle of the congregation and the ark
of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the
furniture of the tabernacle 318 And the table and his furniture and
the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense
