Eddard Stark had left before dawn Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast The king sent for him Another hunt I do believe There are still wild aurochs in these lands I am told

I’ve never seen an aurochs Sansa said feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table The direwolf took it from her hand as delicate as a queen

Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table she said breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread

She’s not a dog she’s a direwolf Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue Anyway Father said we could keep them with us if we want

The septa was not appeased You’re a good girl Sansa but I do vow when it comes to that creature you’re as willful as your sister Arya She scowled And where is Arya this morning

She wasn’t hungry Sansa said knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook’s boy

Do remind her to dress nicely today The grey velvet perhaps We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse and we must look our best

Sansa already looked her best She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone and picked her nicest blue silks She had been looking forward to today for more than a week It was a great honor to ride with the queen and besides Prince Joffrey might be there Her betrothed Just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside even though they were not to marry for years and years Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet but she was already in love with him He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be tall and handsome and strong with hair like gold She treasured every chance to spend time with him few as they were The only thing that scared her about today was Arya Arya had a way of ruining everything You never knew what she would do I’ll tell her Sansa said uncertainly but she’ll dress the way she always does She hoped it wouldn’t be too embarrassing May I be excused

You may Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey and Sansa slid from the bench Lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn’s common room

Outside she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day’s march The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone the biggest that Sansa had ever seen but even so it had accommodations for less than a third of the king’s party which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her father’s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road

She found Arya on the banks of the Trident trying to hold Nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur The direwolf was not enjoying the process Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before

You better put on something pretty Sansa told her Septa Mordane said so We’re traveling in the queen’s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today

I’m not Arya said trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria’s matted grey fur Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford

Rubies Sansa said lost What rubies

Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid Rhaegar’s rubies This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown

Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief You can’t look for rubies the princess is expecting us The queen invited us both

I don’t care Arya said The wheelhouse doesn’t even have windows you can’t see a thing

What could you want to see Sansa said annoyed She had been thrilled by the invitation and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything just as she’d feared It’s all just fields and farms and holdfasts

It is not Arya said stubbornly If you came with us sometimes you’d see

I hate riding Sansa said fervently All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore

Arya shrugged Hold still she snapped at Nymeria I’m not hurting you Then to Sansa she said When we were crossing the Neck I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion

Sansa shuddered They had been twelve days crossing the Neck rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog and she had hated every moment of it The air had been damp and clammy the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night they had to stop right on the kingsroad Dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them there were quicksands waiting to suck you down and snakes watching from the trees and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water like black logs with eyes and teeth

None of which stopped Arya of course One day she came back grinning her horsey grin her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be but he never did he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers That just made her worse

Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses and Arya got a rash on her arms Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson but Arya laughed about it and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep How she had gotten those only the seven gods knew

Arya was still going on brushing out Nymeria’s tangles and chattering about things she’d seen on the trek south Last week we found this haunted watchtower and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her Stop that I have to do the other side you’re all muddy

You’re not supposed to leave the column Sansa reminded her Father said so

Arya shrugged I didn’t go far Anyway Nymeria was with me the whole time I don’t always go off either Sometimes it’s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people

Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to squires and grooms and serving girls old men and naked children rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth Arya would make friends with anybody This Mycah was the worst a butcher’s boy thirteen and wild he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers

Sansa was running out of patience now You have to come with me she told her sister firmly You can’t refuse the queen Septa Mordane will expect you

Arya ignored her She gave a hard yank with the brush Nymeria growled and spun away affronted Come back here

There’s going to be lemon cakes and tea Sansa went on all adult and reasonable Lady brushed against her leg Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked and Lady sat beside her on her haunches watching Arya chase Nymeria Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen

I don’t like the queen Arya said casually Sansa sucked in her breath shocked that even Arya would say such a thing but her sister prattled on heedless She won’t even let me bring Nymeria She thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf Nymeria watched her approach warily

A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf Sansa said And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them you know that

Myrcella is a little baby Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off Frustrated Arya threw down the brush Bad wolf she shouted

Sansa couldn’t help but smile a little The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master She gave Lady a quick little hug Lady licked her cheek Sansa giggled Arya heard and whirled around glaring I don’t care what you say I’m going out riding Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful

Gods be true Arya sometimes you act like such a child Sansa said I’ll go by myself then It will be ever so much nicer that way Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you

She turned to walk off but Arya shouted after her They won’t let you bring Lady either She was gone before Sansa could think of a reply chasing Nymeria along the river

Alone and humiliated Sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew Septa Mordane would be waiting Lady padded quietly by her side She was almost in tears All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs Why couldn’t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind like Princess Myrcella She would have liked a sister like that

Sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard like their half brother Jon She even looked like Jon with the long face and brown hair of the Starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring And Jon’s mother had been common or so people whispered Once when she was littler Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn’t been some mistake Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister But Mother had only laughed and said no Arya was her daughter and Sansa’s trueborn sister blood of their blood Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true

As she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten A crowd had gathered around the queen’s wheelhouse Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees The doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone She heard her saying The council does us great honor my good lords

What’s happening she asked a squire she knew

The council sent riders from King’s Landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her An honor guard for the king

Anxious to see Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd People moved aside hastily for the direwolf When she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink

One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun When he removed his helm Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard

His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold

At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger He did not kneel with the others He stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence His face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks Though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a woman’s His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a two-handed greatsword too long to be worn at his side

The king is gone hunting but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze Slowly he turned his head Lady growled A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly She stepped backward and bumped into someone

Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile You are shaking girl he said his voice rasping Do I frighten you so much

He did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other Still Sansa wrenched away from him and the Hound laughed and Lady moved between them rumbling a warning Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf They were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter

A wolf a man said and someone else said Seven hells that’s a direwolf and the first man said What’s it doing in camp and the Hound’s rasping voice replied The Starks use them for wet nurses and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed Tears filled her eyes
