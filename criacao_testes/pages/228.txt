Micah with me and hath hired me and I am his priest

185 And they said unto him Ask counsel we pray thee of God that
we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous

186 And the priest said unto them Go in peace before the LORD is
your way wherein ye go

187 Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people
that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the
Zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land
that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the
Zidonians and had no business with any man

188 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol and their
brethren said unto them What say ye  189 And they said Arise that
we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it
is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to
possess the land

1810 When ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large
land for God hath given it into your hands a place where there is no
want of any thing that is in the earth

1811 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites out of
Zorah and out of Eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of
war

1812 And they went up and pitched in Kirjathjearim in Judah
wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day behold it
is behind Kirjathjearim

1813 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim and came unto the
house of Micah

1814 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
Laish and said unto their brethren Do ye know that there is in these
houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image
now therefore consider what ye have to do

1815 And they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young
man the Levite even unto the house of Micah and saluted him

1816 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war
which were of the children of Dan stood by the entering of the gate

1817 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came
in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the
teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering
of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons
of war

1818 And these went into Micahs house and fetched the carved image
the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image Then said the
priest unto them What do ye  1819 And they said unto him Hold thy
peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a
father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the
house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family
in Israel  1820 And the priests heart was glad and he took the
ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst
of the people

1821 So they turned and departed and put the little ones and the
cattle and the carriage before them

1822 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah the men
that were in the houses near to Micahs house were gathered together
and overtook the children of Dan

1823 And they cried unto the children of Dan And they turned their
faces and said unto Micah What aileth thee that thou comest with
such a company  1824 And he said Ye have taken away my gods which I
made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have I more and
what is this that ye say unto me What aileth thee  1825 And the
children of Dan said unto him Let not thy voice be heard among us
lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the
lives of thy household

1826 And the children of Dan went their way and when Micah saw that
they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house

1827 And they took the things which Micah had made and the priest
which he had and came unto Laish unto a people that were at quiet
and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt
the city with fire

1828 And there was no deliverer because it was far from Zidon and
they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth
by Bethrehob And they built a city and dwelt therein

1829 And they called the name of the city Dan after the name of Dan
their father who was born unto Israel howbeit the name of the city
was Laish at the first

1830 And the children of Dan set up the graven image and Jonathan
the son of Gershom the son of Manasseh he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land

1831 And they set them up Micahs graven image which he made all
the time that the house of God was in Shiloh
