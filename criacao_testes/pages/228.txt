I will stay Dany said The man took me under the stars and gave life to the child inside me I will not leave him

You must Once I begin to sing no one must enter this tent My song will wake powers old and dark The dead will dance here this night No living man must look on them

Dany bowed her head helpless No one will enter She bent over the tub over Drogo in his bath of blood and kissed him lightly on the brow Bring him back to me she whispered to Mirri Maz Duur before she fled

Outside the sun was low on the horizon the sky a bruised red The khalasar had made camp Tents and sleeping mats were scattered as far as the eye could see A hot wind blew Jhogo and Aggo were digging a firepit to burn the dead stallion A crowd had gathered to stare at Dany with hard black eyes their faces like masks of beaten copper She saw Ser Jorah Mormont wearing mail and leather now sweat beading on his broad balding forehead He pushed his way through the Dothraki to Dany’s side When he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the ground the color seemed to drain from his face What have you done you little fool he asked hoarsely

I had to save him

We could have fled he said I would have seen you safe to Asshai Princess There was no need…

Am I truly your princess she asked him

You know you are gods save us both

Then help me now

Ser Jorah grimaced Would that I knew how

Mirri Maz Duur’s voice rose to a high ululating wail that sent a shiver down Dany’s back Some of the Dothraki began to mutter and back away The tent was aglow with the light of braziers within Through the blood-spattered sandsilk she glimpsed shadows moving

Mirri Maz Duur was dancing and not alone

Dany saw naked fear on the faces of the Dothraki This must not be Qotho thundered

She had not seen the bloodrider return Haggo and Cohollo were with him They had brought the hairless men the eunuchs who healed with knife and needle and fire

This will be Dany replied

Maegi Haggo growled And old Cohollo—Cohollo who had bound his life to Drogo’s on the day of his birth Cohollo who had always been kind to her—Cohollo spat full in her face

You will die maegi Qotho promised but the other must die first He drew his arakh and made for the tent

No she shouted you mustn’t She caught him by the shoulder but Qotho shoved her aside Dany fell to her knees crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within Stop him she commanded her khas kill him

Rakharo and Quaro stood beside the tent flap Quaro took a step forward reaching for the handle of his whip but Qotho spun graceful as a dancer the curved arakh rising It caught Quaro low under the arm the bright sharp steel biting up through leather and skin through muscle and rib bone Blood fountained as the young rider reeled backward gasping

Qotho wrenched the blade free Horselord Ser Jorah Mormont called Try me His longsword slid from its scabbard

Qotho whirled cursing The arakh moved so fast that Quaro’s blood flew from it in a fine spray like rain in a hot wind The longsword caught it a foot from Ser Jorah’s face and held it quivering for an instant as Qotho howled in fury The knight was clad in chainmail with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and a heavy gorget around his throat but he had not thought to don his helm

Qotho danced backward arakh whirling around his head in a shining blur flickering out like lightning as the knight came on in a rush Ser Jorah parried as best he could but the slashes came so fast that it seemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms She heard the crunch of sword on mail saw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet Suddenly it was Mormont stumbling backward and Qotho leaping to the attack The left side of the knight’s face ran red with blood and a cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping Qotho screamed taunts at him calling him a craven a milk man a eunuch in an iron suit You die now he promised arakh shivering through the red twilight Inside Dany’s womb her son kicked wildly The curved blade slipped past the straight one and bit deep into the knight’s hip where the mail gaped open

Mormont grunted stumbled Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly a wetness on her thighs Qotho shrieked triumph but his arakh had found bone and for half a heartbeat it caught

It was enough Ser Jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left him through flesh and muscle and bone and Qotho’s forearm dangled loose flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew The knight’s next cut was at the Dothraki’s ear so savage that Qotho’s face seemed almost to explode

The Dothraki were shouting Mirri Maz Duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human Quaro pleading for water as he died Dany cried out for help but no one heard Rakharo was fighting Haggo arakh dancing with arakh until Jhogo’s whip cracked loud as thunder the lash coiling around Haggo’s throat A yank and the bloodrider stumbled backward losing his feet and his sword Rakharo sprang forward howling swinging his arakh down with both hands through the top of Haggo’s head The point caught between his eyes red and quivering Someone threw a stone and when Dany looked her shoulder was torn and bloody No she wept no please stop it it’s too high the price is too high More stones came flying She tried to crawl toward the tent but Cohollo caught her Fingers in her hair he pulled her head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat My baby she screamed and perhaps the gods heard for as quick as that Cohollo was dead Aggo’s arrow took him under the arm to pierce his lungs and heart

When at last Daenerys found the strength to raise her head she saw the crowd dispersing the Dothraki stealing silently back to their tents and sleeping mats Some were saddling horses and riding off The sun had set Fires burned throughout the khalasar great orange blazes that crackled with fury and spit embers at the sky She tried to rise and agony seized her and squeezed her like a giant’s fist The breath went out of her it was all she could do to gasp The sound of Mirri Maz Duur’s voice was like a funeral dirge Inside the tent the shadows whirled

An arm went under her waist and then Ser Jorah was lifting her off her feet His face was sticky with blood and Dany saw that half his ear was gone She convulsed in his arms as the pain took her again and heard the knight shouting for her handmaids to help him Are they all so afraid She knew the answer Another pain grasped her and Dany bit back a scream It felt as if her son had a knife in each hand as if he were hacking at her to cut his way out Doreah curse you Ser Jorah roared Come here Fetch the birthing women
