It is a fact that if a periodic function has one or more discontinuities its frequency
spectrum will decay at sufficiently high frequencies at the rate of 6 dBoctave
For example the components of the square wave

However if the discontinuities are ones of slope only then the asymptotic decay
at high frequencies is 12 dBoctave  Thus the glottal excitation of Figure 52
will decay at this rate
Note that it is not the
ul
number
but the
ul
type
of discontinuities which are important in determining the asymptotic spectral
trend
rh Voiced excitation in synthetic speech
There are several ways that glottal excitation can be simulated in a synthesizer
four of which are shown in Figure 53
FC Figure 53
The square pulse and the sawtooth pulse
both exhibit discontinuities and so will have the wrong asymptotic rate of
decay 6 dBoctave instead of 12 dBoctave  A better bet is the triangular
pulse  This has the correct decay for there are only discontinuities of slope
However although the asymptotic rate of decay is of first importance the fine
structure of the frequency spectrum at the lower end is also significant and
the fact that there are two discontinuities of slope instead of just one in the
natural waveform means that the spectra cannot match closely

Rosenberg 1971 has investigated several different shapes using listening
tests and he found that the polynomial approximation sketched in Figure 53
was preferred by listeners

It is easy to see that the joins between the first and second section and
between the second and third section are smooth but that the slope of the third
