Me too The Hound eased his dagger into the man’s chest almost tenderly the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat ringmail and the quilting beneath As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man he looked at Arya That’s where the heart is girl That’s how you kill a man

That’s one way Will we bury him

Why Sandor said He don’t care and we’ve got no spade Leave him for the wolves and wild dogs Your brothers and mine He gave her a hard look First we rob him though

There were two silver stags in the archer’s purse and almost thirty coppers His dagger had a pretty pink stone in the hilt The Hound hefted the knife in his hand then flipped it toward Arya She caught it by the hilt slid it through her belt and felt a little better It wasn’t Needle but it was steel The dead man had a quiver of arrows too but arrows weren’t much good without a bow His boots were too big for Arya and too small for the Hound so those they left She took his kettle helm as well even though it came down almost past her nose so she had to tilt it back to see He must have had a horse as well or he wouldn’t have got away Clegane said peering about but it’s bloody well gone I’d say No telling how long he’s been here

By the time they found themselves in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon the rains had mostly stopped Arya could see the sun and moon and stars and it seemed to her that they were heading eastward Where are we going she asked again

This time the Hound answered her You have an aunt in the Eyrie Might be she’ll want to ransom your scrawny arse though the gods know why Once we find the high road we can follow it all the way to the Bloody Gate

Aunt Lysa The thought left Arya feeling empty It was her mother she wanted not her mother’s sister She didn’t know her mother’s sister any more than she knew her great uncle Blackfish We should have gone into the castle They didn’t really know that her mother was dead or Robb either It wasn’t like they’d seen them die or anything Maybe Lord Frey had just taken them captive Maybe they were chained up in his dungeon or maybe the Freys were taking them to King’s Landing so Joffrey could chop their heads off They didn’t know We should go back she suddenly decided We should go back to the Twins and get my mother She can’t be dead We have to help her

I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs the Hound growled Frey might have kept your mother alive to ransom that’s true But there’s no way in seven hells I’m going to pluck her out of his castle all by my bloody self

Not by yourself I’d come too

He made a sound that was almost a laugh That will scare the piss out of the old man

You’re just afraid to die she said scornfully

Now Clegane did laugh Death don’t scare me Only fire Now be quiet or I’ll cut your tongue out myself and save the silent sisters the bother It’s the Vale for us

Arya didn’t think he’d really cut her tongue out he was just saying that the way Pinkeye used to say he’d beat her bloody All the same she wasn’t going to try him Sandor Clegane was no Pinkeye Pinkeye didn’t cut people in half or hit them with axes Not even with the flat of axes

That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself When she closed her eyes she saw her mother’s face against the back of her eyelids She’s so close I could almost smell her   

   and then she could smell her The scent was faint beneath the other smells beneath moss and mud and water and the stench of rotting reeds and rotting men She padded slowly through the soft ground to the river’s edge lapped up a drink the lifted her head to sniff The sky was grey and thick with cloud the river green and full of floating things Dead men clogged the shallows some still moving as the water pushed them others washed up on the banks Her brothers and sisters swarmed around them tearing at the rich ripe flesh

The crows were there too screaming at the wolves and filling the air with feathers Their blood was hotter and one of her sisters had snapped at one as it took flight and caught it by the wing It made her want a crow herself She wanted to taste the blood to hear the bones crunch between her teeth to fill her belly with warm flesh instead of cold She was hungry and the meat was all around but she knew she could not eat

The scent was stronger now She pricked her ears up and listened to the grumbles of her pack the shriek of angry crows the whirr of wings and sound of running water Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men but they were not what mattered Only the scent mattered She sniffed the air again There it was and now she saw it too something pale and white drifting down the river turning where it brushed against a snag The reeds bowed down before it

She splashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water her legs churning The current was strong but she was stronger She swam following her nose The river smells were rich and wet but those were not the smells that pulled her She paddled after the sharp red whisper of cold blood the sweet cloying stench of death She chased them as she had often chased a red deer through the trees and in the end she ran them down and her jaw closed around a pale white arm She shook it to make it move but there was only death and blood in her mouth By now she was tiring and it was all she could do to pull the body back to shore As she dragged it up the muddy bank one of her little brothers came prowling his tongue lolling from his mouth She had to snarl to drive him off or else he would have fed Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur The white thing lay facedown in the mud her dead flesh wrinkled and pale cold blood trickling from her throat Rise she thought Rise and eat and run with us

The sound of horses turned her head Men They were coming from downwind so she had not smelled them but now they were almost here Men on horses with flapping black and yellow and pink wings and long shiny claws in hand Some of her younger brothers bared their teeth to defend the food they’d found but she snapped at them until they scattered That was the way of the wild Deer and hares and crows fled before wolves and wolves fled from men She abandoned the cold white prize in the mud where she had dragged it and ran and felt no shame

When morning came the Hound did not need to shout at Arya or shake her awake She had woken before him for a change and even watered the horses They broke their fast in silence until Sandor said This thing about your mother   

It doesn’t matter Arya said in a dull voice I know she’s dead I saw her in a dream

The Hound looked at her a long time then nodded No more was said of it They rode on toward the mountains

In the higher hills they came upon a tiny isolated village surrounded by grey-green sentinels and tall blue soldier pines and Clegane decided to risk going in We need food he said and a roof over our heads They’re not like to know what happened at the Twins and with any luck they won’t know me

The villagers were building a wooden palisade around their homes and when they saw the breadth of the Hound’s shoulders they offered them food and shelter and even coin for work If there’s wine as well I’ll do it he growled at them In the end he settled for ale and drank himself to sleep each night

His dream of selling Arya to Lady Arryn died there in the hills though There’s frost above us and snow in the high passes the village elder said If you don’t freeze or starve the shadowcats will get you or the cave bears There’s the clans as well The Burned Men are fearless since Timett One-Eye came back from the war And half a year ago Gunthor son of Gurn led the Stone Crows down on a village not eight miles from here They took every woman and every scrap of grain and killed half the men They have steel now good swords and mail hauberks and they watch the high road—the Stone Crows the Milk Snakes the Sons of the Mist all of them Might be you’d take a few with you but in the end they’d kill you and make off with your daughter

I’m not his daughter Arya might have shouted if she hadn’t felt so tired She was no one’s daughter now She was no one Not Arya not Weasel not Nan nor Arry nor Squab not even Lumpyhead She was only some girl who ran with a dog by day and dreamed of wolves by night

It was quiet in the village They had beds stuffed with straw and not too many lice the food was plain but filling and the air smelled of pines All the same Arya soon decided that she hated it The villagers were cowards None of them would even look at the Hound’s face at least not for long Some of the women tried to put her in a dress and make her do needlework but they weren’t Lady Smallwood and she was having none of it And there was one girl who took to following her the village elder’s daughter She was of an age with Arya but just a child she cried if she skinned a knee and carried a stupid cloth doll with her everywhere she went The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms sort of so the girl called him Ser Soldier and bragged how he kept her safe Go away Arya told her half a hundred times Just leave me be She wouldn’t though so finally Arya took the doll away from her ripped it open and pulled the rag stuffing out of its belly with a finger Now he really looks like a soldier she said before she threw the doll in a brook After that the girl stopped pestering her and Arya spent her days grooming Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods Sometimes she would find a stick and practice her needlework but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree until it broke

Might be we should stay here awhile the Hound told her after a fortnight He was drunk on ale but more brooding than sleepy We’d never reach the Eyrie and the Freys will still be hunting survivors in the riverlands Sounds like they need swords here with these clansmen raiding We can rest up maybe find a way to get a letter to your aunt Arya’s face darkened when she heard that She didn’t want to stay but there was nowhere to go either The next morning when the Hound went off to chop down trees and haul logs she crawled back into bed

But when the work was done and the tall wooden palisade was finished the village elder made it plain that there was no place for them Come winter we will be hard pressed to feed our own he explained And you    a man like you brings blood with him

Sandor’s mouth tightened So you do know who I am

Aye We don’t get travelers here that’s so but we go to market and to fairs We know about King Joffrey’s dog

When these Stone Crows come calling you might be glad to have a dog

Might be The man hesitated then gathered up his courage But they say you lost your belly for fighting at the Blackwater They say—

I know what they say Sandor’s voice sounded like two woodsaws grinding together Pay me and we’ll be gone

When they left the Hound had a pouch full of coppers a skin of sour ale and a new sword It was a very old sword if truth be told though new to him He swapped its owner the longaxe he’d taken at the Twins the one he’d used to raise the lump on Arya’s head The ale was gone in less than a day but Clegane sharpened the sword every night cursing the man he’d swapped with for every nick and spot of rust If he lost his belly for fighting why does he care if his sword is sharp It was not a question Arya dared ask him but she thought on it a lot Was that why he’d run from the Twins and carried her off

Back in the riverlands they found that the rains had ebbed away and the flood waters had begun to recede The Hound turned south back toward the Trident We’ll make for Riverrun he told Arya as they roasted a hare he’d killed Maybe the Blackfish wants to buy himself a she-wolf

He doesn’t know me He won’t even know I’m really me Arya was tired of making for Riverrun She had been making for Riverrun for years it seemed without ever getting there Every time she made for Riverrun she ended up someplace worse He won’t give you any ransom He’ll probably just hang you

He’s free to try He turned the spit

He doesn’t talk like he’s lost his belly for fighting I know where we could go Arya said She still had one brother left Jon will want me even if no one else does He’ll call me little sister and muss my hair It was a long way though and she didn’t think she could get there by herself She hadn’t even been able to reach Riverrun We could go to the Wall

Sandor’s laugh was half a growl The little wolf bitch wants to join the Night’s Watch does she

My brother’s on the Wall she said stubbornly

His mouth gave a twitch The Wall’s a thousand leagues from here We’d need to fight through the bloody Freys just to reach the Neck There’s lizard lions in those swamps that eat wolves every day for breakfast And if we did reach the north with our skins intact there’s ironborn in half the castles and thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well

Are you scared of them she asked Have you lost your belly for fighting

For a moment she thought he was going to hit her By then the hare was brown though skin crackling and grease popping as it dripped down into the cookfire Sandor took it off the stick ripped it apart with his big hands and tossed half of it into Arya’s lap There’s nothing wrong with my belly he said as he pulled off a leg but I don’t give a rat’s arse for you or your brother I have a brother too





TYRION

Tyrion Ser Kevan Lannister said wearily if you are indeed innocent of Joffrey’s death you should have no difficulty proving it at trial

Tyrion turned from the window Who is to judge me

Justice belongs to the throne The king is dead but your father remains Hand Since it is his own son who stands accused and his grandson who was the victim he has asked Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn to sit in judgment with him
