Her brother’s face darkened For a moment she thought he was about to lose his temper with her but finally he snapped The godswood If you will insist

She followed him along a gallery to the godswood gate Edmure’s anger had always been a sulky sullen thing Catelyn was sorry she had wounded him but the matter was too important for her to concern herself with his pride When they were alone beneath the trees Edmure turned to face her

You do not have the strength to meet the Lannisters in the field she said bluntly

When all my strength is marshaled I should have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse Edmure said

Which means Lord Tywin will have near twice your numbers

Robb’s won his battles against worse odds Edmure replied and I have a plan You’ve forgotten Roose Bolton Lord Tywin defeated him on the Green Fork but failed to pursue When Lord Tywin went to Harrenhal Bolton took the ruby ford and the crossroads He has ten thousand men I’ve sent word to Helman Tallhart to join him with the garrison Robb left at the Twins—

Edmure Robb left those men to hold the Twins and make certain Lord Walder keeps faith with us

He has Edmure said stubbornly The Freys fought bravely in the Whispering Wood and old Ser Stevron died at Oxcross we hear Ser Ryman and Black Walder and the rest are with Robb in the west Martyn has been of great service scouting and Ser Perwyn helped see you safe to Renly Gods be good how much more can we ask of them Robb’s betrothed to one of Lord Walder’s daughters and Roose Bolton wed another I hear And haven’t you taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at Winterfell

A ward can easily become a hostage if need be She had not known that Ser Stevron was dead nor of Bolton’s marriage

If we’re two hostages to the good all the more reason Lord Walder dare not play us false Bolton needs Frey’s men and Ser Helman’s as well I’ve commanded him to retake Harrenhal

That’s like to be a bloody business

Yes but once the castle falls Lord Tywin will have no safe retreat My own levies will defend the fords of Red Fork against his crossing If he attacks across the river he’ll end as Rhaegar did when he tried to cross the Trident If he holds back he’ll be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal and when Robb returns from the west we can finish him for good and all

Her brother’s voice was full of brusque confidence but Catelyn found herself wishing that Robb had not taken her uncle Brynden west with him The Blackfish was the veteran of half a hundred battles Edmure was the veteran of one and that one lost

The plan’s a good one he concluded Lord Tytos says so and Lord Jonos as well When did Blackwood and Bracken agree about anything that was not certain I ask you

Be that as it may She was suddenly weary Perhaps she was wrong to oppose him Perhaps it was a splendid plan and her misgivings only a woman’s fears She wished Ned were here or her uncle Brynden or    Have you asked Father about this

Father is in no state to weigh strategies Two days ago he was making plans for your marriage to Brandon Stark Go see him yourself if you do not believe me This plan will work Cat you’ll see

I hope so Edmure I truly do She kissed him on the cheek to let him know she meant it and went to find her father

Lord Hoster Tully was much as she had left him—abed haggard flesh pale and clammy The room smelled of sickness a cloying odor made up in equal parts of stale sweat and medicine When she pulled back the drapes her father gave a low moan and his eyes fluttered open He stared at her as if he could not comprehend who she was or what she wanted

Father She kissed him I am returned

He seemed to know her then You’ve come he whispered faintly lips barely moving

Yes she said Robb sent me south but I hurried back

South    where    is the Eyrie south sweetling I don’t recall    oh dear heart I was afraid    have you forgiven me child Tears ran down his cheeks

You’ve done nothing that needs forgiveness Father She stroked his limp white hair and felt his brow The fever still burned him from within despite all the maester’s potions

It was best her father whispered Jon’s a good man good    strong kind    take care of you    he will    and well born listen to me you must I’m your father    your father    you’ll wed when Cat does yes you will   

He thinks I’m Lysa Catelyn realized Gods be good he talks as if we were not married yet

Her father’s hands clutched at hers fluttering like two frightened white birds That stripling    wretched boy    not speak that name to me your duty    your mother she would    Lord Hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over him Oh gods forgive me forgive me forgive me My medicine   

And then Maester Vyman was there holding a cup to his lips Lord Hoster sucked at the thick white potion as eager as a babe at the breast and Catelyn could see peace settle over him once more He’ll sleep now my lady the maester said when the cup was empty The milk of the poppy had left a thick white film around her father’s mouth Maester Vyman wiped it away with a sleeve

Catelyn could watch no more Hoster Tully had been a strong man and proud It hurt her to see him reduced to this She went out to the terrace The yard below was crowded with refugees and chaotic with their noises but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure and endless Those are his rivers and soon he will return to them for his last voyage

Maester Vyman had followed her out My lady he said softly I cannot keep the end at bay much longer We ought send a rider after his brother Ser Brynden would wish to be here

Yes Catelyn said her voice thick with her grief

And the Lady Lysa as well perhaps

Lysa will not come

If you wrote her yourself perhaps   

I will put some words to paper if that please you She wondered who Lysa’s wretched stripling had been Some young squire or hedge knight like as not    though by the vehemence with which Lord Hoster had opposed him he might have been a tradesman’s son or baseborn apprentice even a singer Lysa had always been too fond of singers I must not blame her Jon Arryn was twenty years older than our father however noble

The tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that she and Lysa had shared as maids It would feel good to sleep on a featherbed again with a warm fire in the hearth when she was rested the world would seem less bleak

But outside her chambers she found Utherydes Wayn waiting with two women clad in grey their faces cowled save for their eyes Catelyn knew at once why they were here Ned

The sisters lowered their gaze Utherydes said Ser Cleos brought him from King’s Landing my lady

Take me to him she commanded

They had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner the white banner of House Stark with its grey direwolf sigil I would look on him Catelyn said

Only the bones remain my lady

I would look on him she repeated

One of the silent sisters turned down the banner

Bones Catelyn thought This is not Ned this is not the man I loved the father of my children His hands were clasped together over his chest skeletal fingers curled about the hilt of some longsword but they were not Ned’s hands so strong and full of life They had dressed the bones in Ned’s surcoat the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the heart but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights the arms that had held her The head had been rejoined to the body with fine silver wire but one skull looks much like another and in those empty hollows she found no trace of her lord’s dark grey eyes eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone They gave his eyes to crows she remembered

Catelyn turned away That is not his sword

Ice was not returned to us my lady Utherydes said Only Lord Eddard’s bones

I suppose I must thank the queen for even that much

Thank the Imp my lady It was his doing

One day I will thank them all I am grateful for your service sisters Catelyn said but I must lay another task upon you Lord Eddard was a Stark and his bones must be laid to rest beneath Winterfell They will make a statue of him a stone likeness that will sit in the dark with a direwolf at his feet and a sword across his knees Make certain the sisters have fresh horses and aught else they need for the journey she told Utherydes Wayn Hal Mollen will escort them back to Winterfell it is his place as captain of guards She gazed down at the bones that were all that remained of her lord and love Now leave me all of you I would be alone with Ned tonight

The women in grey bowed their heads The silent sisters do not speak to the living Catelyn remembered dully but some say they can talk to the dead And how she envied that
