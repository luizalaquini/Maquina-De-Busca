2214 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of
the LORD shall fall therein

2215 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of
correction shall drive it far from him

2216 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that
giveth to the rich shall surely come to want

2217 Bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply
thine heart unto my knowledge

2218 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they
shall withal be fitted in thy lips

2219 That thy trust may be in the LORD I have made known to thee
this day even to thee

2220 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
knowledge 2221 That I might make thee know the certainty of the
words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
that send unto thee  2222 Rob not the poor because he is poor
neither oppress the afflicted in the gate 2223 For the LORD will
plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them

2224 Make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man
thou shalt not go 2225 Lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to
thy soul

2226 Be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are
sureties for debts

2227 If thou hast nothing to pay why should he take away thy bed
from under thee  2228 Remove not the ancient landmark which thy
fathers have set

2229 Seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before
kings he shall not stand before mean men

231 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what
is before thee 232 And put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man
given to appetite

233 Be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat

234 Labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom

235 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches
certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward
heaven

236 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither
desire thou his dainty meats 237 For as he thinketh in his heart so
is he Eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with
thee

238 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose
thy sweet words

239 Speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the wisdom
of thy words

2310 Remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of
the fatherless 2311 For their redeemer is mighty he shall plead
their cause with thee

2312 Apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words
of knowledge

2313 Withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him
with the rod he shall not die

2314 Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul
from hell

2315 My son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even
mine

2316 Yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things

2317 Let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the
LORD all the day long

2318 For surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be
cut off

2319 Hear thou my son and be wise and guide thine heart in the
way

2320 Be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh 2321
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness
shall clothe a man with rags

2322 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy
mother when she is old

2323 Buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction
and understanding

2324 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that
