The queen will never let you go never You are too valuable a hostage And Joffrey… sweetling he is still king If he wants you in his bed he will have you only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb instead of trueborn sons

No Sansa said shocked He let me go he…

Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear Be brave I swore to see you home and now I can The day has been chosen

When Sansa asked When will we go

The night of Joffrey’s wedding After the feast All the necessary arrangements have been made The Red Keep will be full of strangers Half the court will be drunk and the other half will be helping Joffrey bed his bride For a little while you will be forgotten and the confusion will be our friend

The wedding won’t be for a moon’s turn yet Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden they’ve only now sent for her

You’ve waited so long be patient awhile longer Here I have something for you Ser Dontos fumbled in his pouch and drew out a silvery spiderweb dangling it between his thick fingers It was a hair net of fine-spun silver the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took it in her fingers Small gems were set wherever two strands crossed so dark they drank the moonlight What stones are these

Black amethysts from Asshai The rarest kind a deep true purple by daylight

It’s very lovely Sansa said thinking It is a ship I need not a net for my hair

Lovelier than you know sweet child It’s magic you see It’s justice you hold It’s vengeance for your father Dontos leaned close and kissed her again It’s home





THEON

Maester Luwin came to him when the first scouts were seen outside the walls My lord prince he said you must yield

Theon stared at the platter of oakcakes honey and blood sausage they’d brought him to break his fast Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw and the very sight of food sickened him There has been no reply from my uncle

None the maester said Nor from your father on Pyke

Send more birds

It will not serve By the time the birds reach—

Send them Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm he pushed off the blankets and rose from Ned Stark’s bed naked and angry Or do you want me dead Is that it Luwin The truth now

The small grey man was unafraid My order serves

Yes but whom

The realm Maester Luwin said and Winterfell Theon once I taught you sums and letters history and warcraft And might have taught you more had you wished to learn I will not claim to bear you any great love no but I cannot hate you either Even if I did so long as you hold Winterfell I am bound by oath to give you counsel So now I counsel you to yield

Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor shook off the rushes and draped it over his shoulders A fire I’ll have a fire and clean garb Where’s Wex I’ll not go to my grave in dirty clothes

You have no hope of holding here the maester went on If your lord father meant to send you aid he would have done so by now It is the Neck that concerns him The battle for the north will be fought amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin

That may be so said Theon And so long as I hold Winterfell Ser Rodrik and Stark’s lords bannermen cannot march south to take my uncle in the rear I am not so innocent of warcraft as you think old man I have food enough to stand a year’s siege if need be

There will be no siege Perhaps they will spend a day or two fashioning ladders and tying grapnels to the ends of ropes But soon enough they will come over your walls in a hundred places at once You may be able to hold the keep for a time but the castle will fall within the hour You would do better to open your gates and ask for—

—mercy I know what kind of mercy they have for me
