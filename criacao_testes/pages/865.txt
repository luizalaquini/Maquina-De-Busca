But these were foolish thoughts She had a city to take and dreaming of kisses and some sellsword’s bright blue eyes would not help her breach the walls of Meereen I am the blood of the dragon Dany reminded herself Her thoughts were spinning in circles like a rat chasing its tail Suddenly she could not stand the close confines of the pavilion another moment I want to feel the wind on my face and smell the sea Missandei she called have my silver saddled Your own mount as well

The little scribe bowed As Your Grace commands Shall I summon your bloodriders to guard you

We’ll take Arstan I do not mean to leave the camps She had no enemies among her children And the old squire would not talk too much as Belwas would or look at her like Daario

The grove of burnt olive trees in which she’d raised her pavilion stood beside the sea between the Dothraki camp and that of the Unsullied When the horses had been saddled Dany and her companions set out along the shoreline away from the city Even so she could feel Meereen at her back mocking her When she looked over one shoulder there it stood the afternoon sun blazing off the bronze harpy atop the Great Pyramid Inside Meereen the slavers would soon be reclining in their fringed tokars to feast on lamb and olives unborn puppies honeyed dormice and other such delicacies whilst outside her children went hungry A sudden wild anger filled her I will bring you down she swore

As they rode past the stakes and pits that surrounded the eunuch encampment Dany could hear Grey Worm and his sergeants running one company through a series of drills with shield shortsword and heavy spear Another company was bathing in the sea clad only in white linen breechclouts The eunuchs were very clean she had noticed Some of her sellswords smelled as if they had not washed or changed their clothes since her father lost the Iron Throne but the Unsullied bathed each evening even if they’d marched all day When no water was available they cleansed themselves with sand the Dothraki way

The eunuchs knelt as she passed raising clenched fists to their breasts Dany returned the salute The tide was coming in and the surf foamed about the feet of her silver She could see her ships standing out to sea Balerion floated nearest the great cog once known as Saduleon her sails furled Further out were the galleys Meraxes and Vhagar formerly Joso’s Prank and Summer Sun They were Magister Illyrio’s ships in truth not hers at all and yet she had given them new names with hardly a thought Dragon names and more in old Valyria before the Doom Balerion Meraxes and Vhagar had been gods

South of the ordered realm of stakes pits drills and bathing eunuchs lay the encampments of her freedmen a far noisier and more chaotic place Dany had armed the former slaves as best she could with weapons from Astapor and Yunkai and Ser Jorah had organized the fighting men into four strong companies yet she saw no one drilling here They passed a driftwood fire where a hundred people had gathered to roast the carcass of a horse She could smell the meat and hear the fat sizzling as the spit boys turned but the sight only made her frown

Children ran behind their horses skipping and laughing Instead of salutes voices called to her on every side in a babble of tongues Some of the freedmen greeted her as Mother while others begged for boons or favors Some prayed for strange gods to bless her and some asked her to bless them instead She smiled at them turning right and left touching their hands when they raised them letting those who knelt reach up to touch her stirrup or her leg Many of the freedmen believed there was good fortune in her touch If it helps give them courage let them touch me she thought There are hard trials yet ahead…

Dany had stopped to speak to a pregnant woman who wanted the Mother of Dragons to name her baby when someone reached up and grabbed her left wrist Turning she glimpsed a tall ragged man with a shaved head and a sunburnt face Not so hard she started to say but before she could finish he’d yanked her bodily from the saddle The ground came up and knocked the breath from her as her silver whinnied and backed away Stunned Dany rolled to her side and pushed herself onto one elbow…

…and then she saw the sword

There’s the treacherous sow he said I knew you’d come to get your feet kissed one day His head was bald as a melon his nose red and peeling but she knew that voice and those pale green eyes I’m going to start by cutting off your teats Dany was dimly aware of Missandei shouting for help A freedman edged forward but only a step One quick slash and he was on his knees blood running down his face Mero wiped his sword on his breeches Who’s next

I am Arstan Whitebeard leapt from his horse and stood over her the salt wind riffling through his snowy hair both hands on his tall hardwood staff

Grandfather Mero said run off before I break your stick in two and bugger you with—

The old man feinted with one end of the staff pulled it back and whipped the other end about faster than Dany would have believed The Titan’s Bastard staggered back into the surf spitting blood and broken teeth from the ruin of his mouth Whitebeard put Dany behind him Mero slashed at his face The old man jerked back cat-quick The staff thumped Mero’s ribs sending him reeling Arstan splashed sideways parried a looping cut danced away from a second checked a third mid-swing The moves were so fast she could hardly follow Missandei was pulling Dany to her feet when she heard a crack She thought Arstan’s staff had snapped until she saw the jagged bone jutting from Mero’s calf As he fell the Titan’s Bastard twisted and lunged sending his point straight at the old man’s chest Whitebeard swept the blade aside almost contemptuously and smashed the other end of his staff against the big man’s temple Mero went sprawling blood bubbling from his mouth as the waves washed over him A moment later the freedmen washed over him too knives and stones and angry fists rising and falling in a frenzy

Dany turned away sickened She was more frightened now than when it had been happening He would have killed me

Your Grace Arstan knelt I am an old man and shamed He should never have gotten close enough to seize you I was lax I did not know him without his beard and hair

No more than I did Dany took a deep breath to stop her shaking Enemies everywhere Take me back to my tent Please

By the time Mormont arrived she was huddled in her lion pelt drinking a cup of spice wine I had a look at the river wall Ser Jorah started It’s a few feet higher than the others and just as strong And the Meereenese have a dozen fire hulks tied up beneath the ramparts—

She cut him off You might have warned me that the Titan’s Bastard had escaped

He frowned I saw no need to frighten you Your Grace I have offered a reward for his head—

Pay it to Whitebeard Mero has been with us all the way from Yunkai He shaved his beard off and lost himself amongst the freedmen waiting for a chance for vengeance Arstan killed him

Ser Jorah gave the old man a long look A squire with a stick slew Mero of Braavos is that the way of it

A stick Dany confirmed but no longer a squire Ser Jorah it’s my wish that Arstan be knighted

No

The loud refusal was surprise enough Stranger still it came from both men at once

Ser Jorah drew his sword The Titan’s Bastard was a nasty piece of work And good at killing Who are you old man

A better knight than you ser Arstan said coldly
