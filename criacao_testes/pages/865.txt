Jesus

1222 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip
tell Jesus

1223 And Jesus answered them saying The hour is come that the Son
of man should be glorified

1224 Verily verily I say unto you Except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth
much fruit

1225 He that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal

1226 If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there
shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my Father
honour

1227 Now is my soul troubled and what shall I say Father save me
from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour

1228 Father glorify thy name Then came there a voice from heaven
saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again

1229 The people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it
thundered others said An angel spake to him

1230 Jesus answered and said This voice came not because of me but
for your sakes

1231 Now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this
world be cast out

1232 And I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto
me

1233 This he said signifying what death he should die

1234 The people answered him We have heard out of the law that
Christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou The Son of man must be
lifted up who is this Son of man  1235 Then Jesus said unto them
Yet a little while is the light with you

Walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth

1236 While ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the
children of light These things spake Jesus and departed and did
hide himself from them

1237 But though he had done so many miracles before them yet they
believed not on him 1238 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might
be fulfilled which he spake Lord who hath believed our report and
to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed  1239 Therefore they
could not believe because that Esaias said again 1240 He hath
blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see
with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted
and I should heal them

1241 These things said Esaias when he saw his glory and spake of
him

1242 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they
should be put out of the synagogue 1243 For they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of God

1244 Jesus cried and said He that believeth on me believeth not on
me but on him that sent me

1245 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me

1246 I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me
should not abide in darkness

1247 And if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not
for I came not to judge the world but to save the world

1248 He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that
judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in
the last day

1249 For I have not spoken of myself but the Father which sent me
he gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak

1250 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever
I speak therefore even as the Father said unto me so I speak

131 Now before the feast of the passover when Jesus knew that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father
having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the
end

132 And supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot Simons son to betray him 133 Jesus knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands and that he was come
from God and went to God 134 He riseth from supper and laid aside
his garments and took a towel and girded himself
