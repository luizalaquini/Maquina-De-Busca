He watched the wildling move carefully from wood to Wall hacking out a handhold with short sharp blows of his ice axe then swinging over The rope around his waist tied him to the second man in line still edging up the tree Step by slow step Jarl moved higher kicking out toeholds with his spiked boots when there were no natural ones to be found When he was ten feet above the sentinel he stopped upon a narrow icy ledge slung his axe from his belt took out his hammer and drove an iron stake into a cleft The second man moved onto the Wall behind him while the third was scrambling to the top of the tree

The other two teams had no happily placed trees to give them a leg up and before long the Thenns were wondering whether they had gotten lost climbing the ridge Jarl’s party were all on the Wall and eighty feet up before the leading climbers from the other groups came into view The teams were spaced a good twenty yards apart Jarl’s four were in the center To the right of them was a team headed up by Grigg the Goat whose long blond braid made him easy to spot from below To the left a very thin man named Errok led the climbers

So slow the Magnar complained loudly as he watched them edge their way upward Has he forgotten the crows He should climb faster afore we are discovered

Jon had to hold his tongue He remembered the Skirling Pass all too well and the moonlight climb he’d made with Stonesnake He had swallowed his heart a half-dozen times that night and by the end his arms and legs had been aching and his fingers were half frozen And that was stone not ice Stone was solid Ice was treacherous stuff at the best of times and on a day like this when the Wall was weeping the warmth of a climber’s hand might be enough to melt it The huge blocks could be frozen rock-hard inside but their outer surface would be slick with runnels of water trickling down and patches of rotten ice where the air had gotten in Whatever else the wildlings are they’re brave

All the same Jon found himself hoping that Styr’s fears proved well founded If the gods are good a patrol will chance by and put an end to this No wall can keep you safe his father had told him once as they walked the walls of Winterfall A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it The wildlings might have a hundred and twenty men but four defenders would be enough to see them off with a few well-placed arrows and perhaps a pail of stones

No defenders appeared however not four not even one The sun climbed the sky and the wildlings climbed the Wall Jarl’s four remained well ahead till noon when they hit a pitch of bad ice Jarl had looped his rope around a wind-carved pinnace and was using it to support his weight when the whole jagged thing suddenly crumbled and came crashing down and him with it Chunks of ice as big as a man’s head bombarded the three below but they clung to the handholds and the stakes held and Jarl jerked to a sudden halt at the end of the rope

By the time his team had recovered from that mischance Grigg the Goat had almost drawn even with them Errok’s four remained well behind The face where they were climbing looked smooth and unpitted covered with a sheet of icemelt that glistened wetly where the sun brushed it Grigg’s section was darker to the eye with more obvious features long horizontal ledges where a block had been imperfectly positioned atop the block below cracks and crevices even chimneys along the vertical joins where wind and water had eaten holes large enough for a man to hide in

Jarl soon had his men edging upward again His four and Grigg’s moved almost side by side with Errok’s fifty feet below Deerhorn axes chopped and hacked sending showers of glittery shards cascading down onto the trees Stone hammers pounded stakes deep into the ice to serve as anchors for the ropes the iron stakes ran out before they were halfway up and after that the climbers used horn and sharpened bone And the men kicked driving the spikes on their boots against the hard unyielding ice again and again and again and again to make one foothold Their legs must be numb Jon thought by the fourth hour How long can they keep on with that He watched as restless as the Magnar listening for the distant moan of a Thenn warhorn But the horns stayed silent and there was no sign of the Night’s Watch

By the sixth hour Jarl had moved ahead of Grigg the Goat again and his men were widening the gap The Mance’s pet must want a sword the Magnar said shading his eyes The sun was high in the sky and the upper third of the Wall was a crystalline blue from below reflecting so brilliantly that it hurt the eyes to look on it Jarl’s four and Grigg’s were all but lost in the glare though Errok’s team was still in shadow Instead of moving upward they were edging their way sideways at about five hundred feet making for a chimney Jon was watching them inch along when he heard the sound—a sudden crack that seemed to roll along the ice followed by a shout of alarm And then the air was full of shards and shrieks and falling men as a sheet of ice a foot thick and fifty feet square broke off from the Wall and came tumbling crumbling rumbling sweeping all before it Even down at the foot of the ridge some chunks came spinning through the trees and rolling down the slope Jon grabbed Ygritte and pulled her down to shield her and one of the Thenns was struck in the face by a chunk that broke his nose

And when they looked up Jarl and his team were gone Men ropes stakes all gone nothing remained above six hundred feet There was a wound in the Wall where the climbers had clung half a heartbeat before the ice within as smooth and white as polished marble and shining in the sun Far far below there was a faint red smear where someone had smashed against a frozen pinnace

The Wall defends itself Jon thought as he pulled Ygritte back to her feet

They found Jarl in a tree impaled upon a splintered branch and still roped to the three men who lay broken beneath him One was still alive but his legs and spine were shattered and most of his ribs as well Mercy he said when they came upon him One of the Thenns smashed his head in with a big stone mace The Magnar gave orders and his men began to gather fuel for a pyre

The dead were burning when Grigg the Goat reached the top of the Wall By the time Errok’s four had joined them nothing remained of Jarl and his team but bone and ash

The sun had begun to sink by then so the climbers wasted little time They unwound the long coils of hemp they’d had looped around their chests tied them all together and tossed down one end The thought of trying to climb five hundred feet up that rope filled Jon with dread but Mance had planned better than that The raiders Jarl had left below uncasked a huge ladder with rungs of woven hemp as thick as a man’s arm and tied it to the climbers’ rope Errok and Grigg and their men grunted and heaved pulled it up staked it to the top then lowered the rope again to haul up a second ladder There were five altogether

When all of them were in place the Magnar shouted a brusque command in the Old Tongue and five of his Thenns started up together Even with the ladders it was no easy climb Ygritte watched them struggle for a while I hate this Wall she said in a low angry voice Can you feel how cold it is

It’s made of ice Jon pointed out

You know nothing Jon Snow This wall is made o’ blood

Nor had it drunk its fill By sunset two of the Thenns had fallen from the ladder to their deaths but they were the last It was near midnight before Jon reached the top The stars were out again and Ygritte was trembling from the climb I almost fell she said with tears in her eyes Twice Thrice The Wall was trying t’ shake me off I could feel it One of the tears broke free and trickled slowly down her cheek

The worst is behind us Jon tried to sound confident Don’t be frightened He tried to put an arm around her

Ygritte slammed the heel of her hand into his chest so hard it stung even through his layers of wool mail and boiled leather I wasn’t frightened You know nothing Jon Snow

Why are you crying then

Not for fear She kicked savagely at the ice beneath her with a heel chopping out a chunk I’m crying because we never found the Horn of Winter We opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world and never found the Horn of Joramun to bring this cold thing down





JAIME

His hand burned

Still still long after they had snuffed out the torch they’d used to sear his bloody stump days after he could still feel the fire lancing up his arm and his fingers twisting in the flames the fingers he no longer had

He had taken wounds before but never like this He had never known there could be such pain Sometimes unbidden old prayers bubbled from his lips prayers he learned as a child and never thought of since prayers he had first prayed with Cersei kneeling beside him in the sept at Casterly Rock Sometimes he even wept until he heard the Mummers laughing Then he made his eyes go dry and his heart go dead and prayed for his fever to burn away his tears Now I know how Tyrion has felt all those times they laughed at him

After the second time he fell from the saddle they bound him tight to Brienne of Tarth and made them share a horse again One day instead of back to front they bound them face-to-face The lovers Shagwell sighed loudly and what a lovely sight they are ’Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and his lady Then he laughed that high shrill laugh of his and said Ah but which one is the knight and which one is the lady

If I had my hand you’d learn that soon enough Jaime thought His arms ached and his legs were numb from the ropes but after a while none of that mattered His world shrunk to the throb of agony that was his phantom hand and Brienne pressed against him She’s warm at least he consoled himself though the wench’s breath was as foul as his own

His hand was always between them Urswyck had hung it about his neck on a cord so it dangled down against his chest slapping Brienne’s breasts as Jaime slipped in and out of consciousness His right eye was swollen shut the wound inflamed where Brienne had cut him during their fight but it was his hand that hurt the most Blood and pus seeped from his stump and the missing hand throbbed every time the horse took a step

His throat was so raw that he could not eat but he drank wine when they gave it to him and water when that was all they offered Once they handed him a cup and he quaffed it straight away trembling and the Brave Companions burst into laughter so loud and harsh it hurt his ears That’s horse piss you’re drinking Kingslayer Rorge told him Jaime was so thirsty he drank it anyway but afterward he retched it all back up They made Brienne wash the vomit out of his beard just as they made her clean him up when he soiled himself in the saddle

One damp cold morning when he was feeling slightly stronger a madness took hold of him and he reached for the Dornishman’s sword with his left hand and wrenched it clumsily from its scabbard Let them kill me he thought so long as I die fighting a blade in hand But it was no good Shagwell came hopping from leg to leg dancing nimbly aside when Jaime slashed at him Unbalanced he staggered forward hacking wildly at the fool but Shagwell spun and ducked and darted until all the Mummers were laughing at Jaime’s futile efforts to land a blow When he tripped over a rock and stumbled to his knees the fool leapt in and planted a wet kiss atop his head

Rorge finally flung him aside and kicked the sword from Jaime’s feeble fingers as he tried to bring it up That wath amuthing Kingthlayer said Vargo Hoat but if you try it again I thall take your other hand or perhapth a foot

Jaime lay on his back afterward staring at the night sky trying not to feel the pain that snaked up his right arm every time he moved it The night was strangely beautiful The moon was a graceful crescent and it seemed as though he had never seen so many stars The King’s Crown was at the zenith and he could see the Stallion rearing and there the Swan The Moonmaid shy as ever was half-hidden behind a pine tree How can such a night be beautiful he asked himself Why would the stars want to look down on such as me

Jaime Brienne whispered so faintly he thought he was dreaming it Jaime what are you doing

Dying he whispered back

No she said no you must live

He wanted to laugh Stop telling me what do wench I’ll die if it pleases me

Are you so craven

The word shocked him He was Jaime Lannister a knight of the Kingsguard he was the Kingslayer No man had ever called him craven Other things they called him yes oathbreaker liar murderer They said he was cruel treacherous reckless But never craven What else can I do but die

Live she said live and fight and take revenge But she spoke too loudly Rorge heard her voice if not her words and came over to kick her shouting at her to hold her bloody tongue if she wanted to keep it

Craven Jaime thought as Brienne fought to stifle her moans Can it be They took my sword hand Was that all I was a sword hand Gods be good is it true

The wench had the right of it He could not die Cersei was waiting for him She would have need of him And Tyrion his little brother who loved him for a lie And his enemies were waiting too the Young Wolf who had beaten him in the Whispering Wood and killed his men around him Edmure Tully who had kept him in darkness and chains these Brave Companions

When morning came he made himself eat They fed him a mush of oats horse food but he forced down every spoon He ate again at evenfall and the next day Live he told himself harshly when the mush was like to gag him live for Cersei live for Tyrion Live for vengeance A Lannister always pays his debts His missing hand throbbed and burned and stank When I reach King’s Landing I’ll have a new hand forged a golden hand and one day I’ll use it to rip out Vargo Hoat’s throat

The days and the nights blurred together in a haze of pain He would sleep in the saddle pressed against Brienne his nose full of the stink of his rotting hand and then at night he would lie awake on the hard ground caught in a waking nightmare Weak as he was they always bound him to a tree It gave him some cold consolation to know that they feared him that much even now

Brienne was always bound beside him She lay there in her bonds like a big dead cow saying not a word The wench has built a fortress inside herself They will rape her soon enough but behind her walls they cannot touch her But Jaime’s walls were gone They had taken his hand they had taken his sword hand and without it he was nothing The other was no good to him Since the time he could walk his left arm had been his shield arm no more It was his right hand that made him a knight his right arm that made him a man

One day he heard Urswyck say something about Harrenhal and remembered that was to be their destination That made him laugh aloud and that made Timeon slash his face with a long thin whip The cut bled but beside his hand he scarcely felt it Why did you laugh the wench asked him that night in a whisper

Harrenhal was where they gave me the white cloak he whispered back Whent’s great tourney He wanted to show us all his big castle and his fine sons I wanted to show them too I was only fifteen but no one could have beaten me that day Aerys never let me joust He laughed again He sent me away But now I’m coming back

They heard the laugh That night it was Jaime who got the kicks and punches He hardly felt them either until Rorge slammed a boot into his stump and then he fainted
