old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the
sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his fathers wives and
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report

373 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he
was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours

all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto
him

375 And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they
hated him yet the more

376 And he said unto them Hear I pray you this dream which I have
dreamed 377 For behold we were binding sheaves in the field and
lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves
stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf

378 And his brethren said to him Shalt thou indeed reign over us or
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us And they hated him yet the
more for his dreams and for his words

379 And he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and
said Behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and
the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me

3710 And he told it to his father and to his brethren and his
father rebuked him and said unto him What is this dream that thou
hast dreamed  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth  3711 And his brethren
envied him but his father observed the saying

3712 And his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in Shechem

3713 And Israel said unto Joseph Do not thy brethren feed the flock
in Shechem come and I will send thee unto them And he said to him
Here am I

thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again So he
sent him out of the vale of Hebron and he came to Shechem

3715 And a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in
the field and the man asked him saying What seekest thou  3716
And he said I seek my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed
their flocks

3717 And the man said They are departed hence for I heard them say
Let us go to Dothan And Joseph went after his brethren and found
them in Dothan
