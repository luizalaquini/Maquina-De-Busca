TYRION

A horse whickered impatiently behind him from amidst the ranks of gold cloaks drawn up across the road Tyrion could hear Lord Gyles coughing as well He had not asked for Gyles no more than he’d asked for Ser Addam or Jalabhar Xho or any of the rest but his lord father felt Doran Martell might take it ill if only a dwarf came out to escort him across the Blackwater

Joffrey should have met the Dornishmen himself he reflected as he sat waiting but he would have mucked it up no doubt Of late the king had been repeating little jests about the Dornish that he’d picked up from Mace Tyrell’s men-at-arms How many Dornishmen does it take to shoe a horse Nine One to do the shoeing and eight to lift the horse up Somehow Tyrion did not think Doran Martell would find that amusing

He could see their banners flying as the riders emerged from the green of the living wood in a long dusty column From here to the river only bare black trees remained a legacy of his battle Too many banners he thought sourly as he watched the ashes kick up under the hooves of the approaching horses as they had beneath the hooves of the Tyrell van as it smashed Stannis in the flank Martell’s brought half the lords of Dorne by the look of it He tried to think of some good that might come of that and failed How many banners do you count he asked Bronn

The sellsword knight shaded his eyes Eight    no nine

Tyrion turned in his saddle Pod come up here Describe the arms you see and tell me which houses they represent

Podrick Payne edged his gelding closer He was carrying the royal standard Joffrey’s great stag-and-lion and struggling with its weight Bronn bore Tyrion’s own banner the lion of Lannister gold on crimson

He’s getting taller Tyrion realized as Pod stood in his stirrups for a better look He’ll soon tower over me like all the rest The lad had been making a diligent study of Dornish heraldry at Tyrion’s command but as ever he was nervous I can’t see The wind is flapping them

Bronn tell the boy what you see

Bronn looked very much the knight today in his new doublet and cloak the flaming chain across his chest A red sun on orange he called with a spear through its back

Martell Podrick Payne said at once visibly relieved House Martell of Sunspear my lord The Prince of Dorne

My horse would have known that one said Tyrion dryly Give him another Bronn

There’s a purple flag with yellow balls

Lemons Pod said hopefully A purple field strewn with lemons For House Dalt Of of Lemonwood

Might be Next’s a big black bird on yellow Something pink or white in its claws hard to say with the banner flapping

The vulture of Blackmont grasps a baby in its talons said Pod House Blackmont of Blackmont ser

Bronn laughed Reading books again Books will ruin your sword eye boy I see a skull too A black banner

The crowned skull of House Manwoody bone and gold on black Pod sounded more confident with every correct answer The Manwoodys of Kingsgrave

Three black spiders

They’re scorpions ser House Qorgyle of Sandstone three scorpions black on red

Red and yellow a jagged line between

The flames of Hellholt House Uller

Tyrion was impressed The boy’s not half stupid once he gets his tongue untied Go on Pod he urged If you get them all I’ll make you a gift

A pie with red and black slices said Bronn There’s a gold hand in the middle

House Allyrion of Godsgrace

A red chicken eating a snake looks like

The Gargalens of Salt Shore A cockatrice Ser Pardon Not a chicken Red with a black snake in its beak

Very good exclaimed Tyrion One more lad

Bronn scanned the ranks of the approaching Dornishmen The last’s a golden feather on green checks

A golden quill ser Jordayne of the Tor

Tyrion laughed Nine and well done I could not have named them all myself That was a lie but it would give the boy some pride and that he badly needed

Martell brings some formidable companions it would seem Not one of the houses Pod had named was small or insignificant Nine of the greatest lords of Dorne were coming up the kingsroad them or their heirs and somehow Tyrion did not think they had come all this way just to see the dancing bear There was a message here And not one I like He wondered if it had been a mistake to ship Myrcella down to Sunspear

My lord Pod said a little timidly there’s no litter

Tyrion turned his head sharply The boy was right

Doran Martell always travels in a litter the boy said A carved litter with silk hangings and suns on the drapes

Tyrion had heard the same talk Prince Doran was past fifty and gouty He may have wanted to make faster time he told himself He may have feared his litter would make too tempting a target for brigands or that it would prove too cumbersome in the high passes of the Boneway Perhaps his gout is better

So why did he have such a bad feeling about this

This waiting was intolerable Banners forward he snapped We’ll meet them He kicked his horse Bronn and Pod followed one to either side When the Dornishmen saw them coming they spurred their own mounts banners rippling as they rode From their ornate saddles were slung the round metal shields they favored and many carried bundles of short throwing spears or the double-curved Dornish bows they used so well from horseback

There were three sorts of Dornishmen the first King Daeron had observed There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood the stony Dornishmen the least

All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran’s retinue The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind The sandy Dornishmen were even darker their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest sons of the Andals and the First Men brown-haired or blond with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning

The lords wore silk and satin robes with jeweled belts and flowing sleeves Their armor was heavily enameled and inlaid with burnished copper shining silver and soft red gold They came astride red horses and golden ones and a few as pale as snow all slim and swift with long necks and narrow beautiful heads The fabled sand steeds of Dorne were smaller than proper warhorses and could not bear such weight of armor but it was said that they could run for a day and night and another day and never tire

The Dornish leader forked a stallion black as sin with a mane and tail the color of fire He sat his saddle as if he’d been born there tall slim graceful A cloak of pale red silk fluttered from his shoulders and his shirt was armored with overlapping rows of copper disks that glittered like a thousand bright new pennies as he rode His high gilded helm displayed a copper sun on its brow and the round shield slung behind him bore the sun-and-spear of House Martell on its polished metal surface

A Martell sun but ten years too young Tyrion thought as he reined up too fit as well and far too fierce He knew what he must deal with by then How many Dornishmen does it take to start a war he asked himself Only one Yet he had no choice but to smile Well met my lords We had word of your approach and His Grace King Joffrey bid me ride out to welcome you in his name My lord father the King’s Hand sends his greetings as well He feigned an amiable confusion Which of you is Prince Doran

My brother’s health requires he remain at Sunspear The princeling removed his helm Beneath his face was lined and saturnine with thin arched brows above large eyes as black and shiny as pools of coal oil Only a few streaks of silver marred the lustrous black hair that receded from his brow in a widow’s peak as sharply pointed as his nose A salty Dornishmen for certain Prince Doran has sent me to join King Joffrey’s council in his stead as it please His Grace

His Grace will be most honored to have the counsel of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn of Dorne said Tyrion thinking This will mean blood in the gutters And your noble companions are most welcome as well

Permit me to acquaint you with them my lord of Lannister Ser Deziel Dalt of Lemonwood Lord Tremond Gargalen Lord Harmen Uller and his brother Ser Ulwyck Ser Ryon Allyrion and his natural son Ser Daemon Sand the Bastard of Godsgrace Lord Dagos Manwoody his brother Ser Myles his sons Mors and Dickon Ser Arron Qorgyle And never let it be thought that I would neglect the ladies Myria Jordayne heir to the Tor Lady Larra Blackmont her daughter Jynessa her son Perros He raised a slender hand toward a black-haired woman to the rear beckoning her forward And this is Ellaria Sand mine own paramour

Tyrion swallowed a groan His paramour and bastard-born Cersei will pitch a holy fit if he wants her at the wedding If she consigned the woman to some dark corner below the salt his sister would risk the Red Viper’s wrath Seat her beside him at the high table and every other lady on the dais was like to take offense Did Prince Doran mean to provoke a quarrel

Prince Oberyn wheeled his horse about to face his fellow Dornishmen Ellaria lords and ladies sers see how well King Joffrey loves us His Grace has been so kind as to send his own Uncle Imp to bring us to his court

Bronn snorted back laughter and Tyrion perforce must feign amusement as well Not alone my lords That would be too enormous a task for a little man like me His own party had come up on them so it was his turn to name the names Let me present Ser Flement Brax heir to Hornvale Lord Gyles of Rosby Ser Addam Marbrand Lord Commander of the City Watch Jalabhar Xho Prince of the Red Flower Vale Ser Harys Swyft my uncle Kevan’s good father by marriage Ser Merlon Crakehall Ser Philip Foote and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater two heroes of our recent battle against the rebel Stannis Baratheon And mine own squire young Podrick of House Payne The names had a nice ringing sound as Tyrion reeled them off but the bearers were nowise near as distinguished nor formidable a company as those who accompanied Prince Oberyn as both of them knew full well

My lord of Lannister said Lady Blackmont we have come a long dusty way and rest and refreshment would be most welcome Might we continue on to the city
