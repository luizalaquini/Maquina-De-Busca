All I did was protect Val and the babe against looters when the wildlings fled and keep them there until the rangers found us I never captured anyone King Stannis keeps his men well in hand that’s plain He lets them plunder some but I’ve only heard of three wildling women being raped and the men who did it have all been gelded I suppose I should have been killing the free folk as they ran Ser Alliser has been putting it about that the only time I bared my sword was to defend our foes I failed to kill Mance Rayder because I was in league with him he says

That’s only Ser Alliser said Sam Everyone knows the sort of man he is With his noble birth his knighthood and his long years in the Watch Ser Alliser Thorne might have been a strong challenger for the Lord Commander’s title but almost all the men he’d trained during his years as master-at-arms despised him His name had been offered of course but after running a weak sixth on the first day and actually losing votes on the second Thorne had withdrawn to support Lord Janos Slynt

What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble line and trueborn while I’m the bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand and bedded with a spearwife The warg I’ve heard them call me How can I be a warg without a wolf I ask you His mouth twisted I don’t even dream of Ghost anymore All my dreams are of the crypts of the stone kings on their thrones Sometimes I hear Robb’s voice and my father’s as if they were at a feast But there’s a wall between us and I know that no place has been set for me

The living have no place at the feasts of the dead It tore the heart from Sam to hold his silence then Bran’s not dead Jon he wanted to stay He’s with friends and they’re going north on a giant elk to find a three-eyed crow in the depths of the haunted forest It sounded so mad that there were times Sam Tarly thought he must have dreamt it all conjured it whole from fever and fear and hunger… but he would have blurted it out anyway if he had not given his word

Three times he had sworn to keep the secret once to Bran himself once to that strange boy Jojen Reed and last of all to Coldhands The world believes the boy is dead his rescuer had said as they parted Let his bones lie undisturbed We want no seekers coming after us Swear it Samwell of the Night’s Watch Swear it for the life you owe me

Miserable Sam shifted his weight and said Lord Janos will never be chosen Lord Commander It was the best comfort he had to offer Jon the only comfort That won’t happen

Sam you’re a sweet fool Open your eyes It’s been happening for days Jon pushed his hair back out of his eyes and said I may know nothing but I know that Now pray excuse me I need to hit someone very hard with a sword

There was naught that Sam could do but watch him stride off toward the armory and the practice yard That was where Jon Snow spent most of his waking hours With Ser Endrew dead and Ser Alliser disinterested Castle Black had no master-at-arms so Jon had taken it on himself to work with some of the rawer recruits Satin Horse Hop-Robin with his clubfoot Arron and Emrick And when they had duties he would train alone for hours with sword and shield and spear or match himself against anyone who cared to take him on

Sam you’re a sweet fool he could hear Jon saying all the way back to the maester’s keep Open your eyes It’s been happening for days Could he be right A man needed the votes of two-thirds of the Sworn Brothers to become the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch and after nine days and nine votes no one was even close to that Lord Janos had been gaining true creeping up past first Bowen Marsh and then Othell Yarwyck but he was still well behind Ser Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower and Cotter Pyke of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea One of them will be the new Lord Commander surely Sam told himself

Stannis had posted guards outside the maester’s door too Within the rooms were hot and crowded with the wounded from the battle black brothers king’s men and queen’s men all three Clydas was shuffling amongst them with flagons of goats’ milk and dreamwine but Maester Aemon had not yet returned from his morning call on Mance Rayder Sam hung his cloak upon a peg and went to lend a hand But even as he fetched and poured and changed dressings Jon’s words nagged at him Sam you’re a sweet fool Open your eyes It’s been happening for days

It was a good hour before he could excuse himself to feed the ravens On the way up to the rookery he stopped to check the tally he had made of last night’s count At the start of the choosing more than thirty names had been offered but most had withdrawn once it became clear they could not win Seven remained as of last night Ser Denys Mallister had collected two hundred and thirteen tokens Cotter Pyke one hundred and eighty-seven Lord Slynt seventy-four Othell Yarwyck sixty Bowen Marsh forty-nine Three-Finger Hobb five and Dolorous Edd Tollett one Pyp and his stupid japes Sam shuffled through the earlier counts Ser Denys Cotter Pyke and Bowen Marsh had all been falling since the third day Othell Yarwyck since the sixth Only Lord Janos Slynt was climbing day after day after day

He could hear the birds quorking in the rookery so he put the papers away and climbed the steps to feed them Three more ravens had come in he saw with pleasure Snow they cried at him Snow snow snow He had taught them that Even with the newcomers the ravenry seemed dismally empty Few of the birds that Aemon had sent off had returned as yet One reached Stannis though One found Dragonstone and a king who still cared A thousand leagues south Sam knew his father had joined House Tarly to the cause of the boy on the Iron Throne but neither King Joffrey nor little King Tommen had bestirred himself when the Watch cried out for help What good is a king who will not defend his realm he thought angrily remembering the night on the Fist of the First Men and the terrible trek to Craster’s Keep through darkness fear and falling snow The queen’s men made him uneasy it was true but at least they had come

That night at supper Sam looked for Jon Snow but did not see him anywhere in the cavernous stone vault where the brothers now took their meals He finally took a place on the bench near his other friends Pyp was telling Dolorous Edd about the contest they’d had to see which of the straw soldiers could collect the most wildling arrows You were leading most of the way but Watt of Long Lake got three in the last day and passed you

I never win anything Dolorous Edd complained The gods always smiled on Watt though When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water How lucky was that missing all those rocks

Was it a long fall Grenn wanted to know Did landing in the pool of water save his life

No said Dolorous Edd He was dead already from that axe in his head Still it was pretty lucky missing the rocks

Three-Finger Hobb had promised the brothers roast haunch of mammoth that night maybe in hopes of cadging a few more votes If that was his notion he should have found a younger mammoth Sam thought as he pulled a string of gristle out from between his teeth Sighing he pushed the food away

There would be another vote shortly and the tensions in the air were thicker than the smoke Cotter Pyke sat by the fire surrounded by rangers from Eastwatch Ser Denys Mallister was near the door with a smaller group of Shadow Tower men Janos Slynt has the best place Sam realized halfway between the flames and the drafts He was alarmed to see Bowen Marsh beside him wan-faced and haggard his head still wrapped in linen but listening to all that Lord Janos had to say When he pointed that out to his friends Pyp said And look down there that’s Ser Alliser whispering with Othell Yarwyck

After the meal Maester Aemon rose to ask if any of the brothers wished to speak before they cast their tokens Dolorous Edd got up stone-faced and glum as ever I just want to say to whoever is voting for me that I would certainly make an awful Lord Commander But so would all these others He was followed by Bowen Marsh who stood with one hand on Lord Slynt’s shoulder Brothers and friends I am asking that my name be withdrawn from this choosing My wound still troubles me and the task is too large for me I fear… but not for Lord Janos here who commanded the gold cloaks of King’s Landing for many years Let us all give him our support

Sam heard angry mutters from Cotter Pyke’s end of the room and Ser Denys looked at one of his companions and shook his head It is too late the damage is done He wondered where Jon was and why he had stayed away

Most of the brothers were unlettered so by tradition the choosing was done by dropping tokens into a big potbellied iron kettle that Three-Finger Hobb and Owen the Oaf had dragged over from the kitchens The barrels of tokens were off in a corner behind a heavy drape so the voters could make their choice unseen You were allowed to have a friend cast your token if you had duty so some men took two tokens three or four and Ser Denys and Cotter Pyke voted for the garrisons they had left behind

When the hall was finally empty save for them Sam and Clydas upended the kettle in front of Maester Aemon A cascade of seashells stones and copper pennies covered the table Aemon’s wrinkled hands sorted with surprising speed moving the shells here the stones there the pennies to one side the occasional arrowhead nail and acorn off to themselves Sam and Clydas counted the piles each of them keeping his own tally

Tonight it was Sam’s turn to give his results first Two hundred and three for Ser Denys Mallister he said One hundred and sixty-nine for Cotter Pyke One hundred and thirty-seven for Lord Janos Slynt seventy-two for Othell Yarwyck five for Three-Finger Hobb and two for Dolorous Edd

I had one hundred and sixty-eight for Pyke Clydas said We are two votes short by my count and one by Sam’s

Sam’s count is correct said Maester Aemon Jon Snow did not cast a token It makes no matter No one is close

Sam was more relieved than disappointed Even with Bowen Marsh’s support Lord Janos was still only third Who are these five who keep voting for Three-Finger Hobb he wondered

Brothers who want him out of the kitchens said Clydas
