there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these
things

49 Those things which ye have both learned and received and heard
and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you

410 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your
care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye
lacked opportunity

411 Not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in
whatsoever state I am therewith to be content

412 I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound every
where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry both to abound and to suffer need

413 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me

414 Notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with
my affliction

415 Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the
gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving but ye only

416 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
necessity

417 Not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound
to your account

418 But I have all and abound I am full having received of
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet
smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to God

419 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Jesus

420 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever Amen

421 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus The brethren which are with
me greet you

422 All the saints salute you chiefly they that are of Caesars
household

423 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians


11  Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God
and Timotheus our brother 12  To the saints and faithful brethren
in Christ which are at Colosse Grace be unto you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

13  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying
always for you
14  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which ye
have to all the saints
15  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of the gospel
16  Which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth
fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the
grace of God in truth
17  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you
a faithful minister of Christ
18  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit

19  For this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to
pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
110  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God
111  Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
112  Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
113  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear Son
114  In whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of
sins
115  Who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every
creature
116  For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are
in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or
principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
117  And he is before all things and by him all things consist

118  And he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the
firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence

119  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell
120  And having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to
reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in
earth or things in heaven
