While others went without says Leeg 1
Right says Messalla Thats how it works here
Fortunately or we wouldnt have dinner says Gale
Everybody grab a can
Some of our company seem reluctant to do this but its
as good a method as any Im really not in the mood to divvy
up everything into eleven equal parts factoring in age body
weight and physical output I poke around in the pile about
to settle on some cod chowder when Peeta holds out a
can to me Here
I take it not knowing what to expect The label reads
Lamb Stew
I press my lips together at the memories of rain
dripping through stones my inept attempts at flirting and
the aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in the chilly air So
some part of it must still be in his head too How happy
how hungry how close we were when that picnic basket
arrived outside our cave Thanks I pop open the top It
even has dried plums I bend the lid and use it as a
makeshift spoon scooping a bit into my mouth Now this
place tastes like the arena too
Were passing around a box of fancy cream-filled
cookies when the beeping starts again The seal of Panem
lights up on the screen and remains there while the anthem
plays And then they begin to show images of the dead just
as they did with the tributes in the arena They start with the
four faces of our TV crew followed by Boggs Gale
Finnick Peeta and me Except for Boggs they dont
bother with the soldiers from 13 either because they have
no idea who they are or because they know they wont
mean anything to the audience Then the man himself
appears seated at his desk a flag draped behind him the
fresh white rose gleaming in his lapel I think he might have
recently had more work done because his lips are puffier
than usual And his prep team really needs to use a lighter
hand with his blush
Snow congratulates the Peacekeepers on a masterful
job honors them for ridding the country of the menace
called the Mockingjay With my death he predicts a turning
of the tide in the war since the demoralized rebels have no
one left to follow And what was I really A poor unstable
girl with a small talent with a bow and arrow Not a great
thinker not the mastermind of the rebellion merely a face
plucked from the rabble because I had caught the nations
attention with my antics in the Games But necessary so
very necessary because the rebels have no real leader
among them
Somewhere in District 13 Beetee hits a switch
because now its not President Snow but President Coin
whos looking at us She introduces herself to Panem
identifies herself as the head of the rebellion and then
gives my eulogy Praise for the girl who survived the Seam
and the Hunger Games then turned a country of slaves into
an army of freedom fighters Dead or alive Katniss
Everdeen will remain the face of this rebellion If ever you
waver in your resolve think of the Mockingjay and in her
you will find the strength you need to rid Panem of its
oppressors
I had no idea how much I meant to her I say which
brings a laugh from Gale and questioning looks from the
others
Up comes a heavily doctored photo of me looking
beautiful and fierce with a bunch of flames flickering behind
me No words No slogan My face is all they need now
Beetee gives the reins back to a very controlled Snow
I have the feeling the president thought the emergency
channel was impenetrable and someone will end up dead
tonight because it was breached Tomorrow morning
when we pull Katniss Everdeens body from the ashes we
will see exactly who the Mockingjay is A dead girl who
could save no one not even herself Seal anthem and
out
Except that you wont find her says Finnick to the
empty screen voicing what were all probably thinking The
grace period will be brief Once they dig through those
ashes and come up missing eleven bodies theyll know we
escaped
We can get a head start on them at least I say
Suddenly Im so tired All I want is to lie down on a nearby
green plush sofa and go to sleep To cocoon myself in a
comforter made of rabbit fur and goose down Instead I pull
out the Holo and insist that Jackson talk me through the
most basic commands--which are really about entering the
coordinates of the nearest map grid intersection--so that I
can at least begin to operate the thing myself As the Holo
projects our surroundings I feel my heart sink even further
We must be moving closer to crucial targets because the
number of pods has noticeably increased How can we
possibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights
without detection We cant And if we cant we are
trapped like birds in a net I decide its best not to adopt
some sort of superior attitude when Im with these people
Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa
So I say Any ideas
Why dont we start by ruling out possibilities says
Finnick The street is not a possibility
The rooftops are just as bad as the street says Leeg

We still might have a chance to withdraw go back the
way we came says Homes But that would mean a failed
