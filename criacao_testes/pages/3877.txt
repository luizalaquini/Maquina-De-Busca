As they came alongside the galley dropped a rope ladder over the rail The rower shipped the oars and helped Sansa to her feet Up now Go on girl I got you Sansa thanked him for his kindness but received no answer but a grunt It was much easier going up the rope ladder than it had been coming down the cliff The oarsman Oswell followed close behind her while Ser Dontos remained in the boat

Two sailors were waiting by the rail to help her onto the deck Sansa was trembling She’s cold she heard someone say He took off his cloak and put it around her shoulders There is that better my lady Rest easy the worst is past and done

She knew the voice But he’s in the Vale she thought Ser Lothor Brune stood beside him with a torch

Lord Petyr Dontos called from the boat I must needs row back before they think to look for me

Petyr Baelish put a hand on the rail But first you’ll want your payment Ten thousand dragons was it

Ten thousand Dontos rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand As you promised my lord

Ser Lothor the reward

Lothor Brune dipped his torch Three men stepped to the gunwale raised crossbows fired One bolt took Dontos in the chest as he looked up punching through the left crown on his surcoat The others ripped into throat and belly It happened so quickly neither Dontos nor Sansa had time to cry out When it was done Lothor Brune tossed the torch down on top of the corpse The little boat was blazing fiercely as the galley moved away

You killed him Clutching the rail Sansa turned away and retched Had she escaped the Lannisters to tumble into worse

My lady Littlefinger murmured your grief is wasted on such a man as that He was a sot and no man’s friend

But he saved me

He sold you for a promise of ten thousand dragons Your disappearance will make them suspect you in Joffrey’s death The gold cloaks will hunt and the eunuch will jingle his purse Dontos… well you heard him He sold you for gold and when he’d drunk it up he would have sold you again A bag of dragons buys a man’s silence for a while but a well-placed quarrel buys it forever He smiled sadly All he did he did at my behest I dared not befriend you openly When I heard how you saved his life at Joff ‘s tourney I knew he would be the perfect catspaw

Sansa felt sick He said he was my Florian

Do you perchance recall what I said to you that day your father sat the Iron Throne

The moment came back to her vividly You told me that life was not a song That I would learn that one day to my sorrow She felt tears in her eyes but whether she wept for Ser Dontos Hollard for Joff for Tyrion or for herself Sansa could not say Is it all lies forever and ever everyone and everything

Almost everyone Save you and I of course He smiled Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

The note… it was you

It had to be the godswood No other place in the Red Keep is safe from the eunuch’s little birds… or little rats as I call them There are trees in the godswood instead of walls Sky above instead of ceiling Roots and dirt and rock in place of floor The rats have no place to scurry Rats need to hide lest men skewer them with swords Lord Petyr took her arm Let me show you to your cabin You have had a long and trying day I know You must be weary

Already the little boat was no more than a swirl of smoke and fire behind them almost lost in the immensity of the dawn sea There was no going back her only road was forward Very weary she admitted

As he led her below he said Tell me of the feast The queen took such pains The singers the jugglers the dancing bear… did your little lord husband enjoy my jousting dwarfs

Yours

I had to send to Braavos for them and hide them away in a brothel until the wedding The expense was exceeded only by the bother It is surprisingly difficult to hide a dwarf and Joffrey… you can lead a king to water but with Joff one had to splash it about before he realized he could drink it When I told him about my little surprise His Grace said ‘Why would I want some ugly dwarfs at my feast I hate dwarfs’ I had to take him by the shoulder and whisper ‘Not as much as your uncle will’

The deck rocked beneath her feet and Sansa felt as if the world itself had grown unsteady They think Tyrion poisoned Joffrey Ser Dontos said they seized him

Littlefinger smiled Widowhood will become you Sansa

The thought made her tummy flutter She might never need to share a bed with Tyrion again That was what she’d wanted… wasn’t it

The cabin was low and cramped but a featherbed had been laid upon the narrow sleeping shelf to make it more comfortable and thick furs piled atop it It will be snug I know but you shouldn’t be too uncomfortable Littlefinger pointed out a cedar chest under the porthole You’ll find fresh garb within Dresses smallclothes warm stockings a cloak Wool and linen only I fear Unworthy of a maid so beautiful but they’ll serve to keep you dry and clean until we can find you something finer

He had this all prepared for me My lord I… I do not understand… Joffrey gave you Harrenhal made you Lord Paramount of the Trident… why…

Why should I wish him dead Littlefinger shrugged I had no motive Besides I am a thousand leagues away in the Vale Always keep your foes confused If they are never certain who you are or what you want they cannot know what you are like to do next Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose or even seem to work against you Remember that Sansa when you come to play the game

What… what game

The only game The game of thrones He brushed back a strand of her hair You are old enough to know that your mother and I were more than friends There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me… but she was a daughter of Riverrun and Hoster Tully Family Duty Honor Sansa Family Duty Honor meant I could never have her hand But she gave me something finer a gift a woman can give but once How could I turn my back upon her daughter In a better world you might have been mine not Eddard Stark’s My loyal loving daughter… Put Joffrey from your mind sweetling Dontos Tyrion all of them They will never trouble you again You are safe now that’s all that matters You are safe with me and sailing home





Jaime


The king is dead they told him never knowing that Joffrey was his son as well as his sovereign

The Imp opened his throat with a dagger a costermonger declared at the roadside inn where they spent the night He drank his blood from a big gold chalice The man did not recognize the bearded one-handed knight with the big bat on his shield no more than any of them so he said things he might otherwise have swallowed had he known who was listening

It was poison did the deed the innkeep insisted The boy’s face turned black as a plum

May the Father judge him justly murmured a septon

The dwarf’s wife did the murder with him swore an archer in Lord Rowan’s livery Afterward she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep blood dripping from his jaws

Jaime sat silent through it all letting the words wash over him a horn of ale forgotten in his one good hand Joffrey My blood My firstborn My son He tried to bring the boy’s face to mind but his features kept turning into Cersei’s She will be in mourning her hair in disarray and her eyes red from crying her mouth trembling as she tries to speak She will cry again when she sees me though she’ll fight the tears His sister seldom wept but when she was with him She could not stand for others to think her weak Only to her twin did she show her wounds She will look to me for comfort and revenge

They rode hard the next day at Jaime’s insistence His son was dead and his sister needed him

When he saw the city before him its watchtowers dark against the gathering dusk Jaime Lannister cantered up to Steelshanks Walton behind Nage with the peace banner

What’s that awful stink the northman complained

Death thought Jaime but he said Smoke sweat and shit King’s Landing in short If you have a good nose you can smell the treachery too You’ve never smelled a city before

I smelled White Harbor It never stank like this

White Harbor is to King’s Landing as my brother Tyrion is to Ser Gregor Clegane

Nage led them up a low hill the seven-tailed peace banner lifting and turning in the wind the polished seven-pointed star shining bright upon its staff He would see Cersei soon and Tyrion and their father Could my brother truly have killed the boy Jaime found that hard to believe

He was curiously calm Men were supposed to go mad with grief when their children died he knew They were supposed to tear their hair out by the roots to curse the gods and swear red vengeance So why was it that he felt so little The boy lived and died believing Robert Baratheon his sire

Jaime had seen him born that was true though more for Cersei than the child But he had never held him How would it look his sister warned him when the women finally left them Bad enough Joff looks like you without you mooning over him Jaime yielded with hardly a fight The boy had been a squalling pink thing who demanded too much of Cersei’s time Cersei’s love and Cersei’s breasts Robert was welcome to him

And now he’s dead He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face black from poison and still felt nothing Perhaps he was the monster they claimed If the Father Above came down to offer him back his son or his hand Jaime knew which he would choose He had a second son after all and seed enough for many more If Cersei wants another child I’ll give her one… and this time I’ll hold him and the Others take those who do not like it Robert was rotting in his grave and Jaime was sick of lies
