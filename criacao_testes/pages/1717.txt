  Thats abouyt the shape ot a blieve said Jan
uncle was a very fair sort of man Did ye know en
be under em as under one here and there Her
uncle was a very fair sort of man Did ye know en
shepherd -- a bachelor-man  
  Not at all
  I used to go to his house a-courting my first wife
Charlotte who was his dairymaid Well a very good+
hearted man were Farmer Everdene and I being a
respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see
her and drink as much ale as I liked but not to carry
away any -- outside my skin I mane of course
  Ay ay Jan Coggan we know yer maning
  And so you see twas beautiful ale and I wished
to value his kindness as much as I could and not to
be so ill-mannered as to drink only a thimbleful which
would have been insulting the mans generosity  --  -- 
  True Master Coggan twould so corroborated
Mark Clark
   --  -- And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore
going and then by the time I got there I were as dry
as a lime-basket -- so thorough dry that that ale would
slip down  -- ah twould slip down sweet Happy
times heavenly times Such lovely drunks as I
used to have at that house You can mind Jacob
You used to go wi me sometimes
P 110
  I can -- I can said Jacob That one too that
we had at Bucks Head on a White Monday was a
pretty tipple
  Twas But for a wet of the better class that
brought you no nearer to the horned man than you were
afore you begun there was none like those in Farmer
Everdenes kitchen Not a single damn allowed no
not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment
when all were blindest though the good old word of
sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
relief to a merry soul
  True said the maltster Nater requires her
swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and
unholy exclamations is a necessity of life
  But Charlotte continued Coggan -- not a word of
the sort would Charlotte allow nor the smallest item of
taking in vain Ay poor Charlotte I wonder if she
had the good fortune to get into Heaven when a died
But a was never much in lucks way and perhaps a
went downwards after all poor soul
  And did any of you know Miss Everdenes-father
and mother inquired the shepherd who found some
difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired
channel
THE CHAT
  I knew them a little said Jacob Smallbury but
they were townsfolk and didnt live here Theyve
been dead for years Father what sort of people were
misess father and mother
  Well said the maltster he wasnt much to look
at but she was a lovely woman He was fond enough
of her as his sweetheart
  Used to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o times
so twas said observed Coggan
  He was very proud of her too when they were
married as Ive been told said the maltster
  Ay said Coggan He admired her so much that
he used to light the candle three time a night to look
at her
  Boundless love I shouldnt have supposed it in the
universe murmered Joseph Poorgrass who habitually
spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections
  Well to be sure said Gabriel
  Oh tis true enough I knowed the man and
woman both well Levi Everdene -- that was the mans
name sure Man
P 111
saith I in my hurry but he were
of a higher circle of life than that -- a was a gentleman+
tailor really worth scores of pounds And he became
a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times
  Oh I thought he was quite a common man said
Joseph
  O no no That man failed for heaps of money
hundreds in gold and silver
  The maltster being rather short of breath Mr Coggan
after absently scrutinising a coal which had fallen among
the ashes took up the narrative with a private twirl of
his eye --
  Well now youd hardly believe it but that man --
husbands alive after a while Understand a didnt
want to be fickle but he couldnt help it The poor
feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish
but his heart would rove do what he would He spoke
to me in real tribulation about it once Coggan
he said I could never wish for a handsomer woman
than Ive got but feeling shes ticketed as my lawful
wife I cant help my wicked heart wandering do what
I will But at last I believe he cured it by making her
take off her wedding-ring and calling her by her maiden
name as they sat together after the shop was shut and
so a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart and
not married to him at all And as soon as he could
