tame it Carrying him was a little easier but not much
The questions are just beginning The arenas have
been completely destroyed the memorials built there are
no more Hunger Games But they teach about them at
school and the girl knows we played a role in them The
boy will know in a few years How can I tell them about that
world without frightening them to death My children who
take the words of the song for granted
Deep in the meadow under the willow
A bed of grass a soft green pillow
Lay down your head and close your sleepy
eyes
And when again they open the sun will rise
Here its safe here its warm
Here the daisies guard you from every harm
Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow
brings them true
Here is the place where I love you
My children who dont know they play on a graveyard
Peeta says it will be okay We have each other And
the book We can make them understand in a way that will
make them braver But one day Ill have to explain about my
nightmares Why they came Why they wont ever really go
away
Ill tell them how I survive it Ill tell them that on bad
mornings it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything
because Im afraid it could be taken away Thats when I
make a list in my head of every act of goodness Ive seen
someone do Its like a game Repetitive Even a little
tedious after more than twenty years
But there are much worse games to play
