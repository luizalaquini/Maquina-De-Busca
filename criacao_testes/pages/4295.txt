where R1 is the correlation of the signal with itself delayed by one sample
and R0 is the correlation without delay that is the signal variance
This is reasonable intuitively because high sample-to-sample correlation
is to be expected in voiced speech so that R1 is very nearly as great as
R0 and the ratio becomes 1 whereas little or no sample-to-sample correlation
will be present in unvoiced speech making the ratio close to 0  Such a
scheme is reminiscent of ADPCM with adaptive prediction

However this sophisticated pre-emphasis method does not seem to be worthwhile
in practice  Usually the breakpoint in an analogue pre-emphasis filter is
chosen to be rather greater than 100 Hz to limit the amplification of fricative
energy  In fact the channel vocoder described by Holmes 1980 has the
breakpoint at 1 kHz limiting the gain to 12 dB at 4 kHz two octaves above

You may be wondering how the frequency response for the digital pre-emphasis
filters displayed in Figure 42 can be calculated  Suppose a digitized
sinusoid is applied as input to the filter

A sine wave of frequency f has equation  xt  =  sin  2 pi ft and when
sampled at t=0 T 2T  where T is the sampling interval 125 msec for
an 8 kHz sample rate this becomes  xn  =  sin  2 pi fnT  It is much
more convenient to consider a complex exponential
input  e sup  j2 pi fnT  em the response to a sinusoid can then be derived
by taking imaginary parts if necessary  The output for this input is

a sinusoid at the same frequency as the input  The
factor  1-ae sup -j2 pi fT  is complex with both amplitude and phase
components  Thus the output will be a phase-shifted and amplified version
of the input  The amplitude response at frequency f is therefore

With a=09 and 1 this gives the graphs of Figure 42

Frequency responses for analogue filters are often plotted with a logarithmic
frequency scale as well as a logarithmic amplitude one to bring out the
asymptotes in dBoctave as straight lines  For digital filters the response
is usually drawn on a
ul
linear
frequency axis extending to half the sampling frequency  The response is
symmetric about this point

Analyses like the above are usually expressed in terms of the z-transform
Denote the unit delay operation by z sup -1  The choice of the inverse rather
than z itself is of course an arbitrary matter but the convention has stuck
Then the filter can be characterized
by Figure 43 which signifies that the output is the input minus a delayed
and scaled version of itself

The transfer function of the filter is

and we have seen that the effect of the system on a complex exponential of
frequency f is to multiply it by

To get the frequency response from the transfer function replace z sup -1
by e sup -j2 pi fT  Amplitude and phase responses can then be found by
taking the modulus and angle of the complex frequency response
