things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they
give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped
or harped  148 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall
prepare himself to the battle  149 So likewise ye except ye utter
by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what
is spoken for ye shall speak into the air

1410 There are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and
none of them is without signification

1411 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice I shall be
unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me

1412 Even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church

1413 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret

1414 For if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my
understanding is unfruitful

1415 What is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray
with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will
sing with the understanding also

1416 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest  1417 For thou verily
givest thanks well but the other is not edified

1418 I thank my God I speak with tongues more than ye all 1419 Yet
in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding
that by my voice I might teach others also than ten thousand words in
an unknown tongue

1420 Brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be
ye children but in understanding be men

1421 In the law it is written With men of other tongues and other
lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not
hear me saith the LORD

1422 Wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but
to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that
believe not but for them which believe

1423 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place
and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are
unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad  1424
But if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one
unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all 1425 And thus
are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his
face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth

1426 How is it then brethren when ye come together every one of
you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation
hath an interpretation Let all things be done unto edifying

1427 If any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at
the most by three and that by course and let one interpret

1428 But if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the
church and let him speak to himself and to God

1429 Let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge

1430 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the
first hold his peace

1431 For ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all
may be comforted

1432 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets

1433 For God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all
churches of the saints

1434 Let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not
permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under
obedience as also saith the law

1435 And if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at
home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church

1436 What came the word of God out from you or came it unto you
only  1437 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual
let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
commandments of the Lord

1438 But if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant

1439 Wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak
with tongues

1440 Let all things be done decently and in order

151 Moreover brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I
preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand
