Mero tossed down his wine straightaway wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and leered at Dany I believe I fucked your twin sister in a pleasure house back home Or was it you

I think not I would remember a man of such magnificence I have no doubt

Yes that is so No woman has ever forgotten the Titan’s Bastard The Braavosi held out his cup to Jhiqui What say you take those clothes off and come sit on my lap If you please me I might bring the Second Sons over to your side

If you bring the Second Sons over to my side I might not have you gelded

The big man laughed Little girl another woman once tried to geld me with her teeth She has no teeth now but my sword is as long and thick as ever Shall I take it out and show you

No need After my eunuchs cut it off I can examine it at my leisure Dany took a sip of wine It is true that I am only a young girl and do not know the ways of war Explain to me how you propose to defeat ten thousand Unsullied with your five hundred Innocent as I am these odds seem poor to me

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run At Qohor when the Three Thousand made their stand Or do you deny it

That was many and more years ago before the Second Sons were led by the Titan’s Bastard

So it is from you they get their courage Dany turned to Ser Jorah When the battle is joined kill this one first

The exile knight smiled Gladly Your Grace

Of course she said to Mero you could run again We will not stop you Take your Yunkish gold and go

Had you ever seen the Titan of Braavos foolish girl you would know that it has no tail to turn

Then stay and fight for me

You are worth fighting for it is true the Braavosi said and I would gladly let you kiss my sword if I were free But I have taken Yunkai’s coin and pledged my holy word

Coins can be returned she said I will pay you as much and more I have other cities to conquer and a whole kingdom awaiting me half a world away Serve me faithfully and the Second Sons need never seek hire again

The Braavosi tugged on his thick red beard As much and more and perhaps a kiss besides eh Or more than a kiss For a man as magnificent as me

Perhaps

I will like the taste of your tongue I think

She could sense Ser Jorah’s anger My black bear does not like this talk of kissing Think on what I’ve said tonight Can I have your answer on the morrow

You can The Titan’s Bastard grinned Can I have a flagon of this fine wine to take back to my captains

You may have a tun It is from the cellars of the Good Masters of Astapor and I have wagons full of it

Then give me a wagon A token of your good regard

You have a big thirst

I am big all over And I have many brothers The Titan’s Bastard does not drink alone Khaleesi

A wagon it is if you promise to drink to my health

Done he boomed And done and done Three toasts we’ll drink you and bring you an answer when the sun comes up

But when Mero was gone Arstan Whitebeard said That one has an evil reputation even in Westeros Do not be misled by his manner Your Grace He will drink three toasts to your health tonight and rape you on the morrow

The old man’s right for once Ser Jorah said The Second Sons are an old company and not without valor but under Mero they’ve turned near as bad as the Brave Companions The man is as dangerous to his employers as to his foes That’s why you find him out here None of the Free Cities will hire him any longer

It is not his reputation that I want it’s his five hundred horse What of the Stormcrows is there any hope there

No Ser Jorah said bluntly That Prendahl is Ghiscari by blood Likely he had kin in Astapor

A pity Well perhaps we will not need to fight Let us wait and hear what the Yunkai’i have to say

The envoys from Yunkai arrived as the sun was going down fifty men on magnificent black horses and one on a great white camel Their helms were twice as tall as their heads so as not to crush the bizarre twists and towers and shapes of their oiled hair beneath They dyed their linen skirts and tunics a deep yellow and sewed copper disks to their cloaks

The man on the white camel named himself Grazdan mo Eraz Lean and hard he had a white smile such as Kraznys had worn until Drogon burned off his face His hair was drawn up in a unicorn’s horn that jutted from his brow and his tokar was fringed with golden Myrish lace Ancient and glorious is Yunkai the queen of cities he said when Dany welcomed him to her tent Our walls are strong our nobles proud and fierce our common folk without fear Ours is the blood of ancient Ghis whose empire was old when Valyria was yet a squalling child You were wise to sit and speak Khaleesi You shall find no easy conquest here 

Good My Unsullied will relish a bit of a fight She looked to Grey Worm who nodded

Grazdan shrugged expansively If blood is what you wish let it flow I am told you have freed your eunuchs Freedom means as much to an Unsullied as a hat to a haddock He smiled at Grey Worm but the eunuch might have been made of stone Those who survive we shall enslave again and use to retake Astapor from the rabble We can make a slave of you as well do not doubt it There are pleasure houses in Lys and Tyrosh where men would pay handsomely to bed the last Targaryen

It is good to see you know who I am said Dany mildly

I pride myself on my knowledge of the savage senseless west Grazdan spread his hands a gesture of conciliation And yet why should we speak thus harshly to one another It is true that you committed savageries in Astapor but we Yunkai’i are a most forgiving people Your quarrel is not with us Your Grace Why squander your strength against our mighty walls when you will need every man to regain your father’s throne in far Westeros Yunkai wishes you only well in that endeavor And to prove the truth of that I have brought you a gift He clapped his hands and two of his escort came forward bearing a heavy cedar chest bound in bronze and gold They set it at her feet Fifty thousand golden marks Grazdan said smoothly Yours as a gesture of friendship from the Wise Masters of Yunkai Gold given freely is better than plunder bought with blood surely So I say to you Daenerys Targaryen take this chest and go

Dany pushed open the lid of the chest with a small slippered foot It was full of gold coins just as the envoy said She grabbed a handful and let them run through her fingers They shone brightly as they tumbled and fell new minted most of them stamped with a stepped pyramid on one face and the harpy of Ghis on the other Very pretty I wonder how many chests like this I shall find when I take your city

He chuckled None for that you shall never do

I have a gift for you as well She slammed the chest shut Three days On the morning of the third day send out your slaves All of them Every man woman and child shall be given a weapon and as much food clothing coin and goods as he or she can carry These they shall be allowed to choose freely from among their masters’ possessions as payment for their years of servitude When all the slaves have departed you will open your gates and allow my Unsullied to enter and search your city to make certain none remain in bondage If you do this Yunkai will not be burned or plundered and none of your people shall be molested The Wise Masters will have the peace they desire and will have proved themselves wise indeed What say you

I say you are mad

Am I Dany shrugged and said Dracarys

The dragons answered Rhaegal hissed and smoked Viserion snapped and Drogon spat swirling red-black flame It touched the drape of Grazdan’s tokar and the silk caught in half a heartbeat Golden marks spilled across the carpets as the envoy stumbled over the chest shouting curses and beating at his arm until Whitebeard flung a flagon of water over him to douse the flames You swore I should have safe conduct the Yunkish envoy wailed

Do all the Yunkai’i whine so over a singed tokar I shall buy you a new one… if you deliver up your slaves within three days Elsewise Drogon shall give you a warmer kiss She wrinkled her nose You’ve soiled yourself Take your gold and go and see that the Wise Masters hear my message

Grazdan mo Eraz pointed a finger You shall rue this arrogance whore These little lizards will not keep you safe I promise you We will fill the air with arrows if they come within a league of Yunkai Do you think it is so hard to kill a dragon

Harder than to kill a slaver Three days Grazdan Tell them By the end of the third day I will be in Yunkai whether you open your gates for me or no

Full dark had fallen by the time the Yunkai’i departed from her camp It promised to be a gloomy night moonless starless with a chill wet wind blowing from the west A fine black night thought Dany The fires burned all around her small orange stars strewn across hill and field Ser Jorah she said summon my bloodriders Dany seated herself on a mound of cushions to await them her dragons all about her When they were assembled she said An hour past midnight should be time enough

Yes Khaleesi said Rakharo Time for what

To mount our attack
