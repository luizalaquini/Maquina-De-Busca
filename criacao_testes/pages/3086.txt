wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your
own sight for all your evils that ye have committed

2044 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor
according to your corrupt doings O ye house of Israel saith the Lord
GOD

2045 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 2046 Son of
man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the
south and prophesy against the forest of the south field 2047 And
say to the forest of the south Hear the word of the LORD Thus saith
the Lord GOD Behold I will kindle a fire in thee and it shall
devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame
shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall
be burned therein

2048 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it it
shall not be quenched

2049 Then said I Ah Lord GOD they say of me Doth he not speak
parables  211 And the word of the LORD came unto me saying 212
Son of man set thy face toward Jerusalem and drop thy word toward
the holy places and prophesy against the land of Israel 213 And say
to the land of Israel Thus saith the LORD Behold I am against thee
and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from
thee the righteous and the wicked

214 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the
wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against
all flesh from the south to the north 215 That all flesh may know
that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall
not return any more

216 Sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins
and with bitterness sigh before their eyes

217 And it shall be when they say unto thee Wherefore sighest thou
that thou shalt answer For the tidings because it cometh and every
heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit
shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh
and shall be brought to pass saith the Lord GOD

218 Again the word of the LORD came unto me saying 219 Son of man
prophesy and say Thus saith the LORD Say A sword a sword is
sharpened and also furbished 2110 It is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make
mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree

2111 And he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled
this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand
of the slayer

2112 Cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it
shall be upon all the princes of Israel terrors by reason of the
sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh

2113 Because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the
rod  it shall be no more saith the Lord GOD

2114 Thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands
together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of
the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which
entereth into their privy chambers

2115 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates that
their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made
bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter

2116 Go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the
left whithersoever thy face is set

2117 I will also smite mine hands together and I will cause my fury
to rest I the LORD have said it

2118 The word of the LORD came unto me again saying 2119 Also
thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of
Babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and
choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city

2120 Appoint a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
Ammonites and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced

2121 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way at the
head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he
consulted with images he looked in the liver

2122 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem to appoint
captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice
with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a
mount and to build a fort

2123 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight
to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the
iniquity that they may be taken

2124 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Because ye have made your
iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered
so that in all your doings your sins do appear because I say that
ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand
