Sansa felt as though she were in a dream Joffrey is dead she told the trees to see if that would wake her

He had not been dead when she left the throne room He had been on his knees though clawing at his throat tearing at his own skin as he fought to breathe The sight of it had been too terrible to watch and she had turned and fled sobbing Lady Tanda had been fleeing as well You have a good heart my lady she said to Sansa Not every maid would weep so for a man who set her aside and wed her to a dwarf

A good heart I have a good heart Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet but Sansa choked it back down The bells were ringing slow and mournful Ringing ringing ringing They had rung for King Robert the same way Joffrey was dead he was dead he was dead dead dead Why was she crying when she wanted to dance Were they tears of joy

She found her clothes where she had hidden them the night before last With no maids to help her it took her longer than it should have to undo the laces of her gown Her hands were strangely clumsy though she was not as frightened as she ought to have been The gods are cruel to take him so young and handsome at his own wedding feast Lady Tanda had said to her

The gods are just thought Sansa Robb had died at a wedding feast as well It was Robb she wept for Him and Margaery Poor Margaery twice wed and twice widowed Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve pushed down the gown and wriggled out of it She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak shook out the clothing she had hidden there Dress warmly Ser Dontos had told her and dress dark She had no blacks so she chose a dress of thick brown wool The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls though The cloak will cover them The cloak was a deep green with a large hood She slipped the dress over her head and donned the cloak though she left the hood down for the moment There were shoes as well simple and sturdy with flat heels and square toes The gods heard my prayer she thought She felt so numb and dreamy My skin has turned to porcelain to ivory to steel Her hands moved stiffly awkwardly as if they had never let down her hair before For a moment she wished Shae was there to help her with the net

When she pulled it free her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders The web of spun silver hung from her fingers the fine metal glimmering softly the stones black in the moonlight Black amethysts from Asshai One of them was missing Sansa lifted the net for a closer look There was a dark smudge in the silver socket where the stone had fallen out

A sudden terror filled her Her heart hammered against her ribs and for an instant she held her breath Why am I so scared it’s only an amethyst a black amethyst from Asshai no more than that It must have been loose in the setting that’s all It was loose and it fell out and now it’s lying somewhere in the throne room or in the yard unless…

Ser Dontos had said the hair net was magic that it would take her home He told her she must wear it tonight at Joffrey’s wedding feast The silver wire stretched tight across her knuckles Her thumb rubbed back and forth against the hole where the stone had been She tried to stop but her fingers were not her own Her thumb was drawn to the hole as the tongue is drawn to a missing tooth What kind of magic The king was dead the cruel king who had been her gallant prince a thousand years ago If Dontos had lied about the hair net had he lied about the rest as well What if he never comes What if there is no ship no boat on the river no escape What would happen to her then

She heard a faint rustle of leaves and stuffed the silver hair net down deep in the pocket of her cloak Who’s there she cried Who is it The godswood was dim and dark and the bells were ringing Joff into his grave

Me He staggered out from under the trees reeling drunk He caught her arm to steady himself Sweet Jonquil I’ve come Your Florian has come don’t be afraid

Sansa pulled away from his touch You said I must wear the hair net The silver net with… what sort of stones are those

Amethysts Black amethysts from Asshai my lady

They’re no amethysts Are they Are they You lied

Black amethysts he swore There was magic in them

There was murder in them

Softly my lady softly No murder He choked on his pigeon pie Dontos chortled Oh tasty tasty pie Silver and stones that’s all it was silver and stone and magic

The bells were tolling and the wind was making a noise like he had made as he tried to suck a breath of air You poisoned him You did You took a stone from my hair…

Hush you’ll be the death of us I did nothing Come we must away they’ll search for you Your husband’s been arrested

Tyrion she said shocked

Do you have another husband The Imp the dwarf uncle she thinks he did it He grabbed her hand and pulled at her This way we must away quickly now have no fear

Sansa followed unresisting I could never abide the weeping of women Joff once said but his mother was the only woman weeping now In Old Nan’s stories the grumkins crafted magic things that could make a wish come true Did I wish him dead she wondered before she remembered that she was too old to believe in grumkins Tyrion poisoned him Her dwarf husband had hated his nephew she knew Could he truly have killed him Did he know about my hair net about the black amethysts He brought Joff wine How could you make someone choke by putting an amethyst in their wine If Tyrion did it they will think I was part of it as well she realized with a start of fear How not They were man and wife and Joff had killed her father and mocked her with her brother’s death One flesh one heart one soul

Be quiet now my sweetling said Dontos Outside the godswood we must make no sound Pull up your hood and hide your face Sansa nodded and did as he said

He was so drunk that sometimes Sansa had to lend him her arm to keep him from falling The bells were ringing out across the city more and more of them joining in She kept her head down and stayed in the shadows close behind Dontos While descending the serpentine steps he stumbled to his knees and retched My poor Florian she thought as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve Dress dark he’d said yet under his brown hooded cloak he was wearing his old surcoat red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns the arms of House Hollard Why are you wearing your surcoat Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again he… oh… Nothing Joff had decreed mattered any longer

I wanted to be a knight For this at least Dontos lurched back to his feet and took her arm Come Be quiet now no questions

They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper They were inside a long gallery Along the walls stood empty suits of armor dark and dusty their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs As they hurried past the taper’s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist The hollow knights are turning into dragons she thought

One more stair took them to an oaken door banded with iron Be strong now my Jonquil you are almost there When Dontos lifted the bar and pulled open the door Sansa felt a cold breeze on her face She passed through twelve feet of wall and then she was outside the castle standing at the top of the cliff Below was the river above the sky and one was as black as the other

We must climb down Ser Dontos said At the bottom a man is waiting to row us out to the ship

I’ll fall Bran had fallen and he had loved to climb

No you won’t There’s a sort of ladder a secret ladder carved into the stone Here you can feel it my lady He got down on his knees with her and made her lean over the edge of the cliff groping with her fingers until she found the handhold cut into the face of the bluff Almost as good as rungs

Even so it was a long way down I can’t

You must

Isn’t there another way

This is the way It won’t be so hard for a strong young girl like you Hold on tight and never look down and you’ll be at the bottom in no time at all His eyes were shiny Your poor Florian is fat and old and drunk I’m the one should be afraid I used to fall off my horse don’t you remember That was how we began I was drunk and fell off my horse and Joffrey wanted my fool head but you saved me You saved me sweetling

He’s weeping she realized And now you have saved me

Only if you go If not I have killed us both

It was him she thought He killed Joffrey She had to go for him as much as for herself You go first ser If he did fall she did not want him falling down on her head and knocking both of them off the cliff

As you wish my lady He gave her a sloppy kiss and swung his legs clumsily over the precipice kicking about until he found a foothold Let me get down a bit and come after You will come now You must swear it

I’ll come she promised

Ser Dontos disappeared She could hear him huffing and puffing as he began the descent Sansa listened to the tolling of the bell counting each ring At ten gingerly she eased herself over the edge of the cliff poking with her toes until they found a place to rest The castle walls loomed large above her and for a moment she wanted nothing so much as to pull herself up and run back to her warm rooms in the Kitchen Keep Be brave she told herself Be brave like a lady in a song

Sansa dared not look down She kept her eyes on the face of the cliff making certain of each step before reaching for the next The stone was rough and cold Sometimes she could feel her fingers slipping and the handholds were not as evenly spaced as she would have liked The bells would not stop ringing Before she was halfway down her arms were trembling and she knew that she was going to fall One more step she told herself one more step She had to keep moving If she stopped she would never start again and dawn would find her still clinging to the cliff frozen in fear One more step and one more step

The ground took her by surprise She stumbled and fell her heart pounding When she rolled onto her back and stared up at from where she had come her head swam dizzily and her fingers clawed at the dirt I did it I did it I didn’t fall I made the climb and now I’m going home

Ser Dontos pulled her back onto her feet This way Quiet now quiet quiet He stayed close to the shadows that lay black and thick beneath the cliffs Thankfully they did not have to go far Fifty yards downriver a man sat in a small skiff half-hidden by the remains of a great galley that had gone aground there and burned Dontos limped up to him puffing Oswell

No names the man said In the boat He sat hunched over his oars an old man tall and gangling with long white hair and a great hooked nose with eyes shaded by a cowl Get in be quick about it he muttered We need to be away

When both of them were safe aboard the cowled man slid the blades into the water and put his back into the oars rowing them out toward the channel Behind them the bells were still tolling the boy king’s death They had the dark river all to themselves

With slow steady rhythmic strokes they threaded their way downstream sliding above the sunken galleys past broken masts burned hulls and torn sails The oarlocks had been muffled so they moved almost soundlessly A mist was rising over the water Sansa saw the embattled ramparts of one of the Imp’s winch towers looming above but the great chain had been lowered and they rowed unimpeded past the spot where a thousand men had burned The shore fell away the fog grew thicker the sound of the bells began to fade Finally even the lights were gone lost somewhere behind them They were out in Blackwater Bay and the world shrank to dark water blowing mist and their silent companion stooped over the oars How far must we go she asked

No talk The oarsman was old but stronger than he looked and his voice was fierce There was something oddly familiar about his face though Sansa could not say what it was

Not far Ser Dontos took her hand in his own and rubbed it gently Your friend is near waiting for you

No talk the oarsman growled again Sound carries over water Ser Fool

Abashed Sansa bit her lip and huddled down in silence The rest was rowing rowing rowing

The eastern sky was vague with the first hint of dawn when Sansa finally saw a ghostly shape in the darkness ahead a trading galley her sails furled moving slowly on a single bank of oars As they drew closer she saw the ship’s figurehead a merman with a golden crown blowing on a great seashell horn She heard a voice cry out and the galley swung slowly about
