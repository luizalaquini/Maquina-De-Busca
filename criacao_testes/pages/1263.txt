She filched one anyway and ate it on her way out It was stuffed with chopped nuts and fruit and cheese the crust flaky and still warm from the oven Eating Ser Amory’s tart made Arya feel daring Barefoot surefoot lightfoot she sang under her breath I am the ghost in Harrenhal

The horn had stirred the castle from sleep men were coming out into the ward to see what the commotion was about Arya fell in with the others A line of ox carts were rumbling under the portcullis Plunder she knew at once The riders escorting the carts spoke in a babble of queer tongues Their armor glinted pale in the moonlight and she saw a pair of striped black-and-white zorses The Bloody Mummers Arya withdrew a little deeper into the shadows and watched as a huge black bear rolled by caged in the back of a wagon Other carts were loaded down with silver plate weapons and shields bags of flour pens of squealing hogs and scrawny dogs and chickens Arya was thinking how long it had been since she’d had a slice off a pork roast when she saw the first of the prisoners

By his bearing and the proud way he held his head he must have been a lord She could see mail glinting beneath his torn red surcoat At first Arya took him for a Lannister but when he passed near a torch she saw his device was a silver fist not a lion His wrists were bound tightly and a rope around one ankle tied him to the man behind him and him to the man behind him so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep Many of the captives were wounded If any halted one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of the whip to get him moving again She tried to judge how many prisoners there were but lost count before she got to fifty There were twice that many at least Their clothing was stained with mud and blood and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all their badges and sigils but some of those Arya glimpsed she recognized Twin towers Sunburst Bloody man Battle-axe The battle-axe is for Cerwyn and the white sun on black is Karstark They’re northmen My father’s men and Robb’s She didn’t like to think what that might mean

The Bloody Mummers began to dismount Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to tend their lathered horses One of the riders was shouting for ale The noise brought Ser Amory Lorch out onto the covered gallery above the ward flanked by two torchbearers Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below him My lord cathellan the sellsword said He had a thick slobbery voice as if his tongue was too big for his mouth

What’s all this Hoat Ser Amory demanded frowning

Captiths Rooth Bolton thought to croth the river but my Brafe Companions cut his van to pieceth Killed many and thent Bolton running Thith ith their lord commander Glover and the one behind ith Ther Aenyth Frey

Ser Amory Lorch stared down at the roped captives with his little pig eyes Arya did not think he was pleased Everyone in the castle knew that he and Vargo Hoat hated each other Very well he said Ser Cadwyn take these men to the dungeons

The lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat raised his eyes We were promised honorable treatment— he began

Silenth Vargo Hoat screamed at him spraying spittle

Ser Amory addressed the captives What Hoat promised you is nothing to me Lord Tywin made me the castellan of Harrenhal and I shall do with you as I please He gestured to his guards The great cell under the Widow’s Tower ought to hold them all Any who do not care to go are free to die here

As his men herded off the captives at spearpoint Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the stairwell blinking at the torchlight If he found her missing he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her but she was not afraid He was no Weese He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one but Arya never actually knew him to hit Still it would be better if he never saw her She glanced around The oxen were being unharnessed the carts unloaded while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the curious gathered around the caged bear In the commotion it was not hard to slip off unseen She went back the way she had come wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her and thought to put her to work

Away from the gates and the stables the great castle was largely deserted The noise dwindled behind her A swirling wind gusted drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks in the Wailing Tower Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood and she could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones Now that Harrenhal was near empty once again sound did queer things here Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up noise shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence Other times the echoes had a life of their own so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army and every distant voice a ghostly feast The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie but not Arya

Quiet as a shadow she flitted across the middle bailey around the Tower of Dread and through the empty mews where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with ghostly wings She could go where she would The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal The Hall of a Hundred Hearths was closed off along with many of the lesser buildings even the Wailing Tower Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan’s chambers in Kingspyre themselves as spacious as a lord’s and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be close at hand While Lord Tywin had been in residence there was always a man-at-arms wanting to know your business But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a thousand doors and no one seemed to know who should be where or care much

As she passed the armory Arya heard the ring of a hammer A deep orange glow shone through the high windows She climbed to the roof and peeked down Gendry was beating out a breastplate When he worked nothing existed for him but metal bellows fire The hammer was like part of his arm She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made He’s strong she thought As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the breastplate into the quenching trough Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to the floor beside him

He did not seem surprised to see her You should be abed girl The breastplate hissed like a cat as he dipped it in the cold water What was all that noise

Vargo Hoat’s come back with prisoners I saw their badges There’s a Glover from Deepwood Motte he’s my father’s man The rest too mostly All of a sudden Arya knew why her feet had brought her here You have to help me get them out

Gendry laughed And how do we do that

Ser Amory sent them down to the dungeon The one under the Widow’s Tower that’s just one big cell You could smash the door open with your hammer—

While the guards watch and make bets on how many swings it will take me maybe

Arya chewed her lips We’d need to kill the guards

How are we supposed to do that

Maybe there won’t be a lot of them

If there’s two that’s too many for you and me You never learned nothing in that village did you You try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet the way he does Gendry took up the tongs again

You’re afraid

Leave me alone girl

Gendry there’s a hundred northmen Maybe more I couldn’t count them all That’s as many as Ser Amory has Well not counting the Bloody Mummers We just have to get them out and we can take over the castle and escape

Well you can’t get them out no more’n you could save Lommy Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely And if we did escape where would we go

Winterfell she said at once I’d tell Mother how you helped me and you could stay—

Would m’lady permit Could I shoe your horses for you and make swords for your lordly brothers

Sometimes he made her so angry You stop that

Why should I wager my feet for the chance to sweat in Winterfell in place of Harrenhal You know old Ben Blackthumb He came here as a boy Smithed for Lady Whent and her father before her and his father before him and even for Lord Lothston who held Harrenhal before the Whents Now he smiths for Lord Tywin and you know what he says A sword’s a sword a helm’s a helm and if you reach in the fire you get burned no matter who you’re serving Lucan’s a fair enough master I’ll stay here

The queen will catch you then She didn’t send gold cloaks after Ben Blackthumb

Likely it wasn’t even me they wanted

It was too you know it You’re somebody

I’m a ’prentice smith and one day might be I’ll make a master armorer… if I don’t run off and lose my feet or get myself killed He turned away from her picked up his hammer once more and began to bang

Arya’s hands curled into helpless fists The next helm you make put mule’s ears on it in place of bull’s horns She had to flee or else she would have started hitting him He probably wouldn’t even feel it if I did When they find who he is and cut off his stupid mulehead he’ll be sorry he didn’t help She was better off without him anyhow He was the one who got her caught at the village

But thinking of the village made her remember the march and the storeroom and the Tickler She thought of the little boy who’d been hit in the face with the mace of stupid old All-for-Joffrey of Lommy Greenhands I was a sheep and then I was a mouse I couldn’t do anything but hide Arya chewed her lip and tried to think when her courage had come back Jaqen made me brave again He made me a ghost instead of a mouse

She had been avoiding the Lorathi since Weese’s death Chiswyck had been easy anyone could push a man off the wallwalk but Weese had raised that ugly spotted dog from a pup and only some dark magic could have turned the animal against him Yoren found Jaqen in a black cell the same as Rorge and Biter she remembered Jaqen did something horrible and Yoren knew that’s why he kept him in chains If the Lorathi was a wizard Rorge and Biter could be demons he called up from some hell not men at all

Jaqen still owed her one death In Old Nan’s stories about men who were given magic wishes by a grumkin you had to be especially careful with the third wish because it was the last Chiswyck and Weese hadn’t been very important The last death has to count Arya told herself every night when she whispered her names But now she wondered if that was truly the reason she had hesitated So long as she could kill with a whisper Arya need not be afraid of anyone… but once she used up the last death she would only be a mouse again

With Pinkeye awake she dared not go back to her bed Not knowing where else to hide she made for the godswood She liked the sharp smell of the pines and sentinels the feel of grass and dirt between her toes and the sound the wind made in the leaves A slow little stream meandered through the wood and there was one spot where it had eaten the ground away beneath a deadfall

There beneath rotting wood and twisted splintered branches she found her hidden sword

Gendry was too stubborn to make one for her so she had made her own by breaking the bristles off a broom Her blade was much too light and had no proper grip but she liked the sharp jagged splintery end

Whenever she had a free hour she stole away to work at the drills Syrio had taught her moving barefoot over the fallen leaves slashing at branches and whacking down leaves Sometimes she even climbed the trees and danced among the upper branches her toes gripping the limbs as she moved back and forth teetering a little less every day as her balance returned to her Night was the best time no one ever bothered her at night

Arya climbed Up in the kingdom of the leaves she unsheathed and for a time forgot them all Ser Amory and the Mummers and her father’s men alike losing herself in the feel of rough wood beneath the soles of her feet and the swish of sword through air A broken branch became Joffrey She struck at it until it fell away The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the Hound were only leaves but she killed them all as well slashing them to wet green ribbons When her arm grew weary she sat with her legs over a high limb to catch her breath in the cool dark air listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted Through the leafy canopy she could see the bone-white branches of the heart tree It looks just like the one in Winterfell from here If only it had been… then when she climbed down she would have been home again and maybe find her father sitting under the weirwood where he always sat

Shoving her sword through her belt she slipped down branch to branch until she was back on the ground The light of the moon painted the limbs of the weirwood silvery white as she made her way toward it but the five-pointed red leaves turned black by night Arya stared at the face carved into its trunk It was a terrible face its mouth twisted its eyes flaring and full of hate Is that what a god looked like Could gods be hurt the same as people I should pray she thought suddenly

Arya went to her knees She wasn’t sure how she should begin She clasped her hands together Help me you old gods she prayed silently Help me get those men out of the dungeon so we can kill Ser Amory and bring me home to Winterfell Make me a water dancer and a wolf and not afraid again ever

Was that enough Maybe she should pray aloud if she wanted the old gods to hear Maybe she should pray longer Sometimes her father had prayed a long time she remembered But the old gods had never helped him Remembering that made her angry You should have saved him she scolded the tree He prayed to you all the time I don’t care if you help me or not I don’t think you could even if you wanted to

Gods are not mocked girl

The voice startled her She leapt to her feet and drew her wooden sword Jaqen H’ghar stood so still in the darkness that he seemed one of the trees A man comes to hear a name One and two and then comes three A man would have done

Arya lowered the splintery point toward the ground How did you know I was here
