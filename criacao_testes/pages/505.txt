He thought Ygritte might try to run but she only stood there waiting looking at him You never killed a woman before did you When he shook his head she said We die the same as men But you don’t need to do it Mance would take you I know he would There’s secret ways Them crows would never catch us

I’m as much a crow as they are Jon said

She nodded resigned Will you burn me after

I can’t The smoke might be seen

That’s so She shrugged Well there’s worse places to end up than the belly of a shadowcat

He pulled Longclaw over a shoulder Aren’t you afraid

Last night I was she admitted But now the sun’s up She pushed her hair aside to bare her neck and knelt before him Strike hard and true crow or I’ll come back and haunt you

Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father’s Ice but it was Valyrian steel all the same He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall and Ygritte shivered That’s cold she said Go on be quick about it

He raised Longclaw over his head both hands tight around the grip One cut with all my weight behind it He could give her a quick clean death at least He was his father’s son Wasn’t he Wasn’t he

Do it she urged him after a moment Bastard Do it I can’t stay brave forever When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him

Jon lowered his sword Go he muttered

Ygritte stared

Now he said before my wits return Go

She went





SANSA

The southern sky was black with smoke It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires its sooty fingers smudging out the stars Across the Blackwater Rush a line of flame burned nightly from horizon to horizon while on this side the Imp had fired the whole riverfront docks and warehouses homes and brothels everything outside the city walls

Even in the Red Keep the air tasted of ashes When Sansa found Ser Dontos in the quiet of the godswood he asked if she’d been crying It’s only from the smoke she lied It looks as though half the kingswood is burning

Lord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imp’s savages Dontos swayed as he spoke one hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree A wine stain discolored the red-and-yellow motley of his tunic They kill his scouts and raid his baggage train And the wildlings have been lighting fires too The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train his horses to eat ash since he would find no blade of grass I heard him say so I hear all sorts of things as a fool that I never heard when I was a knight They talk as though I am not there and—he leaned close breathing his winey breath right in her face—the Spider pays in gold for any little trifle I think Moon Boy has been his for years

He is drunk again My poor Florian he names himself and so he is But he is all I have Is it true Lord Stannis burned the godswood at Storm’s End

Dontos nodded He made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to his new god The red priestess made him do it They say she rules him now body and soul He’s vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor too if he takes the city

Let him When Sansa had first beheld the Great Sept with its marble walls and seven crystal towers she’d thought it was the most beautiful building in the world but that had been before Joffrey beheaded her father on its steps I want it burned

Hush child the gods will hear you

Why should they They never hear my prayers

Yes they do They sent me to you didn’t they

Sansa picked at the bark of a tree She felt light-headed almost feverish They sent you but what good have you done You promised you would take me home but I’m still here
