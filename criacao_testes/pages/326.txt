A handful of Lordsport merchants had gathered to meet the ship They shouted questions as the Myraham was tying up We’re out of Oldtown the captain called down bearing apples and oranges wines from the Arbor feathers from the Summer Isles I have pepper woven leathers a bolt of Myrish lace mirrors for milady a pair of Oldtown woodharps sweet as any you ever heard The gangplank descended with a creak and a thud And I’ve brought your heir back to you

The Lordsport men gazed on Theon with blank bovine eyes and he realized that they did not know who he was It made him angry He pressed a golden dragon into the captain’s palm Have your men bring my things Without waiting for a reply he strode down the gangplank Innkeeper he barked I require a horse

As you say m’lord the man responded without so much as a bow He had forgotten how bold the ironborn could be Happens as I have one might do Where would you be riding m’lord

Pyke The fool still did not know him He should have worn his good doublet with the kraken embroidered on the breast

You’ll want to be off soon to reach Pyke afore dark the innkeeper said My boy will go with you and show you the way

Your boy will not be needed a deep voice called nor your horse I shall see my nephew back to his father’s house

The speaker was the priest he had seen leading the horses along the shoreline As the man approached the smallfolk bent the knee and Theon heard the innkeeper murmur Damphair

Tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose the priest was garbed in mottled robes of green and grey and blue the swirling colors of the Drowned God A waterskin hung under his arm on a leather strap and ropes of dried seaweed were braided through his waist-long black hair and untrimmed beard

A memory prodded at Theon in one of his rare curt letters Lord Balon had written of his youngest brother going down in a storm and turning holy when he washed up safe on shore Uncle Aeron he said doubtfully

Nephew Theon the priest replied Your lord father bid me fetch you Come

In a moment Uncle He turned back to the Myraham My things he commanded the captain

A sailor fetched him down his tall yew bow and quiver of arrows but it was the captain’s daughter who brought the pack with his good clothing Milord Her eyes were red When he took the pack she made as if to embrace him there in front of her own father and his priestly uncle and half the island

Theon turned deftly aside You have my thanks

Please she said I do love you well milord

I must go He hurried after his uncle who was already well down the pier Theon caught him with a dozen long strides I had not looked for you Uncle After ten years I thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come themselves or send Dagmer with an honor guard

It is not for you to question the commands of the Lord Reaper of Pyke The priest’s manner was chilly most unlike the man Theon remembered Aeron Greyjoy had been the most amiable of his uncles feckless and quick to laugh fond of songs ale and women As to Dagmer the Cleftjaw is gone to Old Wyk at your father’s behest to roust the Stonehouses and the Drumms

To what purpose Why are the longships hosting

Why have longships ever hosted His uncle had left the horses tied up in front of the waterside inn When they reached them he turned to Theon Tell me true nephew Do you pray to the wolf gods now

Theon seldom prayed at all but that was not something you confessed to a priest even your father’s own brother Ned Stark prayed to a tree No I care nothing for Stark’s gods

Good Kneel

The ground was all stones and mud Uncle I—

Kneel Or are you too proud now a lordling of the green lands come among us

Theon knelt He had a purpose here and might need Aeron’s help to achieve it A crown was worth a little mud and horseshit on his breeches he supposed

Bow your head Lifting the skin his uncle pulled the cork and directed a thin stream of seawater down upon Theon’s head It drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his eyes Sheets washed down his cheeks and a finger crept under his cloak and doublet and down his back a cold rivulet along his spine The salt made his eyes burn until it was all he could do not to cry out He could taste the ocean on his lips Let Theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were Aeron Greyjoy intoned Bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel Nephew do you still know the words

What is dead may never die Theon said remembering

What is dead may never die his uncle echoed but rises again harder and stronger Stand

Theon stood blinking back tears from the salt in his eyes Wordless his uncle corked the waterskin untied his horse and mounted Theon did the same They set off together leaving the inn and the harbor behind them up past the castle of Lord Botley into the stony hills The priest ventured no further word
