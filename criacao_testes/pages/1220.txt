The outer gates were banded with copper the middle with iron the innermost were studded with golden eyes All opened at Dany’s approach As she rode her silver into the city small children rushed out to scatter flowers in her path They wore golden sandals and bright paint no more

All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose violet and umber She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating their scales delicate flakes of jade obsidian and lapis lazuli Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had ever seen and elaborate fountains filled every square wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores

The Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support their weight They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur every one a lord or lady to her eyes The women wore gowns that left one breast bare while the men favored beaded silk skirts Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin robe with black Drogon on one shoulder Her Dothraki called the Qartheen Milk Men for their paleness and Khal Drogo had dreamed of the day when he might sack the great cities of the east She glanced at her bloodriders their dark almond-shaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts Is it only the plunder they see she wondered How savage we must seem to these Qartheen

Pyrat Pree conducted her little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the city’s ancient heroes stood thrice life-size on columns of white and green marble They passed through a bazaar in a cavernous building whose latticework ceiling was home to a thousand gaily colored birds Trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls while below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale

Her silver shied as the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos rode up to her the horses could not abide the close presence of camels she had found If you see here anything that you would desire O most beautiful of women you have only to speak and it is yours Xaro called down from his ornate horned saddle

Qarth itself is hers she has no need of baubles blue-lipped Pyat Pree sang out from her other side It shall be as I promised Khaleesi Come with me to the House of the Undying and you shall drink of truth and wisdom

Why should she need your Palace of Dust when I can give her sunlight and sweet water and silks to sleep in Xaro said to the warlock The Thirteen shall set a crown of black jade and fire opals upon her lovely head

The only palace I desire is the red castle at King’s Landing my lord Pyat Dany was wary of the warlock the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had soured her on those who played at sorcery And if the great of Qarth would give me gifts Xaro let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine

Pyat’s blue lips curled upward in a gracious smile it shall be as you command Khaleesi He moved away swaying with his camel’s motion his long beaded robes trailing behind

The young queen is wise beyond her years Xaro Xhoan Daxos murmured down at her from his high saddle There is a saying in Qarth A warlock’s house is built of bones and lies

Then why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of Qarth All across the east their power and wisdom are revered

Once they were mighty Xaro agreed but now they are as ludicrous as those feeble old soldiers who boast of their prowess long after strength and skill have left them They read their crumbling scrolls drink shade-of-the-evening until their lips turn blue and hint of dread powers but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before Pyat Pree’s gifts will turn to dust in your hands I warn you He gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away

The crow calls the raven black muttered Ser Jorah in the Common Tongue of Westeros The exile knight rode at her right hand as ever For their entrance into Qarth he had put away his Dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the Seven Kingdoms half a world away You would do well to avoid both those men Your Grace

Those men will help me to my crown she said Xaro has vast wealth and Pyat Pree—

—pretends to power the knight said brusquely On his dark green surcoat the bear of House Mormont stood on its hind legs black and fierce Jorah looked no less ferocious as he scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar I would not linger here long my queen I mislike the very smell of this place

Dany smiled Perhaps it’s the camels you’re smelling The Qartheen themselves seem sweet enough to my nose

Sweet smells are sometimes used to cover foul ones

My great bear Dany thought I am his queen but I will always be his cub as well and he will always guard me It made her feel safe but sad as well She wished she could love him better than she did

Xaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the city She had expected something grand She had not expected a palace larger than many a market town It makes Magister Illyrio’s manse in Pentos look like a swineherd’s hovel she thought Xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides indeed it swallowed them An entire wing was given over to her She would have her own gardens a marble bathing pool a scrying tower and warlock’s maze Slaves would tend her every need In her private chambers the floors were green marble the walls draped with colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air You are too generous she told Xaro Xhoan Daxos

For the Mother of Dragons no gift is too great Xaro was a languid elegant man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose crusted with rubies opals and flakes of jade On the morrow you shall feast upon peacock and lark’s tongue and hear music worthy of the most beautiful of women The Thirteen will come to do you homage and all the great of Qarth

All the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons Dany thought yet she thanked Xaro for his kindness before she sent him on his way Pyat Pree took his leave as well vowing to petition the Undying Ones for an audience A honor rare as summer snows Before he left he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air Last of the three seekers to depart was Quaithe the shadowbinder From her Dany received only a warning Beware the woman in the red lacquer mask said

Of whom

Of all They shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into the world and when they see they shall lust For dragons are fire made flesh and fire is power

When Quaithe too was gone Ser Jorah said She speaks truly my queen… though I like her no more than the others

I do not understand her Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons declaring themselves her loyal servants in all things but from Quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word And it disturbed her that she had never seen the woman’s face Remember Mirri Maz Duur she told herself Remember treachery She turned to her bloodriders We will keep our own watch so long as we are here See that no one enters this wing of the palace without my leave and take care that the dragons are always well guarded

It shall be done Khaleesi Aggo said

We have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished us to see she went on Rakharo go forth and look on the rest and tell me what you find Take good men with you—and women to go places where men are forbidden

As you say I do blood of my blood said Rakharo

Ser Jorah find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor It has been half a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms Perhaps the gods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry us home

The knight frowned That would be no kindness The Usurper will kill you sure as sunrise Mormont hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt My place is here at your side

Jhogo can guard me as well You have more languages than my bloodriders and the Dothraki mistrust the sea and those who sail her Only you can serve me in this Go among the ships and speak to the crews learn where they are from and where they are bound and what manner of men command them

Reluctantly the exile nodded As you say my queen

When all the men had gone her handmaids stripped off the travel-stained silks she wore and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico The water was deliciously cool and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle It felt good to close her eyes and float knowing she could rest as long as she liked She wondered whether Aegon’s Red Keep had a pool like this and fragrant gardens full of lavender and mint It must surely Viserys always said the Seven Kingdoms were more beautiful than any other place in the world

The thought of home disquieted her If her sun-and-stars had lived he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies but his strength had left the world Her bloodriders remained sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter but only in the ways of the horselords The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms they did not rule them Dany had no wish to reduce King’s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts She had supped enough on tears I want to make my kingdom beautiful to fill it with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children I want my people to smile when they see me ride by the way Viserys said they smiled for my father

But before she could do that she must conquer

The Usurper will kill you sure as sunrise Mormont had said Robert had slain her gallant brother Rhaegar and one of his creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle a man who loved nothing better than war And with him stood the great lords her brother had named the Usurper’s dogs cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart and the golden Lannisters father and son so rich so powerful so treacherous

How could she hope to overthrow such men When Khal Drogo had lived men trembled and made him gifts to stay his wrath If they did not he took their cities wealth and wives and all But his khalasar had been vast while hers was meager Her people had followed her across the red waste as she chased her comet and would follow her across the poison water too but they would not be enough Even her dragons might not be enough Viserys had believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king… but Viserys had been a fool and fools believe in foolish things

Her doubts made her shiver Suddenly the water felt cold to her and the little fish prickling at her skin annoying Dany stood and climbed from the pool Irri she called Jhiqui

As the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe Dany’s thoughts went to the three who had sought her out in the City of Bones The Bleeding Star led me to Qarth for a purpose Here I will find what I need if I have the strength to take what is offered and the wisdom to avoid the traps and snares If the gods mean for me to conquer they will provide they will send me a sign and if not… if not…

It was near evenfall and Dany was feeding her dragons when Irri stepped through the silken curtains to tell her that Ser Jorah had returned from the docks… and not alone Send him in with whomever he has brought she said curious

When they entered she was seated on a mound of cushions her dragons all about her The man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet Your Grace the knight said I bring you Quhuru Mo captain of the Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town

The black man knelt I am greatly honored my queen he said not in the tongue of the Summer Isles which Dany did not know but in the liquid Valyrian of the Nine Free Cities

The honor is mine Quhuru Mo said Dany in the same language Have you come from the Summer Isles

This is so Your Grace but before not half a year past we called at Oldtown From there I bring you a wondrous gift

A gift

A gift of news Dragonmother Stormborn I tell you true Robert Baratheon is dead

Outside her walls dusk was settling over Qarth but a sun had risen in Dany’s heart Dead she repeated In her lap black Drogon hissed and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil You are certain The Usurper is dead

So it is said in Oldtown and Dorne and Lys and all the other ports where we have called

He sent me poisoned wine yet I live and he is gone What was the manner of his death On her shoulder pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream stirring the air

Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood or so I heard in Oldtown Others say his queen betrayed him or his brother or Lord Stark who was his Hand Yet all the tales agree in this King Robert is dead and in his grave
