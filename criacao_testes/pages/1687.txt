ROSALIND	O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee
	wear thy heart in a scarf

ORLANDO	It is my arm

ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
	of a lion

ORLANDO	Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady

ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief

ORLANDO	Ay and greater wonders than that

	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
	and Caesars thrasonical brag of I came saw and
	overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
	met but they looked no sooner looked but they
	loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
	sighed but they asked one another the reason no
	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
	to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
	else be incontinent before marriage they are in
	the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
	cannot part them

ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow and I will bid the
	duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it
	is to look into happiness through another mans
	eyes By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
	the height of heart-heaviness by how much I shall
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

ROSALIND	Why then to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind

ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking

ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking
	Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose
