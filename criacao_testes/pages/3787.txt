They might be adequate to my needs Dany answered It had been Ser Jorah’s suggestion that she speak only Dothraki and the Common Tongue while in Astapor My bear is more clever than he looks Tell me of their training

The Westerosi woman is pleased with them but speaks no praise to keep the price down the translator told her master She wishes to know how they were trained

Kraznys mo Nakloz bobbed his head He smelled as if he’d bathed in raspberries this slaver and his jutting red-black beard glistened with oil He has larger breasts than I do Dany reflected She could see them through the thin sea-green silk of the gold-fringed tokar he wound about his body and over one shoulder His left hand held the tokar in place as he walked while his right clasped a short leather whip Are all Westerosi pigs so ignorant he complained All the world knows that the Unsullied are masters of spear and shield and shortsword He gave Dany a broad smile Tell her what she would know slave and be quick about it The day is hot

That much at least is no lie A matched pair of slave girls stood behind them holding a striped silk awning over their heads but even in the shade Dany felt light-headed and Kraznys was perspiring freely The Plaza of Pride had been baking in the sun since dawn Even through the thickness of her sandals she could feel the warmth of the red bricks underfoot Waves of heat rose off them shimmering to make the stepped pyramids of Astapor around the plaza seem half a dream

If the Unsullied felt the heat however they gave no hint of it They could be made of brick themselves the way they stand there A thousand had been marched out of their barracks for her inspection drawn up in ten ranks of one hundred before the fountain and its great bronze harpy they stood stiffly at attention their stony eyes fixed straight ahead They wore nought but white linen clouts knotted about their loins and conical bronze helms topped with a sharpened spike a foot tall Kraznys had commanded them to lay down their spears and shields and doff their swordbelts and quilted tunics so the Queen of Westeros might better inspect the lean hardness of their bodies

They are chosen young for size and speed and strength the slave told her They begin their training at five Every day they train from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword the shield and the three spears The training is most rigorous Your Grace Only one boy in three survives it This is well known Among the Unsullied it is said that on the day they win their spiked cap the worst is done with for no duty that will ever fall to them could be as hard as their training

Kraznys mo Nakloz supposedly spoke no word of the Common Tongue but he bobbed his head as he listened and from time to time gave the slave girl a poke with the end of his lash Tell her that these have been standing here for a day and a night with no food nor water Tell her that they will stand until they drop if I should command it and when nine hundred and ninety-nine have collapsed to die upon the bricks the last will stand there still and never move until his own death claims him Such is their courage Tell her that

I call that madness not courage said Arstan Whitebeard when the solemn little scribe was done He tapped the end of his hardwood staff against the bricks tap tap as if to tell his displeasure The old man had not wanted to sail to Astapor nor did he favor buying this slave army A queen should hear all sides before reaching a decision That was why Dany had brought him with her to the Plaza of Pride not to keep her safe Her bloodriders would do that well enough Ser Jorah Mormont she had left aboard Balerion to guard her people and her dragons Much against her inclination she had locked the dragons belowdecks It was too dangerous to let them fly freely over the city the world was all too full of men who would gladly kill them for no better reason than to name themselves dragonslayer

What did the smelly old man say the slaver demanded of his translator When she told him he smiled and said Inform the savages that we call this obedience Others may be stronger or quicker or larger than the Unsullied Some few may even equal their skill with sword and spear and shield But nowhere between the seas will you ever find any more obedient

Sheep are obedient said Arstan when the words had been translated He had some Valyrian as well though not so much as Dany but like her he was feigning ignorance

Kraznys mo Nakloz showed his big white teeth when that was rendered back to him A word from me and these sheep would spill his stinking old bowels on the bricks he said but do not say that Tell them that these creatures are more dogs than sheep Do they eat dogs or horse in these Seven Kingdoms

They prefer pigs and cows your worship

Beef Pfag Food for unwashed savages

Ignoring them all Dany walked slowly down the line of slave soldiers The girls followed close behind with the silk awning to keep her in the shade but the thousand men before her enjoyed no such protection More than half had the copper skins and almond eyes of Dothraki and Lhazerene but she saw men of the Free Cities in the ranks as well along with pale Qartheen ebon-faced Summer Islanders and others whose origins she could not guess And some had skins of the same amber hue as Kraznys mo Nakloz and the bristly red-black hair that marked the ancient folk of Ghis who named themselves the harpy’s sons They sell even their own kind It should not have surprised her The Dothraki did the same when khalasar met khalasar in the sea of grass

Some of the soldiers were tall and some were short They ranged in age from fourteen to twenty she judged Their cheeks were smooth and their eyes all the same be they black or brown or blue or grey or amber They are like one man Dany thought until she remembered that they were no men at all The Unsullied were eunuchs every one of them Why do you cut them she asked Kraznys through the slave girl Whole men are stronger than eunuchs I have always heard

A eunuch who is cut young will never have the brute strength of one of your Westerosi knights this is true said Kraznys mo Nakloz when the question was put to him A bull is strong as well but bulls die every day in the fighting pits A girl of nine killed one not three days past in Jothiel’s Pit The Unsullied have something better than strength tell her They have discipline We fight in the fashion of the Old Empire yes They are the lockstep legions of Old Ghis come again absolutely obedient absolutely loyal and utterly without fear

Dany listened patiently to the translation

Even the bravest men fear death and maiming Arstan said when the girl was done

Kraznys smiled again when he heard that Tell the old man that he smells of piss and needs a stick to hold him up

Truly your worship

He poked her with his lash No not truly are you a girl or a goat to ask such folly Say that Unsullied are not men Say that death means nothing to them and maiming less than nothing He stopped before a thickset man who had the look of Lhazar about him and brought his whip up sharply laying a line of blood across one copper cheek The eunuch blinked and stood there bleeding Would you like another asked Kraznys

If it please your worship

It was hard to pretend not to understand Dany laid a hand on Kraznys’s arm before he could raise the whip again Tell the Good Master that I see how strong his Unsullied are and how bravely they suffer pain

Kraznys chuckled when he heard her words in Valyrian Tell this ignorant whore of a westerner that courage has nothing to do with it

The Good Master says that was not courage Your Grace

Tell her to open those slut’s eyes of hers

He begs you attend this carefully Your Grace

Kraznys moved to the next eunuch in line a towering youth with the blue eyes and flaxen hair of Lys Your sword he said The eunuch knelt unsheathed the blade and offered it up hilt first It was a shortsword made more for stabbing than for slashing but the edge looked razor-sharp Stand Kraznys commanded

Your worship The eunuch stood and Kraznys mo Nakloz slid the sword slowly up his torso leaving a thin red line across his belly and between his ribs Then he jabbed the swordpoint in beneath a wide pink nipple and began to work it back and forth

What is he doing Dany demanded of the girl as the blood ran down the man’s chest

Tell the cow to stop her bleating said Kraznys without waiting for the translation This will do him no great harm Men have no need of nipples eunuchs even less so The nipple hung by a thread of skin He slashed and sent it tumbling to the bricks leaving behind a round red eye copiously weeping blood The eunuch did not move until Kraznys offered him back his sword hilt first Here I’m done with you

This one is pleased to have served you

Kraznys turned back to Dany They feel no pain you see

How can that be she demanded through the scribe

The wine of courage was the answer he gave her It is no true wine at all but made from deadly nightshade bloodfly larva black lotus root and many secret things They drink it with every meal from the day they are cut and with each passing year feel less and less It makes them fearless in battle Nor can they be tortured Tell the savage her secrets are safe with the Unsullied She may set them to guard her councils and even her bedchamber and never a worry as to what they might overhear

In Yunkai and Meereen eunuchs are often made by removing a boy’s testicles but leaving the penis Such a creature is infertile yet often still capable of erection Only trouble can come of this We remove the penis as well leaving nothing The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth He gave Dany and Arstan another of his broad white smiles I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children but live only for their duty Is it not so

It is Arstan said when the question was put There are many such orders The maesters of the Citadel the septons and septas who serve the Seven the silent sisters of the dead the Kingsguard and the Night’s Watch…

Poor things growled the slaver after the translation Men were not made to live thus Their days are a torment of temptation any fool must see and no doubt most succumb to their baser selves Not so our Unsullied They are wed to their swords in a way that your Sworn Brothers cannot hope to match No woman can ever tempt them nor any man

His girl conveyed the essence of his speech more politely There are other ways to tempt men besides the flesh Arstan Whitebeard objected when she was done

Men yes but not Unsullied Plunder interests them no more than rape They own nothing but their weapons We do not even permit them names

No names Dany frowned at the little scribe Can that be what the Good Master said They have no names

It is so Your Grace

Kraznys stopped in front of a Ghiscari who might have been his taller fitter brother and flicked his lash at a small bronze disk on the swordbelt at his feet There is his name Ask the whore of Westeros whether she can read Ghiscari glyphs When Dany admitted that she could not the slaver turned to the Unsullied What is your name he demanded

This one’s name is Red Flea your worship

The girl repeated their exchange in the Common Tongue

And yesterday what was it

Black Rat your worship

The day before

Brown Flea your worship

Before that
