in context  If you say had heed hud and so on and freeze
your vocal tract posture on the initial
ul
h
you will find it
already configured for the following vowel em an excellent
example of anticipatory coarticulation
Fourthly amplitude values do play some part in identification
particularly for fricatives
ul
th
is the weakest sound closely followed by
ul
f
with
ul
s
and
ul
sh
the
strongest  It is necessary to get a reasonable mix of excitation in
the voiced fricatives the voicing amplitude is considerably less than
in vowels  Finally there are other sounds that might be considered
steady state ones  You can probably identify
ul
m n
and
ul
ng
just by
their steady states  However the difference is not particularly
strong it is the transitional parts which discriminate most effectively
between these sounds  The steady state of
ul
r
is quite distinctive too
for most speakers because the top of the tongue is curled back in a
so-called retroflex action and this causes a radical change in the
third formant resonance
rh Transient segments
Transient sounds include diphthongs glides
nasals voiced and unvoiced stops and affricates
The first two are relatively easy to characterize for they are
basically continuous gradual transitions from one vocal tract posture
to another em sort of dynamic vowels  Diphthongs and glides are
similar to each other  In fact you could be transcribed as
a triphthong
ul
i e uu
except that in the initial posture the tongue
is even higher and the vocal tract correspondingly more constricted
than in
ul
i
hid em though not as constricted as in
ul
sh
Both categories can be represented in terms of target formant
values on the understanding that these are not to be
interpreted as steady state configurations but strictly as
extreme values at the beginning or end of the formant motion for
transitions out of and into the segment respectively
pp
Nasals have a steady-state portion comprising a strong nasal formant
at a fairly low frequency on account of the large size of the
combined nasal and oral cavity which is resonating
Higher formants are relatively weak because of attenuation effects
Transitions into and out of nasals are strongly nasalized
as indeed are adjacent vocalic segments with
the oral and nasal tract operating in parallel  As discussed in
Chapter 5 this cannot be simulated on a series synthesizer
However extremely fast motions of the formants occur on account of
the binary switching action of the velum and it turns out that
fast formant transitions are sufficient to simulate nasals because
the speech perception mechanism is accustomed to hearing them only
in that context  Contrast this with the extremely slow transitions
in diphthongs and glides
pp
Stops form the most interesting category and research using the pattern
playback synthesizer was instrumental in providing adequate acoustic
characterizations for them  Consider unvoiced stops
They each have three phases  transition in silent central portion
and transition out  There is a lot of action on the transition out
and many phoneticians would divide this part alone into several phases
First as the release occurs there is a small burst of fricative noise
Say t t t  as in tut-tut without producing any voicing
Actually when used as an admonishment this is accompanied by
an ingressive inhaling air-stream instead of the normal egressive
exhaling one used in English speech although some languages
do have ingressive sounds
In any case a short fricative somewhat resembling a tiny
ul
s
can be heard as the tongue leaves the roof of the mouth
Frication is produced when the gap is very narrow and ceases
rapidly as it becomes wider
Next when an unvoiced stop is released a significant amount of aspiration
follows the release
Say pot tot cot with force and you will hear the
