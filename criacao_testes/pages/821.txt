44 And Jesus answered him saying It is written That man shall not
live by bread alone but by every word of God

45 And the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto
him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time

46 And the devil said unto him All this power will I give thee and
the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I
will I give it

47 If thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine

48 And Jesus answered and said unto him Get thee behind me Satan
for it is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only
shalt thou serve

49 And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple and said unto him If thou be the Son of God cast thyself
down from hence 410 For it is written He shall give his angels
charge over thee to keep thee 411 And in their hands they shall
bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone

412 And Jesus answering said unto him It is said Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord thy God

413 And when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from
him for a season

414 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee and
there went out a fame of him through all the region round about

415 And he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all

416 And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as
his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and
stood up for to read

417 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias
And when he had opened the book he found the place where it was
written 418 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal
the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and
recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are
bruised 419 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord

420 And he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and
sat down And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him

421 And he began to say unto them This day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears

422 And all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth And they said Is not this Josephs
son  423 And he said unto them Ye will surely say unto me this
proverb Physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in
Capernaum do also here in thy country

424 And he said Verily I say unto you No prophet is accepted in his
own country

425 But I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days
of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when
great famine was throughout all the land 426 But unto none of them
was Elias sent save unto Sarepta a city of Sidon unto a woman that
was a widow

427 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian

428 And all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were
filled with wrath 429 And rose up and thrust him out of the city
and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built
that they might cast him down headlong

430 But he passing through the midst of them went his way 431 And
came down to Capernaum a city of Galilee and taught them on the
sabbath days

432 And they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with
power

433 And in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an
unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice 434 Saying Let us
alone what have we to do with thee thou Jesus of Nazareth art thou
come to destroy us I know thee who thou art the Holy One of God

435 And Jesus rebuked him saying Hold thy peace and come out of
him

And when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him
and hurt him not

436 And they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying
What a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the
unclean spirits and they come out

437 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
round about
