Yes you are Do you think I’m as stupid as they are

No you’re stupider The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls everyone knows that

That’s true I don’t know why Yoren brought you but he must have had some reason You’re still a girl

I am not

Then pull out your cock and take a piss Go on

I don’t need to take a piss If I wanted to I could

Liar You can’t take out your cock because you don’t have one I never noticed before when there were thirty of us but you always go off in the woods to make your water You don’t see Hot Pie doing that nor me neither If you’re not a girl you must be some eunuch

You’re the eunuch

You know I’m not Gendry smiled You want me to take out my cock and prove it I don’t have anything to hide

Yes you do Arya blurted desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didn’t have Those gold cloaks were after you at the inn and you won’t tell us why

I wish I knew I think Yoren knew but he never told me Why did you think they were after you though

Arya bit her lip She remembered what Yoren had said the day he had hacked off her hair This lot half o’ them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers The other half’d do the same only they’d rape you first Only Gendry was different the queen wanted him too I’ll tell you if you’ll tell me she said warily

I would if I knew Arry    is that really what you’re called or do you have some girl’s name

Arya glared at the gnarled root by her feet She realized that the pretense was done Gendry knew and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise She could draw Needle and kill him where he stood or else trust him She wasn’t certain she’d be able to kill him even if she tried he had his own sword and he was a lot stronger All that was left was the truth Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know she said

They won’t he swore Not from me

Arya She raised her eyes to his My name is Arya Of House Stark

Of House    It took him a moment before he said The King’s Hand was named Stark The one they killed for a traitor

He was never a traitor He was my father

Gendry’s eyes widened So that’s why you thought   

She nodded Yoren was taking me home to Winterfell

I    you’re highborn then a    you’ll be a lady   

Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet all cracked and callused She saw the dirt under her nails the scabs on her elbows the scratches on her hands Septa Mordane wouldn’t even know me I bet Sansa might but she’d pretend not to My mother’s a lady and my sister but I never was

Yes you were You were a lord’s daughter and you lived in a castle didn’t you And you    gods be good I never    All of a sudden Gendry seemed uncertain almost afraid All that about cocks I never should have said that And I been pissing in front of you and everything I    I beg your pardon m’lady

Stop that Arya hissed Was he mocking her

I know my courtesies m’lady Gendry said stubborn as ever Whenever highborn girls came into the shop with their fathers my master told me I was to bend the knee and speak only when they spoke to me and call them m’lady

If you start calling me m’lady even Hot Pie is going to notice And you better keep on pissing the same way too

As m’lady commands

Arya slammed his chest with both hands He tripped over a stone and sat down with a thump What kind of lord’s daughter are you he said laughing

This kind She kicked him in the side but it only made him laugh harder You laugh all you like I’m going to see who’s in the village The sun had already fallen below the trees dusk would be on them in no time at all For once it was Gendry who had to hurry after You smell that she asked

He sniffed the air Rotten fish

You know it’s not

We better be careful I’ll go around west see if there’s some road There must be if you saw a wagon You take the shore If you need help bark like a dog

That’s stupid If I need help I’ll shout help She darted away bare feet silent in the grass When she glanced back over her shoulder he was watching her with that pained look on his face that meant he was thinking He’s probably thinking that he shouldn’t be letting m’lady go stealing food Arya just knew he was going to be stupid now

The smell grew stronger as she got closer to the village It did not smell like rotten fish to her This stench was ranker fouler She wrinkled her nose

Where the trees began to thin she used the undergrowth slipping from bush to bush quiet as a shadow Every few yards she stopped to listen The third time she heard horses and a man’s voice as well And the smell got worse Dead man’s stink that’s what it is She had smelled it before with Yoren and the others

A dense thicket of brambles grew south of the village By the time she reached it the long shadows of sunset had begun to fade and the lantern bugs were coming out She could see thatched roofs just beyond the hedge She crept along until she found a gap and squirmed through on her belly keeping well hidden until she saw what made the smell

Beside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up and things that had once been men dangled there their feet in chains while crows pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse For every crow there were a hundred flies When the wind blew off the lake the nearest corpse twisted on its chain ever so slightly The crows had eaten most of its face and something else had been at it as well something much larger Throat and chest had been torn apart and glistening green entrails and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened One arm had been ripped right off the shoulder Arya saw the bones a few feet away gnawed and cracked picked clean of meat

She made herself look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond him telling herself she was hard as a stone Corpses all so savaged and decayed that it took her a moment to realize they had been stripped before they were hanged They did not look like naked people they hardly looked like people at all The crows had eaten their eyes and sometimes their faces Of the sixth in the long row nothing remained but a single leg still tangled in its chains swaying with each breeze

Fear cuts deeper than swords Dead men could not hurt her but whoever had killed them could Well beyond the gibbet two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in front of the long low building by the water the one with the slate roof A pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of it banners drooping from each staff One looked red and one paler white or yellow maybe but both were limp and with the dusk settling she could not even be certain that red one was Lannister crimson I don’t need to see the lion I can see all the dead people who else would it be but Lannisters

Then there was a shout

The two spearmen turned at the cry and a third man came into view shoving a captive before him It was growing too dark to make out faces but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm and when Arya saw the horns she knew it was Gendry You stupid stupid stupid STUPID she thought If he’d been here she would have kicked him again

The guards were talking loudly but she was too far away to make out the words especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand One of the spearmen snatched the helm off Gendry’s head and asked him a question but he must not have liked the answer because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down The one who’d captured him gave him a kick while the second spearman was trying on the bull’s-head helm Finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the storehouse When they opened the heavy wooden doors a small boy darted out but one of the guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside Arya heard sobbing from inside the building and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip

The guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them Just then a breath of wind came sighing off the lake and the banners stirred and lifted The one on the tall staff bore the golden lion as she’d feared On the other three sleek black shapes ran across a field as yellow as butter Dogs she thought Arya had seen those dogs before but where

It didn’t matter The only thing that mattered was that they had Gendry Even if he was stubborn and stupid she had to get him out She wondered if they knew that the queen wanted him

One of the guards took off his helm and donned Gendry’s instead It made her angry to see him wearing it but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him She thought she heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse muffled by the masonry but it was hard to be certain

She stayed long enough to see the guard changed and much more besides Men came and went They led their horses down to the stream to drink A hunting party returned from the wood carrying a deer’s carcass slung from a pole She watched them clean and gut it and build a cookfire on the far side of the stream and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly with the stench of corruption Her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch The prospect of food brought other men out of the houses near all of them wearing bits of mail or boiled leather When the deer was cooked the choicest portions were carried to one of the houses

She thought that the dark might let her crawl close and free Gendry but the guards kindled torches off the cookfire A squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the storehouse and later two more men joined them and they all passed a skin of wine from hand to hand When it was empty the others left but the two guards remained leaning on their spears

Arya’s arms and legs were stiff when she finally wriggled out from under the briar into the dark of the wood It was a black night with a thin sliver of moon appearing and disappearing as the clouds blew past Silent as a shadow she told herself as she moved through the trees In this darkness she dared not run for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing her way On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against its shores On her right a wind sighed through the branches and leaves rustled and stirred Far off she heard the howling of wolves

Lommy and Hot Pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind them Quiet she told them putting an arm around Weasel when the little girl came running up

Hot Pie stared at her with big eyes We thought you left us He had his shortsword in hand the one Yoren had taken off the gold cloak I was scared you was a wolf
