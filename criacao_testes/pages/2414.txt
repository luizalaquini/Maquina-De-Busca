1911 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to
find the door

1912 And the men said unto Lot Hast thou here any besides son in
law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the
city bring them out of this place 1913 For we will destroy this
place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the
LORD and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it

1914 And Lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married
his daughters and said Up get you out of this place for the LORD
will destroy this city But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons
in law

1915 And when the morning arose then the angels hastened Lot
saying Arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city

1916 And while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon
the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the LORD
being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him
without the city

1917 And it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad
that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay
thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed

1918 And Lot said unto them Oh not so my LORD 1919 Behold now
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy
mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and I cannot
escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I die 1920
Behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one
Oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall
live

1921 And he said unto him See I have accepted thee concerning this
thing also that I will not overthrow this city for the which thou
hast spoken

1922 Haste thee escape thither for I cannot do anything till thou
be come thither Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar

1923 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar

1924 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the LORD out of heaven 1925 And he overthrew those cities
and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that
which grew upon the ground

1926 But his wife looked back from behind him and she became a
pillar of salt

1927 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the LORD 1928 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah
and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace

1929 And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain
that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the
overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt

1930 And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his
two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in Zoar and he dwelt
in a cave he and his two daughters

1931 And the firstborn said unto the younger Our father is old and
there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
all the earth 1932 Come let us make our father drink wine and we
will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father

1933 And they made their father drink wine that night and the
firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when
she lay down nor when she arose

1934 And it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto
the younger Behold I lay yesternight with my father let us make him
drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we
may preserve seed of our father

1935 And they made their father drink wine that night also and the
younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay
down nor when she arose

1936 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father

1937 And the first born bare a son and called his name Moab the
same is the father of the Moabites unto this day

1938 And the younger she also bare a son and called his name
Benammi the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this
day

201 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and
dwelled between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar

202 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife She is my sister and
Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah
