clovenfooted nor cheweth the cud are unclean unto you every one
that toucheth them shall be unclean

1127 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws among all manner of beasts
that go on all four those are unclean unto you whoso toucheth their
carcase shall be unclean until the even

1128 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes
and be unclean until the even they are unclean unto you

1129 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
that creep upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and the tortoise
after his kind 1130 And the ferret and the chameleon and the
lizard and the snail and the mole

1131 These are unclean to you among all that creep whosoever doth
touch them when they be dead shall be unclean until the even

1132 And upon whatsoever any of them when they are dead doth fall
it shall be unclean whether it be any vessel of wood or raiment or
skin or sack whatsoever vessel it be wherein any work is done it
must be put into water and it shall be unclean until the even so it
shall be cleansed

1133 And every earthen vessel whereinto any of them falleth
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean and ye shall break it

1134 Of all meat which may be eaten that on which such water cometh
shall be unclean and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel
shall be unclean

1135 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
shall be unclean whether it be oven or ranges for pots they shall
be broken down for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you

1136 Nevertheless a fountain or pit wherein there is plenty of
water shall be clean but that which toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean

1137 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
is to be sown it shall be clean

1138 But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their
carcase fall thereon it shall be unclean unto you

1139 And if any beast of which ye may eat die he that toucheth the
carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even

1140 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes
and be unclean until the even he also that beareth the carcase of it
shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even

1141 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
an abomination it shall not be eaten

1142 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly and whatsoever goeth upon all
four or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that
creep upon the earth them ye shall not eat for they are an
abomination

1143 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
that creepeth neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them
that ye should be defiled thereby

1144 For I am the LORD your God ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves and ye shall be holy for I am holy neither shall ye
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth

1145 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt
to be your God ye shall therefore be holy for I am holy

1146 This is the law of the beasts and of the fowl and of every
living creature that moveth in the waters and of every creature that
creepeth upon the earth 1147 To make a difference between the
unclean and the clean and between the beast that may be eaten and the
beast that may not be eaten

121 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 122 Speak unto the
children of Israel saying If a woman have conceived seed and born a
man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days
of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean

123 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
circumcised

124 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three
and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the
sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled

125 But if she bear a maid child then she shall be unclean two
weeks as in her separation and she shall continue in the blood of
her purifying threescore and six days

126 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or
for a daughter she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest
127 Who shall offer it before the LORD and make an atonement for
her and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood This is
