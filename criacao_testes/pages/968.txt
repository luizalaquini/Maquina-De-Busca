Sansa retreated another step My mother

Yes your mother your precious mother my own sweet sister Catelyn Don’t you think to play the innocent with me you vile little liar All those years in Riverrun she played with Petyr as if he were her little toy She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks and made his nights a torment

No My mother is dead she wanted to shriek She was your own sister and she’s dead She didn’t She wouldn’t

How would you know Were you there Lysa descended from the high seat her skirts swirling Did you come with Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood the time they visited to lay their feud before my father Lord Bracken’s singer played for us and Catelyn danced six dances with Petyr that night six I counted When the lords began to argue my father took them up to his audience chamber so there was no one to stop us drinking Edmure got drunk young as he was… and Petyr tried to kiss your mother only she pushed him away She laughed at him He looked so wounded I thought my heart would burst and afterward he drank until he passed out at the table Uncle Brynden carried him up to bed before my father could find him like that But you remember none of it do you She looked down angrily Do you

Is she drunk or mad I was not born my lady

You were not born But I was so do not presume to tell what is true I know what is true You kissed him

He kissed me Sansa insisted again I never wanted—

Be quiet I haven’t given you leave to speak You enticed him just as your mother did that night in Riverrun with her smiles and her dancing You think I could forget That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort I bled but it was the sweetest hurt He told me he loved me then but he called me Cat just before he fell back to sleep Even so I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten Your mother did not deserve him She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon Stark I would have given him my favor I gave him everything He is mine now Not Catelyn’s and not yours

All of Sansa’s resolve had withered in the face of her aunt’s onslaught Lysa Arryn was frightening her as much as Queen Cersei ever had He’s yours my lady she said trying to sound meek and contrite May I have your leave to go

You may not Her aunt’s breath smelled of wine If you were anyone else I would banish you Send you down to Lord Nestor at the Gates of the Moon or back to the Fingers How would you like to spend your life on that bleak shore surrounded by slatterns and sheep pellets That was what my father meant for Petyr Everyone thought it was because of that stupid duel with Brandon Stark but that wasn’t so Father said I ought to thank the gods that so great a lord as Jon Arryn was willing to take me soiled but I knew it was only for the swords I had to marry Jon or my father would have turned me out as he did his brother but it was Petyr I was meant for I am telling you all this so you will understand how much we love each other how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another We made a baby together a precious little baby Lysa put her hands flat against her belly as if the child was still there When they stole him from me I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again Jon wished to send my sweet Robert to Dragonstone and that sot of a king would have given him to Cersei Lannister but I never let them… no more than I’ll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger Do you hear me Alayne or Sansa or whatever you call yourself Do you hear what I am telling you

Yes I swear I won’t ever kiss him again or… or entice him Sansa thought that was what her aunt wanted to hear

So you admit it now It was you just as I thought You are as wanton as your mother Lysa grabbed her by the wrist Come with me now There is something I want to show you

You’re hurting me Sansa squirmed Please Aunt Lysa I haven’t done anything I swear it

Her aunt ignored her protests Marillion she shouted I need you Marillion I need you

The singer had remained discreetly in the rear of the hall but at Lady Arryn’s shout he came at once My lady

Play us a song Play ‘The False and the Fair’

Marillions fingers brushed the strings The lord he came a-riding upon a rainy day hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey…

Lady Lysa pulled at Sansa’s arm It was either walk or be dragged so she chose to walk halfway down the hall and between a pair of pillars to a white weirwood door set in the marble wall The door was firmly closed with three heavy bronze bars to hold it in place but Sansa could hear the wind outside worrying at its edges When she saw the crescent moon carved in the wood she planted her feet The Moon Door She tried to yank free Why are you showing me the Moon Door

You squeak like a mouse now but you were bold enough in the garden weren’t you You were bold enough in the snow

The lady sat a-sewing upon a rainy day Marillion sang Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey

Open the door Lysa commanded Open it I say You will do it or I’ll send for my guards She shoved Sansa forward Your mother was brave at least Lift off the bars

If I do as she says she will let me go Sansa grabbed one of the bronze bars yanked it loose and tossed it down The second bar clattered to the marble then the third She had barely touched the latch when the heavy wooden door flew inward and slammed back against the wall with a bang Snow had piled up around the frame and it all came blowing in at them borne on a blast of cold air that left Sansa shivering She tried to step backward but her aunt was behind her Lysa seized her by the wrist and put her other hand between her shoulder blades propelling her forcefully toward the open door

Beyond was white sky falling snow and nothing else

Look down said Lady Lysa Look down

She tried to wrench free but her aunt’s fingers were digging into her arm like claws Lysa gave her another shove and Sansa shrieked Her left foot broke through a crust of snow and knocked it loose There was nothing in front of her but empty air and a waycastle six hundred feet below clinging to the side of the mountain Don’t Sansa screamed You’re scaring me Behind her Marillion was still playing his woodharp and singing Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey

Do you still want my leave to go Do you

No Sansa planted her feet and tried to squirm backward but her aunt did not budge Not this way Please… She put a hand up her fingers scrabbling at the doorframe but she could not get a grip and her feet were sliding on the wet marble floor Lady Lysa pressed her forward inexorably Her aunt outweighed her by three stone The lady lay a-kissing upon a mound of hay Marillion was singing Sansa twisted sideways hysterical with fear and one foot slipped out over the void She screamed Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey The wind flapped her skirts up and bit at her bare legs with cold teeth She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks Sansa flailed found Lysa’s thick auburn braid and clutched it tight My hair her aunt shrieked Let go of my hair She was shaking sobbing They teetered on the edge Far off she heard the guards pounding on the door with their spears demanding to be let in Marillion broke off his song
