And may the Father judge you justly Lord Davos The boy went with his cousin Ser Andrew out the postern gate The others followed all but the Bastard of Nightsong May the Father judge me justly Davos thought ruefully But it was the king’s judgment that concerned him now

These two asked Ser Rolland of the guards when he had closed and barred the gate

Drag them into a cellar said Davos You can cut them free when Edric’s safely under way

The Bastard gave a curt nod There were no more words to say the easy part was done Davos pulled his glove on wishing he had not lost his luck He had been a better man and a braver one with that bag of bones around his neck He ran his shortened fingers through thinning brown hair and wondered if it needed to be cut He must look presentable when he stood before the king

Dragonstone had never seemed so dark and fearsome He walked slowly his footsteps echoing off black walls and dragons Stone dragons who will never wake I pray The Stone Drum loomed huge ahead of him The guards at the door uncrossed their spears as he approached Not for the onion knight but for the King’s Hand Davos was the Hand going in at least He wondered what he would be coming out If I ever do…

The steps seemed longer and steeper than before or perhaps it was just that he was tired The Mother never made me for tasks like this He had risen too high and too fast and up here on the mountain the air was too thin for him to breathe As a boy he’d dreamed of riches but that was long ago Later grown all he had wanted was a few acres of good land a hall to grow old in a better life for his sons The Blind Bastard used to tell him that a clever smuggler did not overreach nor draw too much attention to himself A few acres a timbered roof a ser before my name I should have been content If he survived this night he would take Devan and sail home to Cape Wrath and his gentle Marya We will grieve together for our dead sons raise the living ones to be good men and speak no more of kings

The Chamber of the Painted Table was dark and empty when Davos entered the king would still be at the nightfire with Melisandre and the queen’s men He knelt and made a fire in the hearth to drive the chill from the round chamber and chase the shadows back into their corners Then he went around the room to each window in turn opening the heavy velvet curtains and unlatching the wooden shutters The wind came in strong with the smell of salt and sea and pulled at his plain brown cloak

At the north window he leaned against the sill for a breath of the cold night air hoping to catch a glimpse of Mad Prendos raising sail but the sea seemed black and empty as far as the eye could see Is she gone already He could only pray that she was and the boy with her A half moon was sliding in and out amongst thin high clouds and Davos could see familiar stars There was the Galley sailing west there the Crone’s Lantern four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze The clouds hid most of the Ice Dragon all but the bright blue eye that marked due north The sky is full of smugglers’ stars They were old friends those stars Davos hoped that meant good luck

But when he lowered his gaze from the sky to the castle ramparts he was not so certain The wings of the stone dragons cast great black shadows in the light from the nightfire He tried to tell himself that they were no more than carvings cold and lifeless This was their place once A place of dragons and dragonlords the seat of House Targaryen The Targaryens were the blood of old Valyria…

The wind sighed through the chamber and in the hearth the flames gusted and swirled He listened to the logs crackle and spit When Davos left the window his shadow went before him tall and thin and fell across the Painted Table like a sword And there he stood for a long time waiting He heard their boots on the stone steps as they ascended The king’s voice went before him …is not three he was saying

Three is three came Melisandre’s answer I swear to you Your Grace I saw him die and heard his mother’s wail

In the nightfire Stannis and Melisandre came through the door together The flames are full of tricks What is what will be what may be You cannot tell me for a certainty…

Your Grace Davos stepped forward Lady Melisandre saw it true Your nephew Joffrey is dead

If the king was surprised to find him at the Painted Table he gave no sign Lord Davos he said He was not my nephew Though for years I believed he was

He choked on a morsel of food at his wedding feast Davos said It may be that he was poisoned

He is the third said Melisandre

I can count woman Stannis walked along the table past Oldtown and the Arbor up toward the Shield Islands and the mouth of the Mander Weddings have become more perilous than battles it would seem Who was the poisoner Is it known

His uncle it’s said The Imp

Stannis ground his teeth A dangerous man I learned that on the Blackwater How do you come by this report

The Lyseni still trade at King’s Landing Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me

I suppose not The king ran his fingers across the table Joffrey… I remember once this kitchen cat… the cooks were wont to feed her scraps and fish heads One told the boy that she had kittens in her belly thinking he might want one Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if it were true When he found the kittens he brought them to show to his father Robert hit the boy so hard I thought he’d killed him The king took off his crown and placed it on the table Dwarf or leech this killer served the kingdom well They must send for me now

They will not said Melisandre Joffrey has a brother

Tommen The king said the name grudgingly

They will crown Tommen and rule in his name

Stannis made a fist Tommen is gentler than Joffrey but born of the same incest Another monster in the making Another leech upon the land Westeros needs a man’s hand not a child’s

Melisandre moved closer Save them sire Let me wake the stone dragons Three is three Give me the boy

Edric Storm Davos said

Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury I know his name Spare me your reproaches I like this no more than you do but my duty is to the realm My duty… He turned back to Melisandre You swear there is no other way Swear it on your life for I promise you shall die by inches if you lie

You are he who must stand against the Other The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago The red comet was your herald You are the prince that was promised and if you fail the world fails with you Melisandre went to him her red lips parted her ruby throbbing Give me this boy she whispered and I will give you your kingdom

He can’t said Davos Edric Storm is gone

Gone Stannis turned What do you mean gone

He is aboard a Lyseni galley safely out to sea Davos watched Melisandre’s pale heart-shaped face He saw the flicker of dismay there the sudden uncertainty She did not see it

The king’s eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of his face The bastard was taken from Dragonstone without my leave A galley you say If that Lysene pirate thinks to use the boy to squeeze gold from me—

This is your Hand’s work sire Melisandre gave Davos a knowing look You will bring him back my lord You will

The boy is out of my reach said Davos And out of your reach as well my lady

Her red eyes made him squirm I should have left you to the dark ser Do you know what you have done

My duty

Some might call it treason Stannis went to the window to stare out into the night Is he looking for the ship I raised you up from dirt Davos He sounded more tired than angry Was loyalty too much to hope for

Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater I might have died myself You have my loyalty always Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words he said next he knew his life depended on them Your Grace you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience to defend your realm against your foes to protect your people Is not Edric Storm one of your people One of those I swore to protect I kept my oath How could that be treason

Stannis ground his teeth again I never asked for this crown Gold is cold and heavy on the head but so long as I am the king I have a duty… If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark… Sacrifice… is never easy Davos Or it is no true sacrifice Tell him my lady

Melisandre said Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart’s blood of his own beloved wife If a man with a thousand cows gives one to god that is nothing But a man who offers the only cow he owns…

She talks of cows Davos told the king I am speaking of a boy your daughter’s friend your brother’s son

A king’s son with the power of kingsblood in his veins Melisandre’s ruby glowed like a red star at her throat Do you think you’ve saved this boy Onion Knight When the long night falls Edric Storm shall die with the rest wherever he is hidden Your own sons as well Darkness and cold will cover the earth You meddle in matters you do not understand

There’s much I don’t understand Davos admitted I have never pretended elsewise I know the seas and rivers the shapes of the coasts where the rocks and shoals lie I know hidden coves where a boat can land unseen And I know that a king protects his people or he is no king at all

Stannis’s face darkened Do you mock me to my face Must I learn a king’s duty from an onion smuggler

Davos knelt If I have offended take my head I’ll die as I lived your loyal man But hear me first Hear me for the sake of the onions I brought you and the fingers you took

Stannis slid Lightbringer from its scabbard Its glow filled the chamber Say what you will but say it quickly The muscles in the king’s neck stood out like cords

Davos fumbled inside his cloak and drew out the crinkled sheet of parchment It seemed a thin and flimsy thing yet it was all the shield he had A King’s Hand should be able to read and write Maester Pylos has been teaching me He smoothed the letter flat upon his knee and began to read by the light of the magic sword
