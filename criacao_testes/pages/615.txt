Ser Cleos raised a shout When Jaime looked up Brienne was lumbering along the clifftop well ahead of them having cut across a finger of land while they were following the bend in the river She threw herself off the rock and looked almost graceful as she folded into a dive It would have been ungracious to hope that she would smash her head on a stone Ser Cleos turned the skiff toward her Thankfully Jaime still had his oar One good swing when she comes paddling up and I’ll be free of her

Instead he found himself stretching the oar out over the water Brienne grabbed hold and Jaime pulled her in As he helped her into the skiff water ran from her hair and dripped from her sodden clothing to pool on the deck She’s even uglier wet Who would have thought it possible You’re a bloody stupid wench he told her We could have sailed on without you I suppose you expect me to thank you

I want none of your thanks Kingslayer I swore an oath to bring you safe to King’s Landing

And you actually mean to keep it Jaime gave her his brightest smile Now there’s a wonder





Catelyn


Ser Desmond Grell had served House Tully all his life He had been a squire when Catelyn was born a knight when she learned to walk and ride and swim master-at-arms by the day that she was wed He had seen Lord Hoster’s little Cat become a young woman a great lord’s lady mother to a king And now he has seen me become a traitor as well

Her brother Edmure had named Ser Desmond castellan of Riverrun when he rode off to battle so it fell to him to deal with her crime To ease his discomfort he brought her father’s steward with him dour Utherydes Wayn The two men stood and looked at her Ser Desmond stout red-faced embarrassed Utherydes grave gaunt melancholy Each waited for the other to speak They have given their lives to my father’s service and I have repaid them with disgrace Catelyn thought wearily

Your sons Ser Desmond said at last Maester Vyman told us The poor lads Terrible Terrible But…

We share your grief my lady said Utherydes Wayn All Riverrun mourns with you but…

The news must have driven you mad Ser Desmond broke in a madness of grief a mother’s madness men will understand You did not know…

I did Catelyn said firmly I understood what I was doing and knew it was treasonous If you fail to punish me men will believe that we connived together to free Jaime Lannister It was mine own act and mine alone and I alone must answer for it Put me in the Kingslayer’s empty irons and I will wear them proudly if that is how it must be

Fetters The very word seemed to shock poor Ser Desmond For the king’s mother my lord’s own daughter Impossible

Mayhaps said the steward Utherydes Wayn my lady would consent to be confined to her chambers until Ser Edmure returns A time alone to pray for her murdered sons

Confined aye Ser Desmond said Confined to a tower cell that would serve

If I am to be confined let it be in my father’s chambers so I might comfort him in his last days

Ser Desmond considered a moment Very well You shall lack no comfort nor courtesy but freedom of the castle is denied you Visit the sept as you need but elsewise remain in Lord Hoster’s chambers until Lord Edmure returns

As you wish Her brother was no lord while their father lived but Catelyn did not correct him Set a guard on me if you must but I give you my pledge that I shall attempt no escape

Ser Desmond nodded plainly glad to be done with his distasteful task but sad-eyed Utherydes Wayn lingered a moment after the castellan took his leave It was a grave thing you did my lady but for naught Ser Desmond has sent Ser Robin Ryger after them to bring back the Kingslayer… Or failing that his head

Catelyn had expected no less May the Warrior give strength to your sword arm Brienne she prayed She had done all she could nothing remained but to hope

Her things were moved into her father’s bedchamber dominated by the great canopied bed she had been born in its pillars carved in the shapes of leaping trout Her father himself had been moved half a turn down the stair his sickbed placed to face the triangular balcony that opened off his solar from whence he could see the rivers that he had always loved so well

Lord Hoster was sleeping when Catelyn entered She went out to the balcony and stood with one hand on the rough stone balustrade Beyond the point of the castle the swift Tumblestone joined the placid Red Fork and she could see a long way downriver If a striped sail comes from the east it will be Ser Robin returning For the moment the surface of the waters was empty She thanked the gods for that and went back inside to sit with her father

Catelyn could not say if Lord Hoster knew that she was there or if her presence brought him any comfort but it gave her solace to be with him What would you say if you knew my crime Father she wondered Would you have done as I did if it were Lysa and me in the hands of our enemies Or would you condemn me too and call it mother’s madness

There was a smell of death about that room a heavy smell sweet and foul clinging It reminded her of the sons that she had lost her sweet Bran and her little Rickon slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy who had been Ned’s ward She still grieved for Ned she would always grieve for Ned but to have her babies taken as well… It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child she whispered softly more to herself than to her father

Lord Hoster’s eyes opened Tansy he husked in a voice thick with pain

He does not know me Catelyn had grown accustomed to him taking her for her mother or her sister Lysa but Tansy was a name strange to her It’s Catelyn she said It’s Cat Father
