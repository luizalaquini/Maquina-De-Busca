3726 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it and of ancient
times that I have formed it now have I brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps

3727 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were
dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted
before it be grown up

3728 But I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and
thy rage against me

3729 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
mine ears therefore will I put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in
thy lips and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest

3730 And this shall be a sign unto thee Ye shall eat this year such
as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the
same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and
eat the fruit thereof

3731 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
again take root downward and bear fruit upward 3732 For out of
Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount
Zion the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this

3733 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria He
shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come
before it with shields nor cast a bank against it

3734 By the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall
not come into this city saith the LORD

3735 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and
for my servant Davids sake

3736 Then the angel of the LORD went forth and smote in the camp of
the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they
arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses

3737 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned
and dwelt at Nineveh

3738 And it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of
Nisroch his god that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with
the sword and they escaped into the land of Armenia and Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead

381 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death And Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz came unto him and said unto him Thus saith
the LORD Set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live

382 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto
the LORD 383 And said Remember now O LORD I beseech thee how I
have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have
done that which is good in thy sight And Hezekiah wept sore

384 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah saying 385 Go and
say to Hezekiah Thus saith the LORD the God of David thy father I
have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto
thy days fifteen years

386 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
of Assyria and I will defend this city

387 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD that the LORD
will do this thing that he hath spoken 388 Behold I will bring
again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of
Ahaz ten degrees backward So the sun returned ten degrees by which
degrees it was gone down

389 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah when he had been sick and
was recovered of his sickness 3810 I said in the cutting off of my
days I shall go to the gates of the grave I am deprived of the
residue of my years

3811 I said I shall not see the LORD even the LORD in the land of
the living I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the
world

3812 Mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherds
tent I have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with
pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me

3813 I reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all
my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me

3814 Like a crane or a swallow so did I chatter I did mourn as a
dove mine eyes fail with looking upward O LORD I am oppressed
undertake for me

3815 What shall I say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath
done it I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul

3816 O LORD by these things men live and in all these things is the
life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live

3817 Behold for peace I had great bitterness but thou hast in love
to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast
