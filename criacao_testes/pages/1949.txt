The invention of the sound spectrograph in the late 1940s was an
event of colossal significance for acoustic phonetics for it somehow
seemed to make the intricacies of speech visible
This was thought to be a greater advance than actually turned

during the 1950s was a set of minimal rules for synthesizing speech
which showed how stylized formant patterns could generate cues for
identifying vowels and particularly consonants

These were to form the basis of many speech synthesis-by-rule computer
programs in the ensuing decades  Such programs take as input a
phonetic transcription of the utterance and generate a spoken version
of it  The transcription may be broad or narrow depending on the
system  Experience has shown that the Haskins rules really are
minimal and the success of a synthesis-by-rule program depends on
a vast collection of minutia each seemingly insignificant in isolation
but whose effects combine to influence the speech quality dramatically
The best current systems produce clearly understandable
speech which is nevertheless something of a strain to listen to for
long periods
However many are not good and some are execrable
In recent times commercial influences have unfortunately restricted
the free exchange of results and programs between academic researchers
thus slowing down progress
Research attention has turned to prosodic factors
which are certainly less well understood than segmental ones and
to synthesis from plain English text rather than from phonetic transcriptions
pp
The remainder of this chapter describes the techniques of segmental
synthesis  First it is necessary to introduce some
elements of acoustic phonetics
It may be worth re-reading Chapter 2 at this point to refresh
your memory about the classification of speech sounds
sh 74  Acoustic characterization of phonemes
pp
Shortly after the invention of the sound spectrograph an inverse
instrument was developed called the pattern playback synthesizer
This took as input a spectrogram either in its original form or
painted by hand
An optical arrangment was used to modulate the amplitude of some
fifty harmonically-related oscillators by the lightness or darkness
of each point on the frequency axis of the spectrogram
As it was drawn past the playing head sound was produced which
had approximately the frequency components shown on the spectrogram
although the fundamental frequency was constant
pp
This device allowed the complicated
acoustic effects seen on a spectrogram see for example Figures 23 and 24
to be replayed in either original or simplified form
Hence the features which are important for perception of the different sounds
could be isolated  The procedure was to copy from an actual spectrogram
the features which were most prominent visually and then to make further
changes by trial and error until the result was judged to have
reasonable intelligibility when replayed
pp
For the purpose of acoustic characterization of particular phonemes
it is useful to consider the central steady-state part separately from
transitions into and out of the segment
The steady-state part is that sound which is heard when the phoneme
is prolonged  The term phoneme is being used in a rather loose sense
here  it is more appropriate to think of a sound segment rather than
the abstract unit which forms the basis of phonological classification
and this is the terminology I will adopt
pp
The essential auditory characteristics of some sound segments are inherent in
their steady states
If a vowel for example is spoken and prolonged it can readily be
identified by listening to any part of the utterance
This is not true for diphthongs  if you say I very slowly and freeze
your vocal tract posture at any time the resulting steady-state sound
will not be sufficient to identify the diphthong  Rather it will be
a vowel somewhere between
