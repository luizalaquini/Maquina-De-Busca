She could smell the odor of burning flesh no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur’s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night As the smoke grew thicker the Dothraki backed away coughing Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind the logs hissing and cracking glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies The heat beat at the air with great red wings driving the Dothraki back driving off even Mormont but Dany stood her ground She was the blood of the dragon and the fire was in her

She had sensed the truth of it long ago Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration but the brazier had not been hot enough The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils fearsome to behold yet lovely so lovely alive with heat Dany opened her arms to them her skin flushed and glowing This is a wedding too she thought Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent The godswife thought her a child but children grow and children learn

Another step and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet even through her sandals Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks where tears had once run Ser Jorah was shouting behind her but he did not matter anymore only the fire mattered The flames were so beautiful the loveliest things she had ever seen each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet swirling long smoky cloaks She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame she saw fish and foxes and monsters wolves and bright birds and flowering trees each more beautiful than the last She saw a horse a great grey stallion limned in smoke its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame Yes my love my sun-and-stars yes mount now ride now

Her vest had begun to smolder so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire her breasts bare to the blaze streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples Now she thought now and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her mounted on his smoky stallion a flaming lash in his hand He smiled and the whip snaked down at the pyre hissing

She heard a crack the sound of shattering stone The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself Bits of burning wood slid down at her and Dany was showered with ash and cinders And something else came crashing down bouncing and rolling to land at her feet a chunk of curved rock pale and veined with gold broken and smoking The roaring filled the world yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder

Only death can pay for life

And there came a second crack loud and sharp as thunder and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts She heard the screams of frightened horses and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing No she wanted to shout to him no my good knight do not fear for me The fire is mine I am Daenerys Stormborn daughter of dragons bride of dragons mother of dragons don’t you see Don’t you SEE With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky the pyre collapsed and came down around her Unafraid Dany stepped forward into the firestorm calling to her children

The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world

When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion She was naked covered with soot her clothes turned to ash her beautiful hair all crisped away… yet she was unhurt

The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast the green-and-bronze at the right Her arms cradled them close The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin When it saw Jorah it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals

Wordless the knight fell to his knees The men of her khas came up behind him Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet Blood of my blood he murmured pushing his face to the smoking earth Blood of my blood she heard Aggo echo Blood of my blood Rakharo shouted

And after them came her handmaids and then the others all the Dothraki men and women and children and Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now today and tomorrow and forever hers as they had never been Drogo’s

As Daenerys Targaryen rose to her feet her black hissed pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils The other two pulled away from her breasts and added their voices to the call translucent wings unfolding and stirring the air and for the first time in hundreds of years the night came alive with the music of dragons
