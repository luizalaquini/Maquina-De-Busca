She snorted I’d not have thought it by that wench on the waterfront

You must not judge me by her She was the only woman on the ship

Tell me of your father Will he welcome me kindly to his castle

Why should he He scarcely welcomed me his own blood the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands

Are you she asked mildly It’s said that you have uncles brothers a sister

My brothers are long dead and my sister    well they say Asha’s favorite gown is a chainmail hauberk that hangs down past her knees with boiled leather smallclothes beneath Men’s garb won’t make her a man though I’ll make a good marriage alliance with her once we’ve won the war if I can find a man to take her As I recall she had a nose like a vulture’s beak a ripe crop of pimples and no more chest than a boy

You can marry off your sister Esgred observed but not your uncles

My uncles    Theon’s claim took precedence over those of his father’s three brothers but the woman had touched on a sore point nonetheless In the islands it was scarce unheard of for a strong ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights and usually murder him in the bargain But I am not weak Theon told himself and I mean to be stronger yet by the time my father dies My uncles pose no threat to me he declared Aeron is drunk on seawater and sanctity He lives only for his god—

His god Not yours

Mine as well What is dead can never die He smiled thinly If I make pious noises as required Damphair will give me no trouble And my uncle Victarion—

Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet and a fearsome warrior I have heard them sing of him in the alehouses

During my lord father’s rebellion he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and burned the Lannister fleet where it lay at anchor Theon recalled The plan was Euron’s though Victarion is like some great grey bullock strong and tireless and dutiful but not like to win any races No doubt he’ll serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father He has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal

Euron Croweye has no lack of cunning though I’ve heard men say terrible things of that one

Theon shifted his seat My uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two years He may be dead If so it might be for the best Lord Balon’s eldest brother had never given up the Old Way even for a day His Silence with its black sails and dark red hull was infamous in every port from Ibben to Asshai it was said

He may be dead Esgred agreed and if he lives why he has spent so long at sea he’d be half a stranger here The ironborn would never seat a stranger in the Seastone Chair

I suppose not Theon replied before it occurred to him that some would call him a stranger as well The thought made him frown Ten years is a long while but I am back now and my father is far from dead I have time to prove myself

He considered fondling Esgred’s breast again but she would probably only take his hand away and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat Time enough for such play at the castle in the privacy of his chambers I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke and see that you have an honored place at the feast he said I must sit on the dais at my father’s right hand but I will come down and join you when he leaves the hall He seldom lingers long He has no belly for drink these days

A grievous thing when a great man grows old

Lord Balon is but the father of a great man

A modest lordling

Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him He kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck

What shall I wear to this great feast She reached back and pushed his face away

I’ll ask Helya to garb you One of my lady mother’s gowns might do She is off on Harlaw and not expected to return

The cold winds have worn her away I hear Will you not go see her Harlaw is only a day’s sail and surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son

Would that I could I am kept too busy here My father relies on me now that I am returned Come peace perhaps   

Your coming might bring her peace

Now you sound a woman Theon complained

I confess I am    and new with child

Somehow that thought excited him So you say but your body shows no signs of it How shall it be proven Before I believe you I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe and taste your mother’s milk

And what will my husband say to this Your father’s own sworn man and servant

We’ll give him so many ships to build he’ll never know you’ve left him

She laughed It’s a cruel lordling who’s seized me If I promise you that one day you may watch my babe get suck will you tell me more of your war Theon of House Greyjoy There are miles and mountains still ahead of us and I would hear of this wolf king you served and the golden lions he fights

Ever anxious to please her Theon obliged The rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he filled her pretty head with tales of Winterfell and war Some of the things he said astonished him She is easy to talk to gods praise her he reflected I feel as though I’ve known her for years If the wench’s pillow play is half the equal of her wit I’ll need to keep her    He thought of Sigrin the Shipwright a thick-bodied thick-witted man flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow and shook his head A waste A most tragic waste

It seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before them

The gates were open Theon put his heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot The hounds were barking wildly as he helped Esgred dismount Several came bounding up tails wagging They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over leaping all around her yapping and licking Off Theon shouted aiming an ineffectual kick at one big brown bitch but Esgred was laughing and wrestling with them

A stableman came pounding up after the dogs Take the horse Theon commanded him and get these damn dogs away—

The lout paid him no mind His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and he said Lady Asha You’re back

Last night she said I sailed from Great Wyk with Lord Goodbrother and spent the night at the inn My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from Lordsport She kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at Theon

All he could do was stand and gape at her Asha No She cannot be Asha He realized suddenly that there were two Ashas in his head One was the little girl he had known The other more vaguely imagined looked something like her mother Neither looked a bit like this    this    this   

The pimples went when the breasts came she explained while she tussled with a dog but I kept the vulture’s beak

Theon found his voice Why didn’t you tell me

Asha let go of the hound and straightened I wanted to see who you were first And I did She gave him a mocking half bow And now little brother pray excuse me I need to bathe and dress for the feast I wonder if I still have that chainmail gown I like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes She gave him that evil grin and crossed the bridge with that walk he’d liked so well half saunter and half sway

When Theon turned away Wex was smirking at him He gave the boy a clout on the ear That’s for enjoying this so much And another harder And that’s for not warning me Next time grow a tongue

His own chambers in the Guest Keep had never seemed so chilly though the thralls had left a brazier burning Theon kicked his boots off let his cloak fall to the floor and poured himself a cup of wine remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples She unlaced my breeches he thought outraged and she said    oh gods and I said    He groaned He could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself

No he thought then She was the one who made me a fool The evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of it And the way she kept reaching for my cock   

He took his cup and went to the window seat where he sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over Pyke I have no place here he thought and Asha is the reason may the Others take her The water below turned from green to grey to black By then he could hear distant music and he knew it was time to change for the feast

Theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes somber shades of black and grey to fit his mood No ornament he had nothing bought with iron I might have taken something off that wildling I killed to save Bran Stark but he had nothing worth the taking That’s my cursed luck I kill the poor

The long smoky hall was crowded with his father’s lords and captains when Theon entered near four hundred of them Dagmer Cleftjaw had not yet returned from Old Wyk with the Stonehouses and Drumms but all the rest were there—Harlaws from Harlaw Blacktydes from Blacktyde Sparrs Merlyns and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk Saltcliffes and Sunderlies from Saltcliffe and Botleys and Wynches from the other side of Pyke The thralls were pouring ale and there was music fiddles and skins and drums Three burly men were doing the finger dance spinning short-hafted axes at each other The trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step It was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one    or two or five

Neither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of Theon Greyjoy as he strode to the dais Lord Balon occupied the Seastone Chair carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when they came to the Iron Islands To the left of the high seat were Theon’s uncles Asha was ensconced at his right hand in the place of honor You come late Theon Lord Balon observed

I ask your pardon Theon took the empty seat beside Asha Leaning close he hissed in her ear You’re in my place
