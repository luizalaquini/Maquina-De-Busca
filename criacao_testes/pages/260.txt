256 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity Peace be
both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that
thou hast

257 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds
which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing
unto them all the while they were in Carmel

258 Ask thy young men and they will shew thee Wherefore let the
young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give
I pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to
thy son David

259 And when Davids young men came they spake to Nabal according to
all those words in the name of David and ceased

2510 And Nabal answered Davids servants and said Who is David and
who is the son of Jesse there be many servants now a days that break
away every man from his master

2511 Shall I then take my bread and my water and my flesh that I
have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom I know not
whence they be  2512 So Davids young men turned their way and went
again and came and told him all those sayings

2513 And David said unto his men Gird ye on every man his sword And
they girded on every man his sword and David also girded on his
sword and there went up after David about four hundred men and two
hundred abode by the stuff

2514 But one of the young men told Abigail Nabals wife saying
Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
master and he railed on them

2515 But the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt
neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them
when we were in the fields 2516 They were a wall unto us both by
night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep

2517 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is
determined against our master and against all his household for he
is such a son of Belial that a man cannot speak to him

2518 Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two
bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of
parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred
cakes of figs and laid them on asses

2519 And she said unto her servants Go on before me behold I come
after you But she told not her husband Nabal

2520 And it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the
covert on the hill and behold David and his men came down against
her and she met them

2521 Now David had said Surely in vain have I kept all that this
fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that
pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good

2522 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David if I leave of
all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against
the wall

2523 And when Abigail saw David she hasted and lighted off the ass
and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground
2524 And fell at his feet and said Upon me my lord upon me let
this iniquity be and let thine handmaid I pray thee speak in thine
audience and hear the words of thine handmaid

2525 Let not my lord I pray thee regard this man of Belial even
Nabal for as his name is so is he Nabal is his name and folly is
with him but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom
thou didst send

2526 Now therefore my lord as the LORD liveth and as thy soul
liveth seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed
blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine
enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as Nabal

2527 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord

2528 I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the
LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord
fighteth the battles of the LORD and evil hath not been found in thee
all thy days

2529 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy
God and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out
of the middle of a sling

2530 And it shall come to pass when the LORD shall have done to my
lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee
and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel 2531 That this shall
be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that
thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself
but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord then remember
thine handmaid
