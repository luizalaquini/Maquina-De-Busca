CATELYN

The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper Deep shadows draped the walls One of the torches had guttered out leaving only three Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue Brienne was across from her Between them her father’s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall Even the servants were gone She had given them leave to join the celebration

The walls of the keep were thick yet even so they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure’s imminent return and Robb’s conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale

I cannot blame them Catelyn thought They do not know And if they did why should they care They never knew my sons Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one never heard him laugh never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers She stared at the supper set before her trout wrapped in bacon salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass pease and onions and hot bread Brienne was eating methodically as if supper were another chore to be accomplished I am become a sour woman Catelyn thought I take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings There is an empty place within me where my heart was once

The sound of the other woman’s eating had become intolerable to her Brienne I am no fit company Go join the revels if you would Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund’s harping

I am not made for revels my lady Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were If you command it I…

Catelyn could sense her discomfort I only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine

I’m well content The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout had been fried in

There was another bird this morning Catelyn did not know why she said it The maester woke me at once That was dutiful but not kind Not kind at all She had not meant to tell Brienne No one knew but her and Maester Vyman and she had meant to keep it that way until… until…

Until what Foolish woman will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true If you never tell never speak of it will it become only a dream less than a dream a nightmare half-remembered Oh if only the gods would be so good

Is it news of King’s Landing asked Brienne

Would that it was The bird came from Castle Cerwyn from Ser Rodrik my castellan Dark wings dark words He has gathered what power he could and is marching on Winterfell to take the castle back How unimportant all that sounded now But he said… he wrote… he told me he…

My lady what is it Is it some news of your sons

Such a simple question that was would that the answer could be as simple When Catelyn tried to speak the words caught in her throat I have no sons but Robb She managed those terrible words without a sob and for that much she was glad

Brienne looked at her with horror My lady

Bran and Rickon tried to escape but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water Theon Greyjoy has mounted their heads on the walls of Winterfell Theon Greyjoy who ate at my table since he was a boy of ten I have said it gods forgive me I have said it and made it true

Brienne’s face was a watery blur She reached across the table but her fingers stopped short of Catelyn’s as if the touch might be unwelcome I… there are no words my lady My good lady Your sons they… they’re with the gods now

Are they Catelyn said sharply What god would let this happen Rickon was only a baby How could he deserve such a death And Bran… when I left the north he had not opened his eyes since his fall I had to go before he woke Now I can never return to him or hear him laugh again She showed Brienne her palms her fingers These scars… they sent a man to cut Bran’s throat as he lay sleeping He would have died then and me with him but Bran’s wolf tore out the man’s throat That gave her a moment’s pause I suppose Theon killed the wolves too He must have elsewise… I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with them Like Robb with his Grey Wind But my daughters have no wolves now

The abrupt shift of topic left Brienne bewildered Your daughters…

Sansa was a lady at three always so courteous and eager to please She loved nothing so well as tales of knightly valor Men would say she had my look but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was you can see that I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself She had auburn hair lighter than mine and so thick and soft… the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper

And Arya well… Ned’s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into the yard unannounced Arya was a trial it must be said Half a boy and half a wolf pup Forbid her anything and it became her heart’s desire She had Ned’s long face and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it I despaired of ever making a lady of her She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls and would say anything that came into her head I think she must be dead too When she said that it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing her chest I want them all dead Brienne Theon Greyjoy first then Jaime Lannister and Cersei and the Imp every one every one But my girls… my girls will…

The queen… she has a little girl of her own Brienne said awkwardly And sons too of an age with yours When she hears perhaps she… she may take pity and…

Send my daughters back unharmed Catelyn smiled sadly There is a sweet innocence about you child I could wish… but no Robb will avenge his brothers Ice can kill as dead as fire Ice was Ned’s greatsword Valyrian steel marked with the ripples of a thousand foldings so sharp I feared to touch it Robb’s blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice It will not be easy for him to get Theon’s head off I fear The Starks do not use headsmen Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade though he never took any joy in the duty But I would oh yes She stared at her scarred hands opened and closed them then slowly raised her eyes I’ve sent him wine

Wine Brienne was lost Robb Or… Theon Greyjoy

The Kingslayer The ploy had served her well with Cleos Frey I hope you’re thirsty Jaime I hope your throat is dry and tight I would like you to come with me

I am yours to command my lady

Good Catelyn rose abruptly Stay finish your meal in peace I will send for you later At midnight

So late my lady

The dungeons are windowless One hour is much like another down there and for me all hours are midnight Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall As she climbed to Lord Hoster’s solar she could hear them outside shouting Tully and A cup A cup to the brave young lord My father is not dead she wanted to shout down at them My sons are dead but my father lives damn you all and he is your lord still

Lord Hoster was deep in sleep He had a cup of drearnwine not so long ago my lady Maester Vyman said For the pain He will not know you are here

It makes no matter Catelyn said He is more dead than alive yet more alive than my poor sweet sons

My lady is there aught I might do for you A sleeping draught perhaps

Thank you Maester but no I will not sleep away my grief Bran and Rickon deserve better from me Go and join the celebration I will sit with my father for a time

As you will my lady Vyman bowed and left her

Lord Hoster lay on his back mouth open his breath a faint whistling sigh One hand hung over the edge of the mattress a pale frail fleshless thing but warm when she touched it She slid her fingers through his and closed them No matter how tightly I hold him I cannot keep him here she thought sadly Let him go Yet her fingers would not seem to unbend

I have no one to talk with Father she told him I pray but the gods do not answer Lightly she kissed his hand The skin was warm blue veins branching like rivers beneath his pale translucent skin Outside the greater rivers flowed the Red Fork and the Tumblestone and they would flow forever but not so the rivers in her father’s hand Too soon that current would grow still Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from Seagard Do you remember That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party Everything was grey and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse We lost the road The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed Lysa started to cry and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound But Petyr knew where we were and he rode back and found us…

But there’s no one to find me now is there This time I have to find our own way and it is hard so hard

I keep remembering the Stark words Winter has come Father For me For me Robb must fight the Greyjoys now as well as the Lannisters and for what For a gold hat and an iron chair Surely the land has bled enough I want my girls back I want Robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him sons I want Bran and Rickon back I want… Catelyn hung her head I want she said once more and then her words were gone

After a time the candle guttered and went out Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters laying pale silvery bars across her father’s face She could hear the soft whisper of his labored breathing the endless rush of waters the faint chords of some love song drifting up from the yard so sad and sweet I loved a maid as red as autumn Rymund sang with sunset in her hair

Catelyn never noticed when the singing ended Hours had passed yet it seemed only a heartbeat before Brienne was at the door My lady she announced softly Midnight has come

Midnight has come Father she thought and I must do my duty She let go of his hand

The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose They found him bent over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie more than a little drunk He squinted at them suspiciously Begging your forgiveness m’lady but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him with his seal upon it

Lord Edmure Has my father died and no one told me

The gaoler licked his lips No m’lady not as I knows

You will open the cell or you will come with me to Lord Hoster’s solar and tell him why you saw fit to defy me

His eyes fell As m’lady says The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that girdled his waist He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them until he found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer’s cell

Go back to your ale and leave us she commanded An oil lamp hung from a hook on the low ceiling Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame Brienne see that I am not disturbed

Nodding Brienne took up a position just outside the cell her hand resting on the pommel of her sword My lady will call if she has need of me

Catelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness This was the bowels of Riverrun and smelled the part Old straw crackled underfoot The walls were discolored with patches of nitre Through the stone she could hear the faint rush of the Tumblestone The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a huddled shape in another The flagon of wine stood beside the door untouched So much for that ploy I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself I suppose

Jaime raised his hands to cover his face the chains around his wrists clanking Lady Stark he said in a voice hoarse with disuse I fear I am in no condition to receive you
