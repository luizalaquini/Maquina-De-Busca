It was near dark when they reached it at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered still chewing her sourleaf but she gave them only the most cursory of looks with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile Two rooms at the top of the stair that’s all there is she said chewing all the while They’re under the bell tower you won’t be missing meals though there’s some thinks it too noisy Can’t be helped We’re full up or near as makes no matter It’s those rooms or the road

It was those rooms low dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase Leave your boots down here Masha told them after she’d taken their coin The boy will clean them I won’t have you tracking mud up my stairs Mind the bell Those who come late to meals don’t eat There were no smiles and no mention of sweet cakes

When the supper bell rang the sound was deafening Catelyn had changed into dry clothes She sat by the window watching rain run down the pane The glass was milky and full of bubbles and a wet dusk was falling outside Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met

The crossroads gave her pause If they turned west from here it was an easy ride down to Riverrun Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most and she yearned to talk to him to warn him of the gathering storm If Winterfell needed to brace for war how much more so Riverrun so much closer to King’s Landing with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow If only her father had been stronger she might have chanced it but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years and Catelyn was loath to tax him now

The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond Above the Vale the Eyrie stood high and impregnable its towers reaching for the sky There she would find her sister… and perhaps some of the answers Ned sought Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin and if it came to war they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service

Yet the mountain road was perilous Shadowcats prowled those passes rock slides were common and the mountain clans were lawless brigands descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them Even Jon Arryn as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains Catelyn’s only strength was one elderly knight armored in loyalty

No she thought Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait Her path ran north to Winterfell where her sons and her duty were waiting for her As soon as they were safely past the Neck she could declare herself to one of Ned’s bannermen and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad

The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory The marketplace was just across the way and the village a mile farther on half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept There would be more now the summer had been long and peaceful North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident through fertile valleys and green woodlands past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords

Catelyn knew them all the Blackwoods and the Brackens ever enemies whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle Lady Whent last of her line who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal irascible Lord Frey who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children grandchildren and great-grandchildren and bastards and grandbastards as well All of them were bannermen to the Tullys their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun Catelyn wondered if that would be enough if it came to war Her father was the staunchest man who’d ever lived and she had no doubt that he would call his banners… but would the banners come The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join theirs he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath but ever after her father had called him the Late Lord Frey It must not come to war Catelyn thought fervently They must not let it

Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight my lady

It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck she told him Common travelers attract less notice A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business say

As you say my lady Ser Rodrik agreed It was only when she laughed that he realized what he’d done The old courtesies die hard my—my daughter He tried to tug on his missing whiskers and sighed with exasperation

Catelyn took his arm Come Father she said You’ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table I think but try not to praise her You truly don’t want to see her smile

The common room was long and drafty with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs chewing her sourleaf all the while

The benches were crowded townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers The crossroads made for odd companions dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon hard-bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions

The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked Three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey On their shoulder was another familiar sigil the twin towers of House Frey She studied their faces but they were all too young to have known her The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went north

Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp Seven blessings to you goodfolk he said as they sat An empty wine cup stood on the table before him

And to you singer Catelyn returned Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now The singer a youth of some eighteen years eyed them boldly and asked where they were going and from whence they had come and what news they had letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer We left King’s Landing a fortnight ago Catelyn replied answering the safest of his questions

That’s where I’m bound the youth said As she had suspected he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices The Hand’s tourney means rich lords with fat purses The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry… or would have if I hadn’t lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day

The gods frown on the gambler Ser Rodrik said sternly He was of the north and shared the Stark views on tournaments

They frowned on me for certain the singer said Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in

No doubt that was a lesson for you Ser Rodrik said

It was This time my coin will champion Ser Loras

Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there but before he could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer dripping with hot juice Another skewer held tiny onions fire peppers and fat mushrooms Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer

My name is Marillion the singer said plucking a string on his woodharp Doubtless you’ve heard me play somewhere

His manner made Catelyn smile Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun I fear not she told him

He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp That is your loss he said Who was the finest singer you’ve ever heard

Alia of Braavos Ser Rodrik answered at once

Oh I’m much better than that old stick Marillion said If you have the silver for a song I’ll gladly show you

I might have a copper or two but I’d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling Ser Rodrik groused His opinion of singers was well known music was a lovely thing for girls but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword

Your grandfather has a sour nature Marillion said to Catelyn I meant to do you honor An homage to your beauty In truth I was made to sing for kings and high lords

Oh I can see that Catelyn said Lord Tully is fond of song I hear No doubt you’ve been to Riverrun

A hundred times the singer said airily They keep a chamber for me and the young lord is like a brother

Catelyn smiled wondering what Edmure would think of that Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied he had hated the breed ever since And Winterfell she asked him Have you traveled north

Why would I’ Marillion asked It’s all blizzards and bearskins up there and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves Distantly she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room

Innkeep a servant’s voice called out behind her we have horses that want stabling and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath

Oh gods Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him her fingers tightening hard around his forearm

Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile I’m sorry m’lord truly we’re full up every room

There were four of them Catelyn saw An old man in the black of the Night’s Watch two servants… and him standing there small and bold as life My men will steep in your stable and as for myself well I do not require a large room as you can plainly see He flashed a mocking grin So long as the fire’s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas I am a happy man

Masha Heddle was beside herself M’lord there’s nothing it’s the tourney there’s no help for it oh…

Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head caught it tossed it again Even across the room where Catelyn sat the wink of gold was unmistakable

A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet You’re welcome to my room m’lord

Now there’s a clever man Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room The freerider snatched it from the air And a nimble one to boot The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle You will be able to manage food I trust

Anything you like m’lord anything at all the innkeep promised And may he choke on it Catelyn thought but it was Bran she saw choking drowning on his own blood

Lannister glanced at the nearest tables My men will have whatever you’re serving these people Double portions we’ve had a long hard ride I’ll take a roast fowl—chicken duck pigeon it makes no matter And send up a flagon of your best wine Yoren will you sup with me

Aye m’lord I will the black brother replied

The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet My lord of Lannister he called out I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat Let me sing you the lay of your father’s great victory at King’s Landing

Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper the dwarf said dryly His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly started to move away… and found Catelyn He looked at her for a moment puzzled She turned her face away but too late The dwarf was smiling Lady Stark what an unexpected pleasure he said I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell

Marillion gaped at her confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet She heard Ser Rodrik curse If only the man had lingered at the Wall she thought if only…

Lady… Stark Masha Heddle said thickly
