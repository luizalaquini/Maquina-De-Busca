I… my lord that will never happen

It happened to me Jaime said

Swann wiped his brow with the sleeve of his white tunic

You have no answer

My lord Ser Balon drew himself up On my sword on my honor on my father’s name I swear… I shall not do as you did

Jaime laughed Good Return to your duties… and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to his shield

And then he was alone with the Knight of Flowers

Slim as a sword lithe and fit Ser Loras Tyrell wore a snowy linen tunic and white wool breeches with a gold belt around his waist and a gold rose clasping his fine silk cloak His hair was a soft brown tumble and his eyes were brown as well and bright with insolence He thinks this is a tourney and his tilt has just been called Seventeen and a knight of the Kingsguard said Jaime You must be proud Prince Aemon the Dragonknight was seventeen when he was named Did you know that

Yes my lord

And did you know that I was fifteen

That as well my lord He smiled

Jaime hated that smile I was better than you Ser Loras I was bigger I was stronger and I was quicker

And now you’re older the boy said My lord

He had to laugh This is too absurd Tyrion would mock me unmercifully if he could hear me now comparing cocks with this green boy Older and wiser ser You should learn from me

As you learned from Ser Boros and Ser Meryn

That arrow hit too close to the mark I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold Jaime snapped I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning who could have slain all five of you with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right I learned from Prince Lewyn of Dorne and Ser Oswell Whent and Ser Jonothor Darry good men every one

Dead men every one

He’s me Jaime realized suddenly I am speaking to myself as I was all cocksure arrogance and empty chivalry This is what it does to you to be too good too young

As in a swordfight sometimes it is best to try a different stroke It’s said you fought magnificently in the battle… almost as well as Lord Renly’s ghost beside you A Sworn Brother has no secrets from his Lord Commander Tell me ser Who was wearing Renly’s armor

For a moment Loras Tyrell looked as though he might refuse but in the end he remembered his vows My brother he said sullenly Renly was taller than me and broader in the chest His armor was too loose on me but it suited Garlan well

Was the masquerade your notion or his

Lord Littlefinger suggested it He said it would frighten Stannis’s ignorant men-at-arms

And so it did And some knights and lordlings too Well you gave the singers something to make rhymes about I suppose that’s not to be despised What did you do with Renly

I buried him with mine own hands in a place he showed me once when I was a squire at Storm’s End No one shall ever find him there to disturb his rest He looked at Jaime defiantly I will defend King Tommen with all my strength I swear it I will give my life for his if need be But I will never betray Renly by word or deed He was the king that should have been He was the best of them

The best dressed perhaps Jaime thought but for once he did not say it The arrogance had gone out of Ser Loras the moment he began to speak of Renly He answered truly He is proud and reckless and full of piss but he is not false Not yet As you say One more thing and you may return to your duties

Yes my lord

I still have Brienne of Tarth in a tower cell
