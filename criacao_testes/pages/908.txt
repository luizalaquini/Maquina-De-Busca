being witnessed by the law and the prophets 322 Even the
righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
upon all them that believe for there is no difference 323 For all
have sinned and come short of the glory of God 324 Being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
325 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
past through the forbearance of God 326 To declare I say at this
time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of
him which believeth in Jesus

327 Where is boasting then It is excluded By what law of works
Nay but by the law of faith

328 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
the deeds of the law

329 Is he the God of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles
Yes of the Gentiles also 330 Seeing it is one God which shall
justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith

331 Do we then make void the law through faith God forbid yea we
establish the law

41 What shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to
the flesh hath found  42 For if Abraham were justified by works he
hath whereof to glory but not before God

43 For what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was
counted unto him for righteousness

44 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but
of debt

45 But to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness

46 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto
whom God imputeth righteousness without works 47 Saying Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered

48 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin

49 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon
the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham
for righteousness

410 How was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in
uncircumcision Not in circumcision but in uncircumcision

411 And he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that
he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not
circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also 412
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised

413 For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not
to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the
righteousness of faith

414 For if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void
and the promise made of none effect 415 Because the law worketh
wrath for where no law is there is no transgression

416 Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end
the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is
of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is
the father of us all 417 As it is written I have made thee a
father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who
quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though
they were

418 Who against hope believed in hope that he might become the
father of many nations according to that which was spoken So shall
thy seed be

419 And being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now
dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness
of Sarahs womb 420 He staggered not at the promise of God through
unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God 421 And being
fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to
perform

422 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness

423 Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to
him 424 But for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead 425 Who was
delivered for our offences and was raised again for our
justification

51 Therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ 52 By whom also we have access by faith into
this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God

53 And not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that
tribulation worketh patience 54 And patience experience and
experience hope 55 And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of
