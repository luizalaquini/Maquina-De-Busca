644 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor
perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen O God beside thee
what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him

645 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those
that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have
sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved

646 But we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities
like the wind have taken us away

647 And there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and
hast consumed us because of our iniquities

648 But now O LORD thou art our father we are the clay and thou
our potter and we all are the work of thy hand

649 Be not wroth very sore O LORD neither remember iniquity for
ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people

6410 Thy holy cities are a wilderness Zion is a wilderness
Jerusalem a desolation

6411 Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised
thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid
waste

6412 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things O LORD wilt thou
hold thy peace and afflict us very sore  651 I am sought of them
that asked not for me I am found of them that sought me not I said
Behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name

652 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people
which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts
653 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that
sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick 654
Which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat
swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels
655 Which say Stand by thyself come not near to me for I am holier
than thou These are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the
day

656 Behold it is written before me I will not keep silence but
will recompense even recompense into their bosom 657 Your
iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the
LORD which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me
upon the hills therefore will I measure their former work into their
bosom

658 Thus saith the LORD As the new wine is found in the cluster and
one saith Destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will I do for
my servants sakes that I may not destroy them all

659 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah an
inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my
servants shall dwell there

6510 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of Achor a
place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me

6511 But ye are they that forsake the LORD that forget my holy
mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the
drink offering unto that number

6512 Therefore will I number you to the sword and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter because when I called ye did not answer when
I spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did
choose that wherein I delighted not

6513 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold my servants shall
eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye
shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be
ashamed 6514 Behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye
shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit

6515 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the
Lord GOD shall slay thee and call his servants by another name 6516
That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
God of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God
of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they
are hid from mine eyes

6517 For behold I create new heavens and a new earth and the
former shall not be remembered nor come into mind

6518 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create for
behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy

6519 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of
crying

6520 There shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man
that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred
years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be
accursed

6521 And they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall
