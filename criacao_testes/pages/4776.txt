The maester Sam swallowed I    I just left him my lord That wasn’t truly a lie but if Pyke chose to read it wrong it might make him more inclined to listen Sam took a deep breath and launched into his plea

Pyke cut him off before he’d said twenty words You want me to kneel down and kiss the hem of Mallister’s pretty cloak is that it I might have known You lordlings all flock like sheep Well tell Aemon that he’s wasted your breath and my time If anyone withdraws it should be Mallister The man’s too bloody old for the job maybe you ought to go tell him that We choose him and we’re like to be back here in a year choosing someone else

He’s old Sam agreed but he’s well ex-experienced

At sitting in his tower and fussing over maps maybe What does he plan to do write letters to the wights He’s a knight well and good but he’s not a fighter and I don’t give a kettle of piss who he unhorsed in some fool tourney fifty years ago The Halfhand fought all his battles even an old blind man should see that And we need a fighter more than ever with this bloody king on top of us Today it’s ruins and empty fields well and good but what will His Grace want come the morrow You think Mallister has the belly to stand up to Stannis Baratheon and that red bitch He laughed I don’t

You won’t support him then said Sam dismayed

Are you Sam the Slayer or Deaf Dick No I won’t support him Pyke jabbed a finger at his face Understand this boy I don’t want the bloody job and never did I fight best with a deck beneath me not a horse and Castle Black is too far from the sea But I’ll be buggered with a red-hot sword before I turn the Night’s Watch over to that preening eagle from the Shadow Tower And you can run back to the old man and tell him I said so if he asks He stood Get out of my sight

It took all the courage Sam had left in him to say W-what if there was someone else Could you s-support someone else

Who Bowen Marsh The man counts spoons Othell’s a follower does what he’s told and does it well but no more’n that Slynt    well his men like him I’ll grant you and it would almost be worth it to stick him down the royal craw and see if Stannis gagged but no There’s too much of King’s Landing in that one A toad grows wings and thinks he’s a bloody dragon Pyke laughed Who does that leave Hobb We could pick him I suppose only then who’s going to boil your mutton Slayer You look like a man who likes his bloody mutton

There was nothing more to say Defeated Sam could only stammer out his thanks and take his leave I will do better with Ser Denys he tried to tell himself as he walked through the castle Ser Denys was a knight highborn and well-spoken and he had treated Sam most courteously when he’d found him and Gilly on the road Ser Denys will listen to me he has to

The commander of the Shadow Tower had been born beneath the Booming Tower of Seagard and looked every inch a Mallister Sable trimmed his collar and accented the sleeves of his black velvet doublet A silver eagle fastened its claws in the gathered folds of his cloak His beard was white as snow his hair was largely gone and his face was deeply lined it was true Yet he still had grace in his movements and teeth in his mouth and the years had dimmed neither his blue-grey eyes nor his courtesy

My lord of Tarly he said when his steward brought Sam to him in the Lance where the Shadow Tower men were staying I am pleased to see that you’ve recovered from your ordeal Might I offer you a cup of wine Your lady mother is a Florent I recall One day I must tell you about the time I unhorsed both of your grandfathers in the same tourney Not today though I know we have more pressing concerns You come from Maester Aemon to be sure Does he have counsel to offer me

Sam took a sip of wine and chose his words with care A maester chained and sworn    it would not be proper for him to be seen as having influenced the choice of Lord Commander   

The old knight smiled Which is why he has not come to me himself Yes I quite understand Samwell Aemon and I are both old men and wise in such matters Say what you came to say

The wine was sweet and Ser Denys listened to Sam’s plea with grave courtesy unlike Cotter Pyke But when he was done the old knight shook his head I agree that it would be a dark day in our history if a king were to name our Lord Commander This king especially He is not like to keep his crown for long But truly Samwell it ought to be Pyke who withdraws I have more support than he does and I am better suited to the office

You are Sam agreed but Cotter Pyke might serve It’s said he has oft proved himself in battle He did not mean to offend Ser Denys by praising his rival but how else could he convince him to withdraw

Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle It is not enough Some matters cannot be settled with a battleaxe Maester Aemon will understand that though Cotter Pyke does not The Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch is a lord first and foremost He must be able to treat with other lords    and with kings as well He must be a man worthy of respect Ser Denys leaned forward We are the sons of great lords you and I We know the importance of birth blood and that early training that can ne’er be replaced I was a squire at twelve a knight at eighteen a champion at two-and-twenty I have been the commander at the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years Blood birth and training have fitted me to deal with kings Pyke    well did you hear him this morning asking if His Grace would wipe his bottom Samwell it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers but let us be frank    the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy Maester Harmune reads and writes his letters and has for years No loath as I am to disappoint Maester Aemon I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch

This time Sam was ready Might you for someone else If it was someone more suitable

Ser Denys considered a moment I have never desired the honor for its own sake At the last choosing I stepped aside gratefully when Lord Mormont’s name was offered just as I had for Lord Qorgyle at the choosing before that So long as the Night’s Watch remains in good hands I am content But Bowen Marsh is not equal to the task no more than Othell Yarwyck And this so-called Lord of Harrenhal is a butcher’s whelp unjumped by the Lannisters Small wonder he is venal and corrupt

There’s another man Sam blurted out Lord Commander Mormont trusted him So did Donal Noye and Qhorin Halfhand Though he’s not as highly born as you he comes from old blood He was castle-born and castle-raised and he learned sword and lance from a knight and letters from a maester of the Citadel His father was a lord and his brother a king

Ser Denys stroked his long white beard Mayhaps he said after a long moment He is very young but    mayhaps He might serve I grant you though I would be more suitable I have no doubt of that I would be the wiser choice

Jon said there could be honor in a lie if it were told for the right reason Sam said If we do not choose a Lord Commander tonight King Stannis means to name Cotter Pyke He said as much to Maester Aemon this morning after all of you had left

I see Ser Denys rose I must think on this Thank you Samwell And give my thanks to Maester Aemon as well

Sam was trembling by the time he left the Lance What have I done he thought What have I said If they caught him in his lie they would    what Send me to the Wall Rip my entrails out Turn me into a wight Suddenly it all seemed absurd How could he be so frightened of Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister when he had seen a raven eating Small Paul’s face

Pyke was not pleased by his return You again Make it quick you are starting to annoy me

I only need a moment more Sam promised You won’t withdraw for Ser Denys you said but you might for someone else

Who is it this time Slayer You

No A fighter Donal Noye gave him the Wall when the wildlings came and he was the Old Bear’s squire The only thing is he’s bastard-born

Cotter Pyke laughed Bloody hell That would shove a spear up Mallister’s arse wouldn’t it Might be worth it just for that How bad could the boy be He snorted I’d be better though I’m what’s needed any fool can see that

Any fool Sam agreed even me But    well I shouldn’t be telling you but    King Stannis means to force Ser Denys on us if we do not choose a man tonight I heard him tell Maester Aemon that after the rest of you were sent away





JON

Iron Emmett was a long lanky young ranger whose endurance strength and swordsmanship were the pride of Eastwatch Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore and woke the next day covered with bruises which was just the way he wanted it He would never get any better going up against the likes of Satin and Horse or even Grenn

Most days he gave as good as he got Jon liked to think but not today He had hardly slept last night and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt dressed and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up wrestling with Stannis Baratheon’s offer The lack of sleep was catching up with him now and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard driving him back on his heels with one long looping cut after another and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure Jon’s arm had gone numb from the shock of impact and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be growing heavier with every passing moment

He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple He staggered his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur

And then the years were gone and he was back at Winterfell once more wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate His sword was made of wood and it was Robb who stood facing him not Iron Emmett

Every morning they had trained together since they were big enough to walk Snow and Stark spinning and slashing about the wards of Winterfell shouting and laughing sometimes crying when there was no one else to see They were not little boys when they fought but knights and mighty heroes I’m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight Jon would call out and Robb would shout back Well I’m Florian the Fool Or Robb would say I’m the Young Dragon and Jon would reply I’m Ser Ryam Redwyne

That morning he called it first I’m Lord of Winterfell he cried as he had a hundred times before Only this time this time Robb had answered You can’t be Lord of Winterfell you’re bastard-born My lady mother says you can’t ever be the Lord of Winterfell

I thought I had forgotten that Jon could taste blood in his mouth from the blow he’d taken

In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett one man on either arm The ranger sat on the ground dazed his shield half in splinters the visor of his helm knocked askew and his sword six yards away Jon enough Halder was shouting he’s down you disarmed him Enough

No Not enough Never enough Jon let his sword drop I’m sorry he muttered Emmett are you hurt

Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend Lord Snow It was said amiably though Emmett was an amiable man and he loved the song of swords Warrior defend me he groaned now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt

That was too much Jon wrenched free of his friends and retreated to the armory alone His ears were still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt him He sat on the bench and buried his head in his hands Why am I so angry he asked himself but it was a stupid question Lord of Winterfell I could be the Lord of Winterfell My father’s heir

It was not Lord Eddard’s face he saw floating before him though it was Lady Catelyn’s With her deep blue eyes and hard cold mouth she looked a bit like Stannis Iron he thought but brittle She was looking at him the way she used to look at him at Winterfell whenever he had bested Robb at swords or sums or most anything Who are you that look had always seemed to say This is not your place Why are you here

His friends were still out in the practice yard but Jon was in no fit state to face them He left the armory by the back descending a steep flight of stone steps to the wormways the tunnels that linked the castle’s keeps and towers below the earth It was short walk to the bathhouse where he took a cold plunge to wash the sweat off and soaked in a hot stone tub The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles and made him think of Winterfell’s muddy pools steaming and bubbling in the godswood Winterfell he thought Theon left it burned and broken but I could restore it Surely his father would have wanted that and Robb as well They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins

You can’t be the Lord of Winterfell you’re bastard-born he heard Robb say again And the stone kings were growling at him with granite tongues You do not belong here This is not your place When Jon closed his eyes he saw the heart tree with its pale limbs red leaves and solemn face The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell Lord Eddard always said    but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots and feed it to the red woman’s hungry fire god I have no right he thought Winterfell belongs to the old gods

The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black I don’t know a man was saying in a voice thick with doubts Maybe if I knew the man better    Lord Stannis didn’t have much good to say of him I’ll tell you that

When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone Ser Alliser’s flinty voice was unmistakable If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander we become his bannermen in all but name Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end He’s already beaten Stannis once on the Blackwater

Lord Tywin favors Slynt said Bowen Marsh in a fretful anxious voice I can show you his letter Othell ‘Our faithful friend and servant’ he called him

Jon Snow sat up suddenly and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh My lords he said with cold courtesy
