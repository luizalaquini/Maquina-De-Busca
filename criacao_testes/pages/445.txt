Finally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while she was worrying at one of Weese’s ears

Damnedest thing she heard a man say He had that bitch dog since she was a pup

This place is cursed the man with the crossbow said

It’s Harren’s ghost that’s what it is said Goodwife Amabel I’ll not sleep here another night I swear it

Arya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog Jaqen H’ghar was leaning up against the side of the Wailing Tower When he saw her looking he lifted a hand to his face and laid two fingers casually against his cheek





CATELYN

Two days ride from Riverrun a scout spied them watering their horses beside a muddy steam Catelyn had never been so glad to see the twin tower badge of House Frey

When she asked him to lead them to her uncle he said The Blackfish is gone west with the king my lady Martyn Rivers commands the outriders in his stead

I see She had met Rivers at the Twins a baseborn son of Lord Walder Frey half brother to Ser Perwyn It did not surprise her to learn that Robb had struck at the heart of Lannister power clearly he had been contemplating just that when he sent her away to treat with Renly Where is Rivers now

His camp is two hours ride my lady

Take us to him she commanded Brienne helped her back into her saddle and they set out at once

Have you come from Bitterbridge my lady the scout asked

No She had not dared With Renly dead Catelyn had been uncertain of the reception she might receive from his young widow and her protectors Instead she had ridden through the heart of the war through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the Lannisters and each night her scouts brought back tales that made her ill Lord Renly is slain she added

We’d hoped that tale was some Lannister lie or—

Would that it were My brother commands in Riverrun

Yes my lady His Grace left Ser Edmure to hold Riverrun and guard his rear

Gods grant him the strength to do so Catelyn thought And the wisdom as well Is there word from Robb in the west

You have not heard The man seemed surprised His Grace won a great victory at Oxcross Ser Stafford Lannister is dead his host scattered

Ser Wendel Manderly gave a whoop of pleasure but Catelyn only nodded Tomorrow’s trials concerned her more than yesterday’s triumphs

Martyn Rivers had made his camp in the shell of a shattered holdfast beside a roofless stable and a hundred fresh graves He went to one knee when Catelyn dismounted Well met my lady Your brother charged us to keep an eye out for your party and escort you back to Riverrun in all haste should we come upon you

Catelyn scarce liked the sound of that Is it my father

No my lady Lord Hoster is unchanged Rivers was a ruddy man with scant resemblance to his half brothers It is only that we feared you might chance upon Lannister scouts Lord Tywin has left Harrenhal and marches west with all his power

Rise she told Rivers frowning Stannis Baratheon would soon be on the march as well gods help them all How long until Lord Tywin is upon us

Three days perhaps four it is hard to know We have eyes out along all the roads but it would be best not to linger

Nor did they Rivers broke his camp quickly and saddled up beside her and they set off again near fifty strong now flying beneath the direwolf the leaping trout the twin towers
