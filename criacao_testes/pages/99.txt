Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field She had no choice but to stop beside him Some septa trained you well You’re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles aren’t you A pretty little talking bird repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite

That’s unkind Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest You’re frightening me I want to go now

No one could withstand him the Hound rasped That’s truth enough No one could ever withstand Gregor That boy today his second joust oh that was a pretty bit of business You saw that did you Fool boy he had no business riding in this company No money no squire no one to help him with that armor That gorget wasn’t fastened proper You think Gregor didn’t notice that You think Ser Gregor’s lance rode up by chance do you Pretty little talking girl you believe that you’re empty-headed as a bird for true Gregor’s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go Look at me Look at me Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up He squatted in front of her and moved the torch close There’s a pretty for you Take a good long stare You know you want to I’ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad Piss on that Take your look

His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap His eyes watched hers Drunken eyes sullen with anger She had to look

The right side of his face was gaunt with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow His nose was large and hooked his hair thin dark He wore it long and brushed it sideways because no hair grew on the other side of that face

The left side of his face was a ruin His ear had been burned away there was nothing left but a hole His eye was still good but all around it was a twisted mass of scar slick black flesh hard as leather pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved Down by his jaw you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away

Sansa began to cry He let go of her then and snuffed out the torch in the dirt No pretty words for that girl No little compliment the septa taught you When there was no answer he continued Most of them they think it was some battle A siege a burning tower an enemy with a torch One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath His laugh was softer this time but just as bitter I’ll tell you what it was girl he said a voice from the night a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath I was younger than you six maybe seven A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father’s keep and to buy favor he sent us gifts The old man made marvelous toys I don’t remember what I got but it was Gregor’s gift I wanted A wooden knight all painted up every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings so you could make him fight Gregor is five years older than me the toy was nothing to him he was already a squire near six foot tall and muscled like an ox So I took his knight but there was no joy to it I tell you I was scared all the while and true enough he found me There was a brazier in the room Gregor never said a word just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed You saw how strong he is Even then it took three grown men to drag him off me The septons preach about the seven hells What do they know Only a man who’s been burned knows what hell is truly like

My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire and our maester gave me ointments Ointments Gregor got his ointments too Four years later they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said ‘Arise Ser Gregor’

The rasping voice trailed off He squatted silently before her a hulking black shape shrouded in the night hidden from her eyes Sansa could hear his ragged breathing She was sad for him she realized Somehow the fear had gone away

The silence went on and on so long that she began to grow afraid once more but she was afraid for him now not for herself She found his massive shoulder with her hand He was no true knight she whispered to him

The Hound threw back his head and roared Sansa stumbled back away from him but he caught her arm No he growled at her no little bird he was no true knight

The rest of the way into the city Sandor Clegane said not a word He led her to where the carts were waiting told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep and climbed in after her They rode in silence through the King’s Gate and up torchlit city streets He opened the postern door and led her into the castle his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber

Thank you my lord Sansa said meekly

The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close The things I told you tonight he said his voice sounding even rougher than usual If you ever tell Joffrey… your sister your father… any of them…

I won’t Sansa whispered I promise

It was not enough If you ever tell anyone he finished I’ll kill you





EDDARD

I stood last vigil for him myself Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart He had no one else A mother in the Vale I am told

In the pale dawn light the young knight looked as though he were sleeping He had not been handsome but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat Eddard Stark looked at his face and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak to him could that be mere happenstance He supposed he would never know

Hugh was Jon Arryn’s squire for four years Selmy went on The king knighted him before he rode north in Jon’s memory The lad wanted it desperately yet I fear he was not ready

Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years None of us is ever ready he said

For knighthood

For death Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons When his mother asked why her son was dead he reflected bitterly they would tell her he had fought to honor the King’s Hand Eddard Stark This was needless War should not be a game Ned turned to the woman beside the cart shrouded in grey face hidden but for her eyes The silent sisters prepared men for the grave and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death Send his armor home to the Vale The mother will want to have it

It is worth a fair piece of silver Ser Barristan said The boy had it forged special for the tourney Plain work but good I do not know if he had finished paying the smith

He paid yesterday my lord and he paid dearly Ned replied And to the silent sister he said Send the mother the armor I will deal with this smith She bowed her head
