The years have not improved it I fear Brynden Tully said but when he lifted off the helm Catelyn saw that he lied His features were lined and weathered and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey but the smile was the same and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars and the laughter in his deep blue eyes Did Lysa know you were coming

There was no time to send word ahead Catelyn told him The others were coming up behind her I fear we ride before the storm Uncle

May we enter the Vale Ser Donnel asked The Waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony

In the name of Robert Arryn Lord of the Eyrie Defender of the Vale True Warden of the East I bid you enter freely and charge you to keep his peace Ser Brynden replied Come

And so she rode behind him beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes On the far side of the stoneworks the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields blue sky and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away The Vale of Arryn bathed in the morning light

It stretched before them to the misty cast a tranquil land of rich black soil wide slow-moving rivers and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than here They stood at the western end of the valley where the high road crested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below The Vale was narrow here no more than a half day’s ride across and the northern mountains seemed so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant’s Lance a mountain that even mountains looked up to its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor Over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa’s Tears Even from this distance Catelyn could make out the shining silver thread bright against the dark stone

When her uncle saw that she had stopped he moved his horse closer and pointed It’s there beside Alyssa’s Tears All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right

Seven towers Ned had told her like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds How long a ride she asked

We can be at the mountain by evenfall Uncle Brynden said but the climb will take another day

Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind My lady he said I fear I can go no farther today His face sagged beneath his ragged newgrown whiskers and he looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse

Nor should you she said You have done all I could have asked of you and a hundred times more My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie Lannister must come with me but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength

We should be honored to have them to guest Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young Beside Ser Rodrik only Bronn Ser Willis Wode and Marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads

My lady Marillion said riding forward I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings The boy sounded haggard yet strangely determined he had a fevered shine to his eyes

Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them that choice he had made himself and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them she could never say Yet here he was with a scruff of beard that made him look almost a man Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far Very well she told him

I’ll come as well Bronn announced

She liked that less well Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale she knew the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen and his sword had helped cut them through to safety Yet for all that Catelyn misliked the man Courage he had and strength but there was no kindness in him and little loyalty And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn As you wish she said although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission

Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik a soft-spoken septon fussing over their wounds Their horses were left behind as well poor ragged things Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of their coming Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats and within the hour they set forth once again Catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor Behind came Bronn Tyrion Lannister Marillion and six of Brynden’s men

Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path well out of earshot of the others did Brynden Tully turn to her and say So child Tell me about this storm of yours

I have not been a child in many years Uncle Catelyn said but she told him nonetheless It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all Lysa’s letter and Bran’s fall the assassin’s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroads inn

Her uncle listened silently heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper Brynden Tully had always known how to listen… to anyone but her father He was Lord Hoster’s brother younger by five years but the two of them had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember During one of their louder quarrels when Catelyn was eight Lord Hoster had called Brynden the black goat of the Tully flock Laughing Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout so he ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat and from that day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem

The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed It was at their wedding feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new husband the Lord of the Eyrie Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother’s name since from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters

Nonetheless during all those years of Catelyn’s girlhood it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster’s children had run with their tears and their tales when Father was too busy and Mother too ill Catelyn Lysa Edmure… and yes even Petyr Baelish their father’s ward… he had listened to them all patiently as he listened now laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes

When she was done her uncle remained silent for a long time as his horse negotiated the steep rocky trail Your father must be told he said at last If the Lannisters should march Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains but Riverrun lies right in their path

I’d had the same fear Catelyn admitted I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie She had other messages to send as well the commands that Ned had given her for his bannermen to ready the defenses of the north What is the mood in the Vale she asked

Angry Brynden Tully admitted Lord Jon was much loved and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East but no one is fooled Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand’s death None dare say Jon was murdered not openly but suspicion casts a long shadow He gave Catelyn a look his mouth tight And there is the boy

The boy What of him She ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of rock and around a sharp turn

Her uncle’s voice was troubled Lord Robert he sighed Six years old sickly and prone to weep if you take his dolls away Jon Arryn’s trueborn heir by all the gods yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father’s seat Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years while Lord Jon served in King’s Landing and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age Others believe that Lysa must marry again and soon Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield The Eyrie is full of them

I might have expected that Catelyn said Small wonder there Lysa was still young and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift Will Lysa take another husband

She says yes provided she finds a man who suits her Brynden Tully said but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband

You of all people can scarce fault her for that

Ser Brynden snorted Nor do I but… it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship She enjoys the sport but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name

A woman can rule as wisely as a man Catelyn said

The right woman can her uncle said with a sideways glance Make no mistake Cat Lysa is not you He hesitated a moment If truth be told I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like

She was puzzled What do you mean

The Lysa who came back from King’s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand Those years were hard for her You must know Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband but their marriage was made from politics not passion

As was my own

They began the same but your ending has been happier than your sister’s Two babes stillborn twice as many miscarriages Lord Arryn’s death… Catelyn the gods gave Lysa only the one child and he is all your sister lives for now poor boy Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters Your sister is afraid child and the Lannisters are what she fears most She ran to the Vale stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night and all to snatch her son out of the lion’s mouth… and now you have brought the lion to her door

In chains Catelyn said A crevasse yawned on her right falling away into darkness She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step

Oh Her uncle glanced back to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind them I see an axe on his saddle a dirk at his belt and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow Where are the chains sweet one

Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat The dwarf is here and not by choice Chains or no he is my prisoner Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered and her own letter that first warned us against them

Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile I hope you are right child he sighed in tones that said she was wrong

The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses The road widened and grew straight and for the first time Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses growing Once they reached the valley floor the going was faster and they made good time cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets past orchards and golden wheat fields splashing across a dozen sunlit streams Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them a double banner flying from his staff the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high and below it his own black fish Farm wagons and merchants’ carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass

Even so it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the Giant’s Lance Torches flickered atop its ramparts and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat The drawbridge was up and the portcullis down but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers beyond

The Gates of the Moon her uncle said as the party drew rein His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse Lord Nestor’s seat He should be expecting us Look up

Catelyn raised her eyes up and up and up At first all she saw was stone and trees the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night as black as a starless sky Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them a tower keep built upon the steep side of the mountain its lights like orange eyes staring down from above Above that was another higher and more distant and still higher a third no more than a flickering spark in the sky And finally up where the falcons soared a flash of white in the moonlight Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers so far above

The Eyrie she heard Marillion murmur awed

The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in The Arryns must not be overfond of company If you’re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark I’d rather you kill me here

We’ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow Brynden told him

I can scarcely wait the dwarf replied How do we get up there I’ve no experience at riding goats

Mules Brynden said smiling
