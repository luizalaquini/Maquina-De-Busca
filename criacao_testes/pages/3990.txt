Pollux pale and sweaty reaches out and latches on to
Castors wrist Like he might fall over if there isnt someone
to steady him
My brother worked down here after he became an
Avox says Castor Of course Who else would they get to
maintain these dank evil-smelling passages mined with
pods Took five years before we were able to buy his way
up to ground level Didnt see the sun once
Under better conditions on a day with fewer horrors
and more rest someone would surely know what to say
Instead we all stand there for a long time trying to formulate
a response
Finally Peeta turns to Pollux Well then you just
became our most valuable asset Castor laughs and
Pollux manages a smile
Were halfway down the first tunnel when I realize what
was so remarkable about the exchange Peeta sounded
like his old self the one who could always think of the right
thing to say when nobody else could Ironic encouraging a
little funny but not at anyones expense I glance back at
him as he trudges along under his guards Gale and
Jackson his eyes fixed on the ground his shoulders
hunched forward So dispirited But for a moment he was
really here
Peeta called it right Pollux turns out to be worth ten
Holos There is a simple network of wide tunnels that
directly corresponds to the main street plan above
underlying the major avenues and cross streets Its called
the Transfer since small trucks use it to deliver goods
around the city During the day its many pods are
deactivated but at night its a minefield However hundreds
of additional passages utility shafts train tracks and
drainage tubes form a multilevel maze Pollux knows details
that would lead to disaster for a newcomer like which
offshoots might require gas masks or have live wires or
rats the size of beavers He alerts us to the gush of water
that sweeps through the sewers periodically anticipates
the time the Avoxes will be changing shifts leads us into
damp obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage of
cargo trains Most important he has knowledge of the
cameras There arent many down in this gloomy misty
place except in the Transfer But we keep well out of their
way
Under Polluxs guidance we make good time--
remarkable time if you compare it to our aboveground
travel After about six hours fatigue takes over Its three in
the morning so I figure we still have a few hours before our
bodies are discovered missing they search through the
rubble of the whole block of apartments in case we tried to
escape through the shafts and the hunt begins
When I suggest we rest no one objects Pollux finds a
small warm room humming with machines loaded with
levers and dials He holds up his fingers to indicate we
must be gone in four hours Jackson works out a guard
schedule and since Im not on the first shift I wedge myself
in the tight space between Gale and Leeg 1 and go right to
sleep
It seems like only minutes later when Jackson shakes
me awake tells me Im on watch Its six oclock and in one
hour we must be on our way Jackson tells me to eat a can
of food and keep an eye on Pollux whos insisted on being
on guard the entire night He cant sleep down here I drag
myself into a state of relative alertness eat a can of potato
and bean stew and sit against the wall facing the door
Pollux seems wide awake Hes probably been reliving
those five years of imprisonment all night I get out the Holo
and manage to input our grid coordinates and scan the
tunnels As expected more pods are registering the closer
we move toward the center of the Capitol For a while
Pollux and I click around on the Holo seeing what traps lie
where When my head begins to spin I hand it over to him
and lean back against the wall I look down at the sleeping
soldiers crew and friends and I wonder how many of us
will ever see the sun again
When my eyes fall on Peeta whose head rests right by
my feet I see hes awake I wish I could read whats going
on in his mind that I could go in and untangle the mess of
lies Then I settle for something I can accomplish
Have you eaten I ask A slight shake of his head
indicates he hasnt I open a can of chicken and rice soup
and hand it to him keeping the lid in case he tries to slit his
wrists with it or something He sits up and tilts the can
chugging back the soup without really bothering to chew it
The bottom of the can reflects the lights from the machines
and I remember something thats been itching at the back
of my mind since yesterday Peeta when you asked about
what happened to Darius and Lavinia and Boggs told you
it was real you said you thought so Because there was
nothing shiny about it What did you mean
Oh I dont know exactly how to explain it he tells me
In the beginning everything was just complete confusion
Now I can sort certain things out I think theres a pattern
emerging The memories they altered with the tracker
jacker venom have this strange quality about them Like
theyre too intense or the images arent stable You
remember what it was like when we were stung
Trees shattered There were giant colored butterflies
I fell in a pit of orange bubbles I think about it Shiny
orange bubbles
Right But nothing about Darius or Lavinia was like
