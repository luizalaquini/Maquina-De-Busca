You are Arya of Winterfell daughter of the north You told me you could be strong You have the wolf blood in you

The wolf blood Arya remembered now I’ll be as strong as Robb I said I would She took a deep breath then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across her knee It broke with a loud crack and she threw the pieces aside I am a direwolf and done with wooden teeth

That night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise They were the only voices she trusted anymore She could hear the sound of her own breath and the wolves as well a great pack of them now They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood she thought They are calling to me

Finally she slipped from under the blanket wriggled into a tunic and padded barefoot down the stairs Roose Bolton was a cautious man and the entrance to Kingspyre was guarded day and night so she had to slip out of a narrow cellar window The yard was still the great castle lost in haunted dreams Above the wind keened through the Wailing Tower

At the forge she found the fires extinguished and the doors closed and barred She crept in a window as she had once before Gendry shared a mattress with two other apprentice smiths She crouched in the loft for a long time before her eyes adjusted enough for her to be sure that he was the one on the end Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched him His eyes opened He could not have been very deeply asleep Please she whispered She took her hand off his mouth and pointed

For a moment she did not think he understood but then he slid out from under the blankets Naked he padded across the room shrugged into a loose roughspun tunic and climbed down from the loft after her The other sleepers did not stir What do you want now Gendry said in a low angry voice

A sword

Blackthumb keeps all the blades locked up I told you that a hundred times Is this for Lord Leech

For me Break the lock with your hammer

They’ll break my hand he grumbled Or worse

Not if you run off with me

Run and they’ll catch you and kill you

They’ll do you worse Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers he told me so

Gendry pushed black hair out of his eyes So

She looked right at him fearless So when Vargo Hoat’s the lord he’s going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away The smiths too

That’s only a story he said scornfully

No it’s true I heard Lord Vargo say so she lied He’s going to cut one foot off everyone The left one Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie he’ll do what you say We’ll need bread or oatcakes or something You get the swords and I’ll do the horses We’ll meet near the postern in the east wall behind the Tower of Ghosts No one ever comes there

I know that gate It’s guarded same as the rest

So You won’t forget the swords

I never said I’d come

No But if you do you won’t forget the swords

He frowned No he said at last I guess I won’t

Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls In her cell she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully in two layers of smallclothes warm stockings and her cleanest tunic It was Lord Bolton’s livery On the breast was sewn his sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort She tied her shoes threw a wool cloak over her skinny shoulders and knotted it under her throat Quiet as a shadow she moved back down the stairs Outside the lord’s solar she paused to listen at the door easing it open slowly when she heard only silence

The sheepskin map was on the table beside the remains of Lord Bolton’s supper She rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt He’d left his dagger on the table as well so she took that too just in case Gendry lost his courage

A horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables The grooms were all asleep She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said Eh Whas

Lord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled

The boy got to his feet pushing straw from his hair Wha at this hour Horses you say He blinked at the sigil on her tunic Whas he want horses for in the dark
