Thus the appealing segmentation of the overall problem shown in Figure 91
is not very accurate for the individual processes cannot be rigidly
separated as it implies  In fact we saw earlier how this intermixing of
levels occurs with prosodic and segmental features
Nevertheless it is helpful to structure discussion of the problem by
separating levels as a first approximation
Further influences on pronunciation come from the semantics and syntax
of the utterance em and both also play a part in intonation and rhythm analysis
The result of this second process is a phonetic representation still
adorned with prosodic markers
pp
Now we move down from higher-level intonation and rhythm considerations
to the details of the pitch contour and segment durations
This process was the subject of the previous chapter
The problems are twofold  to map an appropriate acoustic pitch contour
on to the utterance using tonic stress point and foot boundaries as
anchor points and to assign durations to segments using the
footemsyllableemclusteremsegment hierarchy
If it is accepted that the overall rhythm can be captured adequately by foot
markers this process does not interact with earlier ones
However many researchers do not believing instead that rhythm is
syntactically determined at a very detailed level
This will of course introduce strong interaction between the duration
assignment process and the levels above
Klatt 1975 puts it into his title em
Vowel lengthening is syntactically determined in a connected discourse

Klatt 1975 Vowel lengthening is syntactically determined

Contrast this with the paper cited earlier Bolinger 1972 entitled
Accent is predictable em if youre a mind reader

Bolinger 1972 Accent is predictable em if youre a mind reader

No-one would disagree that accent is an influential factor in vowel length
pp
Notice incidentally that the representation of the result of the pitch
and duration assignment process in Table 91 is inadequate for each segment
is shown as having just one pitch
In practice the pitch varies considerably throughout every segment
and can easily rise and fall on a single one  For example
LB
hes
ul
very
good
LE
may have a rise-fall on the vowel of very
The linked event-list data-structure of ISP is much more suitable
than a textual string for utterance representation at this level
pp
The fourth and fifth processes of Figure 91 have little interaction with
the first two which are the subject of this chapter  Segmental
concatenation which was treated in Chapter 7 is affected by prosodic
features like stress but a notation which indicates stressed syllables
like Hallidays is sufficient to capture this influence
Contextual modification of segments by which I mean
the coarticulation effects which govern allophones of phonemes
is included explicitly in the fourth process to emphasize that the upper levels
need only provide a broad phonemic transcription rather than a detailed
phonetic one
Signal synthesis can be performed by either a formant synthesizer or a
linear predictive one discussed in Chapters 5 and 6
This will affect the details of the segmental concatenation process but should have no
impact at all on the upper levels
pp
Figure 91 performs a useful function by summarizing where we have
been in earlier chapters em the lower three boxes em and introducing the
remaining problems that must be faced by a full text-to-speech system
It also serves to illustrate an important point  that a speech output system
can demand that its utterances be entered in any of a wide range of
representations
Thus one can enter at a low level with a digitized waveform or linear
predictive parameters or higher up with a phonetic representation
that includes detailed pitch and duration specification at the phoneme level
or with a phonetic text or plain text adorned with prosodic markers
or at the very top with plain text as it would appear in a book
A heavy price in naturalness and intelligibility is paid by moving up

If you really need to start with plain text
some very difficult problems present themselves
The text should be understood first of all and then decisions need to be
made about how it is to be interpreted
For an excellent speaker em like an actor em these decisions will be artistic
at least in part
They should certainly depend upon the opinion and attitude of the speaker
and his perception of the structure and progress of the dialogue
Very little is known about this upper level of speech synthesis from text
In practice it is almost completely ignored em and the speech is at most
barely intelligible and certainly uncomfortable to listen to
Hence anybody contemplating building or using a speech output system which
starts from something close to plain text should consider carefully whether some extra
semantic information can be coded into the initial utterances to help with
prosodic interpretation
Only rarely is this impossible em and reading machines for the blind are
