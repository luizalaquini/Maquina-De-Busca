Khaleesi Ser Jorah prompted when she had been silent for a long time He touched her elbow lightly

Dany shrugged him off  Viserys would have bought as many Unsullied as he had the coin for But you once said I was like Rhaegar…

I remember Daenerys

Your Grace she corrected Prince Rhaegar led free men into battle not slaves Whitebeard said he dubbed his squires himself and made many other knights as well

There was no higher honor than to receive your knighthood from the Prince of Dragonstone

Tell me then—when he touched a man on the shoulder with his sword what did he say ‘Go forth and kill the weak’ Or ‘Go forth and defend them’ At the Trident those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon banners—did they give their lives because they believed in Rhaegar’s cause or because they had been bought and paid for Dany turned to Mormont crossed her arms and waited for an answer

My queen the big man said slowly all you say is true But Rhaegar lost on the Trident He lost the battle he lost the war he lost the kingdom and he lost his life His blood swirled downriver with the rubies from his breastplate and Robert the Usurper rode over his corpse to steal the Iron Throne Rhaegar fought valiantly Rhaegar fought nobly Rhaegar fought honorably And Rhaegar died





Bran


No roads ran through the twisted mountain valleys where they walked now Between the grey stone peaks lay still blue lakes long and deep and narrow and the green gloom of endless piney woods The russet and gold of autumn leaves grew less common when they left the wolfswood to climb amongst the old flint hills and vanished by the time those hills had turned to mountains Giant grey-green sentinels loomed above them now and spruce and fir and soldier pines in endless profusion The undergrowth was sparse beneath them the forest floor carpeted in dark green needles

When they lost their way as happened once or twice they need only wait for a clear cold night when the clouds did not intrude and look up in the sky for the Ice Dragon The blue star in the dragon’s eye pointed the way north as Osha told him once Thinking of Osha made Bran wonder where she was He pictured her safe in White Harbor with Rickon and Shaggydog eating eels and fish and hot crab pie with fat Lord Manderly Or maybe they were warming themselves at the Last Hearth before the Greatjon’s fires But Bran’s life had turned into endless chilly days on Hodor’s back riding his basket up and down the slopes of mountains

Up and down Meera would sigh sometimes as they walked then down and up Then up and down again I hate these stupid mountains of yours Prince Bran

Yesterday you said you loved them

Oh I do My lord father told me about mountains but I never saw one till now I love them more than I can say

Bran made a face at her But you just said you hated them

Why can’t it be both Meera reached up to pinch his nose

Because they’re different he insisted Like night and day or ice and fire

If ice can burn said Jojen in his solemn voice then love and hate can mate Mountain or marsh it makes no matter The land is one

One his sister agreed but over wrinkled

The high glens seldom did them the courtesy of running north and south so often they found themselves going long leagues in the wrong direction and sometimes they were forced to double back the way they’d come If we took the kingsroad we could be at the Wall by now Bran would remind the Reeds He wanted to find the three-eyed crow so he could learn to fly Half a hundred times he said it if he said it once until Meera started teasing by saying it along with him

If we took the kingsroad we wouldn’t be so hungry either he started saying then Down in the hills they’d had no lack of food Meera was a fine huntress and even better at taking fish from streams with her three-pronged frog spear Bran liked to watch her admiring her quickness the way she sent the spear lancing down and pulled it back with a silvery trout wriggling on the end of it And they had Summer hunting for them as well The direwolf vanished most every night as the sun went down but he was always back again before dawn most often with something in his jaws a squirrel or a hare

But here in the mountains the streams were smaller and more icy and the game scarcer Meera still hunted and fished when she could but it was harder and some nights even Summer found no prey Often they went to sleep with empty bellies

But Jojen remained stubbornly determined to stay well away from roads Where you find roads you find travelers he said in that way he had and travelers have eyes to see and mouths to spread tales of the crippled boy his giant and the wolf that walks beside them No one could get as stubborn as Jojen so they struggled on through the wild and every day climbed a little higher and moved a little farther north

Some days it rained some days were windy and once they were caught in a sleet storm so fierce that even Hodor bellowed in dismay On the clear days it often seemed as if they were the only living things in all the world Does no one live up here Meera Reed asked once as they made their way around a granite upthrust as large as Winterfell

There’s people Bran told her The Umbers are mostly east of the kingsroad but they graze their sheep in the high meadows in summer There are Wulls west of the mountains along the Bay of Ice Harclays back behind us in the hills and Knotts and Liddles and Norreys and even some Flints up here in the high places His father’s mother’s mother had been a Flint of the mountains Old Nan once said that it was her blood in him that made Bran such a fool for climbing before his fall She had died years and years and years before he was born though even before his father had been born

Wull said Meera Jojen wasn’t there a Wull who rode with Father during the war

Theo Wull Joien was breathing hard from the climb Buckets they used to call him

That’s their sigil said Bran Three brown buckets on a blue field with a border of white and grey checks Lord Wull came to Winterfell once to do his fealty and talk with Father and he had the buckets on his shield He’s no true lord though Well he is but they call him just the Wull and there’s the Knott and the Norrey and the Liddle too At Winterfell we called them lords but their own folk don’t

Jojen Reed stopped to catch his breath Do you think these mountain folk know we’re here

They know Bran had seen them watching not with his own eyes but with Summer’s sharper ones that missed so little They won’t bother us so long as we don’t try and make off with their goats or horses

Nor did they Only once did they encounter any of the mountain people when a sudden burst of freezing rain sent them looking for shelter Summer found it for them sniffing out a shallow cave behind the greygreen branches of a towering sentinel tree but when Hodor ducked beneath the stony overhang Bran saw the orange glow of fire farther back and realized they were not alone Come in and warm yourselves a man’s voice called out There’s stone enough to keep the rain off all our heads

He offered them oatcakes and blood sausage and a swallow of ale from a skin he carried but never his name nor did he ask theirs Bran figured him for a Liddle The clasp that fastened his squirrelskin cloak was gold and bronze and wrought in the shape of a pinecone and the Liddles bore pinecones on the white half of their green-and-white shields

Is it far to the Wall Bran asked him as they waited for the rain to stop

Not so far as the raven flies said the Liddle if that was who he was Farther for them as lacks wings

Bran started I’d bet we’d be there if…

…we took the kingsroad Meera finished with him

The Liddle took out a knife and whittled at a stick When there was a Stark in Winterfell a maiden girl could walk the kingsroad in her name-day gown and still go unmolested and travelers could find fire bread and salt at many an inn and holdfast But the nights are colder now and doors are closed There’s squids in the wolfswood and flayed men ride the kingsroad asking after strangers

The Reeds exchanged a look Flayed men said Jojen

The Bastard’s boys aye He was dead but now he’s not And paying good silver for wolfskins a man hears and maybe gold for word of certain other walking dead He looked at Bran when he said that and at Summer stretched out beside him As to that Wall the man went on it’s not a place that I’d be going The Old Bear took the Watch into the haunted woods and all that come back was his ravens with hardly a message between them Dark wings dark words me mother used to say but when the birds fly silent seems to me that’s even darker He poked at the fire with his stick It was different when there was a Stark in Winterfell But the old wolf’s dead and young one’s gone south to play the game of thrones and all that’s left us is the ghosts

The wolves will come again said Jojen solemnly

And how would you be knowing boy

I dreamed it

Some nights I dream of me mother that I buried nine years past the man said but when I wake she’s not come back to us

There are dreams and dreams my lord

Hodor said Hodor

They spent that night together for the rain did not let up till well past dark and only Summer seemed to want to leave the cave When the fire had burned down to embers Bran let him go The direwolf did not feel the damp as people did and the night was calling him Moonlight painted the wet woods in shades of silver and turned the grey peaks white Owls hooted through the dark and flew silently between the pines while pale goats moved along the mountainsides Bran closed his eyes and gave himself up to the wolf dream to the smells and sounds of midnight

When they woke the next morning the fire had gone out and the Liddle was gone but he’d left a sausage for them and a dozen oatcakes folded up neatly in a green and white cloth Some of the cakes had pinenuts baked in them and some had blackberries Bran ate one of each and still did not know which sort he liked the best One day there would be Starks in Winterfell again he told himself and then he’d send for the Liddles and pay them back a hundredfold for every nut and berry

The trail they followed was a little easier that day and by noon the sun came breaking through the clouds Bran sat in his basket up on Hodor’s back and felt almost content He dozed off once lulled to sleep by the smooth swing of the big stableboy’s stride and the soft humming sound he made sometimes when he walked Meera woke him up with a light touch on his arm Look she said pointing at the sky with her frog spear an eagle

Bran lifted his head and saw it its grey wings spread and still as it floated on the wind He followed it with his eyes as it circled higher wondering what it would be like to soar about the world so effortless Better than climbing even He tried to reach the eagle to leave his stupid crippled body and rise into the sky to join it the way he joined with Summer The greenseers could do it I should be able to do it too He tried and tried until the eagle vanished in the golden haze of the afternoon It’s gone he said disappointed
