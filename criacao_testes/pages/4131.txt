kindled in this part of the house early in the day
and Bathshebas new piano which was an old one
in other annals looked particularly sloping and out
of level on the warped floor before night threw a
shade over its less prominent angles and hid the
unpleasantness Liddy like a little brook though
shallow was always rippling her presence had not so
much weight as to task thought and yet enough to
exercise it
On the table lay an old quarto Bible bound in
leather Liddy looking at it said --
Did you ever find out miss who you are going to
marry by means of the Bible and key 
Dont be so foolish Liddy As if such things
could be
 Well theres a good deal in it all the same
 Nonsense child
 And it makes your heart beat fearful Some believe
in it some dont I do
Very well lets try it said Bathsheba bounding
from her seat with that total disregard of consistency
which can be indulged in towards a dependent and
entering into the spirit of divination at once Go and
get the front door key
Liddy fetched it I wish it wasnt Sunday she
said on returning  Perhaps tis wrong
 Whats right week days is right Sundays replied her
mistress in a tone which was a proof in itself
P 145
The book was opened -- the leaves drab with age
being quite worn away at much-read verses by the fore
fingers of unpractised readers in former days where they
were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision
The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out
by Bathsheba and the sublime words met her eye They
slightly thrilled and abashed her It was Wisdom in
the abstract facing Folly in the concrete Folly in the
concrete blushed persisted in her intention and placed
the key on -the book A rusty patch immediately upon
the verse caused by previous pressure of an iron
substance thereon told that this was not the first time
the old volume had been used for the purpose
Now keep steady and be silent said Bathsheba
The verse was repeated the book turned round 
Bathsheba blushed guiltily
Who did you try  said Liddy curiously
I shall not tell you
Did you notice Mr Boldwoods doings in church
this morning miss  Liddy continued adumbrating by
the remark the track her thoughts had taken
No indeed said Bathsheba with serene indifference
 His pew is exactly opposite yours miss
I know it
And you did not see his goings on 
Certainly I did not I tell you
Liddy assumed a smaller physiognomy and shut
her lips decisively
This move was unexpected and proportionately dis
concerting  What did he do Bathsheba said perforce
Didnt turn his head to look at you once all the
service
Why should he again demanded her mistress
wearing a nettled look I didnt ask him to
Oh no But everybody else was noticing you  and
it was odd he didnt There tis like him Rich and
gentlemanly what does he care  
Bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to ex+
press that she had opinions on the matter too abstruse
for Liddys comprehension rather than that she had
nothing to say

P 146
Dear me -- I had nearly forgotten the valentine
I bought yesterday she exclaimed at length
Valentine  who for miss   said Liddy  Farmer
Boldwood 
It was the single name among all possible wrong
ones that just at this moment seemed to Bathsheba
more pertinent than the right
Well no It is only for little Teddy Coggan
have promised him something and this will be a pretty
surprise for him Liddy you may as well bring me
my desk and Ill direct it at once
Bathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illumin+
ated and embossed design in post-octavo which had
been bought on the previous market-day at the chief
stationers in Casterbridge In the eentre was a small
oval enclosure  this was left blank that the sender
might insert tender words more appropriate to the
special occasion than any generalities by a printer
could possibly be
 Heres a place for writing said Bathsheba What
shall I put 
 Something of this sort I should think returned
Liddy promptly  --
 The rose is red
 The violet blue
 Camations sweet
 And so are you
 Yes that shall be it It just suits itself to a chubby+
