2211 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven and
said Abraham Abraham and he said Here am I

2212 And he said Lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou
any thing unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou
hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me

2213 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took
the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his
son

2214 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh as it is
said to this day In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen

2215 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the
second time 2216 And said By myself have I sworn saith the LORD
for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son
thine only son 2217 That in blessing I will bless thee and in
multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess
the gate of his enemies 2218 And in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice

2219 So Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and
went together to Beersheba and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba

2220 And it came to pass after these things that it was told
Abraham saying Behold Milcah she hath also born children unto thy
brother Nahor 2221 Huz his firstborn and Buz his brother and
Kemuel the father of Aram 2222 And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash
and Jidlaph and Bethuel

2223 And Bethuel begat Rebekah these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor
Abrahams brother

2224 And his concubine whose name was Reumah she bare also Tebah
and Gaham and Thahash and Maachah

231 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these
were the years of the life of Sarah

232 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her

233 And Abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the
sons of Heth saying 234 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you
give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that I may bury my
dead out of my sight

235 And the children of Heth answered Abraham saying unto him 236
Hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of
our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his
sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead

237 And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the
land even to the children of Heth

238 And he communed with them saying If it be your mind that I
should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to
Ephron the son of Zohar 239 That he may give me the cave of
Machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as
much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a
buryingplace amongst you

2310 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth and Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth even
of all that went in at the gate of his city saying 2311 Nay my
lord hear me the field give I thee and the cave that is therein I
give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee
bury thy dead

2312 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land

2313 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
land saying But if thou wilt give it I pray thee hear me I will
give thee money for the field take it of me and I will bury my dead
there

2314 And Ephron answered Abraham saying unto him 2315 My lord
hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver
what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead

2316 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron and Abraham weighed to Ephron
the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth
four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant

2317 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah which was before
Mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees
that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were
made sure 2318 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the
children of Heth before all that went in at the gate of his city

2319 And after this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
field of Machpelah before Mamre the same is Hebron in the land of
Canaan

2320 And the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto
Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth
