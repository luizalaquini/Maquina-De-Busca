house of Israel which are borne by me from the belly which are
carried from the womb 464 And even to your old age I am he and even
to hoar hairs will I carry you I have made and I will bear even I
will carry and will deliver you

465 To whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that
we may be like  466 They lavish gold out of the bag and weigh
silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god
they fall down yea they worship

467 They bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in
his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea
one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his
trouble

468 Remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind O
ye transgressors

469 Remember the former things of old for I am God and there is
none else I am God and there is none like me 4610 Declaring the
end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not
yet done saying My counsel shall stand and I will do all my
pleasure 4611 Calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that
executeth my counsel from a far country yea I have spoken it I will
also bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do it

4612 Hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from
righteousness 4613 I bring near my righteousness it shall not be
far off and my salvation shall not tarry and I will place salvation
in Zion for Israel my glory

471 Come down and sit in the dust O virgin daughter of Babylon sit
on the ground there is no throne O daughter of the Chaldeans for
thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate

472 Take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare
the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers

473 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen I
will take vengeance and I will not meet thee as a man

474 As for our redeemer the LORD of hosts is his name the Holy One
of Israel

475 Sit thou silent and get thee into darkness O daughter of the
Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms

476 I was wroth with my people I have polluted mine inheritance and
given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the
ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke

477 And thou saidst I shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst
not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter
end of it

478 Therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that
dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart I am and none else
beside me I shall not sit as a widow neither shall I know the loss
of children 479 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment
in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon
thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for
the great abundance of thine enchantments

4710 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said None
seeth me Thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and
thou hast said in thine heart I am and none else beside me

4711 Therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from
whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be
able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly
which thou shalt not know

4712 Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy
sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou
shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail

4713 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels Let now the
astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up
and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee

4714 Behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they
shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall
not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it

4715 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even
thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his
quarter none shall save thee

481 Hear ye this O house of Jacob which are called by the name of
Israel and are come forth out of the waters of Judah which swear by
the name of the LORD and make mention of the God of Israel but not
in truth nor in righteousness

482 For they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves
upon the God of Israel The LORD of hosts is his name

483 I have declared the former things from the beginning and they
went forth out of my mouth and I shewed them I did them suddenly
and they came to pass
