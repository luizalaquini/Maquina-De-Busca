But it was only a game and Bran knew it

Their footsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts The shadows behind them swallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues no mere lords these but the old Kings in the North On their brows they wore stone crowns Torrhen Stark the King Who Knelt Edwyn the Spring King Theon Stark the Hungry Wolf Brandon the Burner and Brandon the Shipwright Jorah and Jonos Brandon the Bad Walton the Moon King Edderion the Bridegroom Eyron Benjen the Sweet and Benjen the Bitter King Edrick Snowbeard Their faces were stern and strong and some of them had done terrible things but they were Starks every one and Bran knew all their tales He had never feared the crypts they were part of his home and who he was and he had always known that one day he would lie here too

But now he was not so certain If I go up will I ever come back down Where will I go when I die

Wait Osha said when they reached the twisting stone stairs that led up to the surface and down to the deeper levels where kings more ancient still sat their dark thrones She handed Meera the torch I’ll grope my way up For a time they could hear the sound of her footfalls but they grew softer and softer until they faded away entirely Hodor said Hodor nervously

Bran had told himself a hundred times how much he hated hiding down here in the dark how much he wanted to see the sun again to ride his horse through wind and rain But now that the moment was upon him he was afraid He’d felt safe in the darkness when you could not even find your own hand in front of your face it was easy to believe that no enemies could ever find you either And the stone lords had given him courage Even when he could not see them he had known they were there

It seemed a long while before they heard anything again Bran had begun to fear that something had happened to Osha His brother was squirming restlessly I want to go home he said loudly Hodor bobbed his head and said Hodor Then they heard the footsteps again growing louder and after a few minutes Osha emerged into the light looking grim Something is blocking the door I can’t move it

Hodor can move anything said Bran

Osha gave the huge stableboy an appraising look Might be he can Come on then

The steps were narrow so they had to climb in single file Osha led Behind came Hodor with Bran crouched low on his back so his head wouldn’t hit the ceiling Meera followed with the torch and Jojen brought up the rear leading Rickon by the hand Around and around they went and up and up Bran thought he could smell smoke now but perhaps that was only the torch

The door to the crypts was made of ironwood It was old and heavy and lay at a slant to the ground Only one person could approach it at a time Osha tried once more when she reached it but Bran could see that it was not budging Let Hodor try

They had to pull Bran from his basket first so he would not get squished Meera squatted beside him on the steps one arm thrown protectively across his shoulders as Osha and Hodor traded places Open the door Hodor Bran said

The huge stableboy put both hands flat on the door pushed and grunted Hodor He slammed a fist against the wood and it did not so much as jump Hodor

Use your back urged Bran And your legs

Turning Hodor put his back to the wood and shoved Again Again Hodor He put one foot on a higher step so he was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise This time the wood groaned and creaked Hodor The other foot came up a step and Hodor spread his legs apart braced and straightened His face turned red and Bran could see cords in his neck bulging as he strained against the weight above him Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor HODOR From above came a dull rumble Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran’s face blinding him for a moment Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone and then the way was open Osha poked her spear through and slid out after it and Rickon squirmed through Meera’s legs to follow Hodor shoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface The Reeds had to carry Bran up the last few steps

The sky was a pale grey and smoke eddied all around them They stood in the shadow of the First Keep or what remained of it One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn across the yard They fell just where I did Bran thought when he saw them Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he was alive at all Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the tumbled stone but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was

The First Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years but now it was more of a shell than ever The floors had burned inside it and all the beams Where the wall had fallen away they could see right into the rooms even into the privy Yet behind the broken tower still stood no more burned than before Jojen Reed was coughing from the smoke Take me home Rickon demanded I want to be home Hodor stomped in a circle Hodor he whimpered in a small voice They stood huddled together with ruin and death all around them

We made noise enough to wake a dragon Osha said but there’s no one come The castle’s dead and burned just as Bran dreamed but we had best— She broke off suddenly at a noise behind them and whirled with her spear at the ready

Two lean dark shapes emerged from behind the broken tower padding slowly through the rubble Rickon gave a happy shout of Shaggy and the black direwolf came bounding toward him Summer advanced more slowly rubbed his head up against Bran’s arm and licked his face

We should go said Jojen So much death will bring other wolves besides Summer and Shaggydog and not all on four feet

Aye soon enough Osha agreed but we need food and there may be some survived this Stay together Meera keep your shield up and guard our backs

It took the rest of the morning to make a slow circuit of the castle The great granite walls remained blackened here and there by fire but otherwise untouched But within all was death and destruction The doors of the Great Hall were charred and smoldering and inside the rafters had given way and the whole roof had crashed down onto the floor The green and yellow panes of the glass gardens were all in shards the trees and fruits and flowers torn up or left exposed to die Of the stables made of wood and thatch nothing remained but ashes embers and dead horses Bran thought of his Dancer and wanted to weep There was a shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower and hot water gushing from a crack in its side The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery had collapsed into the yard below and Maester Luwin’s turret was gone They saw a dull red glow shining up through the narrow cellar windows beneath the Great Keep and a second fire still burning in one of the storehouses

Osha called softly through the blowing smoke as they went but no one answered They saw one dog worrying at a corpse but he ran when he caught the scents of the direwolves the rest had been slain in the kennels The maester’s ravens were paying court to some of the corpses while the crows from the broken tower attended others Bran recognized Poxy Tym even though someone had taken an axe to his face One charred corpse outside the ashen shell of Mother’s sept sat with his arms drawn up and his hands balled into hard black fists as if to punch anyone who dared approach him If the gods are good Osha said in a low angry voice the Others will take them that did this work

It was Theon Bran said blackly

No Look She pointed across the yard with her spear That’s one of his ironmen And there And that’s Greyjoy’s warhorse see The black one with the arrows in him She moved among the dead frowning And here’s Black Lorren He had been hacked and cut so badly that his beard looked a reddish-brown now Took a few with him he did Osha turned over one of the other corpses with her foot There’s a badge A little man all red

The flayed man of the Dreadfort said Bran

Summer howled and darted away

The godswood Meera Reed ran after the direwolf her shield and frog spear to hand The rest of them trailed after threading their way through smoke and fallen stones The air was sweeter under the trees A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched but deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames There is a power in living wood said Jojen Reed almost as if he knew what Bran was thinking a power strong as fire

On the edge of the black pool beneath the shelter of the heart tree Maester Luwin lay on his belly in the dirt A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where he had crawled Summer stood over him and Bran thought he was dead at first but when Meera touched his throat the maester moaned Hodor Hodor said mournfully Hodor

Gently they eased Luwin onto his back He had grey eyes and grey hair and once his robes had been grey as well but they were darker now where the blood had soaked through Bran he said softly when he saw him sitting tall on Hodor’s back And Rickon too He smiled The gods are good I knew…

Knew said Bran uncertainly

The legs I could tell… the clothes fit but the muscles in his legs… poor lad… He coughed and blood came up from inside him You vanished… in the woods… how though

We never went said Bran Well only to the edge and then doubled back I sent the wolves on to make a trail but we hid in Father’s tomb

The crypts Luwin chuckled a froth of blood on his lips When the maester tried to move he gave a sharp gasp of pain

Tears filled Bran’s eyes When a man was hurt you took him to the maester but what could you do when your maester was hurt

We’ll need to make a litter to carry him said Osha

No use said Luwin I’m dying woman

You can’t said Rickon angrily No you can’t Beside him Shaggydog bared his teeth and growled

The maester smiled Hush now child I’m much older than you I can… die as I please

Hodor down said Bran Hodor went to his knees beside the maester

Listen Luwin said to Osha the princes… Robb’s heirs Not… not together… do you hear

The wildling woman leaned on her spear Aye Safer apart But where to take them I’d thought might be these Cerwyns…

Maester Luwin shook his head though it was plain to see what the effort cost him Cerwyn boy’s dead Ser Rodrik Leobald Tallhart Lady Hornwood… all slain Deepwood fallen Moat Cailin soon Torrhen’s Square Ironmen on the Stony Shore And east the Bastard of Bolton

Then where asked Osha

White Harbor… the Umbers… I do not know… war everywhere… each man against his neighbor and winter coming… such folly such black mad folly… Maester Luwin reached up and grasped Bran’s forearm his fingers closing with a desperate strength You must be strong now Strong

I will be Bran said though it was hard Ser Rodrik killed and Maester Luwin everyone everyone…

Good the maester said A good boy Your… your father’s son Bran Now go

Osha gazed up at the weirwood at the red face carved in the pale trunk And leave you for the gods

I beg… The maester swallowed A… a drink of water and… another boon If you would…

Aye She turned to Meera Take the boys

Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between them Hodor followed Low branches whipped at Bran’s face as they pushed between the trees and the leaves brushed away his tears Osha joined them in the yard a few moments later She said no word of Maester Luwin Hodor must stay with Bran to be his legs the wildling woman said briskly I will take Rickon with me
