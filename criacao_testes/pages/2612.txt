29 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnathheres in the mount of Ephraim on the north side of the hill
Gaash

210 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers
and there arose another generation after them which knew not the
LORD nor yet the works which he had done for Israel

211 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and
served Baalim 212 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers
which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods
of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed
themselves unto them and provoked the LORD to anger

213 And they forsook the LORD and served Baal and Ashtaroth

214 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he
delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he
sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they
could not any longer stand before their enemies

215 Whithersoever they went out the hand of the LORD was against
them for evil as the LORD had said and as the LORD had sworn unto
them and they were greatly distressed

216 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges which delivered them out
of the hand of those that spoiled them

217 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a
whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned
quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the
commandments of the LORD but they did not so

218 And when the LORD raised them up judges then the LORD was with
the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the
days of the judge for it repented the LORD because of their groanings
by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them

219 And it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned
and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other
gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from
their own doings nor from their stubborn way

220 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he said
Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice 221 I
also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations
which Joshua left when he died 222 That through them I may prove
Israel whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein as
their fathers did keep it or not

223 Therefore the LORD left those nations without driving them out
hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua

31 Now these are the nations which the LORD left to prove Israel by
them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan
32 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to
teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof 33
Namely five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the
Sidonians and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon from mount
Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath

34 And they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD which he commanded their
fathers by the hand of Moses

35 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites Hittites
and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites 36 And they
took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to
their sons and served their gods

37 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD and
forgat the LORD their God and served Baalim and the groves

38 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel and he
sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia and
the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years

39 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD the LORD
raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them
even Othniel the son of Kenaz Calebs younger brother

310 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him and he judged Israel
and went out to war and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of
Mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against
Chushanrishathaim

311 And the land had rest forty years And Othniel the son of Kenaz
died

312 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
LORD and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel
because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD

313 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek and
went and smote Israel and possessed the city of palm trees

314 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
years
