Ser Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other almost falling They came up through the ashes while the river was burning The river Stannis was neck deep in the river and they took him from the rear Oh to be a knight again to have been part of it His own men hardly fought they say Some ran but more bent the knee and went over shouting for Lord Renly What must Stannis have thought when he heard that I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same and the gold cloaks as well We’re delivered sweetling They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank through all the fields Stannis had burned the ashes puffing up around their boots and turning all their armor grey but oh the banners must have been bright the golden rose and golden lion and all the others the Marbrand tree and the Rowan Tarly’s huntsman and Redwyne’s grapes and Lady Oakheart’s leaf All the westermen all the power of Highgarden and Casterly Rock Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side of the river with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left but the vanguard won the fight They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin every man of them howling like some demon in steel And do you know who led the vanguard Do you Do you Do you

Robb It was too much to be hoped but   

It was Lord Renly Lord Renly in his green armor with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand They say he killed Ser Guyard Morrigen himself in single combat and a dozen other great knights as well It was Renly it was Renly it was Renly Oh the banners darling Sansa Oh to be a knight





DAENERYS

She was breaking her fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought her a Qartheen gown an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls Take it away Dany said The docks are no place for lady’s finery

If the Milk Men thought her such a savage she would dress the part for them When she went to the stables she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki fashion and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid I have won no victories she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly

Jhiqui disagreed You burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell

That was Drogon’s victory not mine Dany wanted to say but she held her tongue The Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair She chimed as she mounted her silver mare and again with every stride but neither Ser Jorah nor her bloodriders made mention of it To guard her people and her dragons in her absence she chose Rakharo Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront

They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street There were fewer horses and camels to be seen and a dearth of palanquins but the streets teemed with children beggars and skinny dogs the color of sand Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch them pass They know who I am and they do not love me Dany could tell from the way they looked at her

Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin safely hidden behind silken curtains but she refused him She had reclined too long on satin cushions letting oxen bear her hither and yon At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere

It was not by choice that she sought the waterfront She was fleeing again Her whole life had been one long flight it seemed She had begun running in her mother’s womb and never once stopped How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night a bare step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives But it was run or die Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her

Dany had laughed when he told her Was it not you who told me warlocks were no more than old soldiers vainly boasting of forgotten deeds and lost prowess

Xaro looked troubled And so it was then But now I am less certain It is said that the glass candles are burning in the house of Urrathon Night-Walker that have not burned in a hundred years Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock’s Way and all the rats in the city are chewing off their tails The wife of Mathos Mallarawan who once mocked a warlock’s drab moth-eaten robe has gone mad and will wear no clothes at all Even fresh-washed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again or so his slaves do swear A man must wonder He sighed These are strange times in Qarth And strange times are bad for trade It grieves me to say so yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely and sooner rather than later Xaro stroked her fingers reassuringly You need not go alone though You have seen dark visions in the Palace of Dust but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams I see you happily abed with our child at your breast Sail with me around the Jade Sea and we can yet make it so It is not too late Give me a son my sweet song of joy

Give you a dragon you mean I will not wed you Xaro

His face had grown cold at that Then go

But where

Somewhere far from here

Well perhaps it was time The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste but now that they were plump and rested once again they began to grow unruly Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place They were a warrior people not made for cities Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long seduced by its comforts and its beauties It was a city that always promised more than it would give you it seemed to her and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame Overnight the Qartheen had come to remember that dragons were dangerous No longer did they vie with each other to give her gifts Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from joining them

But where am I to go Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east away from her enemies in the Seven Kingdoms Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea even if it meant braving the red waste again Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong But her heart was full of doubts Each of these felt wrong somehow    and even when she decided where to go the question of how she would get there remained troublesome

Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her she knew that now For all his professions of devotion he was playing his own game not unlike Pyat Pree The night he asked her to leave Dany had begged one last favor of him An army is it Xaro asked A kettle of gold A galley perhaps

Dany blushed She hated begging A ship yes

Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose I am a trader Khaleesi So perhaps we should speak no more of giving but rather of trade For one of your dragons you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet You need only say that one sweet word

No she said

Alas Xaro sobbed that was not the word I meant

Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children

Whyever not They can always make more Mothers sell their children every day

Not the Mother of Dragons

Not even for twenty ships

Not for a hundred

His mouth curled downward I do not have a hundred But you have three dragons Grant me one for all my kindnesses You will still have two and thirty ships as well

Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros But I do not have a small army How many ships do you own Xaro

Eighty-three if one does not count my pleasure barge

And your colleagues in the Thirteen

Among us all perhaps a thousand

And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Their trifling fleets are of no account

Even so she said tell me

Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood

And the Asshai’i the Braavosi the Summer Islanders the Ibbenese and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea how many ships do they have All together

Many and more he said irritably What does this matter

I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world Dany smiled at him sweetly It seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair

Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose Did I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust This is the very thing I feared The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife A third of all the ships in the world Pah Pah I say Pah

Dany had not seen him since His seneschal brought her messages each cooler than the last She must quit his house He was done feeding her and her people He demanded the return of his gifts which she had accepted in bad faith Her only consolation was that at least she’d had the great good sense not to marry him

The warlocks whispered of three treasons    once for blood and once for gold and once for love The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third She did not think so What Pyat did was not for gold and Xaro had never truly loved her

The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side Her bell rang softly and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth Child of three they had called her daughter of death slayer of lies bride of fire So many threes Three fires three mounts to ride three treasons The dragon has three heads she sighed Do you know what that means Jorah

Your Grace The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon red on black

I know that But there are no three-headed dragons

The three heads were Aegon and his sisters
