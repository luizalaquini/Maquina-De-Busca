2817 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it
shall not be for jewels of fine gold

2818 No mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price
of wisdom is above rubies

2819 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be
valued with pure gold

2820 Whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of
understanding  2821 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living
and kept close from the fowls of the air

2822 Destruction and death say We have heard the fame thereof with
our ears

2823 God understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place
thereof

2824 For he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the
whole heaven 2825 To make the weight for the winds and he weigheth
the waters by measure

2826 When he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning
of the thunder 2827 Then did he see it and declare it he prepared
it yea and searched it out

2828 And unto man he said Behold the fear of the LORD that is
wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding

291 Moreover Job continued his parable and said 292 Oh that I were
as in months past as in the days when God preserved me 293 When his
candle shined upon my head and when by his light I walked through
darkness 294 As I was in the days of my youth when the secret of
God was upon my tabernacle 295 When the Almighty was yet with me
when my children were about me 296 When I washed my steps with
butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil 297 When I went out
to the gate through the city when I prepared my seat in the street
298 The young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and
stood up

299 The princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their
mouth

2910 The nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the
roof of their mouth

2911 When the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw
me it gave witness to me 2912 Because I delivered the poor that
cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him

2913 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and I
caused the widows heart to sing for joy

2914 I put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a
robe and a diadem

2915 I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame

2916 I was a father to the poor and the cause which I knew not I
searched out

2917 And I brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth

2918 Then I said I shall die in my nest and I shall multiply my
days as the sand

2919 My root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night
upon my branch

2920 My glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand

2921 Unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my
counsel

2922 After my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon
them

2923 And they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their
mouth wide as for the latter rain

2924 If I laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my
countenance they cast not down

2925 I chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the
army as one that comforteth the mourners

301 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision whose
fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock

302 Yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom
old age was perished  303 For want and famine they were solitary
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste

304 Who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their
meat

305 They were driven forth from among men they cried after them as
