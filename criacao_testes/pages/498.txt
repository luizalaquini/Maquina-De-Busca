The sky was greying over the castle walls Dawn could not be far off Joseth saddle Smiler and a horse for yourself Murch Gariss Poxy Tym you’ll come as well Murch and Gariss were the best huntsmen in the castle and Tym was a fine bowman Aggar Rednose Gelmarr Reek Wex He needed his own to watch his back Farlen I’ll want hounds and you to handle them

The grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms And why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn lords and babes at that

Theon moved close I am your trueborn lord now and the man who keeps Palla safe

He saw the defiance die in Farlen’s eyes Aye m’lord

Stepping back Theon glanced about to see who else he might add Maester Luwin he announced

I know nothing of hunting

No but I don’t trust you in the castle in my absence Then it’s past time you learned

Let me come too I want that wolfskin cloak A boy stepped forward no older than Bran It took Theon a moment to remember him I’ve hunted lots of times before Walder Frey said Red deer and elk and even boar

His cousin laughed at him He rode on a boar hunt with his father but they never let him near the boar

Theon look at the boy doubtfully Come if you like but if you can’t keep up don’t think that I’ll nurse you along He turned back to Black Lorren Winterfell is yours in my absence If we do not return do with it as you will That bloody well ought to have them praying for my success

They assembled by the Hunter’s Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower their breath frosting in the cold morning air Gelmarr had equipped himself with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him The blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow Aggar wore steel greaves Reek arrived carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack bulging with god knows what Theon had his bow he needed nothing else Once he had saved Bran’s life with an arrow He hoped he would not need to take it with another but if it came to that he would

Eleven men two boys and a dozen dogs crossed the moat Beyond the outer wall the tracks were plain to read in the soft ground the pawprints of the wolves Hodor’s heavy tread the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds Once under the trees the stony ground and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see but by then Farlen’s red bitch had the scent The rest of the dogs were close behind the hounds sniffing and barking a pair of monstrous mastiffs bringing up the rear Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a cornered direwolf

He’d have guessed that Osha might run south to Ser Rodrik but the trail led north by northwest into the very heart of the wolfswood Theon did not like that one bit It would be a bitter irony if the Starks made for Deepwood Motte and delivered themselves right into Asha’s hands I’d sooner have them dead he thought bitterly It is better to be seen as cruel than foolish

Wisps of pale mist threaded between the trees Sentinels and soldier pines grew thick about here and there was nothing as dark and gloomy as an evergreen forest The ground was uneven and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing treacherous for the horses so they had to go slowly Not as slowly as a man carrying a cripple though or a bony harridan with a four-year-old on her back He told himself to be patient He’d have them before the day was out

Maester Luwin trotted up to him as they were following a game trail along the lip of a ravine Thus far hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods my lord

Theon smiled There are similarities But with hunting there’s blood at the end

Must it be so This flight was great folly but will you not be merciful These are your foster brothers we seek

No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living than dead

The same is true of the Reeds Moat Cailin sits on the edge of the bogs Lord Howland can make your uncle’s occupation a visit to hell if he chooses but so long as you hold his heirs he must stay his hand

Theon had not considered that In truth he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if she was still a maiden You may be right We will spare them if we can

And Hodor too I hope The boy is simple you know that He does as he is told How many times has he groomed your horse soaped your saddle scoured your mail

Hodor was nothing to him if he does not fight us we will let him live Theon pointed a finger But say one word about sparing the wildling and you can die with her She swore me an oath and pissed on it

The maester inclined his head I make no apologies for oathbreakers Do what you must I thank you for your mercy

Mercy thought Theon as Luwin dropped back There’s a bloody trap Too much and they call you weak too little and you’re monstrous Yet the maester had given him good counsel he knew His father thought only in terms of conquest but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it Force and fear could carry you only so far A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south elsewise Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them Sansa was a pretty little thing too and by now likely even ripe for bedding But she was a thousand leagues away in the clutches of the Lannisters A shame

The wood grew ever wilder The pines and sentinels gave way to huge dark oaks Tangles of hawthorn concealed treacherous gullies and cuts Stony hills rose and fell They passed a crofter’s cottage deserted and overgown and skirted a flooded quarry where the still water had a sheen as grey as steel When the dogs began to bay Theon figured the fugitives were near at hand He spurred Smiler and followed at a trot but what he found was only the carcass of a young elk… or what remained of it

He dismounted for a closer look The kill was still fresh and plainly the work of wolves The dogs sniffed round it eagerly and one of the mastiffs buried his teeth in a haunch until Farlen shouted him off No part of this animal has been butchered Theon realized The wolves ate but not the men Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire she ought to have cut them a few steaks It made no sense to leave so much good meat to rot Farlen are you certain we’re on the right trail he demanded Could your dogs be chasing the wrong wolves

My bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough
