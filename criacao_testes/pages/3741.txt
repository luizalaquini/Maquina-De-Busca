His long years as a smuggler had made the waters around King’s Landing more familiar to him than any home he’d ever had and he knew his refuge was no more than a speck on the charts in a place that honest sailors steered away from not toward… though Davos himself had come by it once or twice in his smuggling days the better to stay unseen When they find me dead here if ever they do perhaps they will name the rock for me he thought Onion Rock they’ll call it it will be my tombstone and my legacy He deserved no more The Father protects his children the septons taught but Davos had led his boys into the fire Dale would never give his wife the child they had prayed for and Allard with his girl in Oldtown and his girl in King’s Landing and his girl in Braavos they would all be weeping soon Matthos would never captain his own ship as he’d dreamed Maric would never have his knighthood

How can I live when they are dead So many brave knights and mighty lords have died better men than me and highborn Crawl inside your cave Davos Crawl inside and shrink up small and the ship will go away and no one will trouble you ever again Sleep on your stone pillow and let the gulls peck out your eyes while the crabs feast on your flesh You’ve feasted on enough of them you owe them Hide smuggler Hide and be quiet and die

The sail was almost on him A few moments more and the ship would be safely past and he could die in peace

His hand reached for his throat fumbling for the small leather pouch he always wore about his neck Inside he kept the bones of the four fingers his king had shortened for him on the day he made Davos a knight My luck His shortened fingers patted at his chest groping finding nothing The pouch was gone and the fingerbones with them Stannis could never understand why he’d kept the bones To remind me of my king’s justice he whispered through cracked lips But now they were gone The fire took my luck as well as my sons In his dreams the river was still aflame and demons danced upon the waters with fiery whips in their hands while men blackened and burned beneath the lash Mother have mercy Davos prayed Save me gentle Mother save us all My luck is gone and my sons He was weeping freely now salt tears streaming down his cheeks The fire took it all… the fire…

Perhaps it was only wind blowing against the rock or the sound of the sea on the shore but for an instant Davos Seaworth heard her answer You called the fire she whispered her voice as faint as the sound of waves in a seashell sad and soft You burned us… burned us… burrrned usssssss

It was her Davos cried Mother don’t forsake us It was her who burned you the red woman Melisandre her He could see her the heart-shaped face the red eyes the long coppery hair her red gowns moving like flames as she walked a swirl of silk and satin She had come from Asshai in the east she had come to Dragonstone and won Selyse and her queen’s men for her alien god and then the king Stannis Baratheon himself He had gone so far as to put the fiery heart on his banners the fiery heart of R’hllor Lord of Light and God of Flame and Shadow At Melisandre’s urging he had dragged the Seven from their sept at Dragonstone and burned them before the castle gates and later he had burned the godswood at Storm’s End as well even the heart tree a huge white weirwood with a solemn face

It was her work Davos said again more weakly Her work and yours onion knight You rowed her into Storm’s End in the black of night so she might loose her shadow child You are not guiltless no You rode beneath her banner and flew it from your mast You watched the Seven burn at Dragonstone and did nothing She gave the Father’s justice to the fire and the Mother’s mercy and the wisdom of the Crone Smith and Stranger Maid and Warrior she burnt them all to the glory of her cruel god and you stood and held your tongue Even when she killed old Maester Cressen even then you did nothing

The sail was a hundred yards away and moving fast across the bay In a few more moments it would be past him and dwindling

Ser Davos Seaworth began to climb his rock

He pulled himself up with trembling hands his head swimming with fever Twice his maimed fingers slipped on the damp stone and he almost fell but somehow he managed to cling to his perch If he fell he was dead and he had to live For a little while more at least There was something he had to do

The top of the rock was too small to stand on safely as weak as he was so he crouched and waved his fleshless arms Ship he screamed into the wind Ship here here From up here he could see her more clearly the lean striped hull the bronze figurehead the billowing sail There was a name painted on her hull but Davos had never learned to read Ship he called again help me HELP ME

A crewman on her forecastle saw him and pointed He watched as other sailors moved to the gunwale to gape at him A short while later the galley’s sail came down her oars slid out and she swept around toward his refuge She was too big to approach the rock closely but thirty yards away she launched a small boat Davos clung to his rock and watched it creep toward him Four men were rowing while a fifth sat in the prow You the fifth man called out when they were only a few feet from his island you up on the rock Who are you

A smuggler who rose above himself thought Davos a fool who loved his king too much and forgot his gods His throat was parched and he had forgotten how to talk The words felt strange on his tongue and sounded stranger in his ears I was in the battle I was… a captain a… a knight I was a knight

Aye ser the man said and serving which king

The galley might be Joffrey’s he realized suddenly If he spoke the wrong name now she would abandon him to his fate But no her hull was striped She was Lysene she was Salladhor Saan’s The Mother sent her here the Mother in her mercy She had a task for him Stannis lives he knew then I have a king still And sons I have other sons and a wife loyal and loving How could he have forgotten The Mother was merciful indeed

Stannis he shouted back at the Lyseni Gods be good I serve King Stannis

Aye said the man in the boat and so do we





Sansa


The invitation seemed innocent enough but every time Sansa read it her tummy tightened into a knot She’s to be queen now she’s beautiful and rich and everyone loves her why would she want to sup with a traitor’s daughter It could be curiosity she supposed perhaps Margaery Tyrell wanted to get the measure of the rival she’d displaced Does she resent me I wonder Does she think I bear her ill will…

Sansa had watched from the castle walls as Margaery Tyrell and her escort made their way up Aegon’s High Hill Joffrey had met his new bride-to-be at the King’s Gate to welcome her to the city and they rode side by side through cheering crowds Joff glittering in gilded armor and the Tyrell girl splendid in green with a cloak of autumn flowers blowing from her shoulders She was sixteen brown-haired and brown-eyed slender and beautiful The people called out her name as she passed held up their children for her blessing and scattered flowers under the hooves of her horse Her mother and grandmother followed close behind riding in a tall wheelhouse whose sides were carved into the shape of a hundred twining roses every one gilded and shining The smallfolk cheered them as well

The same smallfolk who pulled me from my horse and would have killed me if not for the Hound Sansa had done nothing to make the commons hate her no more than Margaery Tyrell had done to win their love Does she want me to love her too She studied the invitation which looked to be written in Margaery’s own hand Does she want my blessing Sansa wondered if Joffrey knew of this supper For all she knew it might be his doing That thought made her fearful If Joff was behind the invitation he would have some cruel jape planned to shame her in the older girl’s eyes Would he command his Kingsguard to strip her naked once again The last time he had done that his uncle Tyrion had stopped him but the Imp could not save her now

No one can save me but my Florian Ser Dontos had promised he would help her escape but not until the night of Joffrey’s wedding The plans had been well laid her dear devoted knight-turned-fool assured her there was nothing to do until then but endure and count the days

And sup with my replacement…

Perhaps she was doing Margaery Tyrell an injustice Perhaps the invitation was no more than a simple kindness an act of courtesy It might be just a supper But this was the Red Keep this was King’s Landing this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon the First of His Name and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark had learned here it was mistrust

Even so she must accept She was nothing now the discarded daughter of a traitor and disgraced sister of a rebel lord She could scarcely refuse Joffrey’s queen-to-be

I wish the Hound were here The night of the battle Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city but Sansa had refused Sometimes she lay awake at night wondering if she’d been wise She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks She could not say why she’d kept it The Hound had turned craven she heard it said at the height of the battle he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men But Sansa understood She knew the secret of his burned face It was only the fire he feared That night the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze and filled the very air with green flame Even in the castle Sansa had been afraid Outside… she could scarcely imagine it

Sighing she got out quill and ink and wrote Margaery Tyrell a gracious note of acceptance

When the appointed night arrived another of the Kingsguard came for her a man as different from Sandor Clegane as… well as a flower from a dog The sight of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on her threshold made Sansa’s heart beat a little faster This was the first time she had been so close to him since he had returned to King’s Landing leading the vanguard of his father’s host For a moment she did not know what to say Ser Loras she finally managed you… you look so lovely

He gave her a puzzled smile My lady is too kind And beautiful besides My sister awaits you eagerly

I have so looked forward to our supper

As has Margaery and my lady grandmother as well He took her arm and led her toward the steps

Your grandmother Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time with Ser Loras touching her arm She could feel the warmth of his hand through the silk

Lady Olenna She is to sup with you as well

Oh said Sansa I am talking to him and he’s touching me he’s holding my arm and touching me The Queen of Thorns she’s called Isn’t that right

It is Ser Loras laughed He has the warmest laugh she thought as he went on You’d best not use that name in her presence though or you’re like to get pricked

Sansa reddened Any fool would have realized that no woman would be happy about being called the Queen of Thorns Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him but her wits had deserted her She almost told him how beautiful he was until she remembered that she’d already done that

He was beautiful though He seemed taller than he’d been when she’d first met him but still so lithe and graceful and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes He’s no boy though he’s a man grown a knight of the Kingsguard She thought he looked even finer in white than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped his cloak the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves

Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor’s for them to pass He was all in white as well though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras Beyond the spiked moat two dozen men were taking their practice with sword and shield With the castle so crowded the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise their tents and pavilions leaving only the smaller inner yards for training One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad with the eyes on his shield Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword seemed to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack but Osney’s brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt Blunted swords or no Slynt would have a rich crop of bruises by the morrow It made Sansa wince just to watch They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle and already they are practicing for the next one

On the edge of the yard a lone knight with a pair of golden roses on his shield was holding off three foes Even as they watched he caught one of them alongside the head knocking him senseless Is that your brother Sansa asked

It is my lady said Ser Loras Garlan often trains against three men or even four In battle it is seldom one against one he says so he likes to be prepared

He must be very brave

He is a great knight Ser Loras replied A better sword than me in truth though I’m the better lance

I remember said Sansa You ride wonderfully ser

My lady is gracious to say so When has she seen me ride

At the Hand’s tourney don’t you remember You rode a white courser and your armor was a hundred different kinds of flowers You gave me a rose A red rose You threw white roses to the other girls that day It made her flush to speak of it You said no victory was half as beautiful as me

Ser Loras gave her a modest smile I spoke only a simple truth that any man with eyes could see

He doesn’t remember Sansa realized startled He is only being kind to me he doesn’t remember me or the rose or any of it She had been so certain that it meant something that it meant everything A red rose not a white It was after you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce she said desperately
