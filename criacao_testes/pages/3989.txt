projects our surroundings I feel my heart sink even further
We must be moving closer to crucial targets because the
number of pods has noticeably increased How can we
possibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights
without detection We cant And if we cant we are
trapped like birds in a net I decide its best not to adopt
some sort of superior attitude when Im with these people
Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa
So I say Any ideas
Why dont we start by ruling out possibilities says
Finnick The street is not a possibility
The rooftops are just as bad as the street says Leeg
1
We still might have a chance to withdraw go back the
way we came says Homes But that would mean a failed
mission
A pang of guilt hits me since Ive fabricated said
mission It was never intended for all of us to go forward
You just had the misfortune to be with me
Well thats a moot point Were with you now says
Jackson So we cant stay put We cant move up We
cant move laterally I think that just leaves one option
Underground says Gale
Underground Which I hate Like mines and tunnels
and 13 Underground where I dread dying which is stupid
because even if I die aboveground the next thing theyll do
is bury me underground anyway
The Holo can show subterranean as well as streetlevel
pods I see that when we go underground the clean
dependable lines of the street plan are interlaced with a
twisting turning mess of tunnels The pods look less
numerous though
Two doors down a vertical tube connects our row of
apartments to the tunnels To reach the tube apartment we
will need to squeeze through a maintenance shaft that runs
the length of the building We can enter the shaft through the
back of a closet space on the upper floor
Okay then Lets make it look like weve never been
here I say We erase all signs of our stay Send the empty
cans down a trash chute pocket the full ones for later flip
sofa cushions smeared with blood wipe traces of gel from
the tiles Theres no fixing the latch on the front door but we
lock a second bolt which will at least keep the door from
swinging open on contact
Finally theres only Peeta to contend with He plants
himself on the blue sofa refusing to budge Im not going
Ill either disclose your position or hurt someone else
Snows people will find you says Finnick
Then leave me a pill Ill only take it if I have to says
Peeta
Thats not an option Come along says Jackson
Or youll what Shoot me asks Peeta
Well knock you out and drag you with us says
Homes Which will both slow us down and endanger us
Stop being noble I dont care if I die He turns to me
pleading now Katniss please Dont you see I want to be
out of this
The trouble is I do see Why cant I just let him go Slip
him a pill pull the trigger Is it because I care too much
about Peeta or too much about letting Snow win Have I
turned him into a piece in my private Games Thats
despicable but Im not sure its beneath me If its true it
would be kindest to kill Peeta here and now But for better
or worse I am not motivated by kindness Were wasting
time Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you out
Peeta buries his face in his hands for a few moments
then rises to join us
Should we free his hands asks Leeg 1
No Peeta growls at her drawing his cuffs in close to
his body
No I echo But I want the key Jackson passes it
over without a word I slip it into my pants pocket where it
clicks against the pearl
When Homes pries open the small metal door to the
maintenance shaft we encounter another problem Theres
no way the insect shells will be able to fit through the narrow
passage Castor and Pollux remove them and detach
emergency backup cameras Each is the size of a shoe
box and probably works about as well Messalla cant think
of anywhere better to hide the bulky shells so we end up
dumping them in the closet Leaving such an easy trail to
follow frustrates me but what else can we do
Even going single file holding our packs and gear out
to the side its a tight fit We sidestep our way past the first
apartment and break into the second In this apartment
one of the bedrooms has a door marked utility instead of a
bathroom Behind the door is the room with the entrance to
the tube
Messalla frowns at the wide circular cover for a
moment returning to his own fussy world Its why no one
ever wants the center unit Workmen coming and going
whenever and no second bath But the rents considerably
cheaper Then he notices Finnicks amused expression
and adds Never mind
The tube covers simple to unlatch A wide ladder with
rubber treads on the steps allows for a swift easy descent
into the bowels of the city We gather at the foot of the
ladder waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dim strips of
lights breathing in the mixture of chemicals mildew and
sewage
