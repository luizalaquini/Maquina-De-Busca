even President Snow wont be able to tear himself away
Got anything like that asks Haymitch
Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into
focus While I knock down breakfast and get prepped I try
to think of what I might say President Snow must be
wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are
affecting me If he wants me broken then I will have to be
whole But I dont think I will convince him of anything by
shouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera Besides
that wont buy the rescue team any time Outbursts are
short Its stories that take time
I dont know if it will work but when the television
crews all assembled aboveground I ask Cressida if she
could start out by asking me about Peeta I take a seat on
the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown wait for
the red light and Cressidas question
How did you meet Peeta she asks
And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since
my first interview I open up When I met Peeta I was
eleven years old and I was almost dead I talk about that
awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain
how Peetas mother chased me from the bakery door and
how he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread that
saved our lives We had never even spoken The first time
I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games
But he was already in love with you says Cressida
I guess so I allow myself a small smile
How are you doing with the separation she asks
Not well I know at any moment Snow could kill him
Especially since he warned Thirteen about the bombing Its
a terrible thing to live with I say But because of what
theyre putting him through I dont have any reservations
anymore About doing whatever it takes to destroy the
Capitol Im finally free I turn my gaze skyward and watch
the flight of a hawk across the sky President Snow once
admitted to me that the Capitol was fragile At the time I
didnt know what he meant It was hard to see clearly
because I was so afraid Now Im not The Capitols fragile
because it depends on the districts for everything Food
energy even the Peacekeepers that police us If we
declare our freedom the Capitol collapses President
Snow thanks to you Im officially declaring mine today
Ive been sufficient if not dazzling Everyone loves the
bread story But its my message to President Snow that
gets the wheels spinning in Plutarchs brain He hastily calls
Finnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intense
conversation that I can see Haymitch isnt happy with
Plutarch seems to win--Finnicks pale but nodding his head
by the end of it
As Finnick moves to take my seat before the camera
Haymitch tells him You dont have to do this
Yes I do If it will help her Finnick balls up his rope in
his hand Im ready
I dont know what to expect A love story about Annie
An account of the abuses in District 4 But Finnick Odair
takes a completely different tack
President Snow used tosell memy body that is
Finnick begins in a flat removed tone I wasnt the only
one If a victor is considered desirable the president gives
them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an
exorbitant amount of money If you refuse he kills someone
you love So you do it
That explains it then Finnicks parade of lovers in the
Capitol They were never real lovers Just people like our
old Head Peacekeeper Cray who bought desperate girls
to devour and discard because he could I want to interrupt
the taping and beg Finnicks forgiveness for every false
thought Ive ever had about him But we have a job to do
and I sense Finnicks role will be far more effective than
mine
I wasnt the only one but I was the most popular he
says And perhaps the most defenseless because the
people I loved were so defenseless To make themselves
feel better my patrons would make presents of money or
jewelry but I found a much more valuable form of payment
Secrets I think Thats what Finnick told me his lovers
paid him in only I thought the whole arrangement was by
his choice
Secrets he says echoing my thoughts And this is
where youre going to want to stay tuned President Snow
because so very many of them were about you But lets
begin with some of the others
Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that
you cant doubt its authenticity Tales of strange sexual
appetites betrayals of the heart bottomless greed and
bloody power plays Drunken secrets whispered over damp
pillow-cases in the dead of night Finnick was someone
bought and sold A district slave A handsome one
certainly but in reality harmless Who would he tell And
who would believe him if he did But some secrets are too
delicious not to share I dont know the people Finnick
names--all seem to be prominent Capitol citizens--but I
know from listening to the chatter of my prep team the
attention the most mild slip in judgment can draw If a bad
haircut can lead to hours of gossip what will charges of
incest back-stabbing blackmail and arson produce Even
as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over the
Capitol the people there will be waiting as I am now to
hear about the president
And now on to our good President Coriolanus
