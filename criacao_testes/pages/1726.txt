 No not a steady girl like Fanny  
Ill tell ye all particulars When I got to Caster
bridge Barracks they said  The Eleventh Dragoon+
Guards be gone away and new troops have come
The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards
The Route came from Government like a thief in the
night as is his nature to and afore the Eleventh knew
it almost they wem on the march They passed near
here
Gabriel had listened with interest I saw them go
he said
 Yes continued William  they pranced down the
street playing The Girl I Left Behind Me so tis
said in glorious notes of triumph Every looker-ons
inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his
deepest vitals and there was not a dry eye throughout
the town among the public-house people and the name+
less women 
But theyre not gone to any war
No maam but they be gone to take the places
of them who may which is very close connected And
so I said to myself Fannys young man was one of the
regiment and shes gone after him There maam
thats it in black and white
Gabriel remained musing and said nothing for he
was in doubt
Well we are not likely to know more to-night at
any rate said Bathsheba But one of you had better
run across to Farmer Boldwoods and tell him that
much
She then rose but before retiring addressed a few
words to them with a pretty dignity to which her
mourning dress added a soberness that was hardly to
be found in the words themselves
Now mind you have a mistress instead of a master
I dont yet know my powers or my talents in farming
but I shall do my best and if you serve me well so
shall I serve you Dont any unfair ones among you
if there are any such but I hope not suppose that
because Im a woman I dont understand the difference
between bad goings-on and good

All Nom
Liddy Excellent well said
I shall be up before you are awake I shall be
afield before you are up  and I shall have breakfasted
before you are afield In short I shall astonish you all
All Yesm
And so good-night
All Good-night maam
Then this small-thesmothete stepped from the table
and surged out of the hall her black silk dress licking
up a few straws and dragging them along with a scratch+
ing noise upon the floor biddy elevating her feelings
to the occasion from a sense of grandeur floated off
behind Bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely
free from travesty and the door was closed

OUTSIDE THE BARRACKS -- SNOW -- A MEETING
FOR dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the
outskirts of a certain town and military station many
miles north of Weatherbury at a later hour on this
same snowy evening -- if that may be called a prospect
of which the chief constituent was darkness
It was a night when sorrow may come to the
brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity 
when with impressible persons love becomes solicitous+
ness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope  when
the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret
at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by
and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
The scene was a public path bordered on the left
hand by a river behind which rose a high wall On
the right was a tract of land partly meadowand partly
moor reaching at its remote verge to a wide undulating
uplan
The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on
spots of this kind than amid woodland scenery Still
to a close observer they are just as perceptible  the
difference is that their media of manifestation are less
trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the
bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf Many are
not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to
imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor
or waste Winter in coming to the country hereabout
advanced in well-marked stages wherein might have
been successively observed the retreat of the snakes
the transformation of the ferns the filling of the pools
a rising of fogs the embrowning by frost the collapse
of the fungi and an obliteration by snow
This climax of the series had been reached to-night on
the aforesaid moor and for the first time in the season

irregularities were forms without features  suggestive
of anything proclaiming nothing and without more
character than that of being the limit of something
else -- the lowest layer of a firmament of snow From
