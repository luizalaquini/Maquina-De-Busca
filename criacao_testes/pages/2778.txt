and maintain their cause

636 If they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth
not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their
enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or
near 637 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their
captivity saying We have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt
wickedly 638 If they return to thee with all their heart and with
all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have
carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest
unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and
toward the house which I have built for thy name 639 Then hear thou
from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their
supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which
have sinned against thee

640 Now my God let I beseech thee thine eyes be open and let
thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place

641 Now therefore arise O LORD God into thy resting place thou
and the ark of thy strength let thy priests O LORD God be clothed
with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness

642 O LORD God turn not away the face of thine anointed remember
the mercies of David thy servant

71 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down
from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and
the glory of the LORD filled the house

72 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD
because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORDs house

73 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down
and the glory of the LORD upon the house they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and
praised the LORD saying For he is good for his mercy endureth for
ever

74 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
LORD

75 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all
the people dedicated the house of God

76 And the priests waited on their offices the Levites also with
instruments of musick of the LORD which David the king had made to
praise the LORD because his mercy endureth for ever when David
praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before
them and all Israel stood

77 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings and the
fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which Solomon had
made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat
offerings and the fat

78 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days and all
Israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of
Hamath unto the river of Egypt

79 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept
the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days

710 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the
goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David and to Solomon and to
Israel his people

711 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the kings
house and all that came into Solomons heart to make in the house of
the LORD and in his own house he prosperously effected

712 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him I
have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an
house of sacrifice

713 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain or if I command the
locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people
714 If my people which are called by my name shall humble
themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked
ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and
will heal their land

715 Now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer
that is made in this place

716 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house that my name may
be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
perpetually

717 And as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father
walked and do according to all that I have commanded thee and shalt
observe my statutes and my judgments 718 Then will I stablish the
throne of thy kingdom according as I have covenanted with David thy
father saying There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel

719 But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments
