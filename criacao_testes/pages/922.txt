Ser Kevan did not visit him that night He was probably with Lord Tywin trying to placate the Tyrells I have seen the last of that uncle I fear He poured another cup of wine A pity he’d had Symon Silver Tongue killed before learning all the words of that song It wasn’t a bad song if truth be told Especially compared to the ones that would be written about him henceforth For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm he sang Perhaps he should write the other verses himself If he lived so long

That night surprisingly Tyrion Lannister slept long and deep He rose at first light well rested and with a hearty appetite and broke his fast on fried bread blood sausage applecakes and a double helping of eggs cooked with onions and fiery Dornish peppers Then he begged leave of his guards to attend his champion Ser Addam gave his consent

Tyrion found Prince Oberyn drinking a cup of red wine as he donned his armor He was attended by four of his younger Dornish lordlings Good morrow to you my lord the prince said Will you take a cup of wine

Should you be drinking before battle

I always drink before battle

That could get you killed Worse it could get me killed

Prince Oberyn laughed The gods defend the innocent You are innocent I trust

Only of killing Joffrey Tyrion admitted I do hope you know what you are about to face Gregor Clegane is—

—large So I have heard

He is almost eight feet tall and must weigh thirty stone all of it muscle He fights with a two-handed greatsword but needs only one hand to wield it He has been known to cut men in half with a single blow His armor is so heavy that no lesser man could bear the weight let alone move in it

Prince Oberyn was unimpressed I have killed large men before The trick is to get them off their feet Once they go down they’re dead The Dornishman sounded so blithely confident that Tyrion felt almost reassured until he turned and said Daemon my spear Ser Daemon tossed it to him and the Red Viper snatched it from the air

You mean to face the Mountain with a spear That made Tyrion uneasy all over again In battle ranks of massed spears made for a formidable front but single combat against a skilled swordsman was a very different matter

We are fond of spears in Dorne Besides it is the only way to counter his reach Have a look Lord Imp but see you do not touch The spear was turned ash eight feet long the shaft smooth thick and heavy The last two feet of that was steel a slender leaf-shaped spearhead narrowing to a wicked spike The edges looked sharp enough to shave with When Oberyn spun the haft between the palms of his hand they glistened black Oil Or poison Tyrion decided that he would sooner not know I hope you are good with that he said doubtfully

You will have no cause for complaint Though Ser Gregor may However thick his plate there will be gaps at the joints Inside the elbow and knee beneath the arms… I will find a place to tickle him I promise you He set the spear aside It is said that a Lannister always pays his debts Perhaps you will return to Sunspear with me when the day’s bloodletting is done My brother Doran would be most pleased to meet the rightful heir to Casterly Rock… especially if he brought his lovely wife the Lady of Winterfell

Does the snake think I have Sansa squirreled away somewhere like a nut I’m hoarding for winter If so Tyrion was not about to disabuse him A trip to Dorne might be very pleasant now that I reflect on it

Plan on a lengthy visit Prince Oberyn sipped his wine You and Doran have many matters of mutual interest to discuss Music trade history wine the dwarf’s penny… the laws of inheritance and succession No doubt an uncle’s counsel would be of benefit to Queen Myrcella in the trying times ahead

If Varys had his little birds listening Oberyn was giving them a ripe earful I believe I will have that cup of wine said Tyrion Queen Myrcella It would have been more tempting if only he did have Sansa tucked beneath his cloak If she declared for Myrcella over Tommen would the north follow What the Red Viper was hinting at was treason Could Tyrion truly take up arms against Tommen against his own father Cersei would spit blood It might be worth it for that alone

Do you recall the tale I told you of our first meeting Imp Prince Oberyn asked as the Bastard of Godsgrace knelt before him to fasten his greaves It was not for your tail alone that my sister and I came to Casterly Rock We were on a quest of sorts A quest that took us to Starfall the Arbor Oldtown the Shield Islands Crakehall and finally Casterly Rock… but our true destination was marriage Doran was betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos so he had been left behind as castellan of Sunspear My sister and I were yet unpromised

Elia found it all exciting She was of that age and her delicate health had never permitted her much travel I preferred to amuse myself by mocking my sister’s suitors There was Little Lord Lazyeye Squire Squishlips one I named the Whale That Walks that sort of thing The only one who was even halfway presentable was young Baelor Hightower A pretty lad and my sister was half in love with him until he had the misfortune to fart once in our presence I promptly named him Baelor Breakwind and after that Elia couldn’t look at him without laughing I was a monstrous young fellow someone should have sliced out my vile tongue

Yes Tyrion agreed silently Baelor Hightower was no longer young but he remained Lord Leyton’s heir wealthy handsome and a knight of splendid repute Baelor Brightsmile they called him now Had Elia wed him in place of Rhaegar Targaryen she might be in Oldtown with her children growing tall around her He wondered how many lives had been snuffed out by that fart

Lannisport was the end of our voyage Prince Oberyn went on as Ser Arron Qorgyle helped him into a padded leather tunic and began lacing it up the back Were you aware that our mothers knew each other of old

They had been at court together as girls I seem to recall Companions to Princess Rhaella

Just so It was my belief that the mothers had cooked up this plot between them Squire Squishlips and his ilk and the various pimply young maidens who’d been paraded before me were the almonds before the feast meant only to whet our appetites The main course was to be served at Casterly Rock

Cersei and Jaime

Such a clever dwarf Elia and I were older to be sure Your brother and sister could not have been more than eight or nine Still a difference of five or six years is little enough And there was an empty cabin on our ship a very nice cabin such as might be kept for a person of high birth As if it were intended that we take someone back to Sunspear A young page perhaps Or a companion for Elia Your lady mother meant to betroth Jaime to my sister or Cersei to me Perhaps both

Perhaps said Tyrion but my father—
