quick comprehension and considerable force of char+
acter  but being without the power to combine them
the comprehension became engaged with trivialities
whilst waiting for the will to direct it and the force
wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the
comprehension
He was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle
class -- exceptionally well educated for a common soldier
He spoke fluently and unceasingly He could in this
way be one thing and seem another  for instance he

The wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman
is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
many people almost as automatically as they repeat a
proverb or say that they are Christians and the like
without thinking much of the enormous corollaries
which spring from the proposition Still less is it acted
upon for the good of the complemental being alluded
to With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home
When expressed with some amount of reflectiveness it
seems co-ordinate with a belief that this flattery must
be reasonable to be effective It is to the credit of
men that few attempt to settle the question by experi+
ment and it is for their happiness perhaps that accident
has never settled it for them Nevertheless that a
male dissembler who by deluging her with untenable
fictions charms the female wisely may acquire powers
reaching to the extremity of perdition is a truth taught
to many by unsought and wringing occurrences And
some profess to have attained to the same knowledge
by experiment as aforesaid and jauntily continue their
indulgence in such experiments with terrible effect
Sergeant Troy was one
He had been known to observe casually that in
dealing with womankind the only alternative to flattery
was cursing and swearing There was no third method
 Treat them fairly and you are a lost man he would
say
This philosophers public appearance in Weatherbury
promptly followed his arrival there A week or two
after the shearing Bathsheba feeling a nameless relief
of spirits on account of Boldwoods absence approached
her hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the
haymakers They consisted in about equal proportions
of gnarled and flexuous forms the former being the
men the latter the women who wore tilt bonnets
covered with nankeen which hung in a curtain upon
their shoulders Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing
in a less forward meadow Clark humming a tune to
the strokes of his

scythe to which Jan made no attempt
to keep time with his In the first mead they were
already loading hay the women raking it into cocks
and windrows and the men tossing it upon the
waggon
From behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot
emerged and went on loading unconcernedly with the
rest It was the gallant sergeant who had come hay+
making for pleasure  and nobody could deny that he
was doing the mistress of the farm real knight-service
by this voluntary contribution of his labour at a busy
time
As soon as she had entered the field Troy saw her
and sticking his pitchfork into the ground and picking
up his crop or cane he came forward Bathsheba
blushed with half-angry embarrassment and adjusted
her eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her
path

SCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD
AH Miss Everdene said the sergeant touching his
diminutive cap Little did I think it was you I was
speaking to the other night And yet if I had reflected
the Queen of the Corn-market truth is truth at any
hour of the day or night and I heard you so named in
Casterbridge yesterday the Queen of the Corn-market
I say could be no other woman I step across now to
beg your forgiveness a thousand times for having been
led by my feelings to express myself too strongly for a
stranger To be sure I am no stranger to the place --
I am Sergeant Troy as I told you and I have assisted
your uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a
lad I have been doing the same for you today
I suppose I must thank you for that Sergeant
Troy said the Queen of the Corn-market in an in+
differently grateful tone
The sergeant looked hurt and sad Indeed you
must not Miss Everdene he said  Why could you
think such a thing necessary  
I am glad it is not
 Why  if I may ask without offence
 Because I dont much want to thank you for any
thing
