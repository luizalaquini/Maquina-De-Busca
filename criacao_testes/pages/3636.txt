Bran had never even heard of Ser Stafford Lannister He found himself agreeing with Big Walder when he said Lord Tywin is the only one who matters

Tell Robb I want him to come home said Rickon He can bring his wolf home too and Mother and Father Though he knew Lord Eddard was dead sometimes Rickon forgot… willfully Bran suspected His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be

Bran was glad for Robb’s victory but disquieted as well He remembered what Osha had said the day that his brother had led his army out Of Winterfell He’s marching the wrong way the wildling woman had insisted

Sadly no victory is without cost Maester Luwin turned to the Walders My lords your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross He took a wound in the battle Robb writes It was not thought to be serious but three days later he died in his tent asleep

Big Walder shrugged He was very old Five-and-sixty I think Too old for battles He was always saying he was tired

Little Walder hooted Tired of waiting for our grandfather to die you mean Does this mean Ser Emmon’s the heir now

Don’t be stupid his cousin said The sons of the first son come before the second son Ser Ryman is next in line and then Edwyn and Black Walder and Petyr Pimple And then Aegon and all his sons

Ryman is old too said Little Walder Past forty I bet And he has a bad belly Do you think he’ll be lord

I’ll be lord I don’t care if he is

Maester Luwin cut in sharply You ought to be ashamed of such talk my lords Where is your grief Your uncle is dead

Yes said Little Walder We’re very sad

They weren’t though Bran got a sick feeling in his belly They like the taste of this dish better than I do He asked Maester Luwin to be excused

Very well The maester rang for help Hodor must have been busy in the stables It was Osha who came She was stronger than Alebelly though and had no trouble lifting Bran in her arms and carrying him down the steps

Osha Bran asked as they crossed the yard Do you know the way north To the Wall and… and even past

The way’s easy Look for the Ice Dragon and chase the blue star in the rider’s eye She backed through a door and started up the winding steps

And there are still giants there and… the rest… the Others and the children of the forest too

The giants I’ve seen the children I’ve heard tell of and the white walkers… why do you want to know

Did you ever see a three-eyed crow

No She laughed And I can’t say I’d want to Osha kicked open the door to his bedchamber and set him in his window seat where he could watch the yard below

It seemed only a few heartbeats after she took her leave that the door opened again and Jojen Reed entered unbidden with his sister Meera behind him You heard about the bird Bran asked The other boy nodded It wasn’t a supper like you said It was a letter from Robb and we didn’t eat it but—

The green dreams take strange shapes sometimes Jojen admitted The truth of them is not always easy to understand

Tell me the bad thing you dreamed Bran said The bad thing that is coming to Winterfell

Does my lord prince believe me now Will he trust my words no matter how queer they sound in his ears

Bran nodded

It is the sea that comes

The sea

I dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell I saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle Drowned men were floating in the yard When I first dreamed the dream back at Greywater I didn’t know their faces but now I do That Alebelly is one the guard who called our names at the feast Your septon’s another Your smith as well

Mikken Bran was as confused as he was dismayed But the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues away and Winterfell’s walls are so high the water couldn’t get in even if it did come

In the dark of night the salt sea will flow over these walls said Jojen I saw the dead bloated and drowned

We have to tell them Bran said Alebelly and Mikken and Septon Chayle Tell them not to drown

It will not save them replied the boy in green

Meera came to the window seat and put a hand on his shoulder They will not believe Bran No more than you did

Jojen sat on Bran’s bed Tell me what you dream

He was scared even then but he had sworn to trust them and a Stark of Winterfell keeps his sworn word There’s different kinds he said slowly There’s the wolf dreams those aren’t so bad as the others I run and hunt and kill squirrels And there’s dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too calling my name That frightens me But the worst dreams are when I fall He looked down into the yard feeling miserable I never used to fall before When I climbed I went everyplace up on the roofs and along the walls I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower Mother was afraid that I would fall but I knew I never would Only I did and now when I sleep I fall all the time

Meera gave his shoulder a squeeze Is that all

I guess

Warg said Jojen Reed

Bran looked at him his eyes wide What

Warg Shapechanger Beastling That is what they will call you if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams

The names made him afraid again Who will call me

Your own folk In fear Some will hate you if they know what you are Some will even try to kill you

Old Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes In the stories they were always evil I’m not like that Bran said I’m not It’s only dreams

The wolf dreams are no true dreams You have your eye closed tight whenever you’re awake but as you drift off it flutters open and your soul seeks out its other half The power is strong in you

I don’t want it I want to be a knight

A knight is what you want A warg is what you are You can’t change that Bran you can’t deny it or push it away You are the winged wolf but you will never fly Jojen got up and walked to the window Unless you open your eye He put two fingers together and poked Bran in the forehead hard

When he raised his hand to the spot Bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin There was no eye not even a closed one How can I open it if it’s not there

You will never find the eye with your fingers Bran You must search with your heart Jojen studied Bran’s face with those strange green eyes Or are you afraid

Maester Luwin says there’s nothing in dreams that a man need fear

There is said Jojen

What
