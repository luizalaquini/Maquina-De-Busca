Your Grace Ned Stark said we must talk…

Robert pressed his fingertips against his temples I am sick unto death of talk On the morrow I’m going to the kingswood to hunt Whatever you have to say can wait until I return

If the gods are good I shall not be here on your return You commanded me to return to Winterfell remember

Robert stood up grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself The gods are seldom good Ned Here this is yours He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed Like it or not you are my Hand damn you I forbid you to leave

Ned picked up the silver clasp He was being given no choice it seemed His leg throbbed and he felt as helpless as a child The Targaryen girl—

The king groaned Seven hells don’t start with her again That’s done I’ll hear no more of it

Why would you want me as your Hand if you refuse to listen to my counsel

Why Robert laughed Why not Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom Put on the badge Ned It suits you And if you ever throw it in my face again I swear to you I’ll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister





CATELYN

The eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn Catelyn Stark watched the light spread her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window Below her the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests Pale white mists rose off Alyssa’s Tears where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long tumble down the face of the Giant’s Lance Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face

Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband her brothers and all her children slain and yet in life she had never shed a tear So in death the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale where the men she had loved were buried Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died Tell me the rest of it she said

The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind her Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent but he has had no answer Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood

Catelyn turned away from the sunrise Its beauty did little to lighten her mood it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to Edmure has sent riders and made vows she said but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun What of my lord father

The message made no mention of Lord Hoster my lady Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds he looked almost himself again

My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick she said worried I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived

Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep Maester Colemon told me

I should have been woken she insisted

The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat Ser Rodrik said

Then she still plans to go through with this mummer’s farce Catelyn grimaced The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes and she is too deaf to hear the tune Whatever happens this morning Ser Rodrik it is past time we took our leave My place is at Winterfell with my sons If you are strong enough to travel I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown We can take ship from there

Another ship Ser Rodrik looked a shade green yet he managed not to shudder As you say my lady

The old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had given her If she spoke to her sister before the duel perhaps she could change her mind she thought as they dressed her Lysa’s policies varied with her moods and her moods changed hourly The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud fearful cruel dreamy reckless timid stubborn vain and above all inconstant

When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately but no nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the Vale And now this…

Lannister is my prisoner she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the Eyrie’s cold white halls Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt My sister must be reminded of that

At the doors to Lysa’s apartments they met her uncle storming out Going to join the fool’s festival Ser Brynden snapped I’d tell you to slap some sense into your sister if I thought it would do any good but you’d only bruise your hand

There was a bird from Riverrun Catelyn began a letter from Edmure…
