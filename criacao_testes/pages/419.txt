Stannis frowned Who else should it be

Renly gave an easy shrug When I saw that standard I could not be certain Whose banner do you bear

Mine own

The red-clad priestess spoke up The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light

Renly seemed amused by that All for the good If we both use the same banner the battle will be terribly confused

Catelyn said Let us hope there will be no battle We three share a common foe who would destroy us all

Stannis studied her unsmiling The Iron Throne is mine by rights All those who deny that are my foes

The whole of the realm denies it brother said Renly Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers’wombs They deny it in Dorne and they deny it on the Wall No one wants you for their king Sorry

Stannis clenched his jaw his face taut I swore I would never treat with you while you wore your traitor’s crown Would that I had kept to that vow

This is folly Catelyn said sharply Lord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand swords The remnants of the Kingslayer’s army have regrouped at the Golden Tooth another Lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of Casterly Rock and Cersei and her son hold King’s Landing and your precious Iron Throne You each name yourself king yet the kingdom bleeds and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son

Renly shrugged Your son has won a few battles I shall win the war The Lannisters can wait my pleasure

If you have proposals to make make them Stannis said brusquely or I will be gone

Very well said Renly I propose that you dismount bend your knee and swear me your allegiance

Stannis choked back rage That you shall never have

You served Robert why not me

Robert was my elder brother You are the younger

Younger bolder and far more comely…

…and a thief and a usurper besides

Renly shrugged The Targaryens called Robert usurper He seemed to be able to bear the shame So shall I

This will not do Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine I would bang your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers

Stannis frowned at her You presume too much Lady Stark I am the rightful king and your son no less a traitor than my brother here His day will come as well

The naked threat fanned her fury You are very free to name others traitor and usurper my lord yet how are you any different You say you alone are the rightful king yet it seems to me that Robert had two sons By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms Prince Joffrey is his rightful heir and Tornmen after him… and we are all traitors however good our reasons

Renly laughed You must forgive Lady Catelyn Stannis She’s come all the way down from Riverrun a long way ahorse I fear she never saw your little letter

Joffrey is not my brother’s seed Stannis said bluntly Nor is Tommen They are bastards The girl as well All three of them abominations born of incest

Would even Cersei be so mad Catelyn was speechless

Isn’t that a sweet story my lady Renly asked I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter and I must say it took my breath away He smiled at his brother I had never suspected you were so clever Stannis Were it only true you would indeed be Robert’s heir

Were it true Do you name me a liar
