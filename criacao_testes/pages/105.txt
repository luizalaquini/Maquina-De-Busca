Robert must be told Ned said If what you say is true if even a part of it is true the king must hear it for himself

And what proof shall we lay before him My words against theirs My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer against his brothers and his council against the Wardens of East and West against all the might of Casterly Rock Pray send for Ser Ilyn directly it will save us all some time I know where that road ends

Yet if what you say is true they will only bide their time and make another attempt

Indeed they will said Varys and sooner rather than later I do fear You are making them most anxious Lord Eddard But my little birds will be listening and together we may be able to forestall them you and I He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more Thank you for the wine We will speak again When you see me next at council be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt You should not find it difficult

He was at the door when Ned called Varys The eunuch turned back How did Jon Arryn die

I wondered when you would get around to that

Tell me

The tears of Lys they call it A rare and costly thing clear and sweet as water and it leaves no trace I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster in this very room I begged him but he would not hear of it Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing he told me

Ned had to know the rest Who gave him the poison

Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him no doubt Oh but which one There were many such Lord Arryn was a kindly trusting man The eunuch sighed There was one boy All he was he owed Jon Arryn but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household he stayed in King’s Landing and prospered It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world The whip was in his voice again every word a stroke He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney him in his bright new armor with those crescent moons on his cloak A pity he died so untimely before you could talk to him…

Ned felt half-poisoned himself The squire he said Ser Hugh Wheels within wheels within wheels Ned’s head was pounding Why Why now Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years What was he doing that they had to kill him

Asking questions Varys said slipping out the door





TYRION

As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt owed the Starks Steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife His hands moved deftly with never a wasted cut the work had to be done quickly before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights

None of us will go hungry tonight Bronn said He was near a shadow himself bone thin and bone hard with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard

Some of us may Tyrion told him I am not fond of eating horse Particularly my horse

Meat is meat Bronn said with a shrug The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork

Do you take me for a Dothraki Tyrion asked sourly The Dothraki ate horse in truth they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him

Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection Want a taste dwarf

My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day Tyrion said in a flat voice

Thank him for us then If you ever see him again Chiggen grinned showing yellow teeth and swallowed the raw meat in two bites Tastes well bred

Better if you fry it up with onions Bronn put in

Wordlessly Tyrion limped away The cold had settled deep in his bones and his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one He had hours more riding ahead of him followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short cold sleep on hard ground and then another night of the same and another and another and the gods only knew how it would end Damn her he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors remembering damn her and all the Starks

The memory was still bitter One moment he’d been ordering supper and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking No swords not here please m’lords

Tyrion wrenched down Jyck’s arm hurriedly before he got them both hacked to pieces Where are your courtesies Jyck Our good hostess said no swords Do as she asks He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt You’re making a sad mistake Lady Stark I had no part in any attack on your son On my honor—
