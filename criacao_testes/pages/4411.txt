FG Table 116  Bit allocation for Speak n Spell chip
There are 4 bits for energy and 5 bits for pitch and the first two
reflection coefficients
Thereafter the number of bits allocated to reflection coefficients decreases
steadily for higher coefficients are less important for intelligibility
than lower ones
Note that using a 10-stage filter is tantamount to allocating
ul
no
bits to coefficients higher than the tenth  With a
1-bit repeat flag whose role is discussed shortly the frame size
becomes 49 bits
Updated every 20 msec this gives a data rate of just under 25 Kbits
pp
The parameters are expanded into 10-bit numbers by a separate quantization
table for each one
For example the five pitch bits address a 32-word look-up table which
returns a 10-bit value
The transformation is logarithmic in this case the lowest pitch being
around 50 Hz and the highest 190 Hz
As shown in Table 116 a total of 216 10-bit words suffices to hold all
twelve quantization tables and they are implemented on the synthesizer
chip
To provide further smoothing of the control parameters
they are interpolated linearly from one frame to the next at eight points
within the frame
pp
The raw data rate of 25 Kbits is reduced to an average of 1200 bits
by further coding techniques
Firstly if the energy parameter is zero the frame is silent
and no more parameters are transmitted 4-bit frame
Secondly if the repeat flag is 1 all reflection coefficients are held
over from the previous frame giving a constant filter but with the ability
to vary amplitude and pitch 10-bit frame
Finally if the frame is unvoiced signalled by the pitch value being zero
only four reflection coefficients are transmitted because the ear is
relatively insensitive to spectral detail in unvoiced speech 28-bit frame
The end of the utterance is signalled by the energy bits all being 1
rh Chip organization
The configuration of the lattice filter is shown in Figure 1110
FC Figure 1110
The two-multiplier structure Chapter 6 is used so the 10-stage filter
requires 19 multiplications and 19 additions
per speech sample
The last operation in the reverse path at the bottom is not needed  Since
a 10 kHz sample rate is used just 100 musec are available for each
speech sample
A single 5 musec adder and a pipelined multiplier are implemented on
the chip and multiplexed among the 19 operations
The latter begins a new multiplication every 5 musec and finishes it
40 musec later
These times are within the capability of p-channel MOS technology
allowing the chip to be produced at low cost
The time slot for the 20th unnecessary filter multiplication is used
for an overall gain adjustment
pp
The final analogue signal is produced by an 8-bit on-chip DA converter
which drives a 200 milliwatt speaker through an impedance-matching
transformer
These constitute the necessary analogue low-pass desampling filter

Serial data enters directly from the read-only memories although a control
signal from the processor begins synthesis and another signal is returned
