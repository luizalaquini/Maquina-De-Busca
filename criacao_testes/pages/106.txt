Lannister honor was all she said She held up her hands for all the room to see His dagger left these scars The blade he sent to open my son’s throat

Tyrion felt the anger all around him thick and smoky fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman’s hands Kill him hissed some drunken slattern from the back and other voices took up the call faster than he would have believed Strangers all friendly enough only a moment ago and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail

Tyrion spoke up loudly trying to keep the quaver from his voice If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for I will go with her and answer for it

It was the only possible course Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman’s plea for help the Harrenhal man the three Brackens a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though they’d kill him as soon as spit and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing Against that what did Tyrion have A dagger at his belt and two men Jyck swung a fair enough sword but Morrec scarcely counted he was part groom part cook part body servant and no soldier As for Yoren whatever his feelings might have been the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm Yoren would do nothing

And indeed the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark’s side said Take their weapons and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck’s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers Good the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably excellent Tyrion recognized the gruff voice Winterfell’s master-at-arms shorn of his whiskers

Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep’s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark Don’t kill him here

Don’t kill him anywhere Tyrion urged

Take him somewheres else no blood here m’lady I wants no high lordlin’s quarrels

We are taking him back to Winterfell she said and Tyrion thought Well perhaps… By then he’d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation He was not altogether displeased by what he saw Oh the Stark woman had been clever no doubt of it Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served and then call on them for succor and her a woman yes that was sweet Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count Catelyn Stark’s plea had roused a bare dozen the others looked confused or frightened or sullen Only two of the Freys had stirred Tyrion noted and they’d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move He might have smiled if he’d dared

Winterfell it is then he said instead That was a long ride as he could well attest having just ridden it the other way So many things could happen along the way My father will wonder what has become of me he added catching the eye of the swordsman who’d offered to yield up his room He’ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today Lord Tywin would do no such thing of course but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free

Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady his look worried as well it might be His men come with him the old knight announced And we’ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you’ve seen here

It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh Quiet The old fool Unless he took the whole inn the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow If not him then someone else Yoren would carry the story south That fool singer might make a lay of it The Freys would report back to their lord and the gods only knew what he might do Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side At the very least he would send his birds winging south to King’s Landing and he might well dare more than that

Catelyn Stark wasted no time We must ride at once We’ll want fresh mounts and provisions for the road You men know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell I promise you shall be well rewarded That was all it took the fools came rushing forward Tyrion studied their faces they would indeed be well rewarded he vowed to himself but perhaps not quite as they imagined

Yet even as they were bundling him outside saddling the horses in the rain and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid They would never get him to Winterfell he would have given odds on that Riders would be after them within the day birds would take wing and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand Tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle

They set out through the rain at a hard gallop and before long Tyrion’s thighs were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain Even when they were safely away from the inn and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground made worse by his blindness Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse The hood muffled sound so he could not make out what was being said around him and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face until even breathing was a struggle The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl and that wretched singer had to open his mouth he thought mournfully The wretched singer had come along with them There is a great song to be made from this and I’m the one to make it he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the splendid adventure turned out Tyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders caught up with them

The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount Rough hands pulled him down from his horse untied his wrists and yanked the hood off his head When he saw the narrow stony road the foothills rising high and wild all around them and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon all the hope went out of him in a rush This is the high road he gasped looking at Lady Stark with accusation The eastern road You said we were riding for Winterfell

Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles Often and loudly she agreed No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us I wish them good speed

Even now long days later the memory filled him with a bitter rage All his life Tyrion had prided himself on his cunning the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him and yet this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction

They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses and then they were off again This time Tyrion was spared the hood After the second night they no longer bound his hands and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all It seemed they did not fear his escape And why should they Up here the land was harsh and wild and the high road little more than a stony track If he did run how far could he hope to go alone and without provisions The shadowcats would make a morsel of him and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword

Yet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly He knew where they were bound He had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood These mountains were the domain of House Arryn and the late Hand’s widow was a Tully Catelyn Stark’s sister… and no friend to the Lannisters Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly during her years at King’s Landing and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance

His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road The horses had drunk their fill of the icy cold water and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock Jyck and Morrec huddled close sullen and miserable Mohor stood over them leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head Nearby Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings

We must have some rest my lady the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached He was Lady Whent’s man stiff-necked and stolid and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn

Ser Willis speaks truly my lady Ser Rodrik said This is the third horse we have lost—

We will lose more than horses if we’re overtaken by the Lannisters she reminded them Her face was windburnt and gaunt but it had lost none of its determination

Small chance of that here Tyrion put in

The lady did not ask your views dwarf snapped Kurleket a great fat oaf with short-cropped hair and a pig’s face He was one of the Brackens a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him A Lannister always paid his debts Kurleket would learn that someday as would his friends Lharys and Mohor and the good Ser Willis and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen He planned an especially sharp lesson for Marillion him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage

Let him speak Lady Stark commanded
