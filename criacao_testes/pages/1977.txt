rh Intonation analysis
One distinction which a program can usefully try
to make is between basically rising
and basically falling pitch contours  It is often said that pitch rises on
a question and falls on a statement but if you listen to speech you will
find this to be a gross oversimplification  It normally
falls on statements certainly but it falls as often as it rises on questions
It is more accurate to say that pitch rises on yes-no questions
and falls on other utterances although this rule is still only a rough guide
A simple test which operates lexically on the input text is to determine
whether a sentence is a question by looking at the 
punctuation mark at its end and then to examine the first word
If it is a wh-word like what which when why and also how
a falling contour is likely to fit
If not the question is probably a yes-no one and the contour
should rise
Such a crude rule will certainly not be very accurate
it fails for example when the wh-word is embedded in a phrase as in
at what time are you going but at least it provides a starting-point
pp
An air of finality is given to an utterance when it bears a definite
fall in pitch dropping to a rather low value at the end
This should accompany the last intonation unit in an utterance
unless it is a yes-no question
However a rise-fall contour such as Hallidays tone group 5 Figure 85
can easily be used in utterance-final position by one person
in a conversation em
although it would be unlikely to terminate the dialogue altogether
A new topic is frequently introduced by a fall-rise contour em such as
Hallidays tone group 4 em and this often begins a paragraph
pp
Determining the type of pitch contour is only one part of
intonation assignment  There are really three separate problems
LB
NP
dividing the utterance into tone groups
NP
choosing the tonic syllable or major stress point of each one
NP
assigning a pitch contour to each tone group
LE
Let us continue to use the Halliday notation for intonation which was introduced
in simplified form in the previous chapter
Moreover assume that the foot boundaries can be placed correctly em
this problem will be discussed in the next subsection
Then a scheme which considers only the lexical form of the utterance
and does not attempt to understand it whatever that means is as follows
LB
NP
place a tone group boundary at every punctuation mark
NP
place the tonic at the first syllable of the last foot in a tone group
NP
use contour 4 for the first tone group in a paragraph and contour 1
elsewhere except for a yes-no question which receives contour 2
