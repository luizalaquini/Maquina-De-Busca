Finally Tom ran out of rain songs and put away his harp Then there was only the sound of the rain itself beating down on the slate roof of the brewhouse The dice game ended and Arya stood on one leg and then the other listening to Merrit complain about his horse throwing a shoe

I could shoe him for you said Gendry all of a sudden I was only a ’prentice but my master said my hand was made to hold a hammer I can shoe horses close up rents in mail and beat the dents from plate I bet I could make swords too

What are you saying lad asked Harwin

I’ll smith for you Gendry went to one knee before Lord Beric If you’ll have me m’lord I could be of use I’ve made tools and knives and once I made a helmet that wasn’t so bad One of the Mountain’s men stole it from me when we was taken

Arya bit her lip He means to leave me too

You would do better serving Lord Tully at Riverrun said Lord Beric I cannot pay for your work

No one ever did I want a forge and food to eat some place I can sleep That’s enough m’lord

A smith can find a welcome most anywhere A skilled armorer even more so Why would you choose to stay with us

Arya watched Gendry screw up his stupid face thinking At the hollow hill what you said about being King Robert’s men and brothers I liked that I liked that you gave the Hound a trial Lord Bolton just hanged folk or took off their heads and Lord Tywin and Ser Amory were the same I’d sooner smith for you

We got plenty of mail needs mending m’lord Jack reminded Lord Beric Most we took off the dead and there’s holes where the death came through

You must be a lackwit boy said Lem We’re outlaws Lowborn scum most of us excepting his lordship Don’t think it’ll be like Tom’s fool songs neither You won’t be stealing no kisses from a princess nor riding in no tourneys in stolen armor You join us you’ll end with your neck in a noose or your head mounted up above some castle gate

It’s no more than they’d do for you said Gendry

Aye that’s so said Jack-Be-Lucky cheerfully The crows await us all M’lord the boy seems brave enough and we do have need of what he brings us Take him says Jack

And quick suggested Harwin chuckling before the fever passes and he comes back to his senses

A wan smile crossed Lord Beric’s lips Thoros my sword

This time the lightning lord did not set the blade afire but merely laid it light on Gendry’s shoulder Gendry do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend themselves to protect all women and children to obey your captains your liege lord and your king to fight bravely when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you however hard or humble or dangerous they may be

I do m’lord

The marcher lord moved the sword from the right shoulder to the left and said Arise Ser Gendry knight of the hollow hill and be welcome to our brotherhood

From the door came rough rasping laughter

The rain was running off him His burned arm was wrapped in leaves and linen and bound tight against his chest by a crude rope sling but the older burns that marked his face glistened black and slick in the glow of their little fire Making more knights Dondarrion the intruder said in a growl I ought to kill you all over again for that

Lord Beric faced him coolly I’d hoped we’d seen the last of you Clegane How did you come to find us

It wasn’t hard You made enough bloody smoke to be seen in Oldtown

What’s become of the sentries I posted

Clegane’s mouth twitched Those two blind men Might be I killed them both What would you do if I had

Anguy strung his bow Notch was doing the same Do you wish to die so very much Sandor asked Thoros You must be mad or drunk to follow us here

Drunk on rain You didn’t leave me enough gold to buy a cup of wine you whoresons
