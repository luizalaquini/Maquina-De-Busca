Theon had given his word This was not the time to flinch Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later Harrag he said go to the kennels and bring Palla out for…

Ramsay There was a smile on his plump lips but none in those pale pale eyes Snow my wife called me before she ate her fingers but I say Bolton His smile curdled So you’d offer me a kennel girl for my good service is that the way of it

There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like no more than he liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at him She was what was promised

She smells of dogshit I’ve had enough of bad smells as it happens I think I’ll have your bedwarmer instead What do you call her Kyra

Are you mad Theon said angrily I’ll have you—

The Bastard’s backhand caught him square and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel The world vanished in a red roar of pain

Sometime later Theon found himself on the ground He rolled onto his stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood Close the gates he tried to shout but it was too late The Dreadfort men had cut down Red Rolfe and Kenned and more were pouring through a river of mail and sharp swords There was a ringing in his ears and horror all around him Black Lorren had his sword out but there were already four of them pressing in on him He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders then swung back to ride over him Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables Save me the Freys the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward and burn the rest Burn it burn it all

The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze screaming rearing…





TYRION

He dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh The air was full of acrid smoke Men were groaning and whimpering all around him and from time to time a scream would pierce the air thick with pain When he tried to move he found that he had fouled his own bedding The smoke in the air made his eyes water Am I crying He must not let his father see He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock A lion I must be a lion live a lion die a lion He hurt so much though Too weak to groan he lay in his own filth and shut his eyes Nearby someone was cursing the gods in a heavy monotonous voice He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying After a time the room faded

He found himself outside the city walking through a world without color Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings while carrion crows rose from their feasts in furious clouds wherever he set his steps White maggots burrowed through black corruption The wolves were grey and so were the silent sisters together they stripped the flesh from the fallen There were corpses strewn all over the tourney fields The sun was a hot white penny shining down upon the grey river as it rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships From the pyres of the dead rose black columns of smoke and white-hot ashes My work thought Tyrion Lannister They died at my command

At first there was no sound in the world but after a time he began to hear the voices of the dead soft and terrible They wept and moaned they begged for an end to pain they cried for help and wanted their mothers Tyrion had never known his mother He wanted Shae but she was not there He walked alone amidst grey shadows trying to remember…

The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of their armor and clothes All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain they were garbed in shades of white and grey and their blood was black and crusty He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their fellows Metal and cloth were thrown in the back of a white wooden wagon pulled by two tall black horses

So many dead so very many Their corpses hung limply their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas unrecognizable hardly human The garments the sisters took from them were decorated with black hearts grey lions dead flowers and pale ghostly stags Their armor was all dented and gashed the chainmail riven broken slashed Why did I kill them all He had known once but somehow he had forgotten

He would have asked one of the silent sisters but when he tried to speak he found he had no mouth Smooth seamless skin covered his teeth The discovery terrified him How could he live without a mouth He began to run The city was not far He would be safe inside the city away from all these dead He did not belong with the dead He had no mouth but he was still a living man No a lion a lion and alive But when he reached the city walls the gates were shut against him

It was dark when he woke again At first he could see nothing but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around him The drapes were drawn but he could see the shape of carved bedposts and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed and the pillow beneath his head was goose down My own bed I am in my own bed in my own bedchamber

It was warm inside the drapes under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered him He was sweating Fever he thought groggily He felt so weak and the pain stabbed through him when he struggled to lift his hand He gave up the effort His head felt enormous as big as the bed too heavy to raise from the pillow His body he could scarcely feel at all How did I come here He tried to remember The battle came back in fits and flashes The fight along the river the knight who’d offered up his gauntlet the bridge of ships…

Ser Mandon He saw the dead empty eyes the reaching hand the green fire shining against the white enamel plate Fear swept over him in a cold rush beneath the sheets he could feel his bladder letting go He would have cried out if he’d had a mouth No that was the dream he thought his head pounding Help me someone help me Jaime Shae Mother someone… Tysha…

No one heard No one came Alone in the dark he fell back into piss-scented sleep He dreamed his sister was standing over his bed with their lord father beside her frowning It had to be a dream since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away fighting Robb Stark in the west Others came and went as well Varys looked down on him and sighed but Littlefinger made a quip Bloody treacherous bastard Tyrion thought venomously we sent you to Bitterbridge and you never came back Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another but he did not understand the words Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in thick felt

He wanted to ask if they’d won the battle We must have else I’d be a head on a spike somewhere If I live we won He did not know what pleased him more the victory or the fact he had been able to reason it out His wits were coming back to him however slowly That was good His wits were all he had

The next time he woke the draperies had been pulled back and Podrick Payne stood over him with a candle When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off No don’t go help me help he tried to call but the best he could do was a muffled moan I have no mouth He raised a hand to his face his every movement pained and fumbling His fingers found stiff cloth where they should have found flesh lips teeth Linen The lower half of his face was bandaged tightly a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding

A short while later Pod reappeared This time a stranger was with him a maester chained and robed My lord you must be still the man murmured You are grievous hurt You will do yourself great injury Are you thirsty

He managed an awkward nod The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat Tyrion swallowed scarcely tasting Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy By the time the maester removed the funnel from his mouth he was already spiraling back to sleep

This time he dreamed he was at a feast a victory feast in some great hall He had a high seat on the dais and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero Marillion was there the singer who’d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon He played his woodharp and sang of the Imp’s daring deeds Even his father was smiling with approval When the song was over Jaime rose from his place commanded Tyrion to kneel and touched him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword and he rose up a knight Shae was waiting to embrace him She took him by the hand laughing and teasing calling him her giant of Lannister

He woke in darkness to a cold empty room The draperies had been drawn again Something felt wrong turned around though he could not have said what He was alone once more Pushing back the blankets he tried to sit but the pain was too much and he soon subsided breathing raggedly His face was the least part of it His right side was one huge ache and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm What’s happened to me Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it I was hurt more badly than I knew Ser Mandon…

The memory frightened him but Tyrion made himself hold it turn it in his head stare at it hard He tried to kill me no mistake That part was not a dream He would have cut me in half if Pod had not… Pod where’s Pod

Gritting his teeth he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked The drapes ripped free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down half on the rushes and half on him Even that small effort had dizzied him The room whirled around him all bare walls and dark shadows with a single narrow window He saw a chest he’d owned an untidy pile of his clothing his battered armor This is not my bedchamber he realized Not even the Tower of the Hand Someone had moved him His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan They have moved me here to die he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more The room was dank and cold and he was burning

He dreamed of a better place a snug little cottage by the sunset sea The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth but he had always been warm there even when they let the fire go out She used to tease me about that he remembered I never thought to feed the fire that had always been a servant’s task We have no servants she would remind me and I would say You have me I’m your servant and she would say A lazy servant What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock my lord and he would tell her They kiss them That would always make her giggle They do not neither They beat them I bet she would say but he would insist No they kiss them just like this He would show her how They kiss their fingers first every one and they kiss their wrists yes and inside their elbows Then they kiss their funny ears all our servants have funny ears Stop laughing And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them there so like that and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips their… mmmm… mouths… so…

They would kiss for hours and spend whole days doing no more than lolling in bed listening to the waves and touching each other Her body was a wonder to him and she seemed to find delight in his Sometimes she would sing to him I loved a maid as fair as summer with sunlight in her hair I love you Tyrion she would whisper before they went to sleep at night I love your lips I love your voice and the words you say to me and how you treat me gentle I love your face

My face

Yes Yes I love your hands and how you touch me Your cock I love your cock I love how it feels when it’s in me

It loves you too my lady

I love to say your name Tyrion Lannister It goes with mine Not the Lannister t’other part Tyrion and Tysha Tysha and Tyrion Tyrion My lord Tyrion…

Lies he thought all feigned all for gold she was a whore Jaime’s whore Jaime’s gift my lady of the lie Her face seemed to fade away dissolving behind a veil of tears but even after she was gone he could still hear the faint far-off sound of her voice calling his name …my lord can you hear me My lord Tyrion My lord My lord

Through a haze of poppied sleep he saw a soft pink face leaning over him He was back in the dank room with the torn bed hangings and the face was wrong not hers too round with a brown fringe of beard Do you thirst my lord I have your milk your good milk You must not fight no don’t try to move you need your rest He had the copper funnel in one damp pink hand and a flask in the other

As the man leaned close Tyrion’s fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals grabbed pulled The maester dropped the flask spilling milk of the poppy all over the blanket Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man’s fat neck No More he croaked so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken But he must have for the maester choked out a reply Unhand please my lord… need your milk the pain… the chain don’t unhand no…

The pink face was beginning to purple when Tyrion let go The maester reeled back sucking in air His reddened throat showed deep white gouges where the links had pressed His eyes were white too Tyrion raised a hand to his face and made a ripping motion over the hardened mask And again And again

You… you want the bandages off is that it the maester said at last But I’m not to… that would be… be most unwise my lord You are not yet healed the queen would…

The mention of his sister made Tyrion growl Are you one of hers then He pointed a finger at the maester then coiled his hand into a fist Crushing choking a promise unless the fool did as he was bid

Thankfully he understood I… I will do as my lord commands to be sure but… this is unwise your wounds…

Do It Louder that time

Bowing the man left the room only to return a few moments later bearing a long knife with a slender sawtooth blade a basin of water a pile of soft cloths and several flasks By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches so he was half sitting against his pillow The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin beneath the mask A slip of the hand here and Cersei will be free of me he thought He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen only inches above his throat

Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister’s braver creatures After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks There was pain as well but he did his best to ignore that The maester discarded the bandages still crusty with potion Be still now I must wash out the wound His touch was gentle the water warm and soothing The wound Tyrion thought remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes This is like to sting some the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs It did more than sting It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion’s face and twisted a burning poker up his nose His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath but somehow he managed not to scream The maester was clucking like an old hen It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit my lord Still it looks clean good good When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying your wounds were filthy One of your ribs was broken doubtless you can feel it the blow of some mace perhaps or a fall it’s hard to say And you took an arrow in the arm there where it joins the shoulder It showed signs of mortification and for a time I feared you might lose the limb but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots and now it seems to be healing clean…

Name Tyrion breathed up at him Name

The maester blinked Why you are Tyrion Lannister my lord Brother to the queen Do you remember the battle Sometimes with head wounds—

Your name His throat was raw and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words

I am Maester Ballabar

Ballabar Tyrion repeated Bring me Looking glass
