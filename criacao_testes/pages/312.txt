Good men Fine men Any of the six will do but I’d choose Allar Deem My right arm Good good man Loyal Pick him and you won’t be sorry If he pleases the king

To be sure Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater He’s been captain on the Mud Gate for three years and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion King Robert knighted him at Pyke And yet his name does not appear on your list

Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before swallowing Bywater Well Brave man to be sure yet… he’s rigid that one A queer dog The men don’t like him A cripple too lost his hand at Pyke that’s what got him knighted A poor trade if you ask me a hand for a ser He laughed Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor as I see it You’ll do better leaving that one where he is my lor—Tyrion Allar Deem’s the man for you

Deem is little loved in the streets I am told

He’s feared That’s better

What was it I heard of him Some trouble in a brothel

That Not his fault my lor—Tyrion No He never meant to kill the woman that was her own doing He warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty

Still… mothers and children he might have expected she’d try to save the babe Tyrion smiled Have some of this cheese it goes splendidly with the wine Tell me why did you choose Deem for that unhappy task

A good commander knows his men Tyrion Some are good for one job some for another Doing for a babe and her still on the tit that takes a certain sort Not every man’d do it Even if it was only some whore and her whelp

I suppose that’s so said Tyrion hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae and Tysha long ago and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years

Slynt went on oblivious A hard man for a hard job is Deem Does as he’s told and never a word afterward He cut a slice off the cheese This is fine Sharp Give me a good sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and I’m a happy man

Tyrion shrugged Enjoy it while you can With the riverlands in flame and Renly king in Highgarden good cheese will soon be hard to come by So who sent you after the whore’s bastard

Lord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him You’re a sly one Tyrion Thought you could trick me did you it takes more than wine and cheese to make Janos Slynt tell more than he should I pride myself Never a question and never a word afterward not with me

As with Deem

Just the same You make him your Commander when I’m off to Harrenhal and you won’t regret it

Tyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese It was sharp indeed and veined with wine very choice Whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor I can tell Lord Mormont faces the same problem

Lord Janos looked puzzled I thought she was a lady Mormont Beds down with bears that’s the one

It was her brother I was speaking of Jeor Mormont the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch When I was visiting with him on the Wall he mentioned how concerned he was about finding a good man to take his place The Watch gets so few good men these days Tyrion grinned He’d sleep easier if he had a man like you I imagine Or the valiant Allar Deem

Lord Janos roared Small chance of that

One would think Tyrion said but life does take queer turns Consider Eddard Stark my lord I don’t suppose he ever imagined his life would end on the steps of Baelor’s Sept

There were damn few as did Lord Janos allowed chuckling

Tyrion chuckled too A pity I wasn’t here to see it They say even Varys was surprised

Lord Janos laughed so hard his gut shook The Spider he said Knows everything they say Well he didn’t know that

How could he Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone He had helped persuade my sister that Stark should be pardoned on the condition that he take the black

Eh Janos Slynt blinked vaguely at Tyrion

My sister Cersei Tyrion repeated a shade more strongly in case the fool had some doubt who he meant The Queen Regent

Yes Slynt took a swallow As to that well… the king commanded it m’lord The king himself
