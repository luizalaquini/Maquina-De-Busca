year of Darius came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet
saying 211 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Ask now the priests
concerning the law saying 212 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt
of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or
wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy And the priests answered
and said No

213 Then said Haggai If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
of these shall it be unclean And the priests answered and said It
shall be unclean

214 Then answered Haggai and said So is this people and so is this
nation before me saith the LORD and so is every work of their hands
and that which they offer there is unclean

215 And now I pray you consider from this day and upward from
before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD 216
Since those days were when one came to an heap of twenty measures
there were but ten when one came to the pressfat for to draw out
fifty vessels out of the press there were but twenty

217 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the LORD

218 Consider now from this day and upward from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the
foundation of the LORDs temple was laid consider it

219 Is the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig
tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth
from this day will I bless you

220 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and
twentieth day of the month saying 221 Speak to Zerubbabel governor
of Judah saying I will shake the heavens and the earth 222 And I
will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and I will destroy the strength
of the kingdoms of the heathen and I will overthrow the chariots and
those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come
down every one by the sword of his brother

223 In that day saith the LORD of hosts will I take thee O
Zerubbabel my servant the son of Shealtiel saith the LORD and will
make thee as a signet for I have chosen thee saith the LORD of hosts




Zechariah


11 In the eighth month in the second year of Darius came the word
of the LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the
prophet saying 12 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your
fathers

13 Therefore say thou unto them Thus saith the LORD of hosts Turn
ye unto me saith the LORD of hosts and I will turn unto you saith
the LORD of hosts

14 Be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have
cried saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts Turn ye now from your
evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor
hearken unto me saith the LORD

15 Your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for
ever  16 But my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants
the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they
returned and said Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us
according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt
with us

17 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is
the month Sebat in the second year of Darius came the word of the
LORD unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the
prophet saying 18 I saw by night and behold a man riding upon a
red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the
bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and white

19 Then said I O my lord what are these And the angel that talked
with me said unto me I will shew thee what these be

110 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said
These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the
earth

111 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
myrtle trees and said We have walked to and fro through the earth
and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest

112 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said O LORD of hosts
how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of
Judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and
ten years  113 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me
with good words and comfortable words

114 So the angel that communed with me said unto me Cry thou
saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts I am jealous for Jerusalem and
for Zion with a great jealousy

115 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease
