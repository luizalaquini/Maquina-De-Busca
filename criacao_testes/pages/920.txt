44 For I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby justified but
he that judgeth me is the Lord

45 Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have
praise of God

46 And these things brethren I have in a figure transferred to
myself and to Apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to
think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed
up for one against another

47 For who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost
thou glory as if thou hadst not received it  48 Now ye are full
now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and I would to
God ye did reign that we also might reign with you

49 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last as it
were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world
and to angels and to men

410 We are fools for Christs sake but ye are wise in Christ we are
weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised

411 Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are
naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace 412 And
labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being
persecuted we suffer it 413 Being defamed we intreat we are made
as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto
this day

414 I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons I
warn you

415 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ yet have
ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
the gospel

416 Wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me

417 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus who is my beloved
son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Christ as I teach every where in every church

418 Now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you

419 But I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know
not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power

420 For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power

421 What will ye shall I come unto you with a rod or in love and
in the spirit of meekness  51 It is reported commonly that there is
fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named
among the Gentiles that one should have his fathers wife

52 And ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that
hath done this deed might be taken away from among you

53 For I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have
judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath so
done this deed 54 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are
gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus
Christ 55 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of
the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus

56 Your glorying is not good Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump  57 Purge out therefore the old leaven
that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened For even Christ our
passover is sacrificed for us 58 Therefore let us keep the feast
not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth

59 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
510 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with
the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye
needs go out of the world

511 But now I have written unto you not to keep company if any man
that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater
or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not
to eat

512 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not
ye judge them that are within  513 But them that are without God
judgeth Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person

61 Dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before
the unjust and not before the saints  62 Do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters  63 Know ye not that
we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life
64 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set
them to judge who are least esteemed in the church

65 I speak to your shame Is it so that there is not a wise man
among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his
