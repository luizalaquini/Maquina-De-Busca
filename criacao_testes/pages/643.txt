Dany leaned forward and yanked Viserion’s tail to pull him off his green brother Her blanket fell away from her chest as she moved She grabbed it hastily and covered herself again The Usurper is dead she said

But his son rules in his place Ser Jorah lifted his gaze and his dark eyes met her own A dutiful son pays his father’s debts Even blood debts

This boy Joffrey might want me dead… if he recalls that I’m alive What has that to do with Belwas and Arstan Whitebeard The old man does not even wear a sword You’ve seen that

Aye And I have seen how deftly he handles that staff of his Recall how he killed that manticore in Qarth It might as easily have been your throat he crushed

Might have been but was not she pointed out It was a stinging manticore meant to slay me He saved my life

Khaleesi has it occurred to you that Whitebeard and Belwas might have been in league with the assassin It might all have been a ploy to win your trust

Her sudden laughter made Drogon hiss and sent Viserion flapping to his perch above the porthole The ploy worked well

The exile knight did not return her smile These are Illyrio’s ships Illyrio’s captains Illyrio’s sailors… and Strong Belwas and Arstan are his men as well not yours

Magister Illyrio has protected me in the past Strong Belwas says that he wept when he heard my brother was dead

Yes said Mormont but did he weep for Viserys or for the plans he had made with him

His plans need not change Magister Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen and wealthy…

He was not born wealthy In the world as I have seen it no man grows rich by kindness The warlocks said the second treason would be for gold What does Illyrio Mopatis love more than gold

His skin Across the cabin Drogon stirred restlessly steam rising from his snout Mirri Maz Duur betrayed me I burned her for it

Mirri Maz Duur was in your power In Pentos you shall be in Illyrio’s power It is not the same I know the magister as well as you He is a devious man and clever—

I need clever men about me if I am to win the Iron Throne

Ser Jorah snorted That wineseller who tried to poison you was a clever man as well Clever men hatch ambitious schemes

Dany drew her legs up beneath the blanket You will protect me You and my bloodriders

Four men Khaleesi you believe you know Illyrio Mopatis very well Yet you insist on surrounding yourself with men you do not know like this puffed-up eunuch and the world’s oldest squire Take a lesson from Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos

He means well Dany reminded herself He does all he does for love It seems to me that a queen who trusts no one is as foolish as a queen who trusts everyone Every man I take into my service is a risk I understand that but how am I to win the Seven Kingdoms without such risks Am I to conquer Westeros with one exile knight and three Dothraki bloodriders

His jaw set stubbornly Your path is dangerous I will not deny that But if you blindly trust in every liar and schemer who crosses it you will end as your brothers did

His obstinacy made her angry He treats me like some child Strong Belwas could not scheme his way to breakfast And what lies has Arstan Whitebeard told me

He is not what he pretends to be He speaks to you more boldly than any squire would dare

He spoke frankly at my command He knew my brother

A great many men knew your brother Your Grace in Westeros the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard sits on the small council and serves the king with his wits as well as his steel If I am the first of your Queensguard I pray you hear me out I have a plan to put to you

What plan Tell me

Illyrio Mopatis wants you back in Pentos under his roof Very well go to him… but in your own time and not alone Let us see how loyal and obedient these new subjects of yours truly are Command Groleo to change course for Slaver’s Bay

Dany was not certain she liked the sound of that at all Everything she’d ever heard of the flesh marts in the great slave cities of Yunkai Meereen and Astapor was dire and frightening What is there for me in Slaver’s Bay
