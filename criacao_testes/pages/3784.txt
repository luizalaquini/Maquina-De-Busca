Arya


The small square keep was half a ruin and so too the great grey knight who lived there He was so old he did not understand their questions No matter what was said to him he would only smile and mutter I held the bridge against Ser Maynard Red hair and a black temper he had but he could not move me Six wounds I took before I killed him Six

The maester who cared for him was a young man thankfully After the old knight had drifted to sleep in his chair he took them aside and said I fear you seek a ghost We had a bird ages ago half a year at least The Lannisters caught Lord Beric near the Gods Eye He was hanged

Aye hanged he was but Thoros cut him down before he died Lem’s broken nose was not so red or swollen as it had been but it was healing crooked giving his face a lopsided look His lordship’s a hard man to kill he is

And a hard man to find it would seem the maester said Have you asked the Lady of the Leaves

We shall said Greenbeard

The next morning as they crossed the little stone bridge behind the keep Gendry wondered if this was the bridge the old man had fought over No one knew Most like it is said Jack-Be-Lucky Don’t see no other bridges

You’d know for certain if there was a song said Tom Sevenstrings One good song and we’d know who Ser Maynard used to be and why he wanted to cross this bridge so bad Poor old Lychester might be as far famed as the Dragonknight if he’d only had sense enough to keep a singer

Lord Lychester’s sons died in Robert’s Rebellion grumbled Lem Some on one side some on t’other He’s not been right in the head since No bloody song’s like to help any o’ that

What did the maester mean about asking the Lady of the Leaves Arya asked Anguy as they rode

The archer smiled Wait and see

Three days later as they rode through a yellow wood Jack-Be-Lucky unslung his horn and blew a signal a different one than before The sounds had scarcely died away when rope ladders unrolled from the limbs of trees Hobble the horses and up we go said Tom half singing the words They climbed to a hidden village in the upper branches a maze of rope walkways and little moss-covered houses concealed behind walls of red and gold and were taken to the Lady of the Leaves a stick-thin white-haired woman dressed in roughspun We cannot stay here much longer with autumn on us she told them A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past hunting If they’d chanced to look up they might have seen us

You’ve not seen Lord Beric asked Tom Sevenstrings

He’s dead The woman sounded sick The Mountain caught him and drove a dagger through his eye A begging brother told us He had it from the lips of a man who saw it happen

That’s an old stale tale and false said Lem The lightning lord’s not so easy to kill Ser Gregor might have put his eye out but a man don’t die o’ that Jack could tell you

Well I never did said one-eyed Jack-Be-Lucky My father got himself good and hanged by Lord Piper’s bailiff my brother Wat got sent to the Wall and the Lannisters killed my other brothers An eye that’s nothing

You swear he’s not dead The woman clutched Lem’s arm Bless you Lem that’s the best tidings we’ve had in half a year May the Warrior defend him and the red priest too

The next night they found shelter beneath the scorched shell of a sept in a burned village called Sallydance Only shards remained of its windows of leaded glass and the aged septon who greeted them said the looters had even made off with the Mother’s costly robes the Crone’s gilded lantern and the silver crown the Father had worn They hacked the Maiden’s breasts off too though those were only wood he told them And the eyes the eyes were jet and lapis and mother-of-pearl they pried them out with their knives May the Mother have mercy on them all

Whose work was this said Lem Lemoncloak Mummers

No the old man said Northmen they were Savages who worship trees They wanted the Kingslayer they said

Arya heard him and chewed her lip She could feel Gendry looking at her It made her angry and ashamed

There were a dozen men living in the vault beneath the sept amongst cobwebs and roots and broken wine casks but they had no word of Beric Dondarrion either Not even their leader who wore soot-blackened armor and a crude lightning bolt on his cloak When Greenbeard saw Arya staring at him he laughed and said The lightning lord is everywhere and nowhere skinny squirrel

I’m not a squirrel she said I’ll almost be a woman soon I’ll be one-and-ten

Best watch out I don’t marry you then He tried to tickle her under the chin but Arya slapped his stupid hand away

Lem and Gendry played tiles with their hosts that night while Tom Sevenstrings sang a silly song about Big Belly Ben and the High Septon’s goose Anguy let Arya try his longbow but no matter how hard she bit her lip she could not draw it You need a lighter bow milady the freckled bowman said If there’s seasoned wood at Riverrun might be I’ll make you one

Tom overheard him and broke off his song You’re a young fool Archer If we go to Riverrun it will only be to collect her ransom won’t be no time for you to sit about making bows Be thankful if you get out with your hide Lord Hoster was hanging outlaws before you were shaving And that son of his… a man who hates music can’t be trusted I always say

It’s not music he hates said Lem It’s you fool

Well he has no cause The wench was willing to make a man of him is it my fault he drank too much to do the deed

Lem snorted through his broken nose Was it you who made a song of it or some other bloody arse in love with his own voice

I only sang it the once Tom complained And who’s to say the song was about him ’Twas a song about a fish

A floppy fish said Anguy laughing

Arya didn’t care what Tom’s stupid songs were about She turned to Harwin What did he mean about ransom

We have sore need of horses milady Armor as well Swords shields spears All the things coin can buy Aye and seed for planting Winter is coming remember He touched her under the chin You will not be the first highborn captive we’ve ransomed Nor the last I’d hope

That much was true Arya knew Knights were captured and ransomed all the time and sometimes women were too But what if Robb won’t pay their price She wasn’t a famous knight and kings were supposed to put the realm before their sisters And her lady mother what would she say Would she still want her back after all the things she’d done Arya chewed her lip and wondered

The next day they rode to a place called High Heart a hill so lofty that from atop it Arya felt as though she could see half the world Around its brow stood a ring of huge pale stumps all that remained of a circle of once-mighty weirwoods Arya and Gendry walked around the hill to count them There were thirty-one some so wide that she could have used them for a bed

High Heart had been sacred to the children of the forest Tom Sevenstrings told her and some of their magic lingered here still No harm can ever come to those as sleep here the singer said Arya thought that must be true the hill was so high and the surrounding lands so flat that no enemy could approach unseen

The smallfolk hereabouts shunned the place Tom told her it was said to be haunted by the ghosts of the children of the forest who had died here when the Andal king named Erreg the Kinslayer had cut down their grove Arya knew about the children of the forest and about the Andals too but ghosts did not frighten her She used to hide in the crypts of Winterfell when she was little and play games of come-into-my-castle and monsters and maidens amongst the stone kings on their thrones

Yet even so the hair on the back of her neck stood up that night She had been asleep but the storm woke her The wind pulled the coverlet right off her and sent it swirling into the bushes When she went after it she heard voices

Beside the embers of their campfire she saw Tom Lem and Greenbeard talking to a tiny little woman a foot shorter than Arya and older than Old Nan all stooped and wrinkled and leaning on a gnarled black cane Her white hair was so long it came almost to the ground When the wind gusted it blew about her head in a fine cloud Her flesh was whiter the color of milk and it seemed to Arya that her eyes were red though it was hard to tell from the bushes The old gods stir and will not let me sleep she heard the woman say I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag aye I dreamt of a man without a face waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish Dead she drifted with red tears on her cheeks but when her eyes did open oh I woke from terror All this I dreamt and more Do you have gifts for me to pay me for my dreams

Dreams grumbled Lem Lemoncloak what good are dreams Fish women and drowned crows I had a dream myself last night I was kissing this tavern wench I used to know Are you going to pay me for that old woman

The wench is dead the woman hissed Only worms may kiss her now And then to Tom Sevenstrings she said I’ll have my song or I’ll have you gone

So the singer played for her so soft and sad that Arya only heard snatches of the words though the tune was half-familiar Sansa would know it I bet Her sister had known all the songs and she could even play a little and sing so sweetly All I could ever do was shout the words

The next morning the little white woman was nowhere to be seen As they saddled their horses Arya asked Tom Sevenstrings if the children of the forest still dwelled on High Heart The singer chuckled Saw her did you

Was she a ghost

Do ghosts complain of how their joints creak No she’s only an old dwarf woman A queer one though and evil-eyed But she knows things she has no business knowing and sometimes she’ll tell you if she likes the look of you

Did she like the looks of you Arya asked doubtfully

The singer laughed The sound of me at least She always makes me sing the same bloody song though Not a bad song mind you but I know others just as good He shook his head What matters is we have the scent now You’ll soon be seeing Thoros and the lightning lord I’ll wager

If you’re their men why do they hide from you
