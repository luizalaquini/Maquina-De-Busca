After some time they brought the hot water he had asked for It was only tepid and soon cold and seawater in the bargain but it served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face and hair and hands While two thralls lit his braziers Theon stripped off his travel-stained clothing and dressed to meet his father He chose boots of supple black leather soft lambswool breeches of silvery-grey a black velvet doublet with the golden kraken of the Greyjoys embroidered on the breast Around his throat he fastened a slender gold chain around his waist a belt of bleached white leather He hung a dirk at one hip and a longsword at the other in scabbards striped black-and-gold Drawing the dirk he tested its edge with his thumb pulled a whetstone from his belt pouch and gave it a few licks He prided himself on keeping his weapons sharp When I return I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes he warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves the silk decorated with a delicate scrollwork tracery in golden thread

Theon returned to the Great Keep through a covered stone walkway the echoes of his footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below To get to the Sea Tower on its crooked pillar he had to cross three further bridges each narrower than the one before The last was made of rope and wood and the wet salt wind made it sway underfoot like a living thing Theon’s heart was in his mouth by the time he was halfway across A long way below the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as they crashed against the rock As a boy he used to run across this bridge even in the black of night Boys believe nothing can hurt them his doubt whispered Grown men know better

The door was grey wood studded with iron and Theon found it barred from the inside He hammered on it with a fist and cursed when a splinter snagged the fabric of his glove The wood was damp and moldy the iron studs rusted

After a moment the door was opened from within by a guard in a black iron breastplate and pothelm You are the son

Out of my way or you’ll learn who I am The man stood aside Theon climbed the twisting steps to the solar He found his father seated beside a brazier beneath a robe of musty sealskins that covered him foot to chin At the sound of boots on stone the Lord of the Iron Islands lifted his eyes to behold his last living son He was smaller than Theon remembered him And so gaunt Balon Greyjoy had always been thin but now he looked as though the gods had put him in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from his bones until nothing remained but hair and skin Bone thin and bone hard he was with a face that might have been chipped from flint His eyes were flinty too black and sharp but the years and the salt winds had turned his hair the grey of a winter sea flecked with whitecaps Unbound it hung past the small of the back

Nine years is it Lord Balon said at last

Ten Theon answered pulling off his torn gloves

A boy they took his father said What are you now

A man Theon answered Your blood and your heir

Lord Balon grunted We shall see

You shall Theon promised

Ten years you say Stark had you as long as I And now you come as his envoy

Not his Theon said Lord Eddard is dead beheaded by the Lannister queen

They are both dead Stark and that Robert who broke my walls with his stones I vowed I’d live to see them both in their graves and I have He grimaced Yet the cold and the damp still make my joints ache as when they were alive So what does it serve

It serves Theon moved closer I bring a letter—

Did Ned Stark dress you like that his father interrupted squinting up from beneath his robe Was it his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet daughter

Theon felt the blood rising to his face I am no man’s daughter If you mislike my garb I will change it

You will Throwing off the furs Lord Balon pushed himself to his feet He was not so tall as Theon remembered That bauble around your neck—was it bought with gold or iron

Theon touched the gold chain He had forgotten It has been so long    In the Old Way women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin but a warrior wore only the jewelry he took off the corpses of enemies slain by his own hand Paying the iron price it was called

You blush red as a maid Theon A question was asked Is it the gold price you paid or the iron

The gold Theon admitted

His father slid his fingers under the necklace and gave it a yank so hard it was like to take Theon’s head off had the chain not snapped first My daughter has taken an axe for a lover Lord Balon said I will not have my son bedeck himself like a whore He dropped the broken chain onto the brazier where it slid down among the coals It is as I feared The green lands have made you soft and the Starks have made you theirs

You’re wrong Ned Stark was my gaoler but my blood is still salt and iron

Lord Balon turned away to warm his bony hands over the brazier Yet the Stark pup sends you to me like a well-trained raven clutching his little message

There is nothing small about the letter I bear Theon said and the offer he makes is one I suggested to him

This wolf king heeds your counsel does he The notion seemed to amuse Lord Balon

He heeds me yes I’ve hunted with him trained with him shared meat and mead with him warred at his side I have earned his trust He looks on me as an older brother he—

No His father jabbed a finger at his face Not here not in Pyke not in my hearing you will not name him brother this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword Or have you forgotten Rodrik and Maron who were your own blood

I forget nothing Ned Stark had killed neither of his brothers in truth Rodrik had been slain by Lord Jason Mallister at Seagard Maron crushed in the collapse of the old south tower    but Stark would have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to sweep them together I remember my brothers very well Theon insisted Chiefly he remembered Rodrik’s drunken cuffs and Maron’s cruel japes and endless lies I remember when my father was a king too He took out Robb’s letter and thrust it forward Here Read it    Your Grace

Lord Balon broke the seal and unfolded the parchment His black eyes flicked back and forth So the boy would give me a crown again he said and all I need do is destroy his enemies His thin lips twisted in a smile

By now Robb is at the Golden Tooth Theon said Once it falls he’ll be through the hills in a day Lord Tywin’s host is at Harrenhal cut off from the west The Kingslayer is a captive at Riverrun Only Ser Stafford Lannister and the raw green levies he’s been gathering remain to oppose Robb in the west Ser Stafford will put himself between Robb’s army and Lannisport which means the city will be undefended when we descend on it by sea If the gods are with us even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the Lannisters so much as realize that we are upon them

Lord Balon grunted Casterly Rock has never fallen

Until now Theon smiled And how sweet that will be

His father did not return the smile So this is why Robb Stark sends you back to me after so long So you might win my consent to this plan of his

It is my plan not Robb’s Theon said proudly Mine as the victory will be mine and in time the crown I will lead the attack myself if it please you As my reward I would ask that you grant me Casterly Rock for my own seat once we have taken it from the Lannisters With the Rock he could hold Lannisport and the golden lands of the west It would mean wealth and power such as House Greyjoy had never known

You reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling His father read the letter again The pup says nothing about a reward Only that you speak for him and I am to listen and give him my sails and swords and in return he will give me a crown His flinty eyes lifted to meet his son’s He will give me a crown he repeated his voice growing sharp

A poor choice of words what is meant is—

What is meant is what is said The boy will give me a crown And what is given can be taken away Lord Balon tossed the letter onto the brazier atop the necklace The parchment curled blackened and took flame

Theon was aghast Have you gone mad

His father laid a stinging backhand across his cheek Mind your tongue You are not in Winterfell now and I am not Robb the Boy that you should speak to me so I am the Greyjoy Lord Reaper of Pyke King of Salt and Rock Son of the Sea Wind and no man gives me a crown I pay the iron price I will take my crown as Urron Redhand did five thousand years ago

Theon edged backward away from the sudden fury in his father’s tone Take it then he spat his cheek still tingling Call yourself King of the Iron Islands no one will care    until the wars are over and the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off his shore with an iron crown on his head

Lord Balon laughed Well at the least you are no craven No more than I’m a fool Do you think I gather my ships to watch them rock at anchor I mean to carve out a kingdom with fire and sword    but not from the west and not at the bidding of King Robb the Boy Casterly Rock is too strong and Lord Tywin too cunning by half Aye we might take Lannisport but we should never keep it No I hunger for a different plum    not so juicy sweet to be sure yet it hangs there ripe and undefended

Where Theon might have asked but by then he knew





DAENERYS

The Dothraki named the comet shierak qiya the Bleeding Star The old men muttered that it omened ill but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned Khal Drogo the night her dragons had awakened It is the herald of my coming she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart The gods have sent it to show me the way

Yet when she put the thought into words her handmaid Doreah quailed That way lies the red lands Khaleesi A grim place and terrible the riders say

The way the comet points is the way we must go Dany insisted    though in truth it was the only way open to her

She dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the Dothraki sea The first khalasar they met would swallow up her ragged band slaying the warriors and slaving the rest The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to them They were too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk and the Lhazareen had small reason to love them She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai and Astapor but Rakharo warned her that Pono’s khalasar had ridden that way driving thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of Slaver’s Bay Why should I fear Pono Dany objected He was Drogo’s ko and always spoke me gently
