these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you 1825 And
the land is defiled therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants

1826 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments and shall
not commit any of these abominations neither any of your own nation
nor any stranger that sojourneth among you 1827 For all these
abominations have the men of the land done which were before you and
the land is defiled 1828 That the land spue not you out also when
ye defile it as it spued out the nations that were before you

1829 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations even the
souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people

1830 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance that ye commit not any
one of these abominable customs which were committed before you and
that ye defile not yourselves therein I am the LORD your God

congregation of the children of Israel and say unto them Ye shall be
holy for I the LORD your God am holy

sabbaths I am the LORD your God

194 Turn ye not unto idols nor make to yourselves molten gods I am
the LORD your God

195 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD ye
shall offer it at your own will

196 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it and on the morrow
and if ought remain until the third day it shall be burnt in the
fire

197 And if it be eaten at all on the third day it is abominable it
shall not be accepted

198 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity
because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD and that soul
shall be cut off from among his people

199 And when ye reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not wholly
