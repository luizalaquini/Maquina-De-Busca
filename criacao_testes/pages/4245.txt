CONCURRITUR -- HORAE MOMENTO
OUTSIDE the front of Boldwoods house a group of
men stood in the dark with their faces towards the door
which occasionally opened and closed for the passage of
some guest or servant when a golden rod of light would
stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again
leaving nothing outside but the glowworm shine of the
pale lamp amid the evergreens over the door
He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon -- so the
boy said one of them remarked in a whisper And l
for one believe it His body was never found you know
Tis a strange story said the next You may
depend upont that she knows nothing about it
Not a word
Perhaps he dont mean that she shall said another
man
If hes alive and here in the neighbourhood he
means mischief said the first Poor young thing
I do pity her if tis true Hell drag her to the dogs
O no hell settle down quiet enough said one
disposed to take a more hopeful view of the case
What a fool she must have been ever to have had
anything to do with the man She is so self-willed and
independent too that one is more minded to say it
serves her right than pity her
No no I dont hold with ee there She was no
otherwise than a girl mind and how couid she tell what
the man was made of If tis really true tis too hard
a punishment and more than she ought to hae -- Hullo
whos that This was to some footsteps that were
heard approaching
William Smallbury said a dim figure in the shades
coming up and joining them Dark as a hedge to+
night isnt it I all but missed the plank over the river
athart there in the bottom --

never did such a thing
before in my life Be ye any of Boldwoods workfolk
He peered into their faces
Yes -- all o us We met here a few minutes ago
Oh I hear now -- thats Sam Samway  thought I
knowed the voice too Going in
Presently But I say William Samway whispered
have ye heard this strange tale
What -- that about Sergeant Troy being seen dye
mean souls said Smallbury also lowering his voice
Ay in Casterbridge
Yes I have Laban Tall named a hint of it to me
but now -- but I dont think it Hark here Laban
comes himself a blieve A footstep drew near
Laban
Yes tis I said Tall
Have ye heard any more about that
No said Tall joining the group And Im in+
clined to think wed better keep quiet If so be tis not
true twill flurry her and do her much harm to repeat
it and if so be tis true twill do no good to forestall
her time o trouble God send that it mid be a lie for
though Henery Fray and some of em do speak against
her shes never been anything but fair to me Shes
hot and hasty but shes a brave girl wholl never tell a
lie however much the truth may harm her and Ive no
cause to wish her evil
She never do tell womens little lies thats true  and
tis a thing that can be said of very few Ay all the
harm she thinks she says to yer face theres nothing
underhand wi her
They stood silent then every man busied with his
own thoughts during which interval sounds of merri+
ment could be heard within Then the front door again
opened the rays streamed out the weliknown form of
Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light the
door closed and Boldwood walked slowly down the path
Tis master one of the men whispered as he neared
them Wed better stand quiet -- hell go in again
directly He would think it unseemly o us to be
loitering here
Boldwood came on and passed by the men without
P 431
seeing them they being under the bushes on the grass
He paused leant over the gate and breathed a long
breath They heard low words come from him
I hope to God shell come or this night will be
nothing but misery to me O my darling my darling
why do you keep me in suspense like this
He said this to himself and they all distinctly heard
it Boldwood remained silent after that and the noise
from indoors was again just audible until a few minutes
later light wheels could be distinguished coming down
the hill They drew nearer and ceased at the gate
Boldwood hastened back to the door and opened it
and the light shone upon Bathsheba coming up the
path
Boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome
