Curiosity was stronger than caution Harwin leave us he commanded Not until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl

Lord Varys Ned said in astonishment

Lord Stark Varys said politely seating himself I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink

Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys I might have passed within a foot of you and never recognized you he said incredulous He had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but silk and velvet and the richest damasks and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs

That was my dearest hope Varys said It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private The queen watches you closely This wine is very choice Thank you

How did you get past my other guards Ned asked Porther and Cayn had been posted outside the tower and Alyn on the stairs

The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders Varys smiled apologetically I will not keep you long my lord There are things you must know You are the King’s Hand and the king is a fool The eunuch’s cloying tones were gone now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip Your friend I know yet a fool nonetheless… and doomed unless you save him Today was a near thing They had hoped to kill him during the melee

For a moment Ned was speechless with shock Who

Varys sipped his wine If I truly need to tell you that you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the wrong side

The Lannisters Ned said The queen… no I will not believe that not even of Cersei She asked him not to fight

She forbade him to fight in front of his brother his knights and half the court Tell me truly do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee I ask you

Ned had a sick feeling in his gut The eunuch had hit upon a truth tell Robert Baratheon he could not should not or must not do a thing and it was as good as done Even if he’d fought who would have dared to strike the king

Varys shrugged There were forty riders in the melee The Lannisters have many friends Amidst all that chaos with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace He went to the flagon and refilled his cup After the deed was done the slayer would be beside himself with grief I can almost hear him weeping So sad Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity lift the poor unfortunate to his feet and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him The eunuch stroked his cheek Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head Less risk for the Lannisters that way though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend

Ned felt his anger rise You knew of this plot and yet you did nothing

I command whisperers not warriors

You might have come to me earlier

Oh yes I confess it And you would have rushed straight to the king yes And when Robert heard of his peril what would he have done I wonder

Ned considered that He would have damned them all and fought anyway to show he did not fear them

Varys spread his hands I will make another confession Lord Eddard I was curious to see what you would do Why not come to me you ask and I must answer Why because I did not trust you my lord

You did not trust me Ned was frankly astonished

The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people Lord Eddard Varys said Those who are loyal to the realm and those who are loyal only to themselves Until this morning I could not say which you might be… so I waited to see… and now I know for a certainty He smiled a plump tight little smile and for a moment his private face and public mask were one I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much Oh yes I do

You are the one she ought to fear Ned said

No I am what I am The king makes use of me but it shames him A most puissant warrior is our Robert and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs If a day should come when Cersei whispers ‘Kill that man’ Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling and who will mourn poor Varys then North or south they sing no songs for spiders He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand But you Lord Stark… I think… no I know… he would not kill you not even for his queen and there may lie our salvation

It was all too much For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell to the clean simplicity of the north where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall Surely Robert has other loyal friends he protested His brothers his—

—wife Varys finished with a smile that cut His brothers hate the Lannisters true enough but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing are they Ser Barristan loves his honor Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger

The Kingsguard—

A paper shield the eunuch said Try not to look so shocked Lord Stark Jaime Lannister is himself a Sworn Brother of the White Swords and we all know what his oath is worth The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song Of these seven only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel and Selmy is old Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen’s creatures to the bone and I have deep suspicions of the others No my lord when the swords come out in earnest you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have
