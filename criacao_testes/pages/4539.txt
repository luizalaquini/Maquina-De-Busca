She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him

Do you know anything of my uncle Benjen Stark

Ygritte ignored him Stonesnake laughed If she spits out her tongue don’t say I didn’t warn you

A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock Shadowcat Jon knew at once As he rose he heard another closer at hand He pulled his sword and turned listening

They won’t trouble us Ygritte said It’s the dead they’ve come for Cats can smell blood six miles off They’ll stay near the bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ meat and cracked the bones for the marrow

Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks It gave him an uneasy feeling The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was but he dared not sleep He had taken a captive and it was on him to guard her Were they your kin he asked her quietly The two we killed

No more than you are

Me He frowned What do you mean

You said you were the Bastard o’ Winterfell

I am

Who was your mother

Some woman Most of them are Someone had said that to him once He did not remember who

She smiled again a flash of white teeth And she never sung you the song o’ the winter rose

I never knew my mother Or any such song

Bael the Bard made it said Ygritte He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back All the free folk know his songs but might be you don’t sing them in the south

Winterfell’s not in the south Jon objected

Yes it is Everything below the Wall’s south to us

He had never thought of it that way I suppose it’s all in where you’re standing

Aye Ygritte agreed It always is

Tell me Jon urged her It would be hours before Qhorin came up and a story would help keep him awake I want to hear this tale of yours

Might be you won’t like it much

I’ll hear it all the same

Brave black crow she mocked Well long before he was king over the free folk Bael was a great raider

Stonesnake gave a snort A murderer robber and raper is what you mean

That’s all in where you’re standing too Ygritte said The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael’s head but never could take him and the taste o’ failure galled him One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak When word o’ that got back Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson So he scaled the Wall skipped down the kingsroad and walked into Winterfell one winter’s night with harp in hand naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos Sygerrik means ‘deceiver’ in the Old Tongue that the First Men spoke and the giants still speak

North or south singers always find a ready welcome so Bael ate at Lord Stark’s own table and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone The old songs he played and new ones he’d made himself and he played and sang so well that when he was done the lord offered to let him name his own reward ‘All I ask is a flower’ Bael answered ‘the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o’ Winterfell’

Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom and no flower is so rare nor precious So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o’ the winter roses be plucked for the singer’s payment And so it was done But when morning come the singer had vanished    and so had Lord Brandon’s maiden daughter Her bed they found empty but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain

Jon had never heard this tale before Which Brandon was this supposed to be Brandon the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes thousands of years before Bael There was Brandon the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright but—

This was Brandon the Daughterless Ygritte said sharply Would you hear the tale or no

He scowled Go on

Lord Brandon had no other children At his behest the black crows flew forth from their castles in the hundreds but nowhere could they find any sign o’ Bael or this maid For most a year they searched till the lord lost heart and took to his bed and it seemed as though the line o’ Starks was at its end But one night as he lay waiting to die Lord Brandon heard a child’s cry He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber asleep with a babe at her breast

Bael had brought her back

No They had been in Winterfell all the time hiding with the dead beneath the castle The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son the song says    though if truth be told all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote Be that as it may what’s certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose he’d plucked unasked and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark So there it is—you have Bael’s blood in you same as me

It never happened Jon said

She shrugged Might be it did might be it didn’t It is a good song though My mother used to sing it to me She was a woman too Jon Snow Like yours She rubbed her throat where his dirk had cut her The song ends when they find the babe but there is a darker end to the story Thirty years later when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford    and killed him for Bael would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword

So the son slew the father instead said Jon

Aye she said but the gods hate kinslayers even when they kill unknowing When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael’s head upon his spear she threw herself from a tower in her grief Her son did not long outlive her One o’ his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak

Your Bael was a liar he told her certain now

No Ygritte said but a bard’s truth is different than yours or mine Anyway you asked for the story so I told it She turned away from him closed her eyes and seemed to sleep

Dawn and Qhorin Halfhand arrived together The black stones had turned to grey and the eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below wending their way upward Jon woke his captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet them Thankfully there was another way off the mountain to the north and west along paths much gentler than the one that had brought them up here They were waiting in a narrow defile when their brothers appeared leading their garrons Ghost raced ahead at first scent of them Jon squatted to let the direwolf close his jaws around his wrist tugging his hand back and forth It was a game they played But when he glanced up he saw Ygritte watching with eyes as wide and white as hen’s eggs

Qhorin Halfhand made no comment when he saw the prisoner There were three Stonesnake told him No more than that

We passed two Ebben said or what the cats had left of them He eyed the girl sourly suspicion plain on his face

She yielded Jon felt compelled to say

Qhorin’s face was impassive Do you know who I am

Qhorin Halfhand The girl looked half a child beside him but she faced him boldly

Tell me true If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself what would it win me

A slower death than elsewise

The big ranger looked to Jon We have no food to feed her nor can we spare a man to watch her

The way before us is perilous enough lad said Squire Dalbridge One shout when we need silence and every man of us is doomed

Ebben drew his dagger A steel kiss will keep her quiet
