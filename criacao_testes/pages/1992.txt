process is relatively easy
A phonetic transcription of each morph may be stored in the morph dictionary
or else letter-to-sound rules can be used on individual morphs
These are likely to be quite successful because final-e processing can be
now be done with confidence  there are no hidden final es in the middle
of morphs
In either case the resulting phonetic transcriptions of the individual morphs
must be concatenated to give the transcription of the complete word
Although some contextual modification has to be accounted for
it is relatively straightforward and easy to predict
For example the plural morphs -s and -es can be realized phonetically
by
ul
uh z
ul
s
or
ul
z
depending on context
Similarly the past-tense suffix -ed may be rendered as
ul
uh d
ul
t
or
ul
d
The suffixes -ion and -ure sometimes cause modification of the previous
morph  for example
LB
NI
act + ion  em  c
ul
a k tc
  + ion  em  c
ul
a k sh uh n
LE

The morph dictionary does not remove the need for a lexicon of exceptional
words
The irregular final-e words mentioned earlier done anemone fete
need to be treated on an individual basis
as do words such as quadruped which have misleading endings
it should not be decomposed as quadrup|ed
rh Pronunciation of languages other than English
Text-to-speech systems for other languages have been reported in

Generally speaking these present fewer difficulties than does English
Esperanto is particularly easy because each letter in its orthography
has only one sound making the pronunciation problem trivial
Moreover stress in polysyllabic words always occurs on the penultimate
syllable

It is tempting and often sensible when designing a synthesis system for
English to use an utterance representation somewhere between phonetics and
ordinary spelling
This may happen in practice even if it is not intended  a user finding
that a given word is pronounced incorrectly will alter the spelling to
make it work
The Word English Spelling alphabet Dewey 1971 amongst others Haas 1966
is a simplified and apparently natural scheme which was developed by the
spelling reform movement

It maps very simply on to a phonetic representation just like Esperanto
However it can provide little help with the crucial problem of stress
assignment except perhaps by explicitly indicating reduced vowels

This chapter has really only touched the tip of a linguistic iceberg
I have given some examples of representations rules algorithms
and exceptions to make the concepts more tangible but a whole mass of
