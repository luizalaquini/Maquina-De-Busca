1819 Now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto mount
Carmel and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty and the
prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at Jezebels table

1820 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the
prophets together unto mount Carmel

1821 And Elijah came unto all the people and said How long halt ye
between two opinions if the LORD be God follow him but if Baal
then follow him And the people answered him not a word

1822 Then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a
prophet of the LORD but Baals prophets are four hundred and fifty
men

1823 Let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one
bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and
put no fire under and I will dress the other bullock and lay it on
wood and put no fire under 1824 And call ye on the name of your
gods and I will call on the name of the LORD and the God that
answereth by fire let him be God And all the people answered and
said It is well spoken

1825 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal Choose you one
bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call
on the name of your gods but put no fire under

1826 And they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed
it and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon
saying O Baal hear us But there was no voice nor any that
answered And they leaped upon the altar which was made

1827 And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said
Cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing
or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be
awaked

1828 And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with
knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them

1829 And it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied
until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there
was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded

1830 And Elijah said unto all the people Come near unto me And all
the people came near unto him And he repaired the altar of the LORD
that was broken down

1831 And Elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the
tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the LORD came
saying Israel shall be thy name 1832 And with the stones he built
an altar in the name of the LORD and he made a trench about the
altar as great as would contain two measures of seed

1833 And he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and
laid him on the wood and said Fill four barrels with water and pour
it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood

1834 And he said Do it the second time And they did it the second
time

And he said Do it the third time And they did it the third time

1835 And the water ran round about the altar and he filled the
trench also with water

1836 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said LORD God of
Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all
these things at thy word

1837 Hear me O LORD hear me that this people may know that thou
art the LORD God and that thou hast turned their heart back again

1838 Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt
sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up
the water that was in the trench

1839 And when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and
they said The LORD he is the God the LORD he is the God

1840 And Elijah said unto them Take the prophets of Baal let not
one of them escape And they took them and Elijah brought them down
to the brook Kishon and slew them there

1841 And Elijah said unto Ahab Get thee up eat and drink for there
is a sound of abundance of rain

1842 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink And Elijah went up to the
top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his
face between his knees 1843 And said to his servant Go up now look
toward the sea And he went up and looked and said There is
nothing And he said Go again seven times

1844 And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said Behold
there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand And he
said Go up say unto Ahab Prepare thy chariot and get thee down
that the rain stop thee not
