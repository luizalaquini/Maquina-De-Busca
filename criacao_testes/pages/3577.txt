The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs and the castle seemed one with the rest its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone wet by the same salt waves festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered thousands of years past All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god’s temple while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them

Drear dark forbidding Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars almost a part of them its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep each on its own island Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not

The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword the oldest part of the castle round and tall the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire

Above the Sea Tower snapped his father’s banner The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself but he knew the device it bore the golden kraken of House Greyjoy arms writhing and reaching against a black field The banner streamed from an iron mast shivering and twisting as the wind gusted like a bird struggling to take flight And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above casting its shadow down upon the Greyjoy kraken

Theon had never seen a more stirring sight In the sky behind the castle the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin scuttling clouds All the way from Riverrun to Seagard the Mallisters had argued about its meaning It is my comet Theon told himself sliding a hand into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given him paper as good as a crown

Does the castle look as you remember it milord the captain’s daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm

It looks smaller Theon confessed though perhaps that is only the distance The Myraham was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver so he stayed well out farther than Theon would have liked An ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the Great Keep but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft the crew nor the courage to attempt such a thing So they sailed past at a safe distance and Theon must content himself with seeing Pyke from afar Even so the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks

It must be windy there the captain’s daughter observed

He laughed Windy and cold and damp A miserable hard place in truth… but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men and hard men rule the world

The captain’s face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked May we make for port now milord

You may Theon said a faint smile playing about his lips The promise of gold had turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he’d hoped Ironborn captains were proud and willful and did not go in awe of a man’s blood The islands were too small for awe and a longship smaller still If every captain was a king aboard his own ship as was often said it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings And when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods The Drowned God makes men old King Urron Redhand had once said thousands of years ago but it’s men who make crowns

A longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well The Myraham was a wallowing tub if truth be told and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm Still Theon could not be too unhappy He was here undrowned and the voyage had offered certain other amusements He put an arm around the captain’s daughter Summon me when we make Lordsport he told her father We’ll be below in my cabin He led the girl away aft while her father watched them go in sullen silence

The cabin was the captain’s in truth but it had been turned over to Theon’s use when they sailed from Seagard The captain’s daughter had not been turned over to his use but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same A cup of wine a few whispers and there she was The girl was a shade plump for his taste with skin as splotchy as oatmeal but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her That was surprising at her age but Theon found it diverting He did not think the captain approved and that was amusing as well watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord the rich purse of gold he’d been promised never far from his thoughts

As Theon shrugged out of his wet cloak the girl said You must be so happy to see your home again milord How many years have you been away 

Ten or close as makes no matter he told her I was a boy of ten when I was taken to Winterfell as a ward of Eddard Stark A ward in name a hostage in truth Half his days a hostage… but no longer His life was his own again and nowhere a Stark to be seen He drew the captain’s daughter close and kissed her on her ear Take off your cloak

She dropped her eyes suddenly shy but did as he bid her When the heavy garment sodden with spray fell from her shoulders to the deck she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously She looked rather stupid when she smiled but he had never required a woman to be clever Come here he told her

She did I have never seen the Iron Islands

Count yourself fortunate Theon stroked her hair it was fine and dark though the wind had made a tangle of it The islands are stern and stony places scant of comfort and bleak of prospect Death is never far here and life is mean and meager Men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil If truth be told the miners have it worse than either breaking their backs down in the dark and for what Iron lead tin those are our treasures Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding

The stupid girl did not seem to be listening I could go ashore with you she said I would if it please you…

You could go ashore Theon agreed squeezing her breast but not with me I fear

I’d work in your castle milord I can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter Father says my peppercrab stew is the best he’s ever tasted You could find me a place in your kitchens and I could make you peppercrab stew

And warm my bed by night He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo them his fingers deft and practiced Once I might have carried you home as a prize and kept you to wife whether you willed it or no The ironmen of old did such things A man had his rock wife his true bride ironborn like himself but he had his salt wives too women captured on raids

The girl’s eyes grew wide and not because he had bared her breasts I would be your salt wife milord

I fear those days are gone Theon’s finger circled one heavy teat spiraling in toward the fat brown nipple No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword taking what we want Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter He took her nipple in his mouth and bit it until she gasped

You can put it in me again if it please you she whispered in his ear as he sucked

When he raised his head from her breast the skin was dark red where his mouth had marked her It would please me to teach you something new Unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth

With my mouth

His thumb brushed lightly over her full lips It’s what those lips were made for sweetling If you were my salt wife you’d do as I command

She was timid at first but learned quickly for such a stupid girl which pleased him Her mouth was as wet and sweet as her cunt and this way he did not have to listen to her mindless prattle Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair Once When we still kept the Old Way lived by the axe instead of the pick taking what we would be it wealth women or glory In those days the ironborn did not work mines that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep War was an ironman’s proper trade The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song

Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren gave Harren’s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands even behind the high stone halls of Pyke Theon’s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow

It had been to bring back the Old Way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that Lord Balon had staged his great rebellion Robert Baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope with the help of his friend Eddard Stark but both men were dead now Mere boys ruled in their stead and the realm that Aegon the Conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered This is the season Theon thought as the captain’s daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him the season the year the day and I am the man He smiled crookedly wondering what his father would say when Theon told him that he the last-born babe and hostage he had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed

His climax came on him sudden as a storm and he filled the girl’s mouth with his seed Startled she tried to pull away but Theon held her tight by the hair Afterward she crawled up beside him Did I please milord

Well enough he told her

It tasted salty she murmured

Like the sea

She nodded I have always loved the sea milord

As I have he said rolling her nipple idly between his fingers It was true The sea meant freedom to the men of the Iron Islands He had forgotten that until the Myraham had raised sail at Seagard The sounds brought old feelings back the creak of wood and rope the captain’s shouted commands the snap of the sails as the wind filled them each as familiar as the beating of his own heart and as comforting I must remember this Theon vowed to himself I must never go far from the sea again

Take me with you milord the captain’s daughter begged I don’t need to go to your castle I can stay in some town and be your salt wife She reached out to stroke his cheek

Theon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk My place is Pyke and yours is on this ship

I can’t stay here now

He laced up his breeches Why not

My father she told him Once you’re gone he’ll punish me milord He’ll call me names and hit me

Theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders Fathers are like that he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp Tell him he should be pleased As many times as I’ve fucked you you’re likely with child It’s not every man who has the honor of raising a king’s bastard She looked at him stupidly so he left her there

The Myraham was rounding a wooded point Below the pine-clad bluffs a dozen fishing boats were pulling in their nets The big cog stayed well out from them tacking Theon moved to the bow for a better view He saw the castle first the stronghold of the Botleys When he was a boy it had been timber and wattle but Robert Baratheon had razed that structure to the ground Lord Sawane had rebuilt in stone for now a small square keep crowned the hill Pale green flags drooped from the squat corner towers each emblazoned with a shoal of silvery fish

Beneath the dubious protection of the fish-ridden little castle lay the village of Lordsport its harbor aswarm with ships When last he’d seen Lordsport it had been a smoking wasteland the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes After ten years few traces of the war remained The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old and cut fresh sod for their roofs A new inn had risen beside the landing twice the size of the old one with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber The sept beyond had never been rebuilt though only a seven-sided foundation remained where it had stood Robert Baratheon’s fury had soured the ironmen’s taste for the new gods it would seem

Theon was more interested in ships than gods Among the masts of countless fishing boats he spied a Tyroshi trading galley off-loading beside a lumbering Ibbenese cog with her black-tarred hull A great number of longships fifty or sixty at the least stood out to sea or lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north Some of the sails bore devices from the other islands the blood moon of Wynch Lord Goodbrother’s banded black warhorn Harlaw’s silver scythe Theon searched for his uncle Euron’s Silence Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign but his father’s Great Kraken was there her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake

Had Lord Balon anticipated him and called the Greyjoy banners His hand went inside his cloak again to the oilskin pouch No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark they were no fools to entrust their secrets to a bird Still Lord Balon was no fool either He might well have guessed why his son was coming home at long last and acted accordingly

The thought did not please him His father’s war was long done and lost This was Theon’s hour—his plan his glory and in time his crown Yet if the longships are hosting…

It might be only a caution now that he thought on it A defensive move lest the war spill out across the sea Old men were cautious by nature His father was old now and so too his uncle Victarion who commanded the Iron Fleet His uncle Euron was a different song to be sure but the Silence did not seem to be in port It’s all for the good Theon told himself This way I shall be able to strike all the more quickly

As the Myraham made her way landward Theon paced the deck restlessly scanning the shore He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside but surely his father would have sent someone to meet him Sylas Sourmouth the steward Lord Botley perhaps even Dagmer Cleftjaw It would be good to look on Dagmer’s hideous old face again It was not as though they had no word of his arrival Robb had sent ravens from Riverrun and when they’d found no longship at Seagard Jason Mallister had sent his own birds to Pyke supposing that Robb’s were lost
