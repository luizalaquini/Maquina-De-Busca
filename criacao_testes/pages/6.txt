821 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour and the LORD said in his
heart I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for
the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will I
again smite any more every thing living as I have done

822 While the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and
heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease

91 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them Be
fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth

92 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth
upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are
they delivered

93 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the
green herb have I given you all things

94 But flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall
ye not eat

95 And surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of
every beast will I require it and at the hand of man at the hand of
every mans brother will I require the life of man

96 Whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in
the image of God made he man

97 And you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in
the earth and multiply therein

98 And God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying 99 And
I behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after
you 910 And with every living creature that is with you of the
fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from
all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth

911 And I will establish my covenant with you neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth

912 And God said This is the token of the covenant which I make
between me and you and every living creature that is with you for
perpetual generations 913 I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall
be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth

914 And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud 915 And I will remember my
covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all
flesh

916 And the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it that
I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth

917 And God said unto Noah This is the token of the covenant which
I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth

918 And the sons of Noah that went forth of the ark were Shem and
Ham and Japheth and Ham is the father of Canaan

919 These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole earth
overspread

920 And Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
921 And he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered
within his tent

922 And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father
and told his two brethren without

923 And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their
father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers
nakedness

924 And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had
done unto him

925 And he said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren

926 And he said Blessed be the LORD God of Shem and Canaan shall be
his servant

927 God shall enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem and Canaan shall be his servant

928 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years

929 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years and
he died

101 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and
Japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood

102 The sons of Japheth Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and
Tubal and Meshech and Tiras
