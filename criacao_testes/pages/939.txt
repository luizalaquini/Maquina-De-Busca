The skinchanger was grey-faced round-shouldered and bald a mouse of a man with a wolfling’s eyes Once a horse is broken to the saddle any man can mount him he said in a soft voice Once a beast’s been joined to a man any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him Orell was withering inside his feathers so I took the eagle for my own But the joining works both ways warg Orell lives inside me now whispering how much he hates you And I can soar above the Wall and see with eagle eyes

So we know said Mance We know how few you were when you stopped the turtle We know how many came from Eastwatch We know how your supplies have dwindled Pitch oil arrows spears Even your stair is gone and that cage can only lift so many We know And now you know we know He opened the flap of the tent Come inside The rest of you wait here

What even me said Tormund

Particularly you Always

It was warm within A small fire burned beneath the smoke holes and a brazier smouldered near the pile of furs where Dalla lay pale and sweating Her sister was holding her hand Val Jon remembered I was sorry when Jarl fell he told her

Val looked at him with pale grey eyes He always climbed too fast She was as fair as he’d remembered slender full-breasted graceful even at rest with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid of honey-colored hair that fell to her waist

Dalla’s time is near Mance explained She and Val will stay They know what I mean to say

Jon kept his face as still as ice Foul enough to slay a man in his own tent under truce Must I murder him in front of his wife as their child is being born He closed the fingers of his sword hand Mance was not wearing armor but his own sword was sheathed on his left hip And there were other weapons in the tent daggers and dirks a bow and a quiver of arrows a bronze-headed spear lying beside that big black…

…horn

Jon sucked in his breath

A warhorn a bloody great warhorn

Yes Mance said The Horn of Winter that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth

The horn was huge eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm inside up to the elbow If this came from an aurochs it was the biggest that ever lived At first he thought the bands around it were bronze but when he moved closer he realized they were gold Old gold more brown than yellow and graven with runes

Ygritte said you never found the horn

Did you think only crows could lie I liked you well enough for a bastard… but I never trusted you A man needs to earn my trust

Jon faced him If you’ve had the Horn of Joramun all along why haven’t you used it Why bother building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in our beds If this horn is all the songs say why not just sound it and be done

It was Dalla who answered him Dalla great with child lying on her pile of furs beside the brazier We free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten Sometimes the short road is not the safest Jon Snow The Horned Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt There is no safe way to grasp it

Mance ran a hand along the curve of the great horn No man goes hunting with only one arrow in his quiver he said I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares and open the gate for us I drew your garrison away with feints and raids and secondary attacks Bowen Marsh swallowed that lure as I knew he would but your band of cripples and orphans proved to be more stubborn than anticipated Don’t think you’ve stopped us though The truth is you are too few and we are too many I could continue the attack here and still send ten thousand men to cross the Bay of Seals on rafts and take Eastwatch from the rear I could storm the Shadow Tower too I know the approaches as well as any man alive I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles you’ve abandoned all of them at once

Why don’t you then Jon could have drawn Longclaw then but he wanted to hear what the wildling had to say

Blood said Mance Rayder I’d win in the end yes but you’d bleed me and my people have bled enough

Your losses haven’t been that heavy

Not at your hands Mance studied Jon’s face You saw the Fist of the First Men You know what happened there You know what we are facing

The Others…

They grow stronger as the days grow shorter and the nights colder First they kill you then they send your dead against you The giants have not been able to stand against them nor the Thenns the ice river clans the Hornfoots

Nor you

Nor me There was anger in that admission and bitterness too deep for words Raymun Redbeard Bael the Bard Gendel and Gorne the Horned Lord they all came south to conquer but I’ve come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall He touched the horn Again If I sound the Horn of Winter the Wall will fall Or so the songs would have me believe There are those among my people who want nothing more…

But once the Wall is fallen Dalla said what will stop the Others
