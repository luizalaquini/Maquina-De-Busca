would not hearken unto her

1317 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said
Put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her

1318 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such
robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled Then his
servant brought her out and bolted the door after her

1319 And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers
colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on
crying

1320 And Absalom her brother said unto her Hath Amnon thy brother
been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother
regard not this thing So Tamar remained desolate in her brother
Absaloms house

1321 But when king David heard of all these things he was very
wroth

1322 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad
for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister Tamar

1323 And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had
sheepshearers in Baalhazor which is beside Ephraim and Absalom
invited all the kings sons

1324 And Absalom came to the king and said Behold now thy servant
hath sheepshearers let the king I beseech thee and his servants go
with thy servant

1325 And the king said to Absalom Nay my son let us not all now
go lest we be chargeable unto thee And he pressed him howbeit he
would not go but blessed him

1326 Then said Absalom If not I pray thee let my brother Amnon go
with us And the king said unto him Why should he go with thee
1327 But Absalom pressed him that he let Amnon and all the kings
sons go with him

1328 Now Absalom had commanded his servants saying Mark ye now when
Amnons heart is merry with wine and when I say unto you Smite
Amnon then kill him fear not have not I commanded you be
courageous and be valiant

1329 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
commanded

Then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his
mule and fled

1330 And it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings
came to David saying Absalom hath slain all the kings sons and
there is not one of them left

1331 Then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the
earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent

1332 And Jonadab the son of Shimeah Davids brother answered and
said Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men
the kings sons for Amnon only is dead for by the appointment of
Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his
sister Tamar

1333 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for Amnon only is
dead

1334 But Absalom fled And the young man that kept the watch lifted
up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the
way of the hill side behind him

1335 And Jonadab said unto the king Behold the kings sons come as
thy servant said so it is

1336 And it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking
that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and
wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore

1337 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud king
of Geshur And David mourned for his son every day

1338 So Absalom fled and went to Geshur and was there three years

1339 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom for
he was comforted concerning Amnon seeing he was dead

141 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was
toward Absalom

142 And Joab sent to Tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and
said unto her I pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on
now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead 143 And come to the
king and speak on this manner unto him So Joab put the words in her
mouth

144 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king she fell on her
face to the ground and did obeisance and said Help O king
