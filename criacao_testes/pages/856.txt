But there are wildlings They killed some man and they wanted to kill Jon too Jojen there were a hundred of them

So you said We are four You helped your brother if that was him in truth but it almost cost you Summer

I know said Bran miserably The direwolf had killed three of them maybe more but there had been too many When they formed a tight ring around the tall earless man he had tried to slip away through the rain but one of their arrows had come flashing after him and the sudden stab of pain had driven Bran out of the wolf’s skin and back into his own After the storm finally died they had huddled in the dark without a fire talking in whispers if they talked at all listening to Hodor’s heavy breathing and wondering if the wildlings might try and cross the lake in the morning Bran had reached out for Summer time and time again but the pain he found drove him back the way a red-hot kettle makes you pull your hand back even when you mean to grab it Only Hodor slept that night muttering Hodor hodor as he tossed and turned Bran was terrified that Summer was off dying in the darkness Please you old gods he prayed you took Winterfell and my father and my legs please don’t take Summer too And watch over Jon Snow too and make the wildlings go away

No weirwoods grew on that stony island in the lake yet somehow the old gods must have heard The wildlings took their sweet time about departing the next morning stripping the bodies of their dead and the old man they’d killed even pulling a few fish from the lake and there was a scary moment when three of them found the causeway and started to walk out… but the path turned and they didn’t and two of them nearly drowned before the others pulled them out The tall bald man yelled at them his words echoing across the water in some tongue that even Jojen did not know and a little while later they gathered up their shields and spears and marched off north by east the same way Jon had gone Bran wanted to leave too to look for Summer but the Reeds said no We will stay another night said Jojen put some leagues between us and the wildlings You don’t want to meet them again do you Late that afternoon Summer returned from wherever he’d been hiding dragging his back leg He ate parts of the bodies in the inn driving off the crows then swam out to the island Meera had drawn the broken arrow from his leg and rubbed the wound with the juice of some plants she found growing around the base of the tower The direwolf was still limping but a little less each day it seemed to Bran The gods had heard

Maybe we should try another castle Meera said to her brother Maybe we could get through the gate somewhere else I could go scout if you wanted I’d make better time by myself

Bran shook his head If you go east there’s Deep Lake then Queensgate West is Icemark But they’ll be the same only smaller All the gates are sealed except the ones at Castle Black Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower

Hodor said Hodor to that and the Reeds exchanged a look At least I should climb to the top of the Wall Meera decided Maybe I’ll see something up there

What could you hope to see Jojen asked

Something said Meera and for once she was adamant

It should be me Bran raised his head to look up at the Wall and imagined himself climbing inch by inch squirming his fingers into cracks in the ice and kicking footholds with his toes That made him smile in spite of everything the dreams and the wildlings and Jon and everything He had climbed the walls of Winterfell when he was little and all the towers too but none of them had been so high and they were only stone The Wall could look like stone all grey and pitted but then the clouds would break and the sun would hit it differently and all at once it would transform and stand there white and blue and glittering It was the end of the world Old Nan always said On the other side were monsters and giants and ghouls but they could not pass so long as the Wall stood strong I want to stand on top with Meera Bran thought I want to stand on top and see

But he was a broken boy with useless legs so all he could do was watch from below as Meera went up in his stead

She wasn’t really climbing the way he used to climb She was only walking up some steps that the Night’s Watch had hewn hundreds and thousands of years ago He remembered Maester Luwin saying the Nightfort was the only castle where the steps had been cut from the ice of the Wall itself Or maybe it had been Uncle Benjen The newer castles had wooden steps or stone ones or long ramps of earth and gravel Ice is too treacherous It was his uncle who’d told him that He said that the outer surface of the Wall wept icy tears sometimes though the core inside stayed frozen hard as rock The steps must have melted and refrozen a thousand times since the last black brothers left the castle and every time they did they shrunk a little and got smoother and rounder and more treacherous

And smaller It’s almost like the Wall was swallowing them back into itself Meera Reed was very surefooted but even so she was going slowly moving from nub to nub In two places where the steps were hardly there at all she got down on all fours It will be worse when she comes down Bran thought watching Even so he wished it was him up there When she reached the top crawling up the icy knobs that were all that remained of the highest steps Meera vanished from his sight

When will she come down Bran asked Jojen

When she is ready She will want to have a good look… at the Wall and what’s beyond We should do the same down here

Hodor said Hodor doubtfully

We might find something Jojen insisted

Or something might find us Bran couldn’t say it though he did not want Jojen to think he was craven

So they went exploring Jojen Reed leading Bran in his basket on Hodor’s back Summer padding by their side Once the direwolf bolted through a dark door and returned a moment later with a grey rat between his teeth The Rat Cook Bran thought but it was the wrong color and only as big as a cat The Rat Cook was white and almost as huge as a sow…

There were a lot of dark doors in the Nightfort and a lot of rats Bran could hear them scurrying through the vaults and cellars and the maze of pitch-black tunnels that connected them Jojen wanted to go poking around down there but Hodor said Hodor to that and Bran said No There were worse things than rats down in the dark beneath the Nightfort

This seems an old place Jojen said as they walked down a gallery where the sunlight fell in dusty shafts through empty windows

Twice as old as Castle Black Bran said remembering It was the first castle on the Wall and the largest But it had also been the first abandoned all the way back in the time of the Old King Even then it had been three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain Good Queen Alysanne had suggested that the Watch replace it with a smaller newer castle at a spot only seven miles east where the Wall curved along the shore of a beautiful green lake Deep Lake had been paid for by the queen’s jewels and built by the men the Old King had sent north and the black brothers had abandoned the Nightfort to the rats

That was two centuries past though Now Deep Lake stood as empty as the castle it had replaced and the Nightfort…

There are ghosts here Bran said Hodor had heard all the stories before but Jojen might not have Old ghosts from before the Old King even before Aegon the Dragon seventy-nine deserters who went south to be outlaws One was Lord Ryswell’s youngest son so when they reached the barrowlands they sought shelter at his castle but Lord Ryswell took them captive and returned them to the Nightfort The Lord Commander had holes hewn in the top of the Wall and he put the deserters in them and sealed them up alive in the ice They have spears and horns and they all face north The seventy-nine sentinels they’re called They left their posts in life so in death their watch goes on forever Years later when Lord Ryswell was old and dying he had himself carried to the Nightfort so he could take the black and stand beside his son He’d sent him back to the Wall for honor’s sake but he loved him still so he came to share his watch

They spent half the day poking through the castle Some of the towers had fallen down and others looked unsafe but they climbed the bell tower the bells were gone and the rookery the birds were gone Beneath the brewhouse they found a vault of huge oaken casks that boomed hollowly when Hodor knocked on them They found a library the shelves and bins had collapsed the books were gone and rats were everywhere They found a dank and dim-lit dungeon with cells enough to hold five hundred captives but when Bran grabbed hold of one of the rusted bars it broke off in his hand Only one crumbling wall remained of the great hall the bathhouse seemed to be sinking into the ground and a huge thornbush had conquered the practice yard outside the armory where black brothers had once labored with spear and shield and sword The armory and the forge still stood however though cobwebs rats and dust had taken the places of blades bellows and anvil Sometimes Summer would hear sounds that Bran seemed deaf to or bare his teeth at nothing the fur on the back of his neck bristling… but the Rat Cook never put in an appearance nor the seventy-nine sentinels nor Mad Axe Bran was much relieved Maybe it is only a ruined empty castle

By the time Meera returned the sun was only a sword’s breath above the western hills What did you see her brother Jojen asked her

I saw the haunted forest she said in a wistful tone Hills rising wild as far as the eye can see covered with trees that no axe has ever touched I saw the sunlight glinting off a lake and clouds sweeping in from the west I saw patches of old snow and icicles long as pikes I even saw an eagle circling I think he saw me too I waved at him
