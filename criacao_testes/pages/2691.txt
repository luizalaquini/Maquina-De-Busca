the prophet and Benaiah and the mighty men and Solomon his brother
he called not

111 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon
saying Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
reign and David our lord knoweth it not  112 Now therefore come
let me I pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine
own life and the life of thy son Solomon

113 Go and get thee in unto king David and say unto him Didst not
thou my lord O king swear unto thine handmaid saying Assuredly
Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
why then doth Adonijah reign  114 Behold while thou yet talkest
there with the king I also will come in after thee and confirm thy
words

115 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the
king was very old and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the
king

116 And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king And the
king said What wouldest thou  117 And she said unto him My lord
thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid saying
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon
my throne

118 And now behold Adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king
thou knowest it not 119 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and
Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host but Solomon thy
servant hath he not called

120 And thou my lord O king the eyes of all Israel are upon thee
that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord
the king after him

121 Otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall
sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted
offenders

122 And lo while she yet talked with the king Nathan the prophet
also came in

123 And they told the king saying Behold Nathan the prophet And
when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king
with his face to the ground

124 And Nathan said My lord O king hast thou said Adonijah shall
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne  125 For he is gone
down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of
the host and Abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink
before him and say God save king Adonijah

126 But me even me thy servant and Zadok the priest and Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada and thy servant Solomon hath he not called

127 Is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king
after him  128 Then king David answered and said Call me Bathsheba
And she came into the kings presence and stood before the king

129 And the king sware and said As the LORD liveth that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress 130 Even as I sware unto thee
by the LORD God of Israel saying Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so
will I certainly do this day

131 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did
reverence to the king and said Let my lord king David live for ever

132 And king David said Call me Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada And they came before the
king

133 The king also said unto them Take with you the servants of your
lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring
him down to Gihon 134 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet anoint him there king over Israel and blow ye with the
trumpet and say God save king Solomon

135 Then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my
throne for he shall be king in my stead and I have appointed him to
be ruler over Israel and over Judah

136 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said
Amen the LORD God of my lord the king say so too

137 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king even so be he with
Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
David

138 So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and
caused Solomon to ride upon king Davids mule and brought him to
Gihon

139 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle
and anointed Solomon And they blew the trumpet and all the people
said God save king Solomon
