all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us
round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name  710 And the LORD said unto Joshua Get thee up
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face  711 Israel hath sinned and
they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them for
they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and
dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff

712 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they
were accursed neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy
the accursed from among you

713 Up sanctify the people and say Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow for thus saith the LORD God of Israel There is an accursed
thing in the midst of thee O Israel thou canst not stand before
thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you

714 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall
come according to the families thereof and the family which the LORD
shall take shall come by households and the household which the LORD
shall take shall come man by man

715 And it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing
shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he hath wrought
folly in Israel

716 So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by
their tribes and the tribe of Judah was taken 717 And he brought
the family of Judah and he took the family of the Zarhites and he
brought the family of the Zarhites man by man and Zabdi was taken
718 And he brought his household man by man and Achan the son of
Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah was
taken

719 And Joshua said unto Achan My son give I pray thee glory to
the LORD God of Israel and make confession unto him and tell me now
what thou hast done hide it not from me

720 And Achan answered Joshua and said Indeed I have sinned against
the LORD God of Israel and thus and thus have I done 721 When I saw
among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels
of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then I coveted
them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the
midst of my tent and the silver under it

722 So Joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and
behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it

723 And they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them
unto Joshua and unto all the children of Israel and laid them out
before the LORD

724 And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah
and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons
and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his
tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of
Achor

725 And Joshua said Why hast thou troubled us the LORD shall
trouble thee this day And all Israel stoned him with stones and
burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones

726 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day So
the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger Wherefore the name
of that place was called The valley of Achor unto this day

81 And the LORD said unto Joshua Fear not neither be thou dismayed
take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to Ai see I
have given into thy hand the king of Ai and his people and his city
and his land 82 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst
unto Jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle
thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush
for the city behind it

83 So Joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against Ai
and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent
them away by night

84 And he commanded them saying Behold ye shall lie in wait
against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city
but be ye all ready 85 And I and all the people that are with me
will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come
out against us as at the first that we will flee before them 86
For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the
city for they will say They flee before us as at the first
therefore we will flee before them

87 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city
for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand

88 And it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set
the city on fire according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye
do See I have commanded you

89 Joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush
and abode between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai but Joshua
lodged that night among the people
