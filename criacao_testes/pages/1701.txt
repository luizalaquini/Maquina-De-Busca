more -- his head was upon her lap his face and neck
were disagreeably wet and her fingers were unbuttoning
his collar
Whatever is the matter said Oak vacantly
She seemed to experience mirth but of too insignifi+
cant a kind to start enjoyment
Nothing now she answered since you are not
dead It is a wonder you were notsuffocated in this
hut of yours
Ah the hut   murmured Gabriel I gave ten
pounds for that hut But Ill sell it and sit under
thatched hurdles as they did in old times curl up
to sleep in a lock of straw It played me nearly the
same trick the other day   Gabriel by way of emphasis
brought down his fist upon the floor
It was not exactly the fault of the hut she ob+
served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty
among women -- one who finished a thought before
beginning the sentence which was to convey it  You
should I think have considered and not have been so
foolish as to leave the slides closed
Yes I suppose I should said Oak absently He
was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation
of being thus with her his head upon her dress before
the event passed on into the heap of bygone things
He wished she knew his impressions  but he would as
soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of
attempting to convey the intangibilities
P 71
of his feeling
in the coarse meshes of language So he remained
silent
She made him sit up and then Oak began wiping
his face and shaking himself like a Samson How
can I thank ee   he said at last gratefully some of the
natural rusty red having returned to his face
  Oh never mind that said the girl smiling and
allowing her smile to hold good for Gabriels next
remark whatever that might prove to be
How did you find me
I heard your dog howling and scratching at the
door of the hut when I came to the milking it was so
lucky Daisys milking is almost over for the season and
 I shall not come here after this week or the next The
dog saw me and jumped over to me and laid hold of
my skirt I came across and looked round the hut the
very first thing to see if the slides were closed My
uncle has a hut like this one and I have heard him tell
his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide
open I opened the door and there you were like
dead I threw the milk over you as there was no
water forgetting it was warm and no use
I wonder if I should have died   Gabriel said in a
low voice which was rather meant to travel back to
himself than to her
O no the girl replied She seemed to prefer a
less tragic probability  to have saved a man from death
involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of
such a deed -- and she shunned it
I believe you saved my life Miss --  -- I dont know
your name I know your aunts but not yours
 I would just as soon not tell it -- rather not There
is no reason either why I should as you probably will
never have much to do with me
  Still I should like to know
 You can inquire at my aunts -- she will tell you
My name is Gabriel Oak
And mine isnt You seem fond of yours in
speaking it so decisively Gabriel Oak
P 72
 You see it is the only one I shall ever have and I
must make the most of it
 I always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable
I should think you might soon get a new one
Mercy  -- how many opinions you keep about you
concerning other people Gabriel Oak
Well Miss-excuse the words-I thought you
would like them But I cant match you I know in
napping out my mind upon my tongue I never was
very clever in my inside But I thank you Come
give me your hand
She hesitated somewhat disconcerted at Oaks old+
fashioned earnest conclusion to a dialogue lightly
carried onVery well she said and gave him her
hand compressing her lips to a demure impassivity
He held it but an instant and in his fear of being too
demonstrative swerved to the opposite extreme touching
her fingers with the lightness of a small-hearted person
 I am sorry he said the instant after
 What for
You may have it again if you like there it is
She gave him her hand again
Oak held it longer this time -- indeed curiously long
How soft it is -- being winter time too -- not chapped
or rough or anything he said
There -- thats long enough said she though with+
out pulling it away But I suppose you are thinking
you would like to kiss it You may if you want to
I wasnt thinking of any such thing said Gabriel
simply  but I will
