man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and I will
settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at
your beginnings and ye shall know that I am the LORD

3612 Yea I will cause men to walk upon you even my people Israel
and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and
thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men

3613 Thus saith the Lord GOD Because they say unto you Thou land
devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations 3614 Therefore thou
shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith
the Lord GOD

3615 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people
any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith
the Lord GOD

3616 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 3617 Son of
man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it
by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the
uncleanness of a removed woman

3618 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted
it 3619 And I scattered them among the heathen and they were
dispersed through the countries according to their way and according
to their doings I judged them

3620 And when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they
profaned my holy name when they said to them These are the people of
the LORD and are gone forth out of his land

3621 But I had pity for mine holy name which the house of Israel had
profaned among the heathen whither they went

3622 Therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord GOD
I do not this for your sakes O house of Israel but for mine holy
names sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye
went

3623 And I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the
heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen
shall know that I am the LORD saith the Lord GOD when I shall be
sanctified in you before their eyes

3624 For I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out
of all countries and will bring you into your own land

3625 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be
clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I
cleanse you

3626 A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put
within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh
and I will give you an heart of flesh

3627 And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my
statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them

3628 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and
ye shall be my people and I will be your God

3629 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses and I will
call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you

3630 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of
the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the
heathen

3631 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that
were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your
iniquities and for your abominations

3632 Not for your sakes do I this saith the Lord GOD be it known
unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways O house of
Israel

3633 Thus saith the Lord GOD In the day that I shall have cleansed
you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the
cities and the wastes shall be builded

3634 And the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate
in the sight of all that passed by

3635 And they shall say This land that was desolate is become like
the garden of Eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are
become fenced and are inhabited

3636 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I
the LORD build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate I
the LORD have spoken it and I will do it

3637 Thus saith the Lord GOD I will yet for this be enquired of by
the house of Israel to do it for them I will increase them with men
like a flock

3638 As the holy flock as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and
they shall know that I am the LORD
