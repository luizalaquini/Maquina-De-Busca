15 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and
of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned 16 From which some
having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling 17 Desiring to
be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor
whereof they affirm

18 But we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully 19
Knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for
the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for
unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers
for manslayers 110 For whoremongers for them that defile themselves
with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if
there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine 111
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was
committed to my trust

112 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me for that
he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry 113 Who was
before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but I obtained
mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief

114 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
love which is in Christ Jesus

115 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief

116 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus
Christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which
should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting

117 Now unto the King eternal immortal invisible the only wise
God be honour and glory for ever and ever Amen

118 This charge I commit unto thee son Timothy according to the
prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a
good warfare 119 Holding faith and a good conscience which some
having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck 120 Of whom is
Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered unto Satan that they
may learn not to blaspheme

21 I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers
intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men 22 For
kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life in all godliness and honesty

23 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour
24 Who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge
of the truth

25 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men the
man Christ Jesus 26 Who gave himself a ransom for all to be
testified in due time

27 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle I speak the
truth in Christ and lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
verity

28 I will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands
without wrath and doubting

29 In like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest
apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or
gold or pearls or costly array 210 But which becometh women
professing godliness with good works

211 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection

212 But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over
the man but to be in silence

213 For Adam was first formed then Eve

214 And Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in
the transgression

215 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they
continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety

31 This is a true saying If a man desire the office of a bishop he
desireth a good work

32 A bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife
vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to
teach 33 Not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre
but patient not a brawler not covetous 34 One that ruleth well his
own house having his children in subjection with all gravity 35
For if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take
care of the church of God  36 Not a novice lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil

37 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil

38 Likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given
to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre 39 Holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience

310 And let these also first be proved then let them use the office
of a deacon being found blameless
