	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
	If with myself I hold intelligence
	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
	If that I do not dream or be not frantic--
	As I do trust I am not--then dear uncle
	Never so much as in a thought unborn
	Did I offend your highness

DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors
	If their purgation did consist in words
	They are as innocent as grace itself
	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not

ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends

DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough

ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom
	So was I when your highness banishd him
	Treason is not inherited my lord
	Or if we did derive it from our friends
	Whats that to me my father was no traitor
	Then good my liege mistake me not so much
	To think my poverty is treacherous

CELIA	Dear sovereign hear me speak

DUKE FREDERICK	Ay Celia we stayd her for your sake
	Else had she with her father ranged along

CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse
	I was too young that time to value her
	But now I know her if she be a traitor
	Why so am I we still have slept together
	Rose at an instant learnd playd eat together
	And wheresoever we went like Junos swans
	Still we went coupled and inseparable

DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
	Her very silence and her patience
	Speak to the people and they pity her
	Thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
	When she is gone Then open not thy lips
	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
	Which I have passd upon her she is banishd

CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
	I cannot live out of her company

DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool You niece provide yourself
	If you outstay the time upon mine honour
	And in the greatness of my word you die

	Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA	O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go
	Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine
	I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am

ROSALIND	I have more cause

CELIA	                  Thou hast not cousin
	Prithee be cheerful knowst thou not the duke
	Hath banishd me his daughter

ROSALIND	That he hath not

CELIA	No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love
	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
	Shall we be sunderd shall we part sweet girl
	No let my father seek another heir
	Therefore devise with me how we may fly
	Whither to go and what to bear with us
	And do not seek to take your change upon you
	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
	For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
	Say what thou canst Ill go along with thee

ROSALIND	Why whither shall we go

CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden

ROSALIND	Alas what danger will it be to us
	Maids as we are to travel forth so far
	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold

CELIA	Ill put myself in poor and mean attire
	And with a kind of umber smirch my face
	The like do you so shall we pass along
	And never stir assailants

ROSALIND	Were it not better
	Because that I am more than common tall
	That I did suit me all points like a man
	A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh
	A boar-spear in my hand and--in my heart
	Lie there what hidden womans fear there will--
