Smiling Tyrion shook his head You are too beautiful for words sweetling but I’ve grown fond of Alayaya’s remedy

You’ve never tried mine Milord never chooses anyone but ’Yaya She’s good but I’m better don’t you want to see

Next time perhaps Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful She was pug-nosed and bouncy with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse

Giggling she put her hand between his thighs and squeezed him through his breeches I don’t think he wants to wait till next time she announced He wants to come out and count all my freckles I think

Dancy Alayaya stood in the doorway dark and cool in gauzy green silk His lordship is come to visit me

Tyrion gently disentangled himself from the other girl and stood Dancy did not seem to mind Next time she reminded him She put a finger in her mouth and sucked it

As the black-skinned girl led him up the stairs she said Poor Dancy She has a fortnight to get my lord to choose her Elsewise she loses her black pearls to Marei

Marei was a cool pale delicate girl Tyrion had noticed once or twice Green eyes and porcelain skin long straight silvery hair very lovely but too solemn by half I’d hate to have the poor child lose her pearls on account of me

Then take her upstairs next time

Maybe I will

She smiled I think not my lord

She’s right Tyrion thought I won’t Shae may be only a whore but I am faithful to her after my fashion

In the turret room as he opened the door of the wardrobe he looked at Alayaya curiously What do you do while I’m gone

She raised her arms and stretched like some sleek black cat Sleep I am much better rested since you began to visit us my lord And Marei is teaching us to read perhaps soon I will be able to pass the time with a book

Sleep is good he said And books are better He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek Then it was down the shaft and through the tunnel

As he left the stable on his piebald gelding Tyrion heard the sound of music drifting over the rooftops It was pleasant to think that men still sang even in the midst of butchery and famine Remembered notes filled his head and for a moment he could almost hear Tysha as she’d sung to him half a lifetime ago He reined up to listen The tune was wrong the words too faint to hear A different song then and why not His sweet innocent Tysha had been a lie start to finish only a whore his brother Jaime had hired to make him a man

I’m free of Tysha now he thought She’s haunted me half my life but I don’t need her anymore no more than I need Alayaya or Dancy or Marei or the hundreds like them I’ve bedded with over the years I have Shae now Shae

The gates of the manse were closed and barred Tyrion pounded until the ornate bronze eye clacked open It’s me The man who admitted him was one of Varys’s prettier finds a Braavosi daggerman with a harelip and a lazy eye Tyrion had wanted no handsome young guardsmen loitering about Shae day after day Find me old ugly scarred men preferably impotent he had told the eunuch Men who prefer boys Or men who prefer sheep for that matter Varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers but he did find a eunuch strangler and a pair of foulsmelling Ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each other The others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon each uglier than the last When Varys had paraded them before him Tyrion had been afraid he’d gone too far but Shae had never uttered a word of complaint And why would she She has never complained of me and I’m more hideous than all her guards together Perhaps she does not even see ugliness

Even so Tyrion would sooner have used some of his mountain clansmen to guard the manse Chella’s Black Ears perhaps or the Moon Brothers He had more faith in their iron loyalties and sense of honor than in the greed of sellswords The risk was too great however All King’s Landing knew the wildlings were his If he sent the Black Ears here it would only be a matter of time until the whole city knew the King’s Hand was keeping a concubine

One of the Ibbenese took his horse Have you woken her Tyrion asked him

No m’lord

Good

The fire in the bedchamber had burned down to embers but the room was still warm Shae had kicked off her blankets and sheets as she slept She lay nude atop the featherbed the soft curves of her young body limned in the faint glow from the hearth Tyrion stood in the door and drank in the sight of her Younger than Marei sweeter than Dancy more beautiful than Alayaya she’s all I need and more How could a whore look so clean and sweet and innocent he wondered

He had not intended to disturb her but the sight of her was enough to make him hard He let his garments fall to the floor then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart and kissed her between the thighs Shae murmured in her sleep He kissed her again and licked at her secret sweetness on and on until his beard and her cunt were both soaked When she gave a soft moan and shuddered he climbed up and thrust himself inside her and exploded almost at once

Her eyes were open She smiled and stroked his head and whispered I just had the sweetest dream m’lord

Tyrion nipped at her small hard nipple and nestled his head on her shoulder He did not pull out of her would that he never had to pull out of her This is no dream he promised her It is real all of it he thought the wars the intrigues the great bloody game and me in the center of it… me the dwarf the monster the one they scorned and laughed at but now I hold it all the power the city the girl This was what I was made for and gods forgive me but I do love it…

And her And her
