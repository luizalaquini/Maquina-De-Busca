How many times Lord Beric insisted

Six Thoros said reluctantly And each time is harder You have grown reckless my lord Is death so very sweet

Sweet No my friend Not sweet

Then do not court it so Lord Tywin leads from the rear Lord Stannis as well You would be wise to do the same A seventh death might mean the end of both of us

Lord Beric touched the spot above his left ear where his temple was caved in Here is where Ser Burton Crakehall broke helm and head with a blow of his mace He unwound his scarf exposing the black bruise that encircled his neck Here the mark the manticore made at Rushing Falls He seized a poor beekeeper and his wife thinking they were mine and let it be known far and wide that he would hang them both unless I gave myself up to him When I did he hanged them anyway and me on the gibbet between them He lifted a finger to the raw red pit of his eye Here is where the Mountain thrust his dirk through my visor A weary smile brushed his lips That’s thrice I have died at the hands of House Clegane You would think that I might have learned   

It was a jest Arya knew but Thoros did not laugh He put a hand on Lord Beric’s shoulder Best not to dwell on it

Can I dwell on what I scarce remember I held a castle on the Marches once and there was a woman I was pledged to marry but I could not find that castle today nor tell you the color of that woman’s hair Who knighted me old friend What were my favorite foods It all fades Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest Are you my mother Thoros

Arya stared at the Myrish priest all shaggy hair and pink rags and bits of old armor Grey stubble covered his cheeks and the sagging skin beneath his chin He did not look much like the wizards in Old Nan’s stories but even so   

Could you bring back a man without a head Arya asked Just the once not six times Could you

I have no magic child Only prayers That first time his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth I knew there was no hope So when his poor torn chest stopped moving I gave him the good god’s own kiss to send him on his way I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him down his throat to lungs and heart and soul The last kiss it is called and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord’s servants as they died I had given it a time or two myself as all priests must But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him nor seen his eyes come open It was not me who raised him my lady It was the Lord R’hllor is not done with him yet Life is warmth and warmth is fire and fire is God’s and God’s alone

Arya felt tears well in her eyes Thoros used a lot of words but all they meant was no that much she understood

Your father was a good man Lord Beric said Harwin has told me much of him For his sake I would gladly forgo your ransom but we need the gold too desperately

She chewed her lip That’s true I guess He had given the Hound’s gold to Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy provisions south of the Mander she knew The last harvest burned this one is drowning and winter will soon be on us she had heard him say when he sent them off The smallfolk need grain and seed and we need blades and horses Too many of my men ride rounseys drays and mules against foes mounted on coursers and destriers

Arya didn’t know how much Robb would pay for her though He was a king now not the boy she’d left at Winterfell with snow melting in his hair And if he knew the things she’d done the stableboy and the guard at Harrenhal and all    What if my brother doesn’t want to ransom me

Why would you think that asked Lord Beric

Well Arya said my hair’s messy and my nails are dirty and my feet are all hard Robb wouldn’t care about that probably but her mother would Lady Catelyn always wanted her to be like Sansa to sing and dance and sew and mind her courtesies Just thinking of it made Arya try to comb her hair with her fingers but it was all tangles and mats and all she did was tear some out I ruined that gown that Lady Smallwood gave me and I don’t sew so good She chewed her lip I don’t sew very well I mean Septa Mordane used to say I had a blacksmith’s hands

Gendry hooted Those soft little things he called out You couldn’t even hold a hammer

I could if I wanted she snapped at him

Thoros chuckled Your brother will pay child Have no fear on that count

Yes but what if he won’t she insisted

Lord Beric sighed Then I will send you to Lady Smallwood for a time or perhaps to mine own castle of Blackhaven But that will not be necessary I’m certain I do not have the power to give you back your father no more than Thoros does but I can at least see that you are returned safely to your mother’s arms

Do you swear she asked him Yoren had promised to take her home too only he’d gotten killed instead

On my honor as a knight the lightning lord said solemnly

It was raining when Lem returned to the brewhouse muttering curses as water ran off his yellow cloak to puddle on the floor Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky sat by the door rolling dice but no matter which game they played one-eyed Jack had no luck at all Tom Sevenstrings replaced a string on his woodharp and sang The Mother’s Tears When Willum’s Wife Was Wet Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day and then The Rains of Castamere

And who are you the proud lord said

that I must bow so low

Only a cat of a different coat

that’s all the truth I know

In a coat of gold or a coat of red

a lion still has claws

And mine are long and sharp my lord

as long and sharp as yours

And so he spoke and so he spoke

that lord of Castamere

But now the rains weep o’er his hall

with no one there to hear

Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall

and not a soul to hear

Finally Tom ran out of rain songs and put away his harp Then there was only the sound of the rain itself beating down on the slate roof of the brewhouse The dice game ended and Arya stood on one leg and then the other listening to Merrit complain about his horse throwing a shoe

I could shoe him for you said Gendry all of a sudden I was only a ’prentice but my master said my hand was made to hold a hammer I can shoe horses close up rents in mail and beat the dents from plate I bet I could make swords too

What are you saying lad asked Harwin

I’ll smith for you Gendry went to one knee before Lord Beric If you’ll have me m’lord I could be of use I’ve made tools and knives and once I made a helmet that wasn’t so bad One of the Mountain’s men stole it from me when we was taken

Arya bit her lip He means to leave me too

You would do better serving Lord Tully at Riverrun said Lord Beric I cannot pay for your work

No one ever did I want a forge and food to eat some place I can sleep That’s enough m’lord

A smith can find a welcome most anywhere A skilled armorer even more so Why would you choose to stay with us

Arya watched Gendry screw up his stupid face thinking At the hollow hill what you said about being King Robert’s men and brothers I liked that I liked that you gave the Hound a trial Lord Bolton just hanged folk or took off their heads and Lord Tywin and Ser Amory were the same I’d sooner smith for you

We got plenty of mail needs mending m’lord Jack reminded Lord Beric Most we took off the dead and there’s holes where the death came through

You must be a lackwit boy said Lem We’re outlaws Lowborn scum most of us excepting his lordship Don’t think it’ll be like Tom’s fool songs neither You won’t be stealing no kisses from a princess nor riding in no tourneys in stolen armor You join us you’ll end with your neck in a noose or your head mounted up above some castle gate

It’s no more than they’d do for you said Gendry
