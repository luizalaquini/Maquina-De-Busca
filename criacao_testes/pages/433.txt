BRAN

Alebelly found him in the forge working the bellows for Mikken Maester wants you in the turret m’lord prince There’s been a bird from the king

From Robb Excited Bran did not wait for Hodor but let Alebelly carry him up the steps He was a big man though not so big as Hodor and nowhere near as strong By the time they reached the maester’s turret he was red-faced and puffing Rickon was there before them and both Walder Freys as well

Maester Luwin sent Alebelly away and closed his door My lords he said gravely we have had a message from His Grace with both good news and ill He has won a great victory in the west shattering a Lannister army at a place named Oxcross and has taken several castles as well He writes us from Ashemark formerly the stronghold of House Marbrand

Rickon tugged at the maester’s robe Is Robb coming home

Not just yet I fear There are battles yet to fight

Was it Lord Tywin he defeated asked Bran

No said the maester Ser Stafford Lannister commanded the enemy host He was slain in the battle

Bran had never even heard of Ser Stafford Lannister He found himself agreeing with Big Walder when he said Lord Tywin is the only one who matters

Tell Robb I want him to come home said Rickon He can bring his wolf home too and Mother and Father Though he knew Lord Eddard was dead sometimes Rickon forgot… willfully Bran suspected His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be

Bran was glad for Robb’s victory but disquieted as well He remembered what Osha had said the day that his brother had led his army out Of Winterfell He’s marching the wrong way the wildling woman had insisted

Sadly no victory is without cost Maester Luwin turned to the Walders My lords your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross He took a wound in the battle Robb writes It was not thought to be serious but three days later he died in his tent asleep

Big Walder shrugged He was very old Five-and-sixty I think Too old for battles He was always saying he was tired

Little Walder hooted Tired of waiting for our grandfather to die you mean Does this mean Ser Emmon’s the heir now

Don’t be stupid his cousin said The sons of the first son come before the second son Ser Ryman is next in line and then Edwyn and Black Walder and Petyr Pimple And then Aegon and all his sons

Ryman is old too said Little Walder Past forty I bet And he has a bad belly Do you think he’ll be lord

I’ll be lord I don’t care if he is

Maester Luwin cut in sharply You ought to be ashamed of such talk my lords Where is your grief Your uncle is dead

Yes said Little Walder We’re very sad

They weren’t though Bran got a sick feeling in his belly They like the taste of this dish better than I do He asked Maester Luwin to be excused

Very well The maester rang for help Hodor must have been busy in the stables It was Osha who came She was stronger than Alebelly though and had no trouble lifting Bran in her arms and carrying him down the steps

Osha Bran asked as they crossed the yard Do you know the way north To the Wall and… and even past

The way’s easy Look for the Ice Dragon and chase the blue star in the rider’s eye She backed through a door and started up the winding steps

And there are still giants there and… the rest… the Others and the children of the forest too

The giants I’ve seen the children I’ve heard tell of and the white walkers… why do you want to know
