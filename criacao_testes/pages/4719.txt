No archer could have asked for an easier shot The Thenns had their backs to the King’s Tower as they charged the crescent clambering over bags and barrels to reach the men in black Both Jon and Satin chanced to choose the same target He had just reached the top of the barricade when an arrow sprouted from his neck and a quarrel between his shoulder blades Half a heartbeat later a longsword took him in the belly and he fell back onto the man behind him Jon reached down to his quiver and found it empty again Satin was winding back his crossbow He left him to it and went for more arrows but he hadn’t taken more than three steps before the trap slammed open three feet in front of him Bloody hell I never even heard the door break

There was no time to think or plan or shout for help Jon dropped his bow reached back over his shoulder ripped Longclaw from its sheath and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower Bronze was no match for Valyrian steel The blow sheared right through the Thenn’s helm and deep into his skull and he went crashing back down where he’d come from There were more behind him Jon knew from the shouting He fell back and called to Satin The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through his cheek He vanished too The oil Jon said Satin nodded Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they’d left beside the fire lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil and dumped it down the hole on the Thenns below The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick Jon kicked the trapdoor shut set the heavy iron kettle on top of it and gave the boy with the pretty face a hard shake Retch later Jon yelled Come

They had only been gone from the parapets for a few moments but everything below had changed A dozen black brothers and a few Mole’s Town men still stood atop the crates and barrels but the wildlings were swarming over all along the crescent pushing them back Jon saw one shove his spear up through Rast’s belly so hard he lifted him into the air Young Henly was dead and Old Henly was dying surrounded by foes He could see Easy spinning and slashing laughing like a loon his cloak flapping as he leapt from cask to cask A bronze axe caught him just below the knee and the laughter turned into a bubbling shriek

They’re breaking Satin said

No said Jon they’re broken

It happened quickly One mole fled and then another and suddenly all the villagers were throwing down their weapons and abandoning the barricade The brothers were too few to hold alone Jon watched them try and form a line to fall back in order but the Thenns washed over them with spear and axe and then they were fleeing too Dornish Dilly slipped and went down on his face and a wildling planted a spear between his shoulder blades Kegs slow and short of breath had almost reached the bottom step when a Thenn caught the end of his cloak and yanked him around    but a crossbow quarrel dropped the man before his axe could fall Got him Satin crowed as Kegs staggered to the stair and began to crawl up the steps on hands and knees

The gate is lost Donal Noye had closed and chained it but it was there for the taking the iron bars glimmering red with reflected firelight the cold black tunnel behind No one had fallen back to defend it the only safety was on top of the Wall seven hundred feet up the crooked wooden stairs

What gods do you pray to Jon asked Satin

The Seven the boy from Oldtown said

Pray then Jon told him Pray to your new gods and I’ll pray to my old ones It all turned here

With the confusion at the trapdoor Jon had forgotten to fill his quiver He limped back across the roof and did that now and picked up his bow as well The kettle had not moved from where he’d left it so it seemed as though they were safe enough for the nonce The dance has moved on and we’re watching from the gallery he thought as he hobbled back Satin was loosing quarrels at the wildlings on the steps then ducking down behind a merlon to cock the crossbow He may be pretty but he’s quick

The real battle was on the steps Noye had put spearmen on the two lowest landings but the headlong flight of the villagers had panicked them and they had joined the flight racing up toward the third landing with the Thenns killing anyone who fell behind The archers and crossbowmen on the higher landings were trying to drop shafts over their heads Jon nocked an arrow drew and loosed and was pleased when one of the wildlings went rolling down the steps The heat of the fires was making the Wall weep and the flames danced and shimmered against the ice The steps shook to the footsteps of men running for their lives

Again Jon notched and drew and loosed but there was only one of him and one of Satin and a good sixty or seventy Thenns pounding up the stairs killing as they went drunk on victory On the fourth landing three brothers in black cloaks stood shoulder to shoulder with longswords in their hands and battle was joined again briefly But there were only three and soon enough the wildling tide washed over them and their blood dripped down the steps A man is never so vulnerable in battle as when he flees Lord Eddard had told Jon once A running man is like a wounded animal to a soldier It gets his bloodlust up The archers on the fifth landing fled before the battle even reached them It was a rout a red rout

Fetch the torches Jon told Satin There were four of them stacked beside the fire their heads wrapped in oily rags There were a dozen fire arrows too The Oldtown boy thrust one torch into the fire until it was blazing brightly and brought the rest back under his arm unlit He looked frightened again as well he might Jon was frightened too

It was then that he saw Styr The Magnar was climbing up the barricade over the gutted corn sacks and smashed barrels and the bodies of friends and foe alike His bronze scale armor gleamed darkly in the firelight Styr had taken off his helm to survey the scene of his triumph and the bald earless whoreson was smiling In his hand was a long weirwood spear with an ornate bronze head When he saw the gate he pointed the spear at it and barked something in the Old Tongue to the half-dozen Thenns around him Too late Jon thought You should have led your men over the barricade you might have been able to save a few

Up above a warhorn sounded long and low Not from the top of the Wall but from the ninth landing some two hundred feet up where Donal Noye was standing

Jon notched a fire arrow to his bowstring and Satin lit it from the torch He stepped to the parapet drew aimed loosed Ribbons of flame trailed behind as the shaft sped downward and thudded into its target crackling

Not Styr The steps Or more precisely the casks and kegs and sacks that Donal Noye had piled up beneath the steps as high as the first landing the barrels of lard and lamp oil the bags of leaves and oily rags the split logs bark and wood shavings Again said Jon and Again and Again Other longbowmen were firing too from every tower top in range some sending their arrows up in high arcs to drop before the Wall When Jon ran out of fire arrows he and Satin began to light the torches and fling them from the crenels

Up above another fire was blooming The old wooden steps had drunk up oil like a sponge and Donal Noye had drenched them from the ninth landing all the way down to the seventh Jon could only hope that most of their own people had staggered up to safety before Noye threw the torches The black brothers at least had known the plan but the villagers had not

Wind and fire did the rest All Jon had to do was watch With flames below and flames above the wildlings had nowhere to go Some continued upward and died Some went downward and died Some stayed where they were They died as well Many leapt from the steps before they burned and died from the fall Twenty-odd Thenns were still huddled together between the fires when the ice cracked from the heat and the whole lower third of the stair broke off along with several tons of ice That was the last that Jon Snow saw of Styr the Magnar of Thenn The Wall defends itself he thought

Jon asked Satin to help him down to the yard His wounded leg hurt so badly that he could hardly walk even with the crutch Bring the torch he told the boy from Oldtown I need to look for someone It had been mostly Thenns on the steps Surely some of the free folk had escaped Mance’s people not the Magnar’s She might have been one So they climbed down past the bodies of the men who’d tried the trapdoor and Jon wandered through the dark with his crutch under one arm and the other around the shoulders of a boy who’d been a whore in Oldtown

The stables and the common hall had burned down to smoking cinders by then but the fire still raged along the wall climbing step by step and landing by landing From time to time they’d hear a groan and then a craaaack and another chunk would come crashing off the Wall The air was full of ash and ice crystals

He found Quort dead and Stone Thumbs dying He found some dead and dying Thenns he had never truly known He found Big Boil weak from all the blood he’d lost but still alive

He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commander’s Tower with an arrow between her breasts The ice crystals had settled over her face and in the moonlight it looked as though she wore a glittering silver mask

The arrow was black Jon saw but it was fletched with white duck feathers Not mine he told himself not one of mine But he felt as if it were

When he knelt in the snow beside her her eyes opened Jon Snow she said very softly It sounded as though the arrow had found a lung Is this a proper castle now Not just a tower

It is Jon took her hand

Good she whispered I wanted t’ see one proper castle before    before I   

You’ll see a hundred castles he promised her The battle’s done Maester Aemon will see to you He touched her hair You’re kissed by fire remember Lucky It will take more than an arrow to kill you Aemon will draw it out and patch you up and we’ll get you some milk of the poppy for the pain

She just smiled at that D’you remember that cave We should have stayed in that cave I told you so

We’ll go back to the cave he said You’re not going to die Ygritte You’re not

Oh Ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand You know nothing Jon Snow she sighed dying





BRAN

It is only another empty castle Meera Reed said as she gazed across the desolation of rubble ruins and weeds

No thought Bran it is the Nightfort and this is the end of the world In the mountains all he could think of was reaching the Wall and finding the three-eyed crow but now that they were here he was filled with fears The dream he’d had    the dream Summer had had    No I mustn’t think about that dream He had not even told the Reeds though Meera at least seemed to sense that something was wrong If he never talked of it maybe he could forget he ever dreamed it and then it wouldn’t have happened and Robb and Grey Wind would still be   

Hodor Hodor shifted his weight and Bran with it He was tired They had been walking for hours At least he’s not afraid Bran was scared of this place and almost as scared of admitting it to the Reeds I’m a prince of the north a Stark of Winterfell almost a man grown I have to be as brave as Robb

Jojen gazed up at him with his dark green eyes There’s nothing here to hurt us Your Grace

Bran wasn’t so certain The Nightfort had figured in some of Old Nan’s scariest stories It was here that Night’s King had reigned before his name was wiped from the memory of man This was where the Rat Cook had served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie where the seventy-nine sentinels stood their watch where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered This was the castle where King Sherrit had called down his curse on the Andals of old where the ’prentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the hellhounds fighting Mad Axe had once walked these yards and climbed these towers butchering his brothers in the dark

All that had happened hundreds and thousands of years ago to be sure and some maybe never happened at all Maester Luwin always said that Old Nan’s stories shouldn’t be swallowed whole But once his uncle came to see Father and Bran asked about the Nightfort Benjen Stark never said the tales were true but he never said they weren’t he only shrugged and said We left the Nightfort two hundred years ago as if that was an answer

Bran forced himself to look around The morning was cold but bright the sun shining down from a hard blue sky but he did not like the noises The wind made a nervous whistling sound as it shivered through the broken towers the keeps groaned and settled and he could hear rats scrabbling under the floor of the great hall The Rat Cook’s children running from their father The yards were small forests where spindly trees rubbed their bare branches together and dead leaves scuttled like roaches across patches of old snow There were trees growing where the stables had been and a twisted white weirwood pushing up through the gaping hole in the roof of the domed kitchen Even Summer was not at ease here Bran slipped inside his skin just for an instant to get the smell of the place He did not like that either

And there was no way through

Bran had told them there wouldn’t be He had told them and told them but Jojen Reed had insisted on seeing for himself He had had a green dream he said and his green dreams did not lie They don’t open any gates either thought Bran

The gate the Nightfort guarded had been sealed since the day the black brothers had loaded up their mules and garrons and departed for Deep Lake its iron portcullis lowered the chains that raised it carried off the tunnel packed with stone and rubble all frozen together until they were as impenetrable as the Wall itself We should have followed Jon Bran said when he saw it He thought of his bastard brother often since the night that Summer had watched him ride off through the storm We should have found the kingsroad and gone to Castle Black

We dare not my prince Jojen said I’ve told you why

But there are wildlings They killed some man and they wanted to kill Jon too Jojen there were a hundred of them

So you said We are four You helped your brother if that was him in truth but it almost cost you Summer

I know said Bran miserably The direwolf had killed three of them maybe more but there had been too many When they formed a tight ring around the tall earless man he had tried to slip away through the rain but one of their arrows had come flashing after him and the sudden stab of pain had driven Bran out of the wolf’s skin and back into his own After the storm finally died they had huddled in the dark without a fire talking in whispers if they talked at all listening to Hodor’s heavy breathing and wondering if the wildlings might try and cross the lake in the morning Bran had reached out for Summer time and time again but the pain he found drove him back the way a red-hot kettle makes you pull your hand back even when you mean to grab it Only Hodor slept that night muttering Hodor hodor as he tossed and turned Bran was terrified that Summer was off dying in the darkness Please you old gods he prayed you took Winterfell and my father and my legs please don’t take Summer too And watch over Jon Snow too and make the wildlings go away

No weirwoods grew on that stony island in the lake yet somehow the old gods must have heard The wildlings took their sweet time about departing the next morning stripping the bodies of their dead and the old man they’d killed even pulling a few fish from the lake and there was a scary moment when three of them found the causeway and started to walk out    but the path turned and they didn’t and two of them nearly drowned before the others pulled them out The tall bald man yelled at them his words echoing across the water in some tongue that even Jojen did not know and a little while later they gathered up their shields and spears and marched off north by east the same way Jon had gone Bran wanted to leave too to look for Summer but the Reeds said no We will stay another night said Jojen put some leagues between us and the wildlings You don’t want to meet them again do you Late that afternoon Summer returned from wherever he’d been hiding dragging his back leg He ate parts of the bodies in the inn driving off the crows then swam out to the island Meera had drawn the broken arrow from his leg and rubbed the wound with the juice of some plants she found growing around the base of the tower The direwolf was still limping but a little less each day it seemed to Bran The gods had heard
