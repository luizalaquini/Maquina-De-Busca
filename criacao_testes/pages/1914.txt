and it is easy to show that
this is satisfied by  w sub 3dB  =  w sub c  +-  b2  to a
good approximation neglecting higher powers of bw sub c   Figure 57

The bandwidth of a formant is fairly constant regardless of the formant
frequency  This makes the formant filter a slightly unusual one  most
engineering applications which use variable-frequency resonances require
the bandwidth to be a constant proportion of the resonant
frequency em the ratio
w sub c b often called the Q of the filter is to be constant
For formants we wish the Q to increase linearly with resonant frequency
Since the amplitude gain of the formant at resonance is w sub c b
this peak gain increases as the formant frequency is increased
pp
Although it is easy to measure formant frequencies on a spectrogram
cf Chapter 2
it is not so easy to measure bandwidths accurately  One rather unusual method
was reported by van den Berg 1955 who took a subject who had had a partial
laryngectomy an operation which left an opening into the vocal tract near
the larynx position  Into this he inserted a sound source and made a
swept-frequency calibration of the vocal tract

Berg van den 1955

Almost as bizarre is a
technique which involves setting off a spark inside the mouth of a subject
as he holds his articulators in a given position
pp
The results of several different kinds of experiment are reported by Dunn 1961
and are summarized in Table 51 along with the formant frequency ranges

Table 51  Different estimates of formant bandwidths with range of
formant frequencies for reference
TE
Note that the bandwidths really are narrow compared with the resonant frequencies
of the filters except at the lower end of the formant 1 range  Choosing the
lowest bandwidth estimate leads to an amplification factor at resonance of 50 for formant 2
when its frequency is at the top of its range and formant 3 happens to give
the same value
rh Series synthesizers
The simplest realization of the vocal tract filter is a chain of formant
filters in series as illustrated in Figure 58
FC Figure 58
This leads to particular difficulties if the frequencies of two formants
stray close together  The worst case occurs if formants 2 and 3 have the
same resonant frequencies at the top of the range of formant 2 namely 2500 Hz
In this case and if the bandwidths of the formants are set to the lowest
estimates a combined amplification factor
of  250050 times 250070=1800  is
obtained at the point of resonance em that is
65 dB above the DC value  This is enough
to tax most analogue implementations and can evoke clipping in the formant
filters with a very noticeable effect on speech quality  This
extreme case will not occur during synthesis of realistic speech for
although the formant
ul
ranges
overlap the values for any particular human sound will not coincide exactly  However
it illustrates the difficulty of designing a series synthesizer which copes
sensibly with arbitrary parameter settings and explains why designers often
choose formant bandwidths in the top half of the ranges given in Table 51
pp
The problem of excessive amplification within a series synthesizer can be
alleviated to a small extent by choosing carefully the order in which the
