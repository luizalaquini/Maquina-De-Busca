Seven hells He gave the leashes a hard yank to get the dogs’ attention Track you bastards That’s a bear print You want some meat or no Find But the hounds only huddled closer whining Chett snapped his short lash above their heads and the black bitch snarled at him Dog meat would taste as good as bear he warned her his breath frosting with every word

Lark the Sisterman stood with his arms crossed over his chest and his hands tucked up into his armpits He wore black wool gloves but he was always complaining how his fingers were frozen It’s too bloody cold to hunt he said Bugger this bear he’s not worth freezing over

We can’t go back emptyhand Lark rumbled Small Paul through the brown whiskers that covered most of his face The Lord Commander wouldn’t like that There was ice under the big man’s squashed pug nose where his snot had frozen A huge hand in a thick fur glove clenched tight around the shaft of a spear

Bugger that Old Bear too said the Sisterman a thin man with sharp features and nervous eyes Mormont will be dead before daybreak remember Who cares what he likes

Small Paul blinked his black little eyes Maybe he had forgotten Chett thought he was stupid enough to forget most anything Why do we have to kill the Old Bear Why don’t we just go off and let him be

You think he’ll let us be said Lark He’ll hunt us down You want to be hunted you great muttonhead

No said Small Paul I don’t want that I don’t

So you’ll kill him said Lark

Yes The huge man stamped the butt of his spear on the frozen riverbank I will He shouldn’t hunt us

The Sisterman took his hands from his armpits and turned to Chett We need to kill all the officers I say

Chett was sick of hearing it We been over this The Old Bear dies and Blane from the Shadow Tower Grubbs and Aethan as well their ill luck for drawing the watch Dywen and Barmen for their tracking and Ser Piggy for the ravens That’s all We kill them quiet while they sleep One scream and we’re wormfood every one of us His boils were red with rage Just do your bit and see that your cousins do theirs And Paul try and remember it’s third watch not second

Third watch the big man said through hair and frozen snot Me and Softfoot I remember Chett

The moon would be black tonight and they had jiggered the watches so as to have eight of their own standing sentry with two more guarding the horses It wasn’t going to get much riper than that Besides the wildlings could be upon them any day now Chett meant to be well away from here before that happened He meant to live

Three hundred sworn brothers of the Night’s Watch had ridden north two hundred from Castle Black and another hundred from the Shadow Tower It was the biggest ranging in living memory near a third of the Watch’s strength They meant to find Ben Stark Ser Waymar Royce and the other rangers who’d gone missing and discover why the wildlings were leaving their villages Well they were no closer to Stark and Royce than when they’d left the Wall but they’d learned where all the wildlings had gone—up into the icy heights of the godsforsaken Frostfangs They could squat up there till the end of time and it wouldn’t prick Chett’s boils none

But no They were coming down Down the Milkwater

Chett raised his eyes and there it was The river’s stony banks were bearded by ice its pale milky waters flowing endlessly down out of the Frostfangs And now Mance Rayder and his wildlings were flowing down the same way Thoren Smallwood had returned in a lather three days past While he was telling the Old Bear what his scouts had seen his man Kedge Whiteye told the rest of them They’re still well up the foothills but they’re coming Kedge said warming his hands over the fire Harma the Dogshead has the van the poxy bitch Goady crept up on her camp and saw her plain by the fire That fool Tumberjon wanted to pick her off with an arrow but Smallwood had better sense

Chett spat How many were there could you tell

Many and more Twenty thirty thousand we didn’t stay to count Harma had five hundred in the van every one ahorse

The men around the fire exchanged uneasy looks It was a rare thing to find even a dozen mounted wildlings and five hundred…

Smallwood sent Bannen and me wide around the van to catch a peek at the main body Kedge went on There was no end of them They’re moving slow as a frozen river four five miles a day but they don’t look like they mean to go back to their villages neither More’n half were women and children and they were driving their animals before them goats sheep even aurochs dragging sledges They’d loaded up with bales of fur and sides of meat cages of chickens butter churns and spinning wheels every damn thing they own The mules and garrons was so heavy laden you’d think their backs would break The women as well

And they follow the Milkwater Lark the Sisterman asked

I said so didn’t I

The Milkwater would take them past the Fist of the First Men the ancient ringfort where the Night’s Watch had made its camp Any man with a thimble of sense could see that it was time to pull up stakes and fall back on the Wall The Old Bear had strengthened the Fist with spikes and pits and caltrops but against such a host all that was pointless If they stayed here they would be engulfed and overwhelmed

And Thoren Smallwood wanted to attack Sweet Donnel Hill was squire to Ser Mallador Locke and the night before last Smallwood had come to Locke’s tent Ser Mallador had been of the same mind as old Ser Ottyn Wythers urging a retreat on the Wall but Smallwood wanted to convince him otherwise This King-beyond-the-Wall will never look for us so far north Sweet Donnel reported him saying And this great host of his is a shambling horde full of useless mouths who won’t know what end of a sword to hold One blow will take all the fight out of them and send them howling back to their hovels for another fifty years

Three hundred against thirty thousand Chett called that rank madness and what was madder still was that Ser Mallador had been persuaded and the two of them together were on the point of persuading the Old Bear If we wait too long this chance may be lost never to come again Smallwood was saying to anyone who would listen Against that Ser Ottyn Wythers said We are the shield that guards the realms of men You do not throw away your shield for no good purpose but to that Thoren Smallwood said In a swordfight a man’s surest defense is the swift stroke that slays his foe not cringing behind a shield

Neither Smallwood nor Wythers had the command though Lord Mormont did and Mormont was waiting for his other scouts for Jarman Buckwell and the men who’d climbed the Giant’s Stair and for Qhorin Halfhand and Jon Snow who’d gone to probe the Skirling Pass Buckwell and the Halfhand were late in returning though Dead most like Chett pictured Jon Snow lying blue and frozen on some bleak mountaintop with a wildling spear up his bastard’s arse The thought made him smile I hope they killed his bloody wolf as well

There’s no bear here he decided abruptly Just an old print that’s all Back to the Fist The dogs almost yanked him off his feet as eager to get back as he was Maybe they thought they were going to get fed Chett had to laugh He hadn’t fed them for three days now to turn them mean and hungry Tonight before slipping off into the dark he’d turn them loose among the horse lines after Sweet Donnel Hill and Clubfoot Karl cut the tethers They’ll have snarling hounds and panicked horses all over the Fist running through fires jumping the ringwall and trampling down tents With all the confusion it might be hours before anyone noticed that fourteen brothers were missing

Lark had wanted to bring in twice that number but what could you expect from some stupid fishbreath Sisterman Whisper a word in the wrong ear and before you knew it you’d be short a head No fourteen was a good number enough to do what needed doing but not so many that they couldn’t keep the secret Chett had recruited most of them himself Small Paul was one of his the strongest man on the Wall even if he was slower than a dead snail He’d once broken a wildling’s back with a hug They had Dirk as well named for his favorite weapon and the little grey man the brothers called Softfoot who’d raped a hundred women in his youth and liked to boast how none had never seen nor heard him until he shoved it up inside them

The plan was Chett’s He was the clever one he’d been steward to old Maester Aemon for four good years before that bastard Jon Snow had done him out so his job could be handed to his fat pig of a friend When he killed Sam Tarly tonight he planned to whisper Give my love to Lord Snow right in his ear before he sliced Ser Piggy’s throat open to let the blood come bubbling out through all those layers of suet Chett knew the ravens so he wouldn’t have no trouble there no more than he would with Tarly One touch of the knife and that craven would piss his pants and start blubbering for his life Let him beg it won’t do him no good After he opened his throat he’d open the cages and shoo the birds away so no messages reached the Wall Softfoot and Small Paul would kill the Old Bear Dirk would do Blane and Lark and his cousins would silence Bannen and old Dywen to keep them from sniffing after their trail They’d been caching food for a fortnight and Sweet Donnel and Clubfoot Karl would have the horses ready With Mormont dead command would pass to Ser Ottyn Wythers an old done man and failing He’ll be running for the Wall before sundown and he won’t waste no men sending them after us neither

The dogs pulled at him as they made their way through the trees Chett could see the Fist punching its way up through the green The day was so dark that the Old Bear had the torches lit a great circle of them burning all along the ringwall that crowned the top of the steep stony hill The three of them waded across a brook The water was icy cold and patches of ice were spreading across its surface I’m going to make for the coast Lark the Sisterman confided Me and my cousins We’ll build us a boat sail back home to the Sisters

And at home they’ll know you for deserters and lop off your fool heads thought Chett There was no leaving the Night’s Watch once you said your words Anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms they’d take you and kill you

Ollo Lophand now he was talking about sailing back to Tyrosh where he claimed men didn’t lose their hands for a bit of honest thievery nor get sent off to freeze their life away for being found in bed with some knight’s wife Chett had weighed going with him but he didn’t speak their wet girly tongue And what could he do in Tyrosh He had no trade to speak of growing up in Hag’s Mire His father had spent his life grubbing in other men’s fields and collecting leeches He’d strip down bare but for a thick leather clout and go wading in the murky waters When he climbed out he’d be covered from nipple to ankle Sometimes he made Chett help pull the leeches off One had attached itself to his palm once and he’d smashed it against a wall in revulsion His father beat him bloody for that The maesters bought the leeches at twelve-for-a-penny

Lark could go home if he liked and the damn Tyroshi too but not Chett If he never saw Hag’s Mire again it would be too bloody soon He had liked the look of Craster’s Keep himself Craster lived high as a lord there so why shouldn’t he do the same That would be a laugh Chett the leechman’s son a lord with a keep His banner could be a dozen leeches on a field of pink But why stop at lord Maybe he should be a king Mance Rayder started out a crow I could be a king same as him and have me some wives Craster had nineteen not even counting the young ones the daughters he hadn’t gotten around to bedding yet Half them wives were as old and ugly as Craster but that didn’t matter The old ones Chett could put to work cooking and cleaning for him pulling carrots and slopping pigs while the young ones warmed his bed and bore his children Craster wouldn’t object not once Small Paul gave him a hug

The only women Chett had ever known were the whores he’d bought in Mole’s Town When he’d been younger the village girls took one look at his face with its boils and its wen and turned away sickened The worst was that slattern Bessa She’d spread her legs for every boy in Hag’s Mire so he’d figured why not him too He even spent a morning picking wildflowers when he heard she liked them but she’d just laughed in his face and told him she’d crawl in a bed with his father’s leeches before she’d crawl in one with him She stopped laughing when he put his knife in her That was sweet the look on her face so he pulled the knife out and put it in her again When they caught him down near Sevenstreams old Lord Walder Frey hadn’t even bothered to come himself to do the judging He’d sent one of his bastards that Walder Rivers and the next thing Chett had known he was walking to the Wall with that foul-smelling black devil Yoren To pay for his one sweet moment they took his whole life

But now he meant to take it back and Craster’s women too That twisted old wildling has the right of it If you want a woman to wife you take her and none of this giving her flowers so that maybe she don’t notice your bloody boils Chett didn’t mean to make that mistake again

It would work he promised himself for the hundredth time So long as we get away clean Ser Ottyn would strike south for the Shadow Tower the shortest way to the Wall He won’t bother with us not Wythers all he’ll want is to get back whole Thoren Smallwood now he’d want to press on with the attack but Ser Ottyn’s caution ran too deep and he was senior It won’t matter anyhow Once we’re gone Smallwood can attack anyone he likes What do we care If none of them ever returns to the Wall no one will ever come looking for us they’ll think we died with the rest That was a new thought and for a moment it tempted him But they would need to kill Ser Ottyn and Ser Mallador Locke as well to give Smallwood the command and both of them were well-attended day and night… No the risk was too great

Chett said Small Paul as they trudged along a stony game trail through sentinels and soldier pines what about the bird

What bloody bird The last thing he needed now was some muttonhead going on about a bird

The Old Bear’s raven Small Paul said if we kill him who’s going to feed his bird

Who bloody well cares Kill the bird too if you like

I don’t want to hurt no bird the big man said But that’s a talking bird What if it tells what we did

Lark the Sisterman laughed Small Paul thick as a castle wall he mocked

You shut up with that said Small Paul dangerously

Paul said Chett before the big man got too angry when they find the old man lying in a pool of blood with his throat slit they won’t need no bird to tell them someone killed him

Small Paul chewed on that a moment That’s true he allowed Can I keep the bird then I like that bird

He’s yours said Chett just to shut him up

We can always eat him if we get hungry offered Lark

Small Paul clouded up again Best not try and eat my bird Lark Best not

Chett could hear voices drifting through the trees Close your bloody mouths both of you We’re almost to the Fist

They emerged near the west face of the hill and walked around south where the slope was gentler Near the edge of the forest a dozen men were taking archery practice They had carved outlines on the trunks of trees and were loosing shafts at them Look said Lark A pig with a bow
