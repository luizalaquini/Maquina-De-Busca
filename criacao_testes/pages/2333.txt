Littlefinger smiled Widowhood will become you Sansa

The thought made her tummy flutter She might never need to share a bed with Tyrion again That was what she’d wanted    wasn’t it

The cabin was low and cramped but a featherbed had been laid upon the narrow sleeping shelf to make it more comfortable and thick furs piled atop it It will be snug I know but you shouldn’t be too uncomfortable Littlefinger pointed out a cedar chest under the porthole You’ll find fresh garb within Dresses smallclothes warm stockings a cloak Wool and linen only I fear Unworthy of a maid so beautiful but they’ll serve to keep you dry and clean until we can find you something finer

He had this all prepared for me My lord I    I do not understand    Joffrey gave you Harrenhal made you Lord Paramount of the Trident    why   

Why should I wish him dead Littlefinger shrugged I had no motive Besides I am a thousand leagues away in the Vale Always keep your foes confused If they are never certain who you are or what you want they cannot know what you are like to do next Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose or even seem to work against you Remember that Sansa when you come to play the game

What    what game

The only game The game of thrones He brushed back a strand of her hair You are old enough to know that your mother and I were more than friends There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me    but she was a daughter of Riverrun and Hoster Tully Family Duty Honor Sansa Family Duty Honor meant I could never have her hand But she gave me something finer a gift a woman can give but once How could I turn my back upon her daughter In a better world you might have been mine not Eddard Stark’s My loyal loving daughter    Put Joffrey from your mind sweetling Dontos Tyrion all of them They will never trouble you again You are safe now that’s all that matters You are safe with me and sailing home





JAIME

The king is dead they told him never knowing that Joffrey was his son as well as his sovereign

The Imp opened his throat with a dagger a costermonger declared at the roadside inn where they spent the night He drank his blood from a big gold chalice The man did not recognize the bearded one-handed knight with the big bat on his shield no more than any of them so he said things he might otherwise have swallowed had he known who was listening

It was poison did the deed the innkeep insisted The boy’s face turned black as a plum

May the Father judge him justly murmured a septon

The dwarf’s wife did the murder with him swore an archer in Lord Rowan’s livery Afterward she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep blood dripping from his jaws

Jaime sat silent through it all letting the words wash over him a horn of ale forgotten in his one good hand Joffrey My blood My firstborn My son He tried to bring the boy’s face to mind but his features kept turning into Cersei’s She will be in mourning her hair in disarray and her eyes red from crying her mouth trembling as she tries to speak She will cry again when she sees me though she’ll fight the tears His sister seldom wept but when she was with him She could not stand for others to think her weak Only to her twin did she show her wounds She will look to me for comfort and revenge

They rode hard the next day at Jaime’s insistence His son was dead and his sister needed him

When he saw the city before him its watchtowers dark against the gathering dusk Jaime Lannister cantered up to Steelshanks Walton behind Nage with the peace banner

What’s that awful stink the northman complained

Death thought Jaime but he said Smoke sweat and shit King’s Landing in short If you have a good nose you can smell the treachery too You’ve never smelled a city before

I smelled White Harbor It never stank like this

White Harbor is to King’s Landing as my brother Tyrion is to Ser Gregor Clegane

Nage led them up a low hill the seven-tailed peace banner lifting and turning in the wind the polished seven-pointed star shining bright upon its staff He would see Cersei soon and Tyrion and their father Could my brother truly have killed the boy Jaime found that hard to believe

He was curiously calm Men were supposed to go mad with grief when their children died he knew They were supposed to tear their hair out by the roots to curse the gods and swear red vengeance So why was it that he felt so little The boy lived and died believing Robert Baratheon his sire

Jaime had seen him born that was true though more for Cersei than the child But he had never held him How would it look his sister warned him when the women finally left them Bad enough Joff looks like you without you mooning over him Jaime yielded with hardly a fight The boy had been a squalling pink thing who demanded too much of Cersei’s time Cersei’s love and Cersei’s breasts Robert was welcome to him

And now he’s dead He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face black from poison and still felt nothing Perhaps he was the monster they claimed If the Father Above came down to offer him back his son or his hand Jaime knew which he would choose He had a second son after all and seed enough for many more If Cersei wants another child I’ll give her one    and this time I’ll hold him and the Others take those who do not like it Robert was rotting in his grave and Jaime was sick of lies

He turned abruptly and galloped back to find Brienne Gods know why I bother She is the least companionable creature I’ve ever had the misfortune to meet The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side as if to proclaim that she was no part of them They had found men’s garb for her along the way a tunic here a mantle there a pair of breeches and a cowled cloak even an old iron breastplate She looked more comfortable dressed as a man but nothing would ever make her look handsome Nor happy Once out of Harrenhal her usual pighead stubbornness had soon reasserted itself I want my arms and armor back she had insisted Oh by all means let us have you back in steel Jaime replied A helm especially We’ll all be happier if you keep your mouth shut and your visor down

That much Brienne could do but her sullen silences soon began to fray his good humor almost as much as Qyburn’s endless attempts to be ingratiating I never thought I would find myself missing the company of Cleos Frey gods help me He was beginning to wish he had left her for the bear after all

King’s Landing Jaime announced when he found her Our journey’s done my lady You’ve kept your vow and delivered me to King’s Landing All but a few fingers and a hand

Brienne’s eyes were listless That was only half my vow I told Lady Catelyn I would bring her back her daughters Or Sansa at the least And now   

She never met Robb Stark yet her grief for him runs deeper than mine for Joff Or perhaps it was Lady Catelyn she mourned They had been at Brindlewood when they had that news from a red-faced tub of a knight named Ser Bertram Beesbury whose arms were three beehives on a field striped black and yellow A troop of Lord Piper’s men had passed through Brindlewood only yesterday Beesbury told them rushing to King’s Landing beneath a peace banner of their own With the Young Wolf dead Piper saw no point to fighting on His son is captive at the Twins Brienne gaped like a cow about to choke on her cud so it fell to Jaime to draw out the tale of the Red Wedding

Every great lord has unruly bannermen who envy him his place he told her afterward My father had the Reynes and Tarbecks the Tyrells have the Florents Hoster Tully had Walder Frey Only strength keeps such men in their place The moment they smell weakness    during the Age of Heroes the Boltons used to flay the Starks and wear their skins as cloaks She looked so miserable that Jaime almost found himself wanting to comfort her

Since that day Brienne had been like one half-dead Even calling her wench failed to provoke any response The strength is gone from her The woman had dropped a rock on Robin Ryger battled a bear with a tourney sword bitten off Vargo Hoat’s ear and fought Jaime to exhaustion    but she was broken now done I’ll speak to my father about returning you to Tarth if it please you he told her Or if you would rather stay I could perchance find some place for you at court

As a lady companion to the queen she said dully

Jaime remembered the sight of her in that pink satin gown and tried not to imagine what his sister might say of such a companion Perhaps a post with the City Watch   

I will not serve with oathbreakers and murderers

Then why did you ever bother putting on a sword he might have said but he bit back the words As you will Brienne One-handed he wheeled his horse about and left her

The Gate of the Gods was open when they reached it but two dozen wayns were lined up along the roadside loaded with casks of cider barrels of apples bales of hay and some of the biggest pumpkins Jaime had ever seen Almost every wagon had its guards men-at-arms wearing the badges of small lordlings sellswords in mail and boiled leather sometimes only a pink-cheeked farmer’s son clutching a homemade spear with a fire-hardened point Jaime smiled at them all as he trotted past At the gate the gold cloaks were collecting coin from each driver before waving the wagons through What’s this Steelshanks demanded

They got to pay for the right to sell inside the city By command of the King’s Hand and the master of coin

Jaime looked at the long line of wayns carts and laden horses Yet they still line up to pay

There’s good coin to be made here now that the fighting’s done the miller in the nearest wagon told them cheerfully It’s the Lannisters hold the city now old Lord Tywin of the Rock They say he shits silver

Gold Jaime corrected dryly And Littlefinger mints the stuff from goldenrod I vow

The Imp is master of coin now said the captain of the gate Or was till they arrested him for murdering the king The man looked the northmen over suspiciously Who are you lot

Lord Bolton’s men come to see the King’s Hand

The captain glanced at Nage with his peace banner Come to bend the knee you mean You’re not the first Go straight up to the castle and see you make no trouble He waved them through and turned back to the wagons

If King’s Landing mourned its dead boy king Jaime would never have known it On the Street of Seeds a begging brother in threadbare robes was praying loudly for Joffrey’s soul but the passersby paid him no more heed than they would a loose shutter banging in the wind Elsewhere milled the usual crowds gold cloaks in their black mail bakers’ boys selling tarts and breads and hot pies whores leaning out of windows with their bodices half unlaced gutters redolent of nightsoil They passed five men trying to drag a dead horse from the mouth of an alley and elsewhere a juggler spinning knives through the air to delight a throng of drunken Tyrell soldiers and small children

Riding down familiar streets with two hundred northmen a chainless maester and an ugly freak of a woman at his side Jaime found he scarcely drew a second look He did not know whether he ought to be amused or annoyed They do not know me he said to Steelshanks as they rode through Cobbler’s Square

Your face is changed and your arms as well the northman said and they have a new Kingslayer now

The gates to the Red Keep were open but a dozen gold cloaks armed with pikes barred the way They lowered their points as Steelshanks came trotting up but Jaime recognized the white knight commanding them Ser Meryn

Ser Meryn Trant’s droopy eyes went wide Ser Jaime
