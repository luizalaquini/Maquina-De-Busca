144 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest and Nathan the
prophet and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the
Pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule
145 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
king in Gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the
city rang again This is the noise that ye have heard

146 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom

147 And moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king
David saying God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and
make his throne greater than thy throne And the king bowed himself
upon the bed

148 And also thus said the king Blessed be the LORD God of Israel
which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even
seeing it

149 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid and rose
up and went every man his way

150 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon and arose and went and
caught hold on the horns of the altar

151 And it was told Solomon saying Behold Adonijah feareth king
Solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar
saying Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his
servant with the sword

152 And Solomon said If he will shew himself a worthy man there
shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be
found in him he shall die

153 So king Solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar
And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon and Solomon said unto
him Go to thine house

21 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die and he charged
Solomon his son saying 22 I go the way of all the earth be thou
strong therefore and shew thyself a man 23 And keep the charge of
the LORD thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his
commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written
in the law of Moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest
and whithersoever thou turnest thyself 24 That the LORD may continue
his word which he spake concerning me saying If thy children take
heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and
with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the
throne of Israel

25 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel unto Abner
the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether whom he slew and
shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his
girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his
feet

26 Do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go
down to the grave in peace

27 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and
let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me
when I fled because of Absalom thy brother

28 And behold thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera a
Benjamite of Bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
when I went to Mahanaim but he came down to meet me at Jordan and I
sware to him by the LORD saying I will not put thee to death with
the sword

29 Now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring
thou down to the grave with blood

210 So David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of
David

211 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years
seven years reigned he in Hebron and thirty and three years reigned
he in Jerusalem

212 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father and his
kingdom was established greatly

213 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
Solomon And she said Comest thou peaceably And he said Peaceably

214 He said moreover I have somewhat to say unto thee And she said
Say on

215 And he said Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all
Israel set their faces on me that I should reign howbeit the kingdom
is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the
LORD

216 And now I ask one petition of thee deny me not And she said
unto him Say on

217 And he said Speak I pray thee unto Solomon the king for he
will not say thee nay that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to
wife
