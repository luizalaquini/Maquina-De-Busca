Lord Tywin would have paid more heed to a mouse squeaking in the corner Dreamwine will serve Cersei Tyrion remain

Ser Kevan took Joffrey firmly by the arm and marched him out the door where two of the Kingsguard were waiting Grand Maester Pycelle scurried after them as fast as his shaky old legs could take him Tyrion remained where he was

Father I am sorry Cersei said when the door was shut Joff has always been willful I did warn you…

There is a long league’s worth of difference between willful and stupid ‘A strong king acts boldly’ Who told him that

Not me I promise you said Cersei Most like it was something he heard Robert say…

The part about you hiding under Casterly Rock does sound like Robert Tyrion didn’t want Lord Tywin forgetting that bit

Yes I recall now Cersei said Robert often told Joff that a king must be bold

And what were you telling him pray I did not fight a war to seat Robert the Second on the Iron Throne You gave me to understand the boy cared nothing for his father

Why would he Robert ignored him He would have beat him if I’d allowed it That brute you made me marry once hit the boy so hard he knocked out two of his baby teeth over some mischief with a cat I told him I’d kill him in his sleep if he ever did it again and he never did but sometimes he would say things…

It appears things needed to be said Lord Tywin waved two fingers at her a brusque dismissal Go

She went seething

Not Robert the Second Tyrion said Aerys the Third

The boy is thirteen There is time yet Lord Tywin paced to the window That was unlike him he was more upset than he wished to show He requires a sharp lesson

Tyrion had gotten his own sharp lesson at thirteen He felt almost sorry for his nephew On the other hand no one deserved it more Enough of Joffrey he said Wars are won with quills and ravens wasn’t that what you said I must congratulate you How long have you and Walder Frey been plotting this

I mislike that word Lord Tywin said stiffly

And I mislike being left in the dark

There was no reason to tell you You had no part in this

Was Cersei told Tyrion demanded to know

No one was told save those who had a part to play And they were only told as much as they needed to know You ought to know that there is no other way to keep a secret—here especially My object was to rid us of a dangerous enemy as cheaply as I could not to indulge your curiosity or make your sister feel important He closed the shutters frowning You have a certain cunning Tyrion but the plain truth is you talk too much That loose tongue of yours will be your undoing

You should have let Joff tear it out suggested Tyrion

You would do well not to tempt me Lord Tywin said I’ll hear no more of this I have been considering how best to appease Oberyn Martell and his entourage

Oh Is this something I’m allowed to know or should I leave so you can discuss it with yourself

His father ignored the sally Prince Oberyn’s presence here is unfortunate His brother is a cautious man a reasoned man subtle deliberate even indolent to a degree He is a man who weighs the consequences of every word and every action But Oberyn has always been half-mad

Is it true he tried to raise Dorne for Viserys

No one speaks of it but yes Ravens flew and riders rode with what secret messages I never knew Jon Arryn sailed to Sunspear to return Prince Lewyn’s bones sat down with Prince Doran and ended all the talk of war But Robert never went to Dorne thereafter and Prince Oberyn seldom left it

Well he’s here now with half the nobility of Dorne in his tail and he grows more impatient every day said Tyrion Perhaps I should show him the brothels of King’s Landing that might distract him A tool for every task isn’t that how it works My tool is yours Father Never let it be said that House Lannister blew its trumpets and I did not respond

Lord Tywin’s mouth tightened Very droll Shall I have them sew you a suit of motley and a little hat with bells on it
