her claws in my chest and tries to keep me afloat No
Katniss No You cant go
But the ones I hated are winning and if she clings to
me shell be lost as well Prim let go And finally she
doesDeep in the water Im deserted by all Theres only the
sound of my breathing the enormous effort it takes to draw
the water in push it out of my lungs I want to stop I try to
hold my breath but the sea forces its way in and out
against my will Let me die Let me follow the others I
beg whatever holds me here Theres no response
Trapped for days years centuries maybe Dead but
not allowed to die Alive but as good as dead So alone
that anyone anything no matter how loathsome would be
welcome But when I finally have a visitor its sweet
Morphling Coursing through my veins easing the pain
lightening my body so that it rises back toward the air and
rests again on the foam
Foam I really am floating on foam I can feel it beneath
the tips of my fingers cradling parts of my naked body
Theres much pain but theres also something like reality
The sandpaper of my throat The smell of burn medicine
from the first arena The sound of my mothers voice These
things frighten me and I try to return to the deep to make
sense of them But theres no going back Gradually Im
forced to accept who I am A badly burned girl with no
wings With no fire And no sister
In the dazzling white Capitol hospital the doctors work
their magic on me Draping my rawness in new sheets of
skin Coaxing the cells into thinking they are my own
Manipulating my body parts bending and stretching the
limbs to assure a good fit I hear over and over again how
lucky I am My eyes were spared Most of my face was
spared My lungs are responding to treatment I will be as
good as new
When my tender skin has toughened enough to
withstand the pressure of sheets more visitors arrive The
morphling opens the door to the dead and alive alike
Haymitch yellow and unsmiling Cinna stitching a new
wedding dress Delly prattling on about the niceness of
people My father sings all four stanzas of The Hanging
Tree and reminds me that my mother--who sleeps in a
chair between shifts--isnt to know about it
One day I awake to expectations and know I will not be
allowed to live in my dreamland I must take food by mouth
Move my own muscles Make my way to the bathroom A
brief appearance by President Coin clinches it
Dont worry she says Ive saved him for you
The doctors puzzlement grows over why Im unable to
speak Many tests are done and while theres damage to
my vocal cords it doesnt account for it Finally Dr
Aurelius a head doctor comes up with the theory that Ive
become a mental rather than physical Avox That my
silence has been brought on by emotional trauma Although
hes presented with a hundred proposed remedies he tells
them to leave me alone So I dont ask about anyone or
anything but people bring me a steady stream of
information On the war The Capitol fell the day the
parachutes went off President Coin leads Panem now and
troops have been sent out to put down the small remaining
pockets of Capitol resistance On President Snow Hes
being held prisoner awaiting trial and most certain
execution On my assassination team Cressida and Pollux
have been sent out into the districts to cover the wreckage
of the war Gale who took two bullets in an escape attempt
is mopping up Peacekeepers in 2 Peetas still in the burn
unit He made it to the City Circle after all On my family My
mother buries her grief in her work
Having no work grief buries me All that keeps me
going is Coins promise That I can kill Snow And when
thats done nothing will be left
Eventually Im released from the hospital and given a
room in the presidents mansion to share with my mother
Shes almost never there taking her meals and sleeping at
work It falls to Haymitch to check on me make sure Im
eating and using my medicines Its not an easy job I take
to my old habits from District 13 Wandering unauthorized
through the mansion Into bedrooms and offices ballrooms
and baths Seeking strange little hiding spaces A closet of
furs A cabinet in the library A long-forgotten bathtub in a
room of discarded furniture My places are dim and quiet
and impossible to find I curl up make myself smaller try to
disappear entirely Wrapped in silence I slide my bracelet
that reads mentally disoriented around and around my
wrist
My name is Katniss Everdeen I am seventeen years
old My home is District 12 There is no District 12 I am
the Mockingjay I brought down the Capitol President
Snow hates me He killed my sister Now I will kill him
And then the Hunger Games will be over
Periodically I find myself back in my room unsure
whether I was driven by a need for morphling or if Haymitch
ferreted me out I eat the food take the medicine and am
required to bathe Its not the water I mind but the mirror
that reflects my naked fire-mutt body The skin grafts still
retain a newborn-baby pinkness The skin deemed
damaged but salvageable looks red hot and melted in
places Patches of my former self gleam white and pale Im
like a bizarre patchwork quilt of skin Parts of my hair were
singed off completely the rest has been chopped off at odd
lengths Katniss Everdeen the girl who was on fire I
