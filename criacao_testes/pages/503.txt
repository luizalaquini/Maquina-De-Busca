She turned her face away from him

Do you mean to march on the Wall When

She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him

Do you know anything of my uncle Benjen Stark

Ygritte ignored him Stonesnake laughed if she spits out her tongue don’t say I didn’t warn you

A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock Shadowcat Jon knew at once As he rose he heard another closer at hand He pulled his sword and turned listening

They won’t trouble us Ygritte said It’s the dead they’ve come for Cats can smell blood six miles off They’ll stay near the bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ meat and cracked the bones for the marrow

Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks It gave him an uneasy feeling The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was but he dared not sleep He had taken a captive and it was on him to guard her Were they your kin he asked her quietly The two we killed

No more than you are

Me He frowned What do you mean

You said you were the Bastard o’ Winterfell

I am

Who was your mother

Some woman Most of them are Someone had said that to him once He did not remember who

She smiled again a flash of white teeth And she never sung you the song o’ the winter rose

I never knew my mother Or any such song

Bael the Bard made it said Ygritte He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back All the free folk know his songs but might be you don’t sing them in the south

Winterfell’s not in the south Jon objected

Yes it is Everything below the Wall’s south to us

He had never thought of it that way I suppose it’s all in where you’re standing

Aye Ygritte agreed It always is

Tell me Jon urged her It would be hours before Qhorin came up and a story would help keep him awake I want to hear this tale of yours

Might be you won’t like it much

I’ll hear it all the same

Brave black crow she mocked Well long before he was king over the free folk Bael was a great raider

Stonesnake gave a snort A murderer robber and raper is what you mean

That’s all in where you’re standing too Ygritte said The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael’s head but never could take him and the taste o’ failure galled him One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak When word o’ that got back Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson So he scaled the Wall skipped down the kingsroad and walked into Winterfell one winter’s night with harp in hand naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos Sygerrik means ‘deceiver’ in the Old Tongue that the First Men spoke and the giants still speak
