earth The elevators moved more slowly now and
disgorged fewer beings I knelt on the ground and pressed
my hands into the cinders wanting so badly to pull my
father free If theres a more helpless feeling than trying to
reach someone you love whos trapped underground I dont
know it The wounded The bodies The waiting through the
night Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers A
mug of something hot that you dont drink And then finally
at dawn the grieved expression on the face of the mine
captain that could only mean one thing
What did we just do
Katniss Are you there Haymitch is probably
making plans to have me fitted for a head shackle at this
very moment
I drop my hands Yes
Get inside Just in case the Capitol tries to retaliate
with whats left of its air force he instructs
Yes I repeat Everyone on the roof except for the
soldiers manning the machine guns begin to make their
way inside As I descend the stairs I cant help brushing my
fingers along the unblemished white marble walls So cold
and beautiful Even in the Capitol theres nothing to match
the magnificence of this old building But there is no give to
the surface--only my flesh yields my warmth taken Stone
conquers people every time
I sit at the base of one of the gigantic pillars in the
great entrance hall Through the doors I can see the white
expanse of marble that leads to the steps on the square I
remember how sick I was the day Peeta and I accepted
congratulations there for winning the Games Worn down by
the Victory Tour failing in my attempt to calm the districts
facing the memories of Clove and Cato particularly Catos
gruesome slow death by mutts
Boggs crouches down beside me his skin pale in the
shadows We didnt bomb the train tunnel you know
Some of them will probably get out
And then well shoot them when they show their
faces I ask
Only if we have to he answers
We could send in trains ourselves Help evacuate the
wounded I say
No It was decided to leave the tunnel in their hands
That way they can use all the tracks to bring people out
says Boggs Besides it will give us time to get the rest of
our soldiers to the square
A few hours ago the square was a no-mans-land the
front line of the fight between the rebels and the
Peacekeepers When Coin gave approval for Gales plan
the rebels launched a heated attack and drove the Capitol
forces back several blocks so that we would control the
train station in the event that the Nut fell Well its fallen The
reality has sunk in Any survivors will escape to the square I
can hear the gunfire starting again as the Peacekeepers
are no doubt trying to fight their way in to rescue their
comrades Our own soldiers are being brought in to counter
this
Youre cold says Boggs Ill see if I can find a
blanket He goes before I can protest I dont want a
blanket even if the marble continues to leech my body heat
Katniss says Haymitch in my ear
Still here I answer
Interesting turn of events with Peeta this afternoon
Thought youd want to know he says Interesting isnt
good It isnt better But I dont really have any choice but to
listen We showed him that clip of you singing The
Hanging Tree It was never aired so the Capitol couldnt
use it when he was being hijacked He says he recognized
the song
For a moment my heart skips a beat Then I realize its
just more tracker jacker serum confusion He couldnt
Haymitch He never heard me sing that song
Not you Your father He heard him singing it one day
when he came to trade at the bakery Peeta was small
probably six or seven but he remembered it because he
was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing
says Haymitch Guess they did
Six or seven That would have been before my mother
banned the song Maybe even right around the time I was
learning it Was I there too
Dont think so No mention of you anyway But its the
first connection to you that hasnt triggered some mental
meltdown says Haymitch Its something at least
Katniss
My father He seems to be everywhere today Dying in
the mine Singing his way into Peetas muddled
consciousness Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as
he protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders I
miss him so badly it hurts
The gunfires really picking up outside Gale hurries by
with a group of rebels eagerly headed for the battle I dont
petition to join the fighters not that they would let me I have
no stomach for it anyway no heat in my blood I wish Peeta
was here--the old Peeta--because he would be able to
articulate why it is so wrong to be exchanging fire when
people any people are trying to claw their way out of the
mountain Or is my own history making me too sensitive
Arent we at war Isnt this just another way to kill our
enemies
Night falls quickly Huge bright spotlights are turned
on illuminating the square Every bulb must be burning at
