wickedness among you

2015 And if a man lie with a beast he shall surely be put to death
and ye shall slay the beast

2016 And if a woman approach unto any beast and lie down thereto
thou shalt kill the woman and the beast they shall surely be put to
death their blood shall be upon them

2017 And if a man shall take his sister his fathers daughter or
his mothers daughter and see her nakedness and she see his
nakedness it is a wicked thing and they shall be cut off in the
sight of their people he hath uncovered his sisters nakedness he
shall bear his iniquity

2018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and
shall uncover her nakedness he hath discovered her fountain and she
hath uncovered the fountain of her blood and both of them shall be
cut off from among their people

2019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister
nor of thy fathers sister for he uncovereth his near kin they shall
bear their iniquity

2020 And if a man shall lie with his uncles wife he hath uncovered
his uncles nakedness they shall bear their sin they shall die
childless

2021 And if a man shall take his brothers wife it is an unclean
thing he hath uncovered his brothers nakedness they shall be
childless

2022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my judgments
and do them that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein spue
you not out

2023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation which I cast
out before you for they committed all these things and therefore I
abhorred them

2024 But I have said unto you Ye shall inherit their land and I
will give it unto you to possess it a land that floweth with milk and
honey I am the LORD your God which have separated you from other
people

2025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
unclean and between unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not make
your souls abominable by beast or by fowl or by any manner of living
thing that creepeth on the ground which I have separated from you as
unclean

2026 And ye shall be holy unto me for I the LORD am holy and have
severed you from other people that ye should be mine

2027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit or that is a
wizard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with
stones their blood shall be upon them

211 And the LORD said unto Moses Speak unto the priests the sons of
Aaron and say unto them There shall none be defiled for the dead
among his people 212 But for his kin that is near unto him that
is for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his
daughter and for his brother

213 And for his sister a virgin that is nigh unto him which hath
had no husband for her may he be defiled

214 But he shall not defile himself being a chief man among his
people to profane himself

215 They shall not make baldness upon their head neither shall they
shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their
flesh

216 They shall be holy unto their God and not profane the name of
their God for the offerings of the LORD made by fire and the bread
of their God they do offer therefore they shall be holy

217 They shall not take a wife that is a whore or profane neither
shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto
his God

218 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore for he offereth the bread of
thy God he shall be holy unto thee for I the LORD which sanctify
you am holy

219 And the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing
the whore she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire

2110 And he that is the high priest among his brethren upon whose
head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on
the garments shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes 2111
Neither shall he go in to any dead body nor defile himself for his
father or for his mother 2112 Neither shall he go out of the
sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God for the crown of the
anointing oil of his God is upon him I am the LORD

2113 And he shall take a wife in her virginity

2114 A widow or a divorced woman or profane or an harlot these
