765 And the Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the
most holy things till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim

766 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
hundred and threescore 767 Beside their manservants and their
maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty
and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and
singing women

768 Their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two
hundred forty and five 769 Their camels four hundred thirty and
five six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses

770 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work The
Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons
five hundred and thirty priests garments

771 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the
work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred
pound of silver

772 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and
seven priests garments

773 So the priests and the Levites and the porters and the
singers and some of the people and the Nethinims and all Israel
dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children
of Israel were in their cities

81 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into
the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto Ezra
the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the LORD had
commanded to Israel

82 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both
of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the
first day of the seventh month

83 And he read therein before the street that was before the water
gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and
those that could understand and the ears of all the people were
attentive unto the book of the law

84 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had
made for the purpose and beside him stood Mattithiah and Shema and
Anaiah and Urijah and Hilkiah and Maaseiah on his right hand and
on his left hand Pedaiah and Mishael and Malchiah and Hashum and
Hashbadana Zechariah and Meshullam

85 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he
was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood
up 86 And Ezra blessed the LORD the great God And all the people
answered Amen Amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed
their heads and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground

87 Also Jeshua and Bani and Sherebiah Jamin Akkub Shabbethai
Hodijah Maaseiah Kelita Azariah Jozabad Hanan Pelaiah and the
Levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood
in their place

88 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave
the sense and caused them to understand the reading

89 And Nehemiah which is the Tirshatha and Ezra the priest the
scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the
people This day is holy unto the LORD your God mourn not nor weep
For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law

810 Then he said unto them Go your way eat the fat and drink the
sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for
this day is holy unto our LORD neither be ye sorry for the joy of
the LORD is your strength

811 So the Levites stilled all the people saying Hold your peace
for the day is holy neither be ye grieved

812 And all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to
send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood
the words that were declared unto them

813 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
fathers of all the people the priests and the Levites unto Ezra the
scribe even to understand the words of the law

814 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by
Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast
of the seventh month 815 And that they should publish and proclaim
in all their cities and in Jerusalem saying Go forth unto the
mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle
branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make
booths as it is written

816 So the people went forth and brought them and made themselves
booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and
in the courts of the house of God and in the street of the water
gate and in the street of the gate of Ephraim

817 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
