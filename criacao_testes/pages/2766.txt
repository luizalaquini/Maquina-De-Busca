2120 And Ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with
him hid themselves Now Ornan was threshing wheat

2121 And as David came to Ornan Ornan looked and saw David and went
out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to David with his face to
the ground

2122 Then David said to Ornan Grant me the place of this
threshingfloor that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD thou
shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed
from the people

2123 And Ornan said unto David Take it to thee and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his eyes lo I give thee the oxen also
for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the
wheat for the meat offering I give it all

2124 And king David said to Ornan Nay but I will verily buy it for
the full price for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD
nor offer burnt offerings without cost

2125 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold
by weight

2126 And David built there an altar unto the LORD and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings and called upon the LORD and he
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering

2127 And the LORD commanded the angel and he put up his sword again
into the sheath thereof

2128 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite then he sacrificed there

2129 For the tabernacle of the LORD which Moses made in the
wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season
in the high place at Gibeon

2130 But David could not go before it to enquire of God for he was
afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD

221 Then David said This is the house of the LORD God and this is
the altar of the burnt offering for Israel

222 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in
the land of Israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build
the house of God

223 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without
weight 224 Also cedar trees in abundance for the Zidonians and they
of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David

225 And David said Solomon my son is young and tender and the house
that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical of
fame and of glory throughout all countries I will therefore now make
preparation for it So David prepared abundantly before his death

226 Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build an
house for the LORD God of Israel

227 And David said to Solomon My son as for me it was in my mind
to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God 228 But the word
of the LORD came to me saying Thou hast shed blood abundantly and
hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name
because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight

229 Behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest
and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his
name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel
in his days

2210 He shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and
I will be his father and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
over Israel for ever

2211 Now my son the LORD be with thee and prosper thou and build
the house of the LORD thy God as he hath said of thee

2212 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee
charge concerning Israel that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD
thy God

2213 Then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the
statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning
Israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed

2214 Now behold in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the
LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand
talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in
abundance timber also and stone have I prepared and thou mayest add
thereto

2215 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and
workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every
manner of work

2216 Of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is
no number Arise therefore and be doing and the LORD be with thee
