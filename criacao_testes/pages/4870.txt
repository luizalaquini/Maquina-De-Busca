the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars
according to the twelve tribes of Israel

245 And he sent young men of the children of Israel which offered
burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD

246 And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basons and half
of the blood he sprinkled on the altar

247 And he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of
the people and they said All that the LORD hath said will we do and
be obedient

248 And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and
said Behold the blood of the covenant which the LORD hath made with
you concerning all these words

249 Then went up Moses and Aaron Nadab and Abihu and seventy of
the elders of Israel 2410 And they saw the God of Israel and there
was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone and as
it were the body of heaven in his clearness

2411 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
hand also they saw God and did eat and drink

2412 And the LORD said unto Moses Come up to me into the mount and
be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and
commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them

2413 And Moses rose up and his minister Joshua and Moses went up
into the mount of God

2414 And he said unto the elders Tarry ye here for us until we come
again unto you and behold Aaron and Hur are with you if any man
have any matters to do let him come unto them

2415 And Moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount

2416 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai and the cloud
covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of
the midst of the cloud

2417 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel

2418 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into
the mount and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights

251 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 252 Speak unto the
children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that
giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering

253 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them gold and
silver and brass 254 And blue and purple and scarlet and fine
linen and goats hair 255 And rams skins dyed red and badgers
skins and shittim wood 256 Oil for the light spices for anointing
oil and for sweet incense 257 Onyx stones and stones to be set in
the ephod and in the breastplate

258 And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them

259 According to all that I shew thee after the pattern of the
tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so
shall ye make it

2510 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood two cubits and a
half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth
thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof

2511 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without
shalt thou overlay it and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round
about

2512 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it and put them in
the four corners thereof and two rings shall be in the one side of
it and two rings in the other side of it

2513 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood and overlay them
with gold

2514 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the
ark that the ark may be borne with them

2515 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark they shall not be
taken from it

2516 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give
thee

2517 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a
half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth
thereof

2518 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt
thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat

2519 And make one cherub on the one end and the other cherub on the
other end even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the
two ends thereof
