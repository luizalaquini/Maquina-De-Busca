The Hound sat on the bench closest the door His mouth twitched but only the burned side She ought to dip him in wildfire and cook him Or tickle him till the moon turns black He raised his wine cup and drained it straightaway

He’s one of them Arya thought when she saw that She bit her lip so hard she tasted blood He’s just like they are I should kill him when he sleeps

So Gregor took Harrenhal Sandor said

Didn’t require much taking said Polliver The sellswords fled as soon as they knew we were coming all but a few One of the cooks opened a postern gate for us to get back at Hoat for cutting off his foot He chuckled We kept him to cook for us a couple wenches to warm our beds and put all the rest to the sword

All the rest Arya blurted out

Well Ser kept Hoat to pass the time

Sandor said The Blackfish is still in Riverrun

Not for long said Polliver He’s under siege Old Frey’s going to hang Edmure Tully unless he yields the castle The only real fighting’s around Raventree Blackwoods and Brackens The Brackens are ours now

The Hound poured a cup of wine for Arya and another for himself and drank it down while staring at the hearthfire The little bird flew away did she Well bloody good for her She shit on the Imp’s head and flew off

They’ll find her said Polliver If it takes half the gold in Casterly Rock

A pretty girl I hear said the Tickler Honey sweet He smacked his lips and smiled

And courteous the Hound agreed A proper little lady Not like her bloody sister

They found her too said Polliver The sister She’s for Bolton’s bastard I hear

Arya sipped her wine so they could not see her mouth She didn’t understand what Polliver was talking about Sansa has no other sister Sandor Clegane laughed aloud

What’s so bloody funny asked Polliver

The Hound never flicked an eye at Arya If I’d wanted you to know I’d have told you Are there ships at Saltpans

Saltpans How should I know The traders are back at Maidenpool I heard Randyll Tarly took the castle and locked Mooton in a tower cell I haven’t heard shit about Saltpans

The Tickler leaned forward Would you put to sea without bidding farewell to your brother It gave Arya chills to hear him ask a question Ser would sooner you returned to Harrenhal with us Sandor I bet he would Or King’s Landing…

Bugger that Bugger him Bugger you

The Tickler shrugged straightened and reached a hand behind his head to rub the back of his neck Everything seemed to happen at once then Sandor lurched to his feet Polliver drew his longsword and the Tickler’s hand whipped around in a blur to send something silver flashing across the common room If the Hound had not been moving the knife might have cored the apple of his throat instead it only grazed his ribs and wound up quivering in the wall near the door He laughed then a laugh as cold and hollow as if it had come from the bottom of a deep well I was hoping you’d do something stupid His sword slid from its scabbard just in time to knock aside Polliver’s first cut

Arya took a step backward as the long steel song began The Tickler came off the bench with a shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other Even the chunky brown-haired squire was up fumbling for his swordhilt She snatched her wine cup off the table and threw it at his face Her aim was better than it had been at the Twins The cup hit him right on his big white pimple and he went down hard on his tail

Polliver was a grim methodical fighter and he pressed Sandor steadily backward his heavy longsword moving with brutal precision The Hound’s own cuts were sloppier his parries rushed his feet slow and clumsy He’s drunk Arya realized with dismay He drank too much too fast with no food in his belly And the Tickler was sliding around the wall to get behind him She grabbed the second wine cup and flung it at him but he was quicker than the squire had been and ducked his head in time The look he gave her then was cold with promise Is there gold hidden in the village she could hear him ask The stupid squire was clutching the edge of a table and pulling himself to his knees Arya could taste the beginnings of panic in the back of her throat Fear cuts deeper than swords Fears cuts deeper…

Sandor gave a grunt of pain The burned side of his face ran red from temple to cheek and the stub of his ear was gone That seemed to make him angry He drove back Polliver with a furious attack hammering at him with the old nicked longsword he had swapped for in the hills The bearded man gave way but none of the cuts so much as touched him And then the Tickler leapt over a bench quick as a snake and slashed at the back of the Hound’s neck with the edge of his short sword

They’re killing him Arya had no more cups but there was something better to throw She drew the dagger they’d robbed off the dying archer and tried to fling it at the Tickler the way he’d done It wasn’t the same as throwing a rock or a crabapple though The knife wobbled and hit him in the arm hilt first He never even felt it He was too intent on Clegane

As he stabbed Clegane twisted violently aside winning himself half a heartbeat’s respite Blood ran down his face and from the gash in his neck Both of the Mountain’s men came after him hard Polliver hacking at his head and shoulders while the Tickler darted in to stab at back and belly The heavy stone flagon was still on the table Arya grabbed it with two hands but as she lifted it someone grabbed her arm The flagon slipped from her fingers and crashed to the floor Wrenched around she found herself nose to nose with the squire You stupid you forgot all about him His big white pimple had burst she saw

Are you the puppy’s puppy He had his sword in his right hand and her arm in his left but her own hands were free so she jerked his knife from its sheath and sheathed it again in his belly twisting He wasn’t wearing mail or even boiled leather so it went right in the same way Needle had when she killed the stableboy at King’s Landing The squire’s eyes got big and he let go of her arm Arya spun to the door and wrenched the Tickler’s knife from the wall

Polliver and the Tickler had driven the Hound into a corner behind a bench and one of them had given him an ugly red gash on his upper thigh to go with his other wounds Sandor was leaning against the wall bleeding and breathing noisily He looked as though he could barely stand let alone fight Throw down the sword and we’ll take you back to Harrenhal Polliver told him
