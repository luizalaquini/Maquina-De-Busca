All The burnt half of his face was a mask of dried blood Bloody dwarf Should have killed him Years ago

He’s dead they say

Dead No Bugger that I don’t want him dead He cast the empty flagon aside I want him burned If the gods are good they’ll burn him but I won’t be here to see I’m going

Going She tried to wriggle free but his grasp was iron

The little bird repeats whatever she hears Going yes

Where will you go

Away from here Away from the fires Go out the Iron Gate I suppose North somewhere anywhere

You won’t get out Sansa said The queen’s closed up Maegor’s and the city gates are shut as well

Not to me I have the white cloak And I have this He patted the pommel of his sword The man who tries to stop me is a dead man Unless he’s on fire He laughed bitterly

Why did you come here

You promised me a song little bird Have you forgotten

She didn’t know what he meant She couldn’t sing for him now here with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands I can’t she said Let me go you’re scaring me

Everything scares you Look at me Look at me

The blood masked the worst of his scars but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again Sansa could smell him a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit and over it all the reek of blood blood blood

I could keep you safe he rasped They’re all afraid of me No one would hurt you again or I’d kill them He yanked her closer and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss her He was too strong to fight She closed her eyes wanting it to be over but nothing happened Still can’t bear to look can you she heard him say He gave her arm a hard wrench pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed I’ll have that song Florian and Jonquil you said His dagger was out poised at her throat Sing little bird Sing for your little life

Her throat was dry and tight with fear and every song she had ever known had fled from her mind Please don’t kill me she wanted to scream please don’t She could feel him twisting the point pushing it into her throat and she almost closed her eyes again but then she remembered It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil but it was a song Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

She had forgotten the other verses When her voice trailed off she feared he might kill her but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat never speaking

Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers The room was too dark for her to see him but she could feel the stickiness of the blood and a wetness that was not blood Little bird he said once more his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone Then he rose from the bed Sansa heard cloth ripping followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps

When she crawled out of bed long moments later she was alone She found his cloak on the floor twisted up tight the white wool stained by blood and fire The sky outside was darker by then with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars A chill wind was blowing banging the shutters Sansa was cold She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor shivering
