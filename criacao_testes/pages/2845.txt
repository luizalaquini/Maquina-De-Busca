tabernacle

2027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise
up against him

2028 The increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow
away in the day of his wrath

2029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God and the heritage
appointed unto him by God

211 But Job answered and said 212 Hear diligently my speech and
let this be your consolations

213 Suffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken mock
on

214 As for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should
not my spirit be troubled  215 Mark me and be astonished and lay
your hand upon your mouth

216 Even when I remember I am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my
flesh

217 Wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in
power  218 Their seed is established in their sight with them and
their offspring before their eyes

219 Their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of God upon
them

2110 Their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and
casteth not her calf

2111 They send forth their little ones like a flock and their
children dance

2112 They take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the
organ

2113 They spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the
grave

2114 Therefore they say unto God Depart from us for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways

2115 What is the Almighty that we should serve him and what profit
should we have if we pray unto him  2116 Lo their good is not in
their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me

2117 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh
their destruction upon them God distributeth sorrows in his anger

2118 They are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away

2119 God layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him
and he shall know it

2120 His eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the
wrath of the Almighty

2121 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the
number of his months is cut off in the midst  2122 Shall any teach
God knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high

2123 One dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet

2124 His breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with
marrow

2125 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never
eateth with pleasure

2126 They shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover
them

2127 Behold I know your thoughts and the devices which ye
wrongfully imagine against me

2128 For ye say Where is the house of the prince and where are the
dwelling places of the wicked  2129 Have ye not asked them that go
by the way and do ye not know their tokens 2130 That the wicked is
reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the
day of wrath

2131 Who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him
what he hath done  2132 Yet shall he be brought to the grave and
shall remain in the tomb

2133 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man
shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him

2134 How then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there
remaineth falsehood  221 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and
said 222 Can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be
profitable unto himself  223 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty
that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy
ways perfect  224 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he
enter with thee into judgment  225 Is not thy wickedness great and
