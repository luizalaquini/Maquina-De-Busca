241 And Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the LORD had
blessed Abraham in all things

242 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled
over all that he had Put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh 243
And I will make thee swear by the LORD the God of heaven and the God
of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell 244 But thou shalt
go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
Isaac

245 And the servant said unto him Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest  246 And Abraham said unto
him Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again

247 The LORD God of heaven which took me from my fathers house and
from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware
unto me saying Unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send
his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
thence

248 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou
shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again

249 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
master and sware to him concerning that matter

2410 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and
departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he
arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of Nahor

2411 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well
of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out
to draw water

2412 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham I pray thee send
me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master Abraham

2413 Behold I stand here by the well of water and the daughters of
the men of the city come out to draw water 2414 And let it come to
pass that the damsel to whom I shall say Let down thy pitcher I
pray thee that I may drink and she shall say Drink and I will give
thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed
for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed
kindness unto my master

2415 And it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold
Rebekah came out who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah the wife of
Nahor Abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder

2416 And the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had
any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her
pitcher and came up

2417 And the servant ran to meet her and said Let me I pray thee
drink a little water of thy pitcher

2418 And she said Drink my lord and she hasted and let down her
pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink

2419 And when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw
water for thy camels also until they have done drinking

2420 And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran
again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels

2421 And the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the
LORD had made his journey prosperous or not

2422 And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets
for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold 2423 And said Whose
daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there room in thy fathers
house for us to lodge in  2424 And she said unto him I am the
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah which she bare unto Nahor

2425 She said moreover unto him We have both straw and provender
enough and room to lodge in

2426 And the man bowed down his head and worshipped the LORD

2427 And he said Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham who
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being
in the way the LORD led me to the house of my masters brethren

2428 And the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these
things

2429 And Rebekah had a brother and his name was Laban and Laban ran
out unto the man unto the well

2430 And it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
his sisters hands and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister
saying Thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and
behold he stood by the camels at the well

2431 And he said Come in thou blessed of the LORD wherefore
standest thou without for I have prepared the house and room for the
camels
