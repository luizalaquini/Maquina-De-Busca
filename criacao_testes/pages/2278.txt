The water had grown cool When Jaime opened his eyes he found himself staring at the stump of his sword hand The hand that made me Kingslayer The goat had robbed him of his glory and his shame both at once Leaving what Who am I now

The wench looked ridiculous clutching her towel to her meager teats with her thick white legs sticking out beneath Has my tale turned you speechless Come curse me or kiss me or call me a liar Something

If this is true how is it no one knows

The knights of the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king’s secrets Would you have me break my oath Jaime laughed Do you think the noble Lord of Winterfell wanted to hear my feeble explanations Such an honorable man He only had to look at me to judge me guilty Jaime lurched to his feet the water running cold down his chest By what right does the wolf judge the lion By what right A violent shiver took him and he smashed his stump against the rim of the tub as he tried to climb out

Pain shuddered through him    and suddenly the bathhouse was spinning Brienne caught him before he could fall Her arm was all gooseflesh clammy and chilled but she was strong and gentler than he would have thought Gentler than Cersei he thought as she helped him from the tub his legs wobbly as a limp cock Guards he heard the wench shout The Kingslayer

Jaime he thought my name is Jaime

The next he knew he was lying on the damp floor with the guards and the wench and Qyburn all standing over him looking concerned Brienne was naked but she seemed to have forgotten that for the moment The heat of the tubs will do it Maester Qyburn was telling them No he’s not a maester they took his chain There’s still poison in his blood as well and he’s malnourished What have you been feeding him

Worms and piss and grey vomit offered Jaime

Hardbread and water and oat porridge insisted the guard He don’t hardly eat it though What should we do with him

Scrub him and dress him and carry him to Kingspyre if need be Qyburn said Lord Bolton insists he will sup with him tonight The time is growing short

Bring me clean garb for him Brienne said I’ll see that he’s washed and dressed

The others were all too glad to give her the task They lifted him to his feet and sat him on a stone bench by the wall Brienne went away to retrieve her towel and returned with a stiff brush to finish scrubbing him One of the guards gave her a razor to trim his beard Qyburn returned with roughspun smallclothes clean black woolen breeches a loose green tunic and a leather jerkin that laced up the front Jaime was feeling less dizzy by then though no less clumsy With the wench’s help he managed to dress himself Now all I need is a silver looking glass

The Bloody Maester had brought fresh clothing for Brienne as well a stained pink satin gown and a linen undertunic I am sorry my lady These were the only women’s garments in Harrenhal large enough to fit you

It was obvious at once that the gown had been cut for someone with slimmer arms shorter legs and much fuller breasts The fine Myrish lace did little to conceal the bruising that mottled Brienne’s skin All in all the garb made the wench look ludicrous She has thicker shoulders than I do and a bigger neck Jaime thought Small wonder she prefers to dress in mail Pink was not a kind color for her either A dozen cruel japes leaped into his head but for once he kept them there Best not to make her angry he was no match for her one-handed

Qyburn had brought a flask as well What is it Jaime demanded when the chainless maester pressed him to drink

Licorice steeped in vinegar with honey and cloves It will give you some strength and clear your head

Bring me the potion that grows new hands said Jaime That’s the one I want

Drink it Brienne said unsmiling and he did

It was half an hour before he felt strong enough to stand After the dim wet warmth of the bathhouse the air outside was a slap across the face M’lord will be looking for him by now a guard told Qyburn Her too Do I need to carry him

I can still walk Brienne give me your arm

Clutching her Jaime let them herd him across the yard to a vast draughty hall larger even than the throne room in King’s Landing Huge hearths lined the walls one every ten feet or so more than he could count but no fires had been lit so the chill between the walls went bone-deep A dozen spearmen in fur cloaks guarded the doors and the steps that led up to the two galleries above And in the center of that immense emptiness at a trestle table surrounded by what seemed like acres of smooth slate floor the Lord of the Dreadfort waited attended only by a cupbearer

My lord said Brienne when they stood before him

Roose Bolton’s eyes were paler than stone darker than milk and his voice was spider soft I am pleased that you are strong enough to attend me ser My lady do be seated He gestured at the spread of cheese bread cold meat and fruit that covered the table Will you drink red or white Of indifferent vintage I fear Ser Amory drained Lady Whent’s cellars nearly dry

I trust you killed him for it Jaime slid into the offered seat quickly so Bolton could not see how weak he was White is for Starks I’ll drink red like a good Lannister

I would prefer water said Brienne

Elmar the red for Ser Jaime water for the Lady Brienne and hippocras for myself Bolton waved a hand at their escort dismissing them and the men beat a silent retreat

Habit made Jaime reach for his wine with his right hand His stump rocked the goblet spattering his clean linen bandages with bright red spots and forcing him to catch the cup with his left hand before it fell but Bolton pretended not to notice his clumsiness The northman helped himself to a prune and ate it with small sharp bites Do try these Ser Jaime They are most sweet and help move the bowels as well Lord Vargo took them from an inn before he burnt it

My bowels move fine that goat’s no lord and your prunes don’t interest me half so much as your intentions

Regarding you A faint smile touched Roose Bolton’s lips You are a perilous prize ser You sow dissension wherever you go Even here in my happy house of Harrenhal His voice was a whisker above a whisper And in Riverrun as well it seems Do you know Edmure Tully has offered a thousand golden dragons for your recapture

Is that all My sister will pay ten times as much

Will she That smile again there for an instant gone as quick Ten thousand dragons is a formidable sum Of course there is Lord Karstark’s offer to consider as well He promises the hand of his daughter to the man who brings him your head

Leave it to your goat to get it backward said Jaime

Bolton gave a soft chuckle Harrion Karstark was captive here when we took the castle did you know I gave him all the Karhold men still with me and sent him off with Glover I do hope nothing ill befell him at Duskendale    else Alys Karstark would be all that remains of Lord Rickard’s progeny He chose another prune Fortunately for you I have no need of a wife I wed the Lady Walda Frey whilst I was at the Twins

Fair Walda Awkwardly Jaime tried to hold the bread with his stump while tearing it with his left hand

Fat Walda My lord of Frey offered me my bride’s weight in silver for a dowry so I chose accordingly Elmar break off some bread for Ser Jaime

The boy tore a fist-sized chunk off one end of the loaf and handed it to Jaime Brienne tore her own bread Lord Bolton she asked it’s said you mean to give Harrenhal to Vargo Hoat

That was his price Lord Bolton said The Lannisters are not the only men who pay their debts I must take my leave soon in any case Edmure Tully is to wed the Lady Roslin Frey at the Twins and my king commands my attendance

Edmure weds said Jaime Not Robb Stark

His Grace King Robb is wed Bolton spit a prune pit into his hand and put it aside To a Westerling of the Crag I am told her name is Jeyne No doubt you know her ser Her father is your father’s bannerman

My father has a good many bannermen and most of them have daughters Jaime groped one-handed for his goblet trying to recall this Jeyne The Westerlings were an old house with more pride than power

This cannot be true Brienne said stubbornly King Robb was sworn to wed a Frey He would never break faith he—

His Grace is a boy of sixteen said Roose Bolton mildly And I would thank you not to question my word my lady

Jaime felt almost sorry for Robb Stark He won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber poor fool How does Lord Walder relish dining on trout in place of wolf he asked

Oh trout makes for a tasty supper Bolton lifted a pale finger toward his cupbearer Though my poor Elmar is bereft He was to wed Arya Stark but my good father of Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when King Robb betrayed him

Is there word of Arya Stark Brienne leaned forward Lady Catelyn had feared that    is the girl still alive

Oh yes said the Lord of the Dreadfort

You have certain knowledge of that my lord

Roose Bolton shrugged Arya Stark was lost for a time it was true but now she has been found I mean to see her returned safely to the north

Her and her sister both said Brienne Tyrion Lannister has promised us both girls for his brother

That seemed to amuse the Lord of the Dreadfort My lady has no one told you Lannisters lie
