166 Then Asa the king took all Judah and they carried away the
stones of Ramah and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha was
building and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah

167 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and
said unto him Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria and not
relied on the LORD thy God therefore is the host of the king of Syria
escaped out of thine hand

168 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host with very
many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the LORD
he delivered them into thine hand

169 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him Herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from
henceforth thou shalt have wars

1610 Then Asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house
for he was in a rage with him because of this thing And Asa oppressed
some of the people the same time

1611 And behold the acts of Asa first and last lo they are
written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel

1612 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease
he sought not to the LORD but to the physicians

1613 And Asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth
year of his reign

1614 And they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for
himself in the city of David and laid him in the bed which was filled
with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him

171 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened
himself against Israel

172 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah and set
garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which
Asa his father had taken

173 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first
ways of his father David and sought not unto Baalim 174 But sought
to the Lord God of his father and walked in his commandments and not
after the doings of Israel

175 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand and all
Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in
abundance

176 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD moreover he
took away the high places and groves out of Judah

177 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even
to Benhail and to Obadiah and to Zechariah and to Nethaneel and to
Michaiah to teach in the cities of Judah

178 And with them he sent Levites even Shemaiah and Nethaniah and
Zebadiah and Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan and Adonijah
and Tobijah and Tobadonijah Levites and with them Elishama and
Jehoram priests

179 And they taught in Judah and had the book of the law of the LORD
with them and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and
taught the people

1710 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
that were round about Judah so that they made no war against
Jehoshaphat

1711 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and
tribute silver and the Arabians brought him flocks seven thousand
and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats

1712 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in Judah
castles and cities of store

1713 And he had much business in the cities of Judah and the men of
war mighty men of valour were in Jerusalem

1714 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
their fathers Of Judah the captains of thousands Adnah the chief
and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand

1715 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain and with him two
hundred and fourscore thousand

1716 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri who willingly
offered himself unto the LORD and with him two hundred thousand
mighty men of valour

1717 And of Benjamin Eliada a mighty man of valour and with him
armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand

1718 And next him was Jehozabad and with him an hundred and
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war
