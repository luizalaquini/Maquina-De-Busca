situation in the waistband of his trousers which also
lay at a remote height under his waistcoat the watch
was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to
one-side compressing the- mouth and face to a mere
mass of- ruddy flesh- on account -of the exertion and
drawing up the watch by its chain like a bucket from a
well
But some thoughtfull persons who had seen him
walking across one of his fields on a certain December
morning -- sunny and exceedingly mild -- might have
regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these In
his face one might notice that many of the hues and
curves of youth had tarried on to manhood there even
remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy
His height and breadth would have been sufficient to
make his presence imposing had they been exhibited
with due consideration But there is a way some men
have rural and urban alike for which the mind is more
responsible than flesh and sinew  it is a way of curtail+
ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them
And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him
P 53
that he had no great claim on the worlds room Oak
walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible
bend yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders
This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he
depends for his valuation more upon his appearance
than upon his capacity to wear well which Oak did not
He had just reached the time of life at which  young
is ceasing to be the prefix of man  in speaking of one
He was at the brightest period of masculine growth
for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated 
he had passed the time during which the influence of
youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
of impulse and he had not yet arrived at the stage
wherein they become united again in the character of
prejudice by the influence of a wife and family In
short he was twenty-eight and a bachelor
The field he was in this morning sloped to a
ridge called Norcombe Hill Through a spur of this
hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk+
Newton Casually glancing over the hedge Oak saw
coming down the incline before him an ornamental
spring waggon painted yellow and gaily marked
drawn by two horses a waggoner walking alongside
bearing a whip perpendicularly The waggon was
laden with household goods and window plants and
on the apex of the whole sat a woman young-and
attractive Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
than half a minute when the vehicle was brought to a
standstill just beneath his eyes
 The tailboard of the waggon is gone Miss said the
waggoner
Then I heard it fall said the girl in a soft though
not particularly low voice I heard a noise I could
not account for when we were coming up the hill
Ill run back +
 Do she answered +
The sensible horses stood -- perfectly still and the
waggoners steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance
The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless
surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards
backed by an oak settle and ornamented in front by
pots of geraniums myrtles and cactuses together with
P 54
a caged canary -- all probably from the windows of the
house just vacated There was also a cat in a willow
basket from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed
with half-closed eyes and affectionately-surveyed the
small birds around
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her
place and the only sound heard in the stillness-was -the
hopping of the canary up-and down the perches of its
prison Then she looked attentively downwards It
was not at the bird nor at the cat it was at an oblong
package tied in paper and lying between them She
turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming
He was not yet in sight and her-eyes crept back to
the package her thoughts seeming to run upon what
was inside it At length she drew the article into her
lap and untied the paper covering a small swing
looking-glass was disclosed in which she proceeded to
survey herself attentively She parted her lips and
smiled
It was a fine morning and the sun lighted up to a
scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore and painted
a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair The
myrtles geraniums and cactuses packed around her
were fresh and green and at such a leafless season they
invested the whole concern of horses waggon furniture
and girl with a peculiar vernal charm What possessed
her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the
sparrows blackbirds and unperceived farmer who were
alone its spectators -- whether the smile began as a
factitious one to test her capacity in that art -- nobody
knows  it ended certainly in a real smile She blushed
at herself and seeing her reflection blush blushed the
more
The change from the customary spot and necessary
