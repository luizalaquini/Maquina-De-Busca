if the maximum loudness within a tentative syllable falls too
far short of the overall maximum for the utterance
more than 20 dB one boundary is discarded
LE
The question of which boundary to discard can be decided by
examining the voicing continuity of the utterance
If possible voicing across a syllable boundary should be avoided
Otherwise the boundary with the smallest hull-loudness
difference should be rejected

FG Table 81  Success of the syllable segmentation procedure
pp
Table 81 illustrates the success of this syllabification
procedure in a particular example
Segmentation is performed with less than 10 of extraneous
boundaries being inserted
and much less than 10 of actual boundaries being missed
These figures are rather sensitive to the values of the
three thresholds
The values were chosen to err on the side
of over-zealous syllabification because all the boundaries need to be checked
by ear and eye and it is easier to delete
a boundary by hand than to insert one at an appropriate place
It may well be that with careful optimization of thresholds
better figures could be
achieved
rh Stressed and unstressed syllables
If the source and target utterances have the same number of
syllables and the same pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables
pitch can simply be transferred from a syllable in the source
to the corresponding one in the target
But if the pattern differs em even though the
number of syllables may be the same as in eleven and seventeen em
then a one-to-one mapping will conflict with the stress points
and certainly sound unnatural
Hence an attempt should be made to ensure that the pitch is mapped in a
plausible way
pp
The syllables of each utterance can be classified as stressed
and unstressed
This distinction could be made automatically by
inspection of the pitch contour within the domain of utterances used
and possibly even in general Lea

However in many cases it is expedient to perform the job by hand
In our example the sentences have fixed carrier parts and
variable number parts
The stressed carrier syllables namely
LB
 price  dol-  cents
LE
can be marked as such by hand
to facilitate proper alignment between the source and target
This marking would be difficult to do automatically
because it would be hard to distinguish the carrier from the numbers
pp
Even after classifying the syllables as carrier stressed
stressed and unstressed alignment still presents problems
because the configuration of syllables in the variable parts
of the utterances may differ
Syllables in the source which have no
correspondence in the target can be ignored
The pitch track of
the source syllable can be replicated for each
additional syllable in corresponding
position in the target
Of course a stressed syllable should be selected for copying
if the unmatched target syllable is stressed
and similarly for unstressed ones
It is rather dangerous to copy exactly a part of a pitch
contour for the ear is very sensitive to the juxtaposition of
identically intoned segments of speech em especially when the segment is stressed
To avoid this whenever a stressed syllable is replicated the
pitch values should be decreased by say 20 on the second copy
It sometimes happens that a single stressed syllable in the source
needs to cover a stressed-unstressed pair in the target  in
this case the first part of the source pitch track can be used
for the stressed syllable and the remainder for the
