Ser Jorah Mormont said The Western Market will have food more to your taste Your Grace The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares The khal will honor his promise in his own time

He had better Viserys said grimly I was promised a crown and I mean to have it The dragon is not mocked Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret’s head he rode off to inspect it more closely

Dany was relieved yet no less anxious I pray that my sun-and-stars will not keep him waiting too long she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot

The knight looked after Viserys doubtfully Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos There is no place for him in a khalasar Illyrio tried to warn him

He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand My lord husband promised a golden crown

Ser Jorah grunted Yes Khaleesi but… the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the west I have told him as much as Illyrio told him but your brother does not listen The horselords are no traders Viserys thinks he sold you and now he wants his price Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift He will give Viserys a gift in return yes… in his own time You do not demand a gift not of a khal You do not demand anything of a khal

It is not right to make him wait Dany did not know why she was defending her brother yet she was Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers

Ser Jorah snorted Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms

Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone What… what if it were not Viserys she asked If it were someone else who led them Someone stronger Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms

Ser Jorah’s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway When I first went into exile I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians as wild as their horses If you had asked me then Princess I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki

But if I asked you now

Now the knight said I am less certain They are better riders than any knight utterly fearless and their bows outrange ours In the Seven Kingdoms most archers fight on foot from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes The Dothraki fire from horseback charging or retreating it makes no matter they are full as deadly… and there are so many of them my lady Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar

Is that truly so many

Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident Ser Jorah admitted but of that number no more than a tenth were knights The rest were archers freeriders and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes When Rhaegar fell many threw down their weapons and fled the field How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain

Not long she said not well

He nodded Mind you Princess if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose it will never come to that The riders have no taste for siegecraft I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle…

Is he Dany asked A fool I mean

Ser Jorah considered that for a moment Robert should have been born Dothraki he said at last Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand The Usurper would agree He is a strong man brave… and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field But the men around him well their pipers play a different tune His brother Stannis Lord Tywin Lannister Eddard Stark… He spat

You hate this Lord Stark Dany said

He took from me all I loved for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor Ser Jorah said bitterly From his tone she could tell the loss still pained him He changed the subject quickly There he announced pointing Vaes Dothrak The city of the horselords

Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Western Market down the broad ways beyond Dany followed close on her silver staring at the strangeness about her Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that she had ever known She thought it must be ten times as large as Pentos a vastness without walls or limits its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers In the Free Cities of the west towers and manses and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously baking in the warm sun ancient arrogant and empty

Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes She saw carved stone pavilions manses of woven grass as large as castles rickety wooden towers stepped pyramids faced with marble log halls open to the sky In place of walls some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges None of them are alike she said

Your brother had part of the truth Ser Jorah admitted The Dothraki do not build A thousand years ago to make a house they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they’ve plundered and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples

Most of the halls even the largest seemed deserted Where are the people who live here Dany asked The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting but elsewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business

Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city them and their slaves and servants Ser Jorah replied yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar should all the khals return to the Mother at once The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children

Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade with the Mother of Mountains looming overhead Dany smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio’s slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver The palace was a cavernous wooden feasting hall its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet its roof sewn silk a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains or lowered to admit the endless sky Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges firepits and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills covered with grass

A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo’s arrival As each rider swung down from his saddle he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave and any other weapons he carried as well Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt Ser Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak or to shed a free man’s blood Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight of the Mother of Mountains In this place the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed all Dothraki were one blood one khalasar one herd
