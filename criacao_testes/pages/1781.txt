bury till Boldwoods indignation had cooled the second
to listen to Oaks entreaties and Boldwoods denuncia+
tions and give up Troy altogether
Alas Could she give up this new love -- induce
him to renounce her by saying she did not like him --
could no more speak to him and beg him for her good
to end his furlough in Bath and see her and Weather
bury no niore
It was a picture full of misery but for a while she
contemplated it firmly allowing herself nevertheless
as girls will to
P 272
dwell upon the happy life she would
have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood and the path
of love the path of duty -- inflicting upon herself gratuit+
ous tortures by imagining him the lover of another
woman after forgetting her for she had penetrated
Troys nature so far as to estimate his tendencies pretty
accurately hut unfortunately loved him no less in
thinking that he might soon cease to love her -- indeed
considerably more
She jumped to her feet She would see him at once
Yes she would implore him by word of mouth to assist
her in this dilemma A letter to keep him away could
not reach him in time even if he should be disposed to
listen to it
Was Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact
that the support of a lovers arms is not of a kind best
calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him Or was
she sophistically sensible with a thrill of pleasure that
by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was
ensuring a meeting with him at any rate once more
It was now dark and the hour must have been nearly
ten The only way to accomplish her purpose was to
give up her idea of visiting Liddy at Yalbury return to
Weatherbury Farm put the horse into the gig and drive
at once to Bath The scheme seemed at first impossible 
the journey was a fearfully heavy one even for a strong
horse at her own estimate and she much underrated
the distance It was most venturesome for a woman
at night and alone
But could she go on to Liddys and leave things to
take their course No no anything but that Bath+
sheba was full of a stimulating turbulence beside which
caution vainly prayed for a hearing she turned back
towards the village
Her walk was slow for she wished not to enter
Weatherbury till the cottagers were in bed and par+
ticularly till Boldwood was secure Her plan was now
to drive to Bath during the night see Sergeant Troy in
the morning before he set out to come to her bid him
farewell and dismiss him then to rest the horse
thoroughly herself to weep the while she thought
starting early the next morning on her return journey
By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently all
the day reach
P 273
Liddy at Yalbury in the evening and
come home to Weatherbury with her whenever they
chose -- so nobody would know she had been to Bath
at all
Such was Bathshebas scheme But in her topo+
graphical ignorance as a late comer to the place slie
misreckoned the distance of her journey as not much
more than half what it really was Her idea however
she proceeded to carry out with what initial success we
have already seen

IN THE SUN -- A HARBINGER
A WEEK passed and there were no tidings of Bath+
sheba nor was there any explanation of her Gilpins
rig
Then a note came for Maryann stating that the
business which had called her mistress to Bath still
detained her there but that she hoped to return
in the course of another week
Another week passed The oat-harvest began and
all the men were a-field under a monochromatic Lammas
sky amid the trembling air and short shadows of noon
Indoors nothing was to be heard save the droning of
blue-bottle flies out-of-doors the whetting of scythes
and the hiss of tressy oat-ears rubbing together as their
perpendicular stalks of amber-yellow fell heavily to each
swath Every drop of moisture not in the mens bottles
and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira+
tion from their foreheads and cheeks Drought was
everywhere else
They were about to withdraw for a while into the
charitable shade of a tree in the fence when Coggan
saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running
to them across the field
I wonder who that is he said
I hope nothing is wrong about mistress said
Maryann who with some other women was tying the
bundles oats being always sheafed on this farm but
an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning
l went to unlock the door and dropped the key and it
fell upon the stone floor and broke into two pieces
Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement I wish misess
