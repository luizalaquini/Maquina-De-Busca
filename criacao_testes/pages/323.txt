Your words were blunt and strong

And true

And true Yet you have no proof Of this incest No more than you did a year ago

There’s proof of a sort at Storm’s End Robert’s bastard The one he fathered on my wedding night in the very bed they’d made up for me and my bride Delena was a Florent and a maiden when he took her so Robert acknowledged the babe Edric Storm they call him He is said to be the very image of my brother If men were to see him and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen they could not help but wonder I would think

Yet how are men to see him if he is at Storm’s End

Stannis drummed his fingers on the Painted Table It is a difficulty One of many He raised his eyes You have more to say about the letter Well get on with it I did not make you a knight so you could learn to mouth empty courtesies I have my lords for that Say what you would say Davos

Davos bowed his head There was a phrase at the end How did it go Done in the Light of the Lord…

Yes The king’s jaw was clenched

Your people will mislike those words

As you did said Stannis sharply

If you were to say instead Done in the sight of gods and men or By the grace of the gods old and new…

Have you gone devout on me smuggler

That was to be my question for you my liege

Was it now It sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new maester

I do not know this Lord of Light Davos admitted but I knew the gods we burned this morning The Smith has kept my ships safe while the Mother has given me seven strong sons

Your wife has given you seven strong sons Do you pray to her It was wood we burned this morning

That may be so Davos said but when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a copper sometimes the septons would feed me

I feed you now

You have given me an honored place at your table And in return I give you truth Your people will not love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped and give them one whose very name sounds queer on their tongues

Stannis stood abruptly R’hllor Why is that so hard They will not love me you say When have they ever loved me How can I lose something I have never owned He moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship I vowed In King’s Landing the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven but all I ever saw of either was made by men

If you do not believe in gods—

—why trouble with this new one Stannis broke in I have asked myself as well I know little and care less of gods but the red priestess has power

Yes but what sort of power Cressen had wisdom

I trusted in his wisdom and your wiles and what did they avail me smuggler The storm lords sent you packing I went to them a beggar and they laughed at me Well there will be no more begging and no more laughing either The Iron Throne is mine by rights but how am I to take it There are four kings in the realm and three of them have more men and more gold than I do I have ships… and I have her The red woman Half my knights are afraid even to say her name did you know If she can do nothing else a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised A frightened man is a beaten man And perhaps she can do more I mean to find out

When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health Proudwing I named her She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand but she would not soar Time and again I would take her hawking but she never flew higher than the treetops Robert called her Weakwing He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike One day our great-uncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing he said and he was right Stannis Baratheon turned away from the window and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea The Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow It is time I tried another hawk Davos A red hawk
