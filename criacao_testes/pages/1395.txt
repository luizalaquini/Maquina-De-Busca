The Magnar of Thenn studied Jon with his chilly grey eyes We shall learn their numbers soon enough he said after a moment Go I will send for you if I have further questions

Jon bowed his head stiffly and went If all the wildlings were like Styr it would be easier to betray them The Thenns were not like other free folk though The Magnar claimed to be the last of the First Men and ruled with an iron hand His little land of Thenn was a high mountain valley hidden amongst the northernmost peaks of the Frostfangs surrounded by cave dwellers Hornfoot men giants and the cannibal clans of the ice rivers Ygritte said the Thenns were savage fighters and that their Magnar was a god to them Jon could believe that Unlike Jarl and Harma and Rattleshirt Styr commanded absolute obedience from his men and that discipline was no doubt part of why Mance had chosen him to go over the Wall

He walked past the Thenns sitting atop their rounded bronze helms about their cookfires Where did Ygrette get herself to He found her gear and his together but no sign of the girl herself She took a torch and went off that way Grigg the Goat told him pointing toward the back of the cavern

Jon followed his finger and found himself in a dim back room wandering through a maze of columns and stalactites She can’t be here he was thinking when he heard her laugh He turned toward the sound but within ten paces he was in a dead end facing a blank wall of rose and white flowstone Baffled he made his way back the way he’d come and then he saw it a dark hole under an outthrust of wet stone He knelt listened heard the faint sound of water Ygritte

In here her voice came back echoing faintly

Jon had to crawl a dozen paces before the cave opened up around him When he stood again it took his eyes a moment to adjust Ygritte had brought a torch but there was no other light She stood beside a little waterfall that fell from a cleft in the rock down into a wide dark pool The orange and yellow flames shone against the pale green water

What are you doing here he asked her

I heard water I wanted t’see how deep the cave went She pointed with the torch There’s a passage goes down further I followed it a hundred paces before I turned back

A dead end

You know nothing Jon Snow It went on and on and on There are hundreds o’ caves in these hills and down deep they all connect There’s even a way under your Wall Gorne’s Way

Gorne said Jon Gorne was King-beyond-the-Wall

Aye said Ygritte Together with his brother Gendel three thousand years ago They led a host o’ free folk through the caves and the Watch was none the wiser But when they come out the wolves o’ Winterfell fell upon them

There was a battle Jon recalled Gorne slew the King in the North but his son picked up his banner and took the crown from his head and cut down Gorne in turn

And the sound o’ swords woke the crows in their castles and they rode out all in black to take the free folk in the rear

Yes Gendel had the king to the south the Umbers to the east and the Watch to the north of him He died as well

You know nothing Jon Snow Gendel did not die He cut his way free through the crows and led his people back north with the wolves howling at their heels Only Gendel did not know the caves as Gorne had and took a wrong turn She swept the torch back and forth so the shadows jumped and moved Deeper he went and deeper and when he tried t’ turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in stone rather than sky Soon his torches began t’ fail one by one till finally there was naught but dark Gendel’s folk were never seen again but on a still night you can hear their children’s children’s children sobbing under the hills still looking for the way back up Listen Do you hear them

All Jon could hear was the falling water and the faint crackle of flames This way under the Wall was lost as well

Some have searched for it Them that go too deep find Gendel’s children and Gendel’s children are always hungry Smiling she set the torch carefully in a notch of rock and came toward him There’s naught to eat in the dark but flesh she whispered biting at his neck

Jon nuzzled her hair and filled his nose with the smell of her You sound like Old Nan telling Bran a monster story

Ygritte punched his shoulder An old woman am I

You’re older than me

Aye and wiser You know nothing Jon Snow She pushed away from him and shrugged out of her rabbitskin vest

What are you doing

Showing you how old I am She unlaced her doeskin shirt tossed it aside pulled her three woolen undershirts up over her head all at once I want you should see me

We shouldn’t—

We should Her breasts bounced as she stood on one leg to pull one boot then hopped onto her other foot to attend to the other Her nipples were wide pink circles You as well Ygritte said as she yanked down her sheepskin breeches If you want to look you have to show You know nothing Jon Snow

I know I want you he heard himself say all his vows and all his honor forgotten She stood before him naked as her name day and he was as hard as the rock around them He had been in her half a hundred times by now but always beneath the furs with others all around them He had never seen how beautiful she was Her legs were skinny but well muscled the hair at the juncture of her thighs a brighter red than that on her head Does that make it even luckier He pulled her close I love the smell of you he said I love your red hair I love your mouth and the way you kiss me I love your smile I love your teats He kissed them one and then the other I love your skinny legs and what’s between them He knelt to kiss her there lightly on her mound at first but Ygritte moved her legs apart a little and he saw the pink inside and kissed that as well and tasted her She gave a little gasp If you love me all so much why are you still dressed she whispered You know nothing Jon Snow Noth—oh Oh OHHH

Afterward she was almost shy or as shy as Ygritte ever got That thing you did she said when they lay together on their piled clothes With your… mouth She hesitated Is that… is it what lords do to their ladies down in the south

I don’t think so No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with their ladies I only… wanted to kiss you there that’s all You seemed to like it

Aye I… I liked it some No one taught you such

There’s been no one he confessed Only you

A maid she teased You were a maid

He gave her closest nipple a playful pinch I was a man of the Night’s Watch Was he heard himself say What was he now He did not want to look at that Were you a maid

Ygritte pushed herself onto an elbow I am nineteen and a spearwife and kissed by fire How could I be maiden

Who was he

A boy at a feast five years past He’d come trading with his brothers and he had hair like mine kissed by fire so I thought he would be lucky But he was weak When he came back t’ try and steal me Longspear broke his arm and ran him off and he never tried again not once

It wasn’t Longspear then Jon was relieved He liked Longspear with his homely face and friendly ways

She punched him That’s vile Would you bed your sister

Longspear’s not your brother

He’s of my village You know nothing Jon Snow A true man steals a woman from afar t’ strengthen the clan Women who bed brothers or fathers or clan kin offend the gods and are cursed with weak and sickly children Even monsters

Craster weds his daughters Jon pointed out

She punched him again Craster’s more your kind than ours His father was a crow who stole a woman out of Whitetree village but after he had her he flew back t’ his Wall She went t’ Castle Black once t’ show the crow his son but the brothers blew their horns and run her off Craster’s blood is black and he bears a heavy curse She ran her fingers lightly across his stomach I feared you’d do the same once Fly back to the Wall You never knew what t’ do after you stole me

Jon sat up Ygritte I never stole you

Aye you did You jumped down the mountain and killed Orell and afore I could get my axe you had a knife at my throat I thought you’d have me then or kill me or maybe both but you never did And when I told you the tale o’ Bael the Bard and how he plucked the rose o’ Winterfell I thought you’d know to pluck me then for certain but you didn’t You know nothing Jon Snow She gave him a shy smile You might be learning some though

The light was shifting all about her Jon noticed suddenly He looked around We had best go up The torch is almost done

Is the crow afeared o’ Gendel’s children she said with a grin It’s only a little way up and I’m not done with you Jon Snow She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him Would you… She hesitated

What he prompted as the torch began to gutter

Do it again Ygritte blurted With your mouth The lord’s kiss And I… I could see if you liked it any

By the time the torch burned out Jon Snow no longer cared

His guilt came back afterward but weaker than before If this is so wrong he wondered why did the gods make it feel so good
