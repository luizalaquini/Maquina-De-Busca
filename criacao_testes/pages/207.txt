That was all Catelyn needed to hear I am asking for your help my lord she said humbly And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice

Lord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face Save your sweet words my lady Sweet words I get from my wife Did you see her Sixteen she is a little flower and her honey’s only for me I wager she gives me a son by this time next year Perhaps I’ll make him heir wouldn’t that boil the rest of them

I’m certain she will give you many sons

His head bobbed up and down Your lord father did not come to the wedding An insult as I see it Even if he is dying He never came to my last wedding either He calls me the Late Lord Frey you know Does he think I’m dead I’m not dead and I promise you I’ll outlive him as I outlived his father Your family has always pissed on me don’t deny it don’t lie you know it’s true Years ago I went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter Why not I had a daughter in mind sweet girl only a few years older than Edmure but if your brother didn’t warm to her I had others he might have had young ones old ones virgins widows whatever he wanted No Lord Hoster would not hear of it Sweet words he gave me excuses but what I wanted was to get rid of a daughter

And your sister that one she’s full as bad It was oh a year ago no more Jon Arryn was still the King’s Hand and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney Stevron and Jared are too old for the lists now but Danwell and Hosteen rode Perwyn as well and a couple of my bastards tried the melee If I’d known how they’d shame me I would never have troubled myself to make the journey Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp I ask you The boy’s half his age Ser Daisy they call him something like that And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine My third wife was a Crakehall all of the Crakehall women are sluts Well never mind about that she died before you were born what do you care

I was speaking of your sister I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king’s court They are sweet boys quiet and mannerly Walder is Merrett’s son named after me and the other one… heh I don’t recall… he might have been another Walder they’re always naming them Walder so I’ll favor them but his father… which one was his father now His face wrinkled up Well whoever he was Lord Arryn wouldn’t have him or the other one and I blame your lady sister for that She frosted up as if I’d suggested selling her boy to a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies What good are apologies I ask you

Catelyn frowned disquieted I had understood that Lysa’s boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock

No it was Lord Stannis Walder Frey said irritably Do you think I can’t tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin They’re both bungholes who think they’re too noble to shit but never mind about that I know the difference Or do you think I’m so old I can’t remember I’m ninety and I remember very well I remember what to do with a woman too That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year I’ll wager Or a daughter that can’t be helped Boy or girl it will be red wrinkled and squalling and like as not she’ll want to name it Walder or Walda

Catelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis you are quite certain of that

Yes yes yes the old man said Only he died so what does it matter You say you want to cross the river

We do

Well you can’t Lord Walder announced crisply Not unless I allow it and why should I The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine He pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms smirking waiting for her answer

The rest was only haggling

A swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened The drawbridge creaked down the portcullis winched up and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen Behind her came Ser Jared Frey Ser Hosteen Frey Ser Danwell Frey and Lord Walder’s bastard son Ronel Rivers leading a long column of pikemen rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks

Robb galloped out to meet her with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion It’s done she told him Lord Walder will grant you your crossing His swords are yours as well less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own a mixed force of archers and swordsmen He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison… but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust Lord Walder may need help keeping faith

As you say Mother Robb answered gazing at the ranks of pikemen Perhaps… Ser Helman Tallhart do you think

A fine choice

What… what did he want of us

If you can spare a few of your swords I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey’s grandsons north to Winterfell she told him I have agreed to take them as wards They are young boys aged eight years and seven It would seem they are both named Walder Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age I should think

Is that all Two fosterlings That’s a small enough price to—

Lord Frey’s son Olyvar will be coming with us she went on He is to serve as your personal squire His father would like to see him knighted in good time

A squire He shrugged Fine that’s fine if he’s—

Also if your sister Arya is returned to us safely it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder’s youngest son Elmar when the two of them come of age

Robb looked nonplussed Arya won’t like that one bit

And you are to wed one of his daughters once the fighting is done she finished His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer He has a number he thinks might be suitable

To his credit Robb did not flinch I see

Do you consent
