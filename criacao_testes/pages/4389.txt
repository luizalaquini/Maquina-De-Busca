FG Table 97  Rules for detecting suffixes for final e processing
pp
Table 97 shows the suffixes which the program recognizes with some comments
on their processing
Multiple suffixes are detected and marked in words like
force|ful|ly and spite|ful|ness
This allows silent es to be spotted even when they occur far back in a
word
Notice that the suffix marks are available to the word-fragment
rules of Table 95 and are frequently used by them
pp
The program has some
ul
ad hoc
rules for dealing with compound words like race|track house|boat
these are applied as well as normal suffix splitting so that multiple
decompositions like pace|make|r can be accomplished
The rules look for short letter sequences which do not
usually appear in monomorphemic words
It is impossible however to detect every morph boundary
by such rules and the program inevitably makes mistakes
Examples of boundaries which go undetected are
edge|ways fence|post horse|back large|mouth where|in
while boundaries are incorrectly inserted into comple|mentary
male|volent prole|tariat Pame|la
pp
We now seem to have presented two opposing points of view on the pronunciation
problem
Charivarius the Dutch poet shows that an enormous number of
exceptional words exist whereas McIlroys program makes do with a tiny
exception dictionary
These views can be reconciled by noting that most of Charivarius words
are relatively uncommon
McIlroy tested his program against the 2000 most frequent words in a large
corpus Kucera and Francis 1967
and found that 97 were pronounced correctly if word frequencies were
taken into account

Kucera Francis 1967

The notion of correctness is of course a rather subjective one  However
he estimated that on the remaining words the success rate was only 88
pp
The system is particularly impressive in that it is prepared to say
anything  if used for example on source programs in a high-level
computer language it will say the keywords and pronouncable
identifiers spell the other identifiers and even give the names of special
symbols like +  = correctly
rh Morphological analysis
The use of letter-to-sound rules provides a cheap and fast technique
for pronunciation em the fragment table and exception dictionary for the
program described above occupy only 11 Kbyte of storage and can easily
be kept in solid-state read-only memory
