75 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of
Reuben were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Gad were sealed

76 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of
Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe of Manasses were

77 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe

78 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand Of the tribe

79 After this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man
could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues
stood before the throne and before the Lamb clothed with white
robes and palms in their hands 710 And cried with a loud voice
saying Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto
the Lamb

711 And all the angels stood round about the throne and about the
elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces
and worshipped God 712 Saying Amen Blessing and glory and
wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto
our God for ever and ever Amen

713 And one of the elders answered saying unto me What are these
which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they  714 And I
said unto him Sir thou knowest And he said to me These are they
which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and
made them white in the blood of the Lamb

715 Therefore are they before the throne of God and serve him day
and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
among them

716 They shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall
the sun light on them nor any heat

717 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them
and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes

81 And when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in
heaven about the space of half an hour

82 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them
were given seven trumpets

83 And another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden
censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which
was before the throne

84 And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the
saints ascended up before God out of the angels hand

85 And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the
altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and
thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake

86 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound

87 The first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled
with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of
trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up

88 And the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea
became blood 89 And the third part of the creatures which were in
the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were
destroyed

810 And the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from
heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers and upon the fountains of waters 811 And the name of the
star is called Wormwood and the third part of the waters became
wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made
bitter

812 And the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was
smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the
stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone
not for a third part of it and the night likewise

813 And I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of
heaven saying with a loud voice Woe woe woe to the inhabiters of
the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three
angels which are yet to sound  91 And the fifth angel sounded and
I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the
key of the bottomless pit

92 And he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of
the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
