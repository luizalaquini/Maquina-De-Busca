upon the sky From the walls an overhanging thatched
roof sloped up to a point in the centre upon which rose
a small wooden lantern fitted with louvre-boards on all
the four sides and from these openings a mist was dimly
perceived to be escaping into the night air There was
no window in front  but a square hole in the door was
glazed with a single pane through which red comfortable
rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front
Voices were to be heard inside
Oaks hand skimmed the surface of the door with
fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Somerer pattern till
he found a leathern strap which he pulled This lifted
a wooden latch and the door swung open
The room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow
from the kiln mouth which shone over the floor with
the streaming horizontality of the setting sun and threw
upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those
assembled around The stone-flag floor was worn into
a path from the doorway to the kiln and into undula+
tions everywhere A curved settle of unplaned oak
stretched along one side and in a remote corner was a
small bed and bedstead the owner and frequent occupier
of which was the maltster
This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire his
frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled
figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless
apple-tree He wore breeches and the laced-up shoes
called ankle-jacks he kept his eyes fixed upon the
fire

Gabriels nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden
with the sweet smell of new malt The conversation
which seemed to have been concerning the origin of the
fire immediately ceased and every one ocularly criticised
him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of
their foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eye+
lids as if he had been a light too strong for their sight
Several exclaimed meditatively after this operation had
been completed  --
Oh tis the new shepherd a blieve
We thought we heard a hand pawing about the
door for the bobbin but werent sure twere not a dead
leaf blowed across said another  Come in shepherd 
sure ye be welcome though we dont know yer name
 Gabriel Oak thats my name neighbours
The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up
this -- his turning being as the turning of a rusty
crane
Thats never Gable Oaks grandson over at Nor+
combe -- never   he said as a formula expressive of
surprise which nobody was supposed to take literally
My father and my grandfather were old men of the
name of Gabriel said the shepherd placidly
Thought I knowed the mans face as I seed him
on the rick  -- thought I did And where be ye trading
ot to now shepherd  
 Im thinking of biding here said Mr Oak
Knowed yer grandfather for years and years 
continued the maltster the words coming forth of their
own accord as if the momentum previously imparted
had been sufficient
Ah -- and did you 
 Knowed yer grandmother
And her too
Likewise knowed yer father when he was a child
Why my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn
brothers -- that they were sure -- werent ye Jacob  
Ay sure said his son a young man about sixty+
five with a semi-bald head and one tooth in the left
centre of his upper jaw which made much of itself by
standing prominent like a
P 104
milestone in a bank But
twas Joe had most to do with him However my son
William must have knowed the very man afore us --
didnt ye Billy afore ye left Norcombe  
No twas Andrew said Jacobs son Billy a child
of forty or thereabouts who manifested the peculiarity
of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body and
whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here
and there
I can mind Andrew said Oak as being a man in
the place when I was quite a child
Ay -- the other day I and my youngest daughter
Liddy were over at my grandsons christening continued
Billy  We were talking about this very family and
twas only last Purification Day in this very world when
the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor
folk you know shepherd and I can mind the day
because they all had to traypse up to the vestry -- yes
this very mans family
 Come shepherd and drink Tis gape and
swaller with us -- a drap of sommit but not of much
account said the maltster removing from the fire his
eyes which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing
into it for so many years Take up the God-forgive
me Jacob See if tis warm Jacoh
Jacob stooped to the God-forgive-me which was a
two-handled tall mug standing in the ashes cracked
and charred with heat  it was rather furred with ex
