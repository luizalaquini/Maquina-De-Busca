Not long after a rider with the Mallister eagle sewn on his breast arrived with a message from Lord Jason telling of another skirmish and another victory Ser Flement Brax had tried to force a crossing at a different ford six leagues to the south This time the Lannisters shortened their lances and advanced across the river behind on foot but the Mallister bowmen had rained high arcing shots down over their shields while the scorpions Edmure had mounted on the riverbank sent heavy stones crashing through to break up the formation They left a dozen dead in the water only two reaching the shallows where we dealt with them briskly the rider reported He also told of fighting farther upstream where Lord Karyl Vance held the fords Those thrusts too were turned aside at grievous cost to our foes

Perhaps Edmure was wiser than I knew Catelyn thought His lords all saw the sense in his battle plans why was I so blind My brother is not the little boy I remember no more than Robb is

She waited until evening before going to pay her call upon Ser Cleos Frey reasoning that the longer she delayed the drunker he was likely to be As she entered the tower cell Ser Cleos stumbled to his knees My lady I knew naught of any escape The Imp said a Lannister must needs have a Lannister escort on my oath as a knight—

Arise ser Catelyn seated herself I know no grandson of Walder Frey would be an oathbreaker Unless it served his purpose You brought peace terms my brother said

I did Ser Cleos lurched to his feet She was pleased to see how unsteady he was

Tell me she commanded and he did

When he was done Catelyn sat frowning Edmure had been right these were no terms at all except…Lannister will exchange Arya and Sansa for his brother

Yes He sat on the Iron Throne and swore it

Before witnesses

Before all the court my lady And the gods as well I said as much to Ser Edmure but he told me it was not possible that His Grace Robb would never consent

He told you true She could not even say that Robb was wrong Arya and Sansa were children The Kingslayer alive and free was as dangerous as any man in the realm That road led nowhere Did you see my girls Are they treated well

Ser Cleos hesitated I… yes they seemed…

He is fumbling for a lie Catelyn realized but the wine has fuddled his wits Ser Cleos she said coolly you forfeited the protection of your peace banner when your men played us false Lie to me and you’ll hang from the walls beside them Believe that I shall ask you once more—did you see my daughters

His brow was damp with sweat I saw Sansa at the court the day Tyrion told me his terms She looked most beautiful my lady Perhaps a a bit wan Drawn as it were

Sansa but not Arya That might mean anything Arya had always been harder to tame Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do They might have her locked safely out of sight Or they might have killed her Catelyn shoved the thought away His terms you said… yet Cersei is Queen Regent

Tyrion spoke for both of them The queen was not there She was indisposed that day I was told

Curious Catelyn thought back to that terrible trek through the Mountains of the Moon and the way Tyrion Lannister had somehow seduced that sellsword from her service to his own The dwarf is too clever by half She could not imagine how he had survived the high road after Lysa had sent him from the Vale yet it did not surprise her He had no part in Ned’s murder at the least And he came to my defense when the clansmen attacked us If I could trust his word…

She opened her hands to look down at the scars across her fingers His dagger’s marks she reminded herself His dagger in the hand of the killer he paid to open Bran’s throat Though the dwarf denied it to be sure Even after Lysa locked him in one of her sky cells and threatened him with her moon door he had still denied it He lied she said rising abruptly The Lannisters are liars every one and the dwarf is the worst of them The killer was armed with his own knife

Ser Cleos stared I know nothing of any—

You know nothing she agreed sweeping from the cell Brienne fell in beside her silent It is simpler for her Catelyn thought with a pang of envy She was like a man in that For men the answer was always the same and never farther away than the nearest sword For a woman a mother the way was stonier and harder to know

She took a late supper in the Great Hall with her garrison to give them what encouragement she could Rymund the Rhymer sang through all the courses sparing her the need to talk He closed with the song he had written about Robb’s victory at Oxcross And the stars in the night were the eyes of his wolves and the wind itself was their song Between the verses Rymund threw back his head and howled and by the end half of the hall was howling along with him even Desmond Grell who was well in his cups Their voices rang off the rafters

Let them have their songs if it makes them brave Catelyn thought toying with her silver goblet

There was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl Brienne said quietly I learned all the songs by heart

Sansa did the same though few singers ever cared to make the long journey north to Winterfell I told her there would be singers at the king’s court though I told her she would hear music of all sorts that her father could find some master to help her learn the high harp Oh gods forgive me…

Brienne said I remember a woman… she came from some place across the narrow sea I could not even say what language she sang in but her voice was as lovely as she was She had eyes the color of plums and her waist was so tiny my father could put his hands around it His hands were almost as big as mine She closed her long thick fingers as if to hide them

Did you sing for your father Catelyn asked

Brienne shook her head staring down at her trencher as if to find some answer in the gravy

For Lord Renly

The girl reddened Never I… his fool he made cruel japes sometimes and I…

Someday you must sing for me

I… please I have no gift Brienne pushed back from the table Forgive me my lady Do I have your leave to go

Catelyn nodded The tall ungainly girl left the hall with long strides almost unnoticed amidst the revelry May the gods go with her she thought as she returned listlessly to her supper

It was three days later when the hammer blow that Brienne had foretold fell and five days before they heard of it Catelyn was sitting with her father when Edmure’s messenger arrived The man’s armor was dinted his boots dusty and he had a ragged hole in his surcoat but the look on his face as he knelt was enough to tell her that the news was good Victory my lady He handed her Edmure’s letter Her hand trembled as she broke the seal

Lord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords her brother wrote but every thrust had been thrown back Lord Lefford had been drowned the Crakehall knight called Strongboar taken captive Ser Addam Marbrand thrice forced to retreat… but the fiercest battle had been fought at Stone Mill where Ser Gregor Clegane had led the assault So many of his men had fallen that their dead horses threatened to dam the flow In the end the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank but Edmure had thrown his reserve at them and they had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten Ser Gregor himself had lost his horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around him They shall not cross Cat Edmure scrawled Lord Tywin is marching to the southeast A feint perhaps or full retreat it matters not They shall not cross

Ser Desmond Grell had been elated Oh if only I might have been with him the old knight said when she read him the letter Where is that fool Rymund There’s a song in this by the gods and one that even Edmure will want to hear The mill that ground the Mountain down I could almost make the words myself had I the singer’s gift

I’ll hear no songs until the fighting’s done Catelyn said perhaps too sharply Yet she allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word and agreed when he suggested breaking open some casks in honor of Stone Mill The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber they would all be better for a little drink and hope

That night the castle rang to the sounds of celebration Riverrun the smallfolk shouted and Tully Tully They’d come frightened and helpless and her brother had taken them in when most lords would have closed their gates Their voices floated in through the high windows and seeped under the heavy redwood doors Rymund played his harp accompanied by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes Catelyn listened to girlish laughter and the excited chatter of the green boys her brother had left her for a garrison Good sounds… and yet they did not touch her She could not share their happiness

In her father’s solar she found a heavy leatherbound book of maps and opened it to the riverlands Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced it by flickering candlelight Marching to the southeast she thought By now they had likely reached the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush she decided

She closed the book even more uneasy than before The gods had granted them victory after victory At Stone Mill at Oxcross in the Battle of the Camps at the Whispering Wood…

But if we are winning why am I so afraid





BRAN

The sound was the faintest of clinks a scraping of steel over stone He lifted his head from his paws listening sniffing at the night

The evening’s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong again Grass and thorns blackberries broken on the ground mud worms rotting leaves a rat creeping through the bush He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother’s coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he’d killed Other squirrels moved through the branches above smelling of wet fur and fear their little claws scratching at the bark The noise had sounded something like that

And he heard it again clink and scrape It brought him to his feet His ears pricked and his tail rose He howled a long deep shivery cry a howl to wake the sleepers but the piles of man-rock were dark and dead A still wet night a night to drive men into their holes The rain had stopped but the men still hid from the damp huddled by the fires in their caves of piled stone

His brother came sliding through the trees moving almost as quiet as another brother he remembered dimly from long ago the white one with the eyes of blood This brother’s eyes were pools of shadow but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling He had heard the sounds as well and known they meant danger

This time the clink and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of skinfeet on stone The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know Stranger Danger Death

He ran toward the sound his brother racing beside him The stone dens rose before them walls slick and wet He bared his teeth but the man-rock took no notice A gate loomed up a black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post When he crashed against it the gate shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held Through the bars he could look down the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond but there was no way through He could force his muzzle between the bars but no more Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth but they would not break They had tried to dig under but there were great flat stones beneath half-covered by earth and blown leaves

Snarling he paced back and forth in front of the gate then threw himself at it once more It moved a little and slammed him back Locked something whispered Chained The voice he did not hear the scent without a smell The other ways were closed as well Where doors opened in the walls of man-rock the wood was thick and strong There was no way out
