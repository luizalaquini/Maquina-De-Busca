He had not intended to disturb her but the sight of her was enough to make him hard He let his garments fall to the floor then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart and kissed her between the thighs Shae murmured in her sleep He kissed her again and licked at her secret sweetness on and on until his beard and her cunt were both soaked When she gave a soft moan and shuddered he climbed up and thrust himself inside her and exploded almost at once

Her eyes were open She smiled and stroked his head and whispered I just had the sweetest dream m’lord

Tyrion nipped at her small hard nipple and nestled his head on her shoulder He did not pull out of her would that he never had to pull out of her This is no dream he promised her It is real all of it he thought the wars the intrigues the great bloody game and me in the center of it… me the dwarf the monster the one they scorned and laughed at but now I hold it all the power the city the girl This was what I was made for and gods forgive me but I do love it…

And her And her





ARYA

Whatever names Harren the Black had meant to give his towers were long forgotten They were called the Tower of Dread the Widow’s Tower the Wailing Tower the Tower of Ghosts and Kingspyre Tower Arya slept in a shallow niche in the cavernous vaults beneath the Wailing Tower on a bed of straw She had water to wash in whenever she liked a chunk of soap The work was hard but no harder than walking miles every day Weasel did not need to find worms and bugs to eat as Arry had there was bread every day and barley stews with bits of carrot and turnip and once a fortnight even a bite of meat

Hot Pie ate even better he was where he belonged in the kitchens a round stone building with a domed roof that was a world unto itself Arya took her meals at a trestle table in the undercroft with Weese and his other charges but sometimes she would be chosen to help fetch their food and she and Hot Pie could steal a moment to talk He could never remember that she was now Weasel and kept calling her Arry even though he knew she was a girl Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon

Gendry had been sent to the forge Arya seldom saw him As for those she served with she did not even want to know their names That only made it hurt worse when they died Most of them were older than she was and content to let her alone

Harrenhal was vast much of it far gone in decay Lady Whent had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully but she’d used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers and let the rest go to ruin Now she was fled and the small household she’d left could not begin to tend the needs of all the knights lords and highborn prisoners Lord Tywin had brought so the Lannisters must forage for servants as well as for plunder and provender The talk was that Lord Tywin planned to restore Harrenhal to glory and make it his new seat once the war was done

Weese used Arya to run messages draw water and fetch food and sometimes to serve at table in the Barracks Hall above the armory where the men-at-arms took their meals But most of her work was cleaning The ground floor of the Wailing Tower was given over to storerooms and granaries and two floors above housed part of the garrison but the upper stories had not been occupied for eighty years Now Lord Tywin had commanded that they be made fit for habitation again There were floors to be scrubbed grime to be washed off windows broken chairs and rotted beds to be carried off The topmost story was infested with nests of the huge black bats that House Whent had used for its sigil and there were rats in the cellars as well… and ghosts some said the spirits of Harren the Black and his sons

Arya thought that was stupid Harren and his sons had died in Kingspyre Tower that was why it had that name so why should they cross the yard to haunt her The Wailing Tower only wailed when the wind blew from the north and that was just the sound the air made blowing through the cracks in the stones where they had fissured from the heat if there were ghosts in Harrenhal they never troubled her It was the living men she feared Weese and Ser Gregor Clegane and Lord Tywin Lannister himself who kept his apartments in Kingspyre Tower still the tallest and mightiest of all though lopsided beneath the weight of the slagged stone that made it look like some giant half-melted black candle

She wondered what Lord Tywin would do if she marched up to him and confessed to being Arya Stark but she knew she’d never get near enough to talk to him and anyhow he’d never believe her if she did and afterward Weese would beat her bloody

In his own small strutting way Weese was nearly as scary as Ser Gregor The Mountain swatted men like flies but most of the time he did not even seem to know the fly was there Weese always knew you were there and what you were doing and sometimes what you were thinking He would hit at the slightest provocation and he had a dog who was near as bad as he was an ugly spotted bitch that smelled worse than any dog Arya had ever known Once she saw him set the dog on a latrine boy who’d annoyed him She tore a big chunk out of the boy’s calf while Weese laughed

It took him only three days to earn the place of honor in her nightly prayers Weese she would whisper first of all Dunsen Chiswyck Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Gregor Ser Amory Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei If she let herself forget even one of them how would she ever find him again to kill him

On the road Arya had felt like a sheep but Harrenbal turned her into a mouse She was grey as a mouse in her scratchy wool shift and like a mouse she kept to the crannies and crevices and dark holes of the castle scurrying out of the way of the mighty

Sometimes she thought they were all mice within those thick walls even the knights and the great lords The size of the castle made even Gregor Clegane seem small Harrenhal covered thrice as much ground as Winterfell and its buildings were so much larger they could scarcely be compared Its stables housed a thousand horses its godswood covered twenty acres its kitchens were as large as Winterfell’s Great Hall and its own great hall grandly named the Hall of a Hundred Hearths even though it only had thirty and some Arya had tried to count them twice but she came up with thirty-three once and thirty-five the other time was so cavernous that Lord Tywin could have feasted his entire host though he never did Walls doors halls steps everything was built to an inhuman scale that made Arya remember the stories Old Nan used to tell of the giants who lived beyond the Wall

And as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under their feet Arya heard all sorts of secrets just by keeping her ears open as she went about her duties Pretty Pia from the buttery was a slut who was working her way through every knight in the castle The wife of the gaoler was with child but the real father was either Ser Alyn Stackspear or a singer called Whitesmile Wat Lord Lefford made mock of ghosts at table but always kept a candle burning by his bed Ser Dunaver’s squire Jodge could not hold his water when he slept The cooks despised Ser Harys Swyft and spit in all his food once she even overheard Maester Tothmure’s serving girl confiding to her brother about some message that said Joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all Lord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak such filth again the girl whispered

King Robert’s brothers Stannis and Renly had joined the fighting she heard And both of them kings now Weese said Realm’s got more kings than a castle’s got rats Even Lannister men questioned how long Joffrey would hold the Iron Throne The lad’s got no army but them gold cloaks and he’s ruled by a eunuch a dwarf and a woman she heard a lordling mutter in his cups What good will the likes of them be if it comes to battle There was always talk of Beric Dondarrion A fat archer once said the Bloody Mummers had slain him but the others only laughed Lorch killed the man at Rushing Falls and the Mountain’s slain him twice Got me a silver stag says he don’t stay dead this time neither

Arya did not know who Bloody Mummers were until a fortnight later when the queerest company of men she’d ever seen arrived at Harrenhal Beneath the standard of a black goat with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in their braids lancers astride striped black-and-white horses bowmen with powdered cheeks squat hairy men with shaggy shields brown-skinned men in feathered cloaks a wispy fool in green-and-pink motley swordsmen with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver spearmen with colored scars that covered their cheeks a slender man in septon’s robes a fatherly one in maester’s grey and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair

At their head was a man stick-thin and very tall with a drawn emaciated face made even longer by the ropy black beard that grew from his pointed chin nearly to his waist The helm that hung from his saddle horn was black steel fashioned in the shape of a goat’s head About his neck he wore a chain made of linked coins of many different sizes shapes and metals and his horse was one of the strange black-and-white ones

You don’t want to know that lot Weasel Weese said when he saw her looking at the goat-helmed man Two of his drinking friends were with him men-at-arms in service to Lord Lefford

Who are they she asked

One of the soldiers laughed The Footmen girl Toes of the Goat Lord Tywin’s Bloody Mummers

Pease for wits You get her flayed you can scrub the bloody steps said Weese They’re sellswords Weasel girl Call themselves the Brave Companions Don’t use them other names where they can hear or they’ll hurt you bad The goat-helm’s their captain Lord Vargo Hoat

He’s no fucking lord said the second soldier I heard Ser Amory say so He’s just some sellsword with a mouth full of slobber and a high opinion of hisself

Aye said Weese but she better call him lord if she wants to keep all her parts

Arya looked at Vargo Hoat again How many monsters does Lord Tywin have

The Brave Companions were housed in the Widow’s Tower so Arya need not serve them She was glad of that on the very night they arrived fighting broke out between the sellswords and some Lannister men Ser Harys Swyft’s squire was stabbed to death and two of the Bloody Mummers were wounded The next morning Lord Tywin hanged them both from the gatehouse walls along with one of Lord Lydden’s archers Weese said the archer had started all the trouble by taunting the sellswords over Beric Dondarrion After the hanged men had stopped kicking Vargo Hoat and Ser Harys embraced and kissed and swore to love each other always as Lord Tywin looked on Arya thought it was funny the way Vargo Hoat lisped and slobbered but she knew better than to laugh

The Bloody Mummers did not linger long at Harrenhal but before they rode out again Arya heard one of them saying how a northern army under Roose Bolton had occupied the ruby ford of the Trident If he crosses Lord Tywin will smash him again like he did on the Green Fork a Lannister bowmen said but his fellows jeered him down Bolton’ll never cross not till the Young Wolf marches from Riverrun with his wild northmen and all them wolves

Arya had not known her brother was so near Riverrun was much closer than Winterfell though she was not certain where it lay in relation to Harrenhal I could find out somehow I know I could if only I could get away When she thought of seeing Robb’s face again Arya had to bite her lip And I want to see Jon too and Bran and Rickon and Mother Even Sansa… I’ll kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady she’ll like that

From the courtyard talk she’d learned that the upper chambers of the Tower of Dread housed three dozen captives taken during some battle on the Green Fork of the Trident Most had been given freedom of the castle in return for their pledge not to attempt escape They vowed not to escape Arya told herself but they never swore not to help me escape

The captives ate at their own table in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths and could often be seen about the grounds Four brothers took their exercise together every day fighting with staves and wooden shields in the Flowstone Yard Three of them were Freys of the Crossing the fourth their bastard brother They were only there a short time though one morning two other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold and ransomed them from the knights who’d captured them The six Freys all left together

No one ransomed the northmen though One fat lordling haunted the kitchens Hot Pie told her always looking for a morsel His mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth and the clasp that held his cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident He belonged to Lord Tywin but the fierce bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off him Sansa would have known who he was and the fat one too but Arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done

She did remember Lord Cerwyn though His lands had been close to Winterfell so he and his son Cley had often visited Yet as fate would have it he was the only captive who was never seen he was abed in a tower cell recovering from a wound For days and days Arya tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him If he knew her he would be honor bound to help her A lord would have gold for a certainty they all did perhaps he would pay some of Lord Tywin’s own sellswords to take her to Riverrun Father had always said that most sellswords would betray anyone for enough gold

Then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon The body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk decorated with a battle-axe sigil When Arya asked who it was one of the guards told her that Lord Cerwyn had died The words felt like a kick in the belly He could never have helped you anyway she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate He couldn’t even help himself you stupid mouse

After that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors Lord Tywin would soon march on Riverrun she heard or he would drive south to Highgarden no one would ever expect that No he must defend King’s Landing Stannis was the greatest threat He’d sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger from his back He’d sent ravens to the Eyrie he meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win the Vale He’d bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the Stark wargs He was writing Lady Stark to make a peace the Kingslayer would soon be freed

Though ravens came and went every day Lord Tywin himself spent most of his days behind closed doors with his war council Arya caught glimpses of him but always from afar—once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below He stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword They said Lord Tywin loved gold most of all he even shit gold she heard one squire jest The Lannister lord was strong-looking for an old man with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head There was something in his face that reminded Arya of her own father even though they looked nothing alike He has a lord’s face that’s all she told herself She remembered hearing her lady mother tell Father to put on his lord’s face and go deal with some matter Father had laughed at that She could not imagine Lord Tywin ever laughing at anything

One afternoon while she was waiting her turn to draw a pail of water from the well she heard the hinges of the east gate groaning A party of men rode under the portcullis at a walk When she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader a stab of hate shot through her

In the light of day Ser Amory Lorch looked less frightening than he had by torchlight but he still had the pig’s eyes she recalled One of the women said that his men had ridden all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and slaying rebels We weren’t rebels Arya thought We were the Night’s Watch the Night’s Watch takes no side Ser Amory had fewer men than she remembered though and many wounded I hope their wounds fester I hope they all die

Then she saw the three near the end of the column

Rorge had donned a black halfhelm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that he did not have a nose Biter rode ponderously beside him on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under his weight Half-healed burns covered his body making him even more hideous than before

But Jaqen H’ghar still smiled His garb was still ragged and filthy but he had found time to wash and brush his hair It streamed down across his shoulders red and white and shiny and Arya heard the girls giggling to each other in admiration

I should have let the fire have them Gendry said to I should have listened If she hadn’t thrown them that axe they’d all be dead For a moment she was afraid but they rode past her without a flicker of interest Only Jaqen H’ghar so much as glanced in her direction and his eyes passed right over her He does not know me she thought Arry was a fierce little boy with a sword and I’m just a grey mouse girl with a pail

She spent the rest of that day scrubbing steps inside the Wailing Tower By evenfall her hands were raw and bleeding and her arms so sore they trembled when she lugged the pail back to the cellar Too tired even for food Arya begged Weese’s pardons and crawled into her straw to sleep Weese she yawned Dunsen Chiswyck Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Gregor Ser Amory Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei She thought she might add three more names to her prayer but she was too tired to decide tonight

Arya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand clamped down over her mouth like smooth warm stone solid and unyielding She woke at once squirming and struggling A girl says nothing a voice whispered close behind her ear A girl keeps her lips closed no one hears and friends may talk in secret Yes

Heart pounding Arya managed the tiniest of nods

Jaqen H’ghar took his hand away The cellar was black as pitch and she could not see his face even inches away She could smell him though his skin smelled clean and soapy and he had scented his hair A boy becomes a girl he murmured

I was always a girl I didn’t think you saw me
