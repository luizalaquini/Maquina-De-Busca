Meera peeled back one end of her net and the fat man managed to sit up He was shaking Bran saw and still struggling to catch his breath He said there would be people he huffed People in the castle I didn’t know you’d be right at the top of the steps though I didn’t know you’d throw a net on me or stab me in the stomach He touched his belly with a black-gloved hand Am I bleeding I can’t see

It was just a poke to get you off your feet said Meera Here let me have a look She went to one knee and felt around his navel You’re wearing mail I never got near your skin

Well it hurt all the same Sam complained

Are you really a brother of the Night’s Watch Bran asked

The fat man’s chins jiggled when he nodded His skin looked pale and saggy Only a steward I took care of Lord Mormont’s ravens For a moment he looked like he was going to cry I lost them at the Fist though It was my fault I got us lost too I couldn’t even find the Wall It’s a hundred leagues long and seven hundred feet high and I couldn’t find it

Well you’ve found it now said Meera Lift your rump off the ground I want my net back

How did you get through the Wall Jojen demanded as Sam struggled to his feet Does the well lead to an underground river is that where you came from You’re not even wet…

There’s a gate said fat Sam A hidden gate as old as the Wall itself The Black Gate he called it

The Reeds exchanged a look We’ll find this gate at the bottom of the well asked Jojen

Sam shook his head You won’t I have to take you

Why Meera demanded If there’s a gate…

You won’t find it If you did it wouldn’t open Not for you It’s the Black Gate Sam plucked at the faded black wool of his sleeve Only a man of the Night’s Watch can open it he said A Sworn Brother who has said his words

He said Jojen frowned This… Coldhands

That wasn’t his true name said Gilly rocking We only called him that Sam and me His hands were cold as ice but he saved us from the dead men him and his ravens and he brought us here on his elk

His elk said Bran wonderstruck

His elk said Meera startled

His ravens said Jojen

Hodor said Hodor

Was he green Bran wanted to know Did he have antlers

The fat man was confused The elk

Coldhands said Bran impatiently The green men ride on elks Old Nan used to say Sometimes they have antlers too

He wasn’t a green man He wore blacks like a brother of the Watch but he was pale as a wight with hands so cold that at first I was afraid The wights have blue eyes though and they don’t have tongues or they’ve forgotten how to use them The fat man turned to Jojen He’ll be waiting We should go Do you have anything warmer to wear The Black Gate is cold and the other side of the Wall is even colder You—

Why didn’t he come with you Meera gestured toward Gilly and her babe They came with you why not him Why didn’t you bring him through this Black Gate too

He… he can’t

Why not

The Wall The Wall is more than just ice and stone he said There are spells woven into it… old ones and strong He cannot pass beyond the Wall

It grew very quiet in the castle kitchen then Bran could hear the soft crackle of the flames the wind stirring the leaves in the night the creak of the skinny weirwood reaching for the moon Beyond the gates the monsters live and the giants and the ghouls he remembered Old Nan saying but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong So go to sleep my little Brandon my baby boy You needn’t fear There are no monsters here
