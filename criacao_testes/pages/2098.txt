The candles within Renly’s pavilion made the shimmering silken walls seem to glow transforming the great tent into a magical castle alive with emerald light Two of the Rainbow Guard stood sentry at the door to the royal pavilion The green light shone strangely against the purple plums of Ser Parmen’s surcoat and gave a sickly hue to the sunflowers that covered every inch of Ser Emmon’s enameled yellow plate Long silken plumes flew from their helms and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders

Within Catelyn found Brienne armoring the king for battle while the Lords Tarly and Rowan spoke of dispositions and tactics It was pleasantly warm inside the heat shimmering off the coals in a dozen small iron braziers I must speak with you Your Grace she said granting him a king’s style for once anything to make him heed her

In a moment Lady Catelyn Renly replied Brienne fit backplate to breastplate over his quilted tunic The king’s armor was a deep green the green of leaves in a summer wood so dark it drank the candlelight Gold highlights gleamed from inlay and fastenings like distant fires in that wood winking every time he moved Pray continue Lord Mathis

Your Grace Mathis Rowan said with a sideways glance at Catelyn As I was saying our battles are well drawn up Why wait for daybreak Sound the advance

And have it said that I won by treachery with an unchivalrous attack Dawn was the chosen hour

Chosen by Stannis Randyll Tarly pointed out He’d have us charge into the teeth of the rising sun We’ll be half-blind

Only until first shock Renly said confidently Ser Loras will break them and after that it will be chaos Brienne tightened green leather straps and buckled golden buckles When my brother falls see that no insult is done to his corpse He is my own blood I will not have his head paraded about on a spear

And if he yields Lord Tarly asked

Yields Lord Rowan laughed When Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storm’s End Stannis ate rats rather than open his gates

Well I remember Renly lifted his chin to allow Brienne to fasten his gorget in place Near the end Ser Gawen Wylde and three of his knights tried to steal out a postern gate to surrender Stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults I can still see Gawen’s face as they strapped him down He had been our master-at-arms

Lord Rowan appeared puzzled No men were hurled from the walls I would surely remember that

Maester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead and there was no gain in flinging away good meat Renly pushed back his hair Brienne bound it with a velvet tie and pulled a padded cap down over his ears to cushion the weight of his helm Thanks to the Onion Knight we were never reduced to dining on corpses but it was a close thing Too close for Ser Gawen who died in his cell

Your Grace Catelyn had waited patiently but time grew short You promised me a word

Renly nodded See to your battles my lords    oh and if Barristan Selmy is at my brother’s side I want him spared

There’s been no word of Ser Barristan since Joffrey cast him out Lord Rowan objected

I know that old man He needs a king to guard or who is he Yet he never came to me and Lady Catelyn says he is not with Robb Stark at Riverrun Where else but with Stannis

As you say Your Grace No harm will come to him The lords bowed deeply and departed

Say your say Lady Stark Renly said Brienne swept his cloak over his broad shoulders It was cloth-of-gold heavy with the crowned stag of Baratheon picked out in flakes of jet

The Lannisters tried to kill my son Bran A thousand times I have asked myself why Your brother gave me my answer There was a hunt the day he fell Robert and Ned and most of the other men rode out after boar but Jaime Lannister remained at Winterfell as did the queen

Renly was not slow to take the implication So you believe the boy caught them at their incest   

I beg you my lord grant me leave to go to your brother Stannis and tell him what I suspect

To what end

Robb will set aside his crown if you and your brother will do the same she said hoping it was true She would make it true if she must Robb would listen to her even if his lords would not Let the three of you call for a Great Council such as the realm has not seen for a hundred years We will send to Winterfell so Bran may tell his tale and all men may know the Lannisters for the true usurpers Let the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose who shall rule them

Renly laughed Tell me my lady do direwolves vote on who should lead the pack Brienne brought the king’s gauntlets and greathelm crowned with golden antlers that would add a foot and a half to his height The time for talk is done Now we see who is stronger Renly pulled a lobstered green-and-gold gauntlet over his left hand while Brienne knelt to buckle on his belt heavy with the weight of longsword and dagger

I beg you in the name of the Mother Catelyn began when a sudden gust of wind flung open the door of the tent She thought she glimpsed movement but when she turned her head it was only the king’s shadow shifting against the silken walls She heard Renly begin a jest his shadow moving lifting its sword black on green candles guttering shivering something was queer wrong and then she saw Renly’s sword still in its scabbard sheathed still but the shadowsword   

Cold said Renly in a small puzzled voice a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there He had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat

Your Gr—no cried Brienne the Blue when she saw that evil flow sounding as scared as any little girl The king stumbled into her arms a sheet of blood creeping down the front of his armor a dark red tide that drowned his green and gold More candles guttered out Renly tried to speak but he was choking on his own blood His legs collapsed and only Brienne’s strength held him up She threw back her head and screamed wordless in her anguish

The shadow Something dark and evil had happened here she knew something that she could not begin to understand Renly never cast that shadow Death came in that door and blew the life out of him as swift as the wind snuffed out his candles

Only a few instants passed before Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy came bursting in though it felt like half the night A pair of men-at-arms crowded in behind with torches When they saw Renly in Brienne’s arms and her drenched with the king’s blood Ser Robar gave a cry of horror Wicked woman screamed Ser Emmon he of the sunflowered steel Away from him you vile creature

Gods be good Brienne why asked Ser Robar

Brienne looked up from her king’s body The rainbow cloak that hung from her shoulders had turned red where the king’s blood had soaked into the cloth I    I   

You’ll die for this Ser Emmon snatched up a long-handled battle-axe from the weapons piled near the door You’ll pay for the king’s life with your own

NO Catelyn Stark screamed finding her voice at last but it was too late the blood madness was on them and they rushed forward with shouts that drowned her softer words

Brienne moved faster than Catelyn would have believed Her own sword was not to hand so she snatched Renly’s from its scabbard and raised it to catch Emmon’s axe on the downswing A spark flashed blue-white as steel met steel with a rending crash and Brienne sprang to her feet the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside Ser Emmon stumbled over it as he tried to close and Brienne’s blade sheared through the wooden haft to send his axehead spinning Another man thrust a flaming torch at her back but the rainbow cloak was too sodden with blood to burn Brienne spun and cut and torch and hand went flying Flames crept across the carpet The maimed man began to scream Ser Emmon dropped the axe and fumbled for his sword The second man-at-arms lunged Brienne parried and their swords danced and clanged against each other When Emmon Cuy came wading back in Brienne was forced to retreat yet somehow she held them both at bay On the ground Renly’s head rolled sickeningly to one side and a second mouth yawned wide the blood coming from him now in slow pulses

Ser Robar had hung back uncertain but now he was reaching for his hilt Robar no listen Catelyn seized his arm You do her wrong it was not her Help her Hear me it was Stannis The name was on her lips before she could think how it got there but as she said it she knew that it was true I swear it you know me it was Stannis killed him

The young rainbow knight stared at this madwoman with pale and frightened eyes Stannis How

I do not know Sorcery some dark magic there was a shadow a shadow Her own voice sounded wild and crazed to her but the words poured out in a rush as the blades continued to clash behind her A shadow with a sword I swear it I saw Are you blind the girl loved him Help her She glanced back saw the second guardsman fall his blade dropping from limp fingers Outside there was shouting More angry men would be bursting in on them any instant she knew She is innocent Robar You have my word on my husband’s grave and my honor as a Stark

That resolved him I will hold them Ser Robar said Get her away He turned and went out

The fire had reached the wall and was creeping up the side of the tent Ser Emmon was pressing Brienne hard him in his enameled yellow steel and her in wool He had forgotten Catelyn until the iron brazier came crashing into the back of his head Helmed as he was the blow did no lasting harm but it sent him to his knees Brienne with me Catelyn commanded The girl was not slow to see the chance A slash and the green silk parted They stepped out into darkness and the chill of dawn Loud voices came from the other side of the pavilion This way Catelyn urged and slowly We must not run or they will ask why Walk easy as if nothing were amiss

Brienne thrust her sword blade through her belt and fell in beside Catelyn The night air smelled of rain Behind them the king’s pavilion was well ablaze flames rising high against the dark No one made any move to stop them Men rushed past them shouting of fire and murder and sorcery Others stood in small groups and spoke in low voices A few were praying and one young squire was on his knees sobbing openly

Renly’s battles were already coming apart as the rumors spread from mouth to mouth The nightfires had burned low and as the east began to lighten the immense mass of Storm’s End emerged like a dream of stone while wisps of pale mist raced across the field flying from the sun on wings of wind Morning ghosts she had heard Old Nan call them once spirits returning to their graves And Renly one of them now gone like his brother Robert like her own dear Ned

I never held him but as he died Brienne said quietly as they walked through the spreading chaos Her voice sounded as if she might break at any instant He was laughing one moment and suddenly the blood was everywhere    my lady I do not understand Did you see did you    

I saw a shadow I thought it was Renly’s shadow at the first but it was his brother’s

Lord Stannis

I felt him It makes no sense I know   

It made sense enough for Brienne I will kill him the tall homely girl declared With my lord’s own sword I will kill him I swear it I swear it I swear it

Hal Mollen and the rest of her escort were waiting with the horses Ser Wendel Manderly was all in a lather to know what was happening My lady the camp has gone mad he blurted when he saw them Lord Renly is he— He stopped suddenly staring at Brienne and the blood that drenched her

Dead but not by our hands

The battle— Hal Mollen began

There will be no battle Catelyn mounted and her escort formed up about her with Ser Wendel to her left and Ser Perwyn Frey on her right Brienne we brought mounts enough for twice our number Choose one and come with us
