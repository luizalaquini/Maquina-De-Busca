166 And when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own
blood I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood Live yea I said
unto thee when thou wast in thy blood Live

167 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou
hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent
ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas
thou wast naked and bare

168 Now when I passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time
was the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and covered thy
nakedness yea I sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with
thee saith the Lord GOD and thou becamest mine

169 Then washed I thee with water yea I throughly washed away thy
blood from thee and I anointed thee with oil

1610 I clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with
badgers skin and I girded thee about with fine linen and I covered
thee with silk

1611 I decked thee also with ornaments and I put bracelets upon thy
hands and a chain on thy neck

1612 And I put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears
and a beautiful crown upon thine head

1613 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was
of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine
flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou
didst prosper into a kingdom

1614 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for
it was perfect through my comeliness which I had put upon thee saith
the Lord GOD

1615 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the
harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on
every one that passed by his it was

1616 And of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high
places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the
like things shall not come neither shall it be so

1617 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
silver which I had given thee and madest to thyself images of men
and didst commit whoredom with them 1618 And tookest thy broidered
garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine
incense before them

1619 My meat also which I gave thee fine flour and oil and honey
wherewith I fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet
savour and thus it was saith the Lord GOD

1620 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou
hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be
devoured Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter 1621 That thou
hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass
through the fire for them  1622 And in all thine abominations and
thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when
thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood

1623 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto
thee  saith the LORD GOD 1624 That thou hast also built unto thee
an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street

1625 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and
hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every
one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms

1626 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to
provoke me to anger

1627 Behold therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee and
have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will
of them that hate thee the daughters of the Philistines which are
ashamed of thy lewd way

1628 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians because thou
wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet
couldest not be satisfied

1629 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
Canaan unto Chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith

1630 How weak is thine heart saith the LORD GOD seeing thou doest
all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman 1631 In
that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and
makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an
harlot in that thou scornest hire 1632 But as a wife that
committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband
1633 They give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all
thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every
side for thy whoredom

1634 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou
givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art
contrary
