Once I prick you and let the air out you’ll shrink down smaller’n that girl Stand aside or Mance will hear o’ this

Ygritte stood What is it Mance who wants him

I said so didn’t I Get him up on those black feet

Tormund frowned down at Jon Best go if it’s the Mance who’s wanting you

Ygritte helped pull him up He’s bleeding like a butchered boar Look what Orell did t’ his sweet face

Can a bird hate Jon had slain the wildling Orell but some part of the man remained within the eagle The golden eyes looked out on him with cold malevolence I’ll come he said The blood kept running down into his right eye and his cheek was a blaze of pain When he touched it his black gloves came away stained with red Let me catch my garron It was not the horse he wanted so much as Ghost but the direwolf was nowhere to be seen He could be leagues away by now ripping out the throat of some elk Perhaps that was just as well

The garron shied away from him when he approached no doubt frightened by the blood on his face but Jon calmed him with a few quiet words and finally got close enough to take the reins As he swung back into the saddle his head whirled I will need to get this tended he thought but not just now Let the King-beyond-the-Wall see what his eagle did to me His right hand opened and closed and he reached down for Longclaw and slung the bastard sword over a shoulder before he wheeled to trot back to where the Lord of Bones and his band were waiting

Ygritte was waiting too sitting on her horse with a fierce look on her face I am coming too

Be gone The bones of Rattleshirt’s breastplate clattered together I was sent for the crow-come-down none other

A free woman rides where she will Ygritte said

The wind was blowing snow into Jon’s eyes He could feel the blood freezing on his face Are we talking or riding

Riding said the Lord of Bones

It was a grim gallop They rode two miles down the column through swirling snows then cut through a tangle of baggage wayns to splash across the Milkwater where it took a great loop toward the east A crust of thin ice covered the river shallows with every step their horses’ hooves crashed through until they reached the deeper water ten yards out The snow seemed be falling even faster on the eastern bank and the drifts were deeper too Even the wind is colder And night was falling too

But even through the blowing snow the shape of the great white hill that loomed above the trees was unmistakable The Fist of the First Men Jon heard the scream of the eagle overhead A raven looked down from a soldier pine and quorked as he went past Had the Old Bear made his attack Instead of the clash of steel and the thrum of arrows taking flight Jon heard only the soft crunch of frozen crust beneath his garron’s hooves

In silence they circled round to the south slope where the approach was easiest It was there at the bottom that Jon saw the dead horse sprawled at the base of the hill half buried in the snow Entrails spilled from the belly of the animal like frozen snakes and one of its legs was gone Wolves was Jon’s first thought but that was wrong Wolves eat their kill

More garrons were strewn across the slope legs twisted grotesquely blind eyes staring in death The wildlings crawled over them like flies stripping them of saddles bridles packs and armor and hacking them apart with stone axes

Up Rattleshirt told Jon Mance is up top

Outside the ringwall they dismounted to squeeze through a crooked gap in the stones The carcass of a shaggy brown garron was impaled upon the sharpened stakes the Old Bear had placed inside every entrance He was trying to get out not in There was no sign of a rider

Inside was more and worse Jon had never seen pink snow before The wind gusted around him pulling at his heavy sheepskin cloak Ravens flapped from one dead horse to the next Are those wild ravens or our own Jon could not tell He wondered where poor Sam was now And what he was

A crust of frozen blood crunched beneath the heel of his boot The wildlings were stripping the dead horses of every scrap of steel and leather even prying the horseshoes off their hooves A few were going through packs they’d turned up looking for weapons and food Jon passed one of Chett’s dogs or what remained of him lying in a sludgy pool of half-frozen blood

A few tents were still standing on the far side of the camp and it was there they found Mance Rayder Beneath his slashed cloak of black wool and red silk he wore black ringmail and shaggy fur breeches and on his head was a great bronze-and-iron helm with raven wings at either temple Jarl was with him and Harma the Dogshead Styr as well and Varamyr Sixskins with his wolves and his shadowcat

The look Mance gave Jon was grim and cold What happened to your face

Ygritte said Orell tried to take his eye out

It was him I asked Has he lost his tongue Perhaps he should to spare us further lies

Styr the Magnar drew a long knife The boy might see more clear with one eye instead of two

Would you like to keep your eye Jon asked the King-beyond-the-Wall If so tell me how many they were And try and speak the truth this time Bastard of Winterfell

Jon’s throat was dry My lord… what…
