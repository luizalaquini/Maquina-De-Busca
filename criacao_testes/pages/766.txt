The Gospel According to Saint Matthew


11 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the
son of Abraham

12 Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat Judas
and his brethren 13 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar and
Phares begat Esrom and Esrom begat Aram 14 And Aram begat Aminadab
and Aminadab begat Naasson and Naasson begat Salmon 15 And Salmon
begat Booz of Rachab and Booz begat Obed of Ruth and Obed begat
Jesse 16 And Jesse begat David the king and David the king begat
Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias 17 And Solomon begat
Roboam and Roboam begat Abia and Abia begat Asa 18 And Asa begat
Josaphat and Josaphat begat Joram and Joram begat Ozias 19 And
Ozias begat Joatham and Joatham begat Achaz and Achaz begat Ezekias
110 And Ezekias begat Manasses and Manasses begat Amon and Amon
begat Josias 111 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren about
the time they were carried away to Babylon 112 And after they were
brought to Babylon Jechonias begat Salathiel and Salathiel begat
Zorobabel 113 And Zorobabel begat Abiud and Abiud begat Eliakim
and Eliakim begat Azor 114 And Azor begat Sadoc and Sadoc begat
Achim and Achim begat Eliud 115 And Eliud begat Eleazar and
Eleazar begat Matthan and Matthan begat Jacob 116 And Jacob begat
Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called
Christ

117 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
generations and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are
fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto
Christ are fourteen generations

118 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise When as his
mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was
found with child of the Holy Ghost

119 Then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to
make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily

120 But while he thought on these things behold the angel of the
LORD appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived
in her is of the Holy Ghost

121 And she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name
JESUS for he shall save his people from their sins

122 Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying 123 Behold a virgin shall
be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his
name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us

124 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
had bidden him and took unto him his wife 125 And knew her not till
she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name JESUS

21 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem 22 Saying Where is he that is born King of the Jews for
we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him

23 When Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and
all Jerusalem with him

24 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born

25 And they said unto him In Bethlehem of Judaea for thus it is
written by the prophet 26 And thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda
art not the least among the princes of Juda for out of thee shall
come a Governor that shall rule my people Israel

27 Then Herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared

28 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and search diligently
for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again
that I may come and worship him also

29 When they had heard the king they departed and lo the star
which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood
over where the young child was

210 When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy

211 And when they were come into the house they saw the young child
with Mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they
had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and
frankincense and myrrh

212 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
Herod they departed into their own country another way

213 And when they were departed behold the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream saying Arise and take the young
child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I
bring thee word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him
