224 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly

225 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my
brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your
messenger and he that ministered to my wants

226 For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because
that ye had heard that he had been sick

227 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death but God had mercy on him
and not on him only but on me also lest I should have sorrow upon
sorrow

228 I sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him
again ye may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful

229 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold
such in reputation 230 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh
unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service
toward me

31 Finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord To write the same
things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe

32 Beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision

33 For we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and
rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh

34 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh If any other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh I more 35
Circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel of the tribe of
Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law a Pharisee
36 Concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the
righteousness which is in the law blameless

37 But what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ

38 Yea doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the
loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ
39 And be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is
of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the
righteousness which is of God by faith 310 That I may know him and
the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings
being made conformable unto his death 311 If by any means I might
attain unto the resurrection of the dead

312 Not as though I had already attained either were already
perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which
also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus

313 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one
thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching
forth unto those things which are before 314 I press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus

315 Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if
in any thing ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto
you

316 Nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by
the same rule let us mind the same thing

317 Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an ensample

318 For many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you
even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ 319
Whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is
in their shame who mind earthly things  320 For our conversation
is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour the Lord Jesus
Christ 321 Who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is
able even to subdue all things unto himself

41 Therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and
crown so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved

42 I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche that they be of the same
mind in the Lord

43 And I intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which
laboured with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my
fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life

44 Rejoice in the Lord alway and again I say Rejoice

45 Let your moderation be known unto all men The Lord is at hand

46 Be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
God

47 And the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep
your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus

48 Finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things
are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure
whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if
