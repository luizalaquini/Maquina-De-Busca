rh Letter-to-sound rules
Despite such irregularities it is surprising how much can be done
with simple letter-to-sound rules
These specify phonetic equivalents of word fragments and single letters
The longest stored fragment which matches the current word is translated
and then the same strategy is adopted on the remainder of the word
Table 95 shows some English fragments and their pronunciations

It is sometimes important to specify that a rule applies only when
the fragment is matched at the beginning or end of a word
In the Table - means that other fragments can precede or follow this
one
The | sign is used to separate suffixes from a word stem
