Dondarrion Beric Dondarrion had been handsome Sansa’s friend Jeyne had fallen in love with him Even Jeyne Poole was not so blind as to think this man was fair Yet when Arya looked at him again she saw it the remains of a forked purple lightning bolt on the cracked enamel of his breastplate

Rocks and trees and rivers that’s what your realm is made of the Hound was saying Do the rocks need defending Robert wouldn’t have thought so If he couldn’t fuck it fight it or drink it it bored him and so would you    you brave companions

Outrage swept the hollow hill Call us that name again dog and you’ll swallow that tongue Lem drew his longsword

The Hound stared at the blade with contempt Here’s a brave man baring steel on a bound captive Untie me why don’t you We’ll see how brave you are then He glanced at the Mad Huntsman behind him How about you Or did you leave all your courage in your kennels

No but I should have left you in a crow cage The Huntsman drew a knife I might still

The Hound laughed in his face

We are brothers here Thoros of Myr declared Holy brothers sworn to the realm to our god and to each other

The brotherhood without banners Tom Sevenstrings plucked a string The knights of the hollow hill

Knights Clegane made the word a sneer Dondarrion’s a knight but the rest of you are the sorriest lot of outlaws and broken men I’ve ever seen I shit better men than you

Any knight can make a knight said the scarecrow that was Beric Dondarrion and every man you see before you has felt a sword upon his shoulder We are the forgotten fellowship

Send me on my way and I’ll forget you too Clegane rasped But if you mean to murder me then bloody well get on with it You took my sword my horse and my gold so take my life and be done with it    but spare me this pious bleating

You will die soon enough dog promised Thoros but it shan’t be murder only justice

Aye said the Mad Huntsman and a kinder fate than you deserve for all your kind have done Lions you call yourselves At Sherrer and the Mummer’s Ford girls of six and seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched No lion ever killed so cruel

I was not at Sherrer nor the Mummer’s Ford the Hound told him Lay your dead children at some other door

Thoros answered him Do you deny that House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne By rights your arms should bear two bloody infants in place of those ugly dogs

The Hound’s mouth twitched Do you take me for my brother Is being born Clegane a crime

Murder is a crime

Who did I murder

Lord Lothar Mallery and Ser Gladden Wylde said Harwin

My brothers Lister and Lennocks declared Jack-Be-Lucky

Goodman Beck and Mudge the miller’s son from Donnelwood an old woman called from the shadows

Merriman’s widow who loved so sweet added Greenbeard

Them septons at Sludgy Pond

Ser Andrey Charlton His squire Lucas Roote Every man woman and child in Fieldstone and Mousedown Mill

Lord and Lady Deddings that was so rich

Tom Sevenstrings took up the count Alyn of Winterfell Joth Quick-bow Little Matt and his sister Randa Anvil Ryn Ser Ormond Ser Dudley Pate of Mory Pate of Lancewood Old Pate and Pate of Shermer’s Grove Blind Wyl the Whittler Goodwife Maerie Maerie the Whore Becca the Baker Ser Raymun Darry Lord Darry young Lord Darry The Bastard of Bracken Fletcher Will Harsley Goodwife Nolla—

Enough The Hound’s face was tight with anger You’re making noise These names mean nothing Who were they

People said Lord Beric People great and small young and old Good people and bad people who died on the points of Lannister spears or saw their bellies opened by Lannister swords

It wasn’t my sword in their bellies Any man who says it was is a bloody liar

You serve the Lannisters of Casterly Rock said Thoros

Once Me and thousands more Is each of us guilty of the crimes of the others Clegane spat Might be you are knights after all You lie like knights maybe you murder like knights

Lem and Jack-Be-Lucky began to shout at him but Dondarrion raised a hand for silence Say what you mean Clegane

A knight’s a sword with a horse The rest the vows and the sacred oils and the lady’s favors they’re silk ribbons tied round the sword Maybe the sword’s prettier with ribbons hanging off it but it will kill you just as dead Well bugger your ribbons and shove your swords up your arses I’m the same as you The only difference is I don’t lie about what I am So kill me but don’t call me a murderer while you stand there telling each other that your shit don’t stink You hear me

Arya squirted past Greenbeard so fast he never saw her You are a murderer she screamed You killed Mycah don’t say you never did You murdered him

The Hound stared at her with no flicker of recognition And who was this Mycah boy

I’m not a boy But Mycah was He was a butcher’s boy and you killed him Jory said you cut him near in half and he never even had a sword She could feel them looking at her now the women and the children and the men who called themselves the knights of the hollow hill Who’s this now someone asked

The Hound answered Seven hells The little sister The brat who tossed Joff’s pretty sword in the river He gave a bark of laughter Don’t you know you’re dead

No you’re dead she threw back at him

Harwin took her arm to draw her back as Lord Beric said The girl has named you a murderer Do you deny killing this butcher’s boy Mycah

The big man shrugged I was Joffrey’s sworn shield The butcher’s boy attacked a prince of the blood

That’s a lie Arya squirmed in Harwin’s grip It was me I hit Joffrey and threw Lion’s Paw in the river Mycah just ran away like I told him

Did you see the boy attack Prince Joffrey Lord Beric Dondarrion asked the Hound

I heard it from the royal lips It’s not my place to question princes Clegane jerked his hands toward Arya This one’s own sister told the same tale when she stood before your precious Robert

Sansa’s just a liar Arya said furious at her sister all over again It wasn’t like she said It wasn’t

Thoros drew Lord Beric aside The two men stood talking in low whispers while Arya seethed They have to kill him I prayed for him to die hundreds and hundreds of times

Beric Dondarrion turned back to the Hound You stand accused of murder but no one here knows the truth or falsehood of the charge so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by battle

The Hound frowned suspiciously as if he did not trust his ears Are you a fool or a madman

Neither I am a just lord Prove your innocence with a blade and you shall be free to go

No Arya cried before Harwin covered her mouth No they can’t he’ll go free The Hound was deadly with a sword everyone knew that He’ll laugh at them she thought

And so he did a long rasping laugh that echoed off the cave walls a laugh choking with contempt So who will it be He looked at Lem Lemoncloak The brave man in the piss-yellow cloak No How about you Huntsman You’ve kicked dogs before try me He saw Greenbeard You’re big enough Tyrosh step forward Or do you mean to make the little girl fight me herself He laughed again Come on who wants to die
