The names he read made Sansa hold her breath Lord Stannis Baratheon his lady wife his daughter Lord Renly Baratheon Both Lord Royces and their sons Ser Loras Tyrell Lord Mace Tyrell his brothers uncles sons The red priest Thoros of Myr Lord Beric Dondarrion Lady Lysa Arryn and her son the little Lord Robert Lord Hoster Tully his brother Ser Brynden his son Ser Edmure Lord Jason Mallister Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches Lord Tytos Blackwood Lord Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stevron Lord Karyl Vance Lord Jonos Bracken Lady Sheila Whent Doran Martell Prince of Dorne and all his sons So many she thought as Pycelle read on and on it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands

And at the end near last came the names Sansa had been dreading Lady Catelyn Stark Robb Stark Brandon Stark Rickon Stark Arya Stark Sansa stifled a gasp Arya They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath… it must mean her sister had fled on the galley she must be safe at Winterfell by now…

Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list tucked it up his left sleeve and pulled another parchment from his right He cleared his throat and resumed In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West take up the office of Hand of the King to speak with his voice lead his armies against his enemies and carry out his royal will So the king has decreed The small council consents

In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister who has ever been his staunchest support be seated upon his small council that she may help him rule wisely and with justice So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her but it was quickly stilled Pycelle continued

It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt Commander of the City Watch of King’s Landing be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council to assist in the governance of the realm So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance This time the muttering was louder and angrier Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding frog-faced commoner as he marched past Golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step His cloak was checked black-and-gold satin Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear gold on a night-black field The sight of it raised goose prickles up and down Sansa’s arms

As Lord Slynt took his place Grand Maester Pycelle resumed Lastly in these times of treason and turmoil with our beloved Robert so lately dead it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importance… He looked to the queen

Cersei stood Ser Barristan Selmy stand forth

Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne as still as any statue but now he went to one knee and bowed his head Your Grace I am yours to command

Rise Ser Barristan Cersei Lannister said You may remove your helm

My lady Standing the old knight took off his high white helm though he did not seem to understand why

You have served the realm long and faithfully good ser and every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks Yet now I fear your service is at an end It is the wish of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden

My… burden I fear I… I do not…

The new-made lord Janos Slynt spoke up his voice heavy and blunt Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

The tall white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there scarcely breathing Your Grace he said at last The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust

Whose death Ser Barristan The queen’s voice was soft as silk but her words carried the whole length of the hall Yours or your king’s

You let my father die Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne You’re too old to protect anybody

Sansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king She had never seen him look his years before yet now he did Your Grace he said I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year It was all I had ever dreamed from the moment I first took sword in hand I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place I had no need of land or sons my life would be lived for the realm Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my vows… to ward the king with all my strength… to give my blood for his… I fought beside the White Bull and Prince Lewyn of Dorne… beside Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning Before I served your father I helped shield King Aerys and his father Jaehaerys before him… three kings…

And all of them dead Littlefinger pointed out

Your time is done Cersei Lannister announced Joffrey requires men around him who are young and strong The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as the Lord Commander of Sworn Brothers of the White Swords

The Kingslayer Ser Barristan said his voice hard with contempt The false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend

Have a care for your words ser the queen warned You are speaking of our beloved brother your king’s own blood

Lord Varys spoke gentler than the others We are not unmindful of your service good ser Lord Tywin Lannister has generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of Lannisport beside the sea with gold and men sufficient to build you a stout keep and servants to see to your every need

Ser Barristan looked up sharply A hall to die in and men to bury me I thank you my lords… but I spit upon your pity He reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor His helmet dropped with a clang I am a knight he told them He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well I shall die a knight

A naked knight it would seem quipped Littlefinger

They all laughed then Joffrey on his throne and the lords standing attendance Janos Slynt and Queen Cersei and Sandor Clegane and even the other men of the Kingsguard the five who had been his brothers until a moment ago Surely that must have hurt the most Sansa thought Her heart went out to the gallant old man as he stood shamed and red-faced too angry to speak Finally he drew his sword

Sansa heard someone gasp Ser Boros and Ser Meryn moved forward to confront him but Ser Barristan froze them in place with a look that dripped contempt Have no fear sers your king is safe… no thanks to you Even now I could cut through the five of you as easy as a dagger cuts cheese If you would serve under the Kingslayer not a one of you is fit to wear the white He flung his sword at the foot of the Iron Throne Here boy Melt it down and add it to the others if you like It will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these five Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne

He took the long way out his steps ringing loud against the floor and echoing off the bare stone walls Lords and ladies parted to let him pass Not until the pages had closed the great oak-and-bronze doors behind him did Sansa hear sounds again soft voices uneasy stirrings the shuffle of papers from the council table He called me boy Joffrey said peevishly sounding younger than his years He talked about my uncle Stannis too

Idle talk said Varys the eunuch Without meaning…

He could be making plots with my uncles I want him seized and questioned No one moved Joffrey raised his voice I said I want him seized

Janos Slynt rose from the council table My gold cloaks will see to it Your Grace

Good said King Joffrey Lord Janos strode from the hall his ugly sons double-stepping to keep up as they lugged the great metal shield with the arms of House Slynt

Your Grace Littlefinger reminded the king If we might resume the seven are now six We find ourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard

Joffrey smiled Tell them Mother

The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield Sandor Clegane

How do you like that dog King Joffrey asked

The Hound’s scarred face was hard to read He took a long moment to consider Why not I have no lands nor wife to forsake and who’d care if I did The burned side of his mouth twisted But I warn you I’ll say no knight’s vows

The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights Ser Boros said firmly

Until now the Hound said in his deep rasp and Ser Boros fell silent

When the king’s herald moved forward Sansa realized the moment was almost at hand She smoothed down the cloth of her skirt nervously She was dressed in mourning as a sign of respect for the dead king but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her the one Arya had ruined but she’d had them dye it black and you couldn’t see the stain at all She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain

The herald’s voice boomed out If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence

Sansa quailed Now she told herself I must do it now Gods give me courage She took one step then another Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass and she felt the weight of their eyes on her I must be as strong as my lady mother Your Grace she called out in a soft tremulous voice

The height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall He was the first to see her Come forward my lady he called out smiling

His smile emboldened her made her feel beautiful and strong He does love me he does Sansa lifted her head and walked toward him not too slow and not too fast She must not let them see how nervous she was

The Lady Sansa of House Stark the herald cried

She stopped under the throne at the spot where Ser Barristan’s white cloak lay puddled on the floor beside his helm and breastplate Do you have some business for king and council Sansa the queen asked from the council table

I do She knelt on the cloak so as not to spoil her gown and looked up at her prince on his fearsome black throne As it please Your Grace I ask mercy for my father Lord Eddard Stark who was the Hand of the King She had practiced the words a hundred times

The queen sighed Sansa you disappoint me What did I tell you about traitor’s blood

Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes my lady Grand Maester Pycelle intoned
