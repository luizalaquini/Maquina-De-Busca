turned against me

1920 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and I am escaped
with the skin of my teeth

1921 Have pity upon me have pity upon me O ye my friends for the
hand of God hath touched me

1922 Why do ye persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my
flesh  1923 Oh that my words were now written oh that they were
printed in a book  1924 That they were graven with an iron pen and
lead in the rock for ever  1925 For I know that my redeemer liveth
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth 1926 And
though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I
see God 1927 Whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall
behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me

1928 But ye should say Why persecute we him seeing the root of the
matter is found in me  1929 Be ye afraid of the sword for wrath
bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a
judgment

201 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite and said 202 Therefore do
my thoughts cause me to answer and for this I make haste

203 I have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my
understanding causeth me to answer

204 Knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth
205 That the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment  206 Though his excellency mount up to
the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds 207 Yet he shall
perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say
Where is he  208 He shall fly away as a dream and shall not be
found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night

209 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall
his place any more behold him

2010 His children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall
restore their goods

2011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down
with him in the dust

2012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under
his tongue 2013 Though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it
still within his mouth 2014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned it
is the gall of asps within him

2015 He hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again
God shall cast them out of his belly

2016 He shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay
him

2017 He shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and
butter

2018 That which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not
swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be
and he shall not rejoice therein

2019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he
hath violently taken away an house which he builded not 2020 Surely
he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that
which he desired

2021 There shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man
look for his goods

2022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every
hand of the wicked shall come upon him

2023 When he is about to fill his belly God shall cast the fury of
his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating

2024 He shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall
strike him through

2025 It is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering
sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him

2026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown
shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his
tabernacle

2027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise
up against him

2028 The increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow
away in the day of his wrath

2029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God and the heritage
appointed unto him by God

211 But Job answered and said 212 Hear diligently my speech and
let this be your consolations

213 Suffer me that I may speak and after that I have spoken mock
