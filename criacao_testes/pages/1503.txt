What if I decide you’re only worthy to be my fool Dany asked scornfully Or perhaps my cook

I would be honored Your Grace Selmy said with quiet dignity I can bake apples and boil beef as well as any man and I’ve roasted many a duck over a campfire I hope you like them greasy with charred skin and bloody bones

That made her smile I’d have to be mad to eat such fare Ben Plumm come give Ser Barristan your longsword

But Whitebeard would not take it I flung my sword at Joffrey’s feet and have not touched one since Only from the hand of my queen will I accept a sword again

As you wish Dany took the sword from Brown Ben and offered it hilt first The old man took it reverently Now kneel she told him and swear it to my service

He went to one knee and lay the blade before her as he said the words Dany scarcely heard them He was the easy one she thought The other will be harder When Ser Barristan was done she turned to Jorah Mormont And now you ser Tell me true

The big man’s neck was red whether from anger or shame she did not know I have tried to tell you true half a hundred times I told you Arstan was more than he seemed I warned you that Xaro and Pyat Pree were not to be trusted I warned you—

You warned me against everyone except yourself His insolence angered her He should be humbler He should beg for my forgiveness Trust no one but Jorah Mormont you said… and all the time you were the Spider’s creature

I am no man’s creature I took the eunuch’s gold yes I learned some ciphers and wrote some letters but that was all—

All You spied on me and sold me to my enemies

For a time He said it grudgingly I stopped

When When did you stop

I made one report from Qarth but—

From Qarth Dany had been hoping it had ended much earlier What did you write from Qarth That you were my man now that you wanted no more of their schemes Ser Jorah could not meet her eyes When Khal Drogo died you asked me to go with you to Yi Ti and the Jade Sea Was that your wish or Robert’s

That was to protect you he insisted To keep you away from them I knew what snakes they were…

Snakes And what are you ser Something unspeakable occurred to her You told them I was carrying Drogo’s child…

Khaleesi…

Do not think to deny it ser Ser Barristan said sharply I was there when the eunuch told the council and Robert decreed that Her Grace and her child must die You were the source ser There was even talk that you might do the deed for a pardon

A lie Ser Jorah’s face darkened I would never… Daenerys it was me who stopped you from drinking the wine

Yes And how was it you knew the wine was poisoned

I… I but suspected… the caravan brought a letter from Varys he warned me there would be attempts He wanted you watched yes but not harmed He went to his knees If I had not told them someone else would have You know that

I know you betrayed me She touched her belly where her son Rhaego had perished I know a poisoner tried to kill my son because of you That’s what I know

No… no He shook his head I never meant… forgive me You have to forgive me

Have to It was too late He should have begun by begging forgiveness She could not pardon him as she’d intended She had dragged the wineseller behind her horse until there was nothing left of him Didn’t the man who brought him deserve the same This is Jorah my fierce bear the right arm that never failed me I would be dead without him but… I can’t forgive you she said I can’t

You forgave the old man…

He lied to me about his name You sold my secrets to the men who killed my father and stole my brother’s throne

I protected you I fought for you Killed for you

Kissed me she thought betrayed me

I went down into the sewers like a rat For you

It might have been kinder if you’d died there Dany said nothing There was nothing to say

Daenerys he said I have loved you

And there it was Three treasons will you know Once for blood and once for gold and once for love The gods do nothing without a purpose they say You did not die in battle so it must be they still have some use for you But I don’t I will not have you near me You are banished ser Go back to your masters in King’s Landing and collect your pardon if you can Or to Astapor No doubt the butcher king needs knights

No He reached for her Daenerys please hear me…

She slapped his hand away Do not ever presume to touch me again or to speak my name You have until dawn to collect your things and leave this city If you’re found in Meereen past break of day I will have Strong Belwas twist your head off I will Believe that She turned her back on him her skirts swirling I cannot bear to see his face Remove this liar from my sight she commanded I must not weep I must not If I weep I will forgive him Strong Belwas seized Ser Jorah by the arm and dragged him out When Dany glanced back the knight was walking as if drunk stumbling and slow She looked away until she heard the doors open and close Then she sank back onto the ebony bench He’s gone then My father and my mother my brothers Ser Willem Darry Drogo who was my sun-and-stars his son who died inside me and now Ser Jorah…

The queen has a good heart Daario purred through his deep purple whiskers but that one is more dangerous than all the Oznaks and Meros rolled up in one His strong hands caressed the hilts of his matched blades those wanton golden women You need not even say the word my radiance Only give the tiniest nod and your Daario shall fetch you back his ugly head

Leave him be The scales are balanced now Let him go home Dany pictured Jorah moving amongst old gnarled oaks and tall pines past flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss and little creeks running icy down steep hillsides She saw him entering a hall built of huge logs where dogs slept by the hearth and the smell of meat and mead hung thick in the smoky air We are done for now she told her captains

It was all she could do not to run back up the wide marble stairs Irri helped her slip from her court clothes and into more comfortable garb baggy woolen breeches a loose felted tunic a painted Dothraki vest You are trembling Khaleesi the girl said as she knelt to lace up Dany’s sandals

I’m cold Dany lied Bring me the book I was reading last night She wanted to lose herself in the words in other times and other places The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms Children’s stories if truth be told too simple and fanciful to be true history All the heroes were tall and handsome and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes Yet she loved them all the same Last night she had been reading of the three princesses in the red tower locked away by the king for the crime of being beautiful

When her handmaid brought the book Dany had no trouble finding the page where she had left off but it was no good She found herself reading the same passage half a dozen times Ser Jorah gave me this book as a bride’s gift the day I wed Khal Drogo But Daario is right I shouldn’t have banished him I should have kept him or I should have killed him She played at being a queen yet sometimes she still felt like a scared little girl Viserys always said what a dolt I was Was he truly mad She closed the book She could still recall Ser Jorah if she wished Or send Daario to kill him

Dany fled from the choice out onto the terrace She found Rhaegal asleep beside the pool a green and bronze coil basking in the sun Drogon was perched up atop the pyramid in the place where the huge bronze harpy had stood before she had commanded it to be pulled down He spread his wings and roared when he spied her There was no sign of Viserion but when she went to the parapet and scanned the horizon she saw pale wings in the far distance sweeping above the river He is hunting They grow bolder every day Yet it still made her anxious when they flew too far away One day one of them may not return she thought

Your Grace

She turned to find Ser Barristan behind her What more would you have of me ser I spared you I took you into my service now give me some peace

Forgive me Your Grace It was only… now that you know who I am… The old man hesitated A knight of the Kingsguard is in the king’s presence day and night For that reason our vows require us to protect his secrets as we would his life But your father’s secrets by rights belong to you now along with his throne and… I thought perhaps you might have questions for me

Questions She had a hundred questions a thousand ten thousand Why couldn’t she think of one Was my father truly mad she blurted out Why do I ask that Viserys said this talk of madness was a ploy of the Usurper’s…

Viserys was a child and the queen sheltered him as much as she could Your father always had a little madness in him I now believe Yet he was charming and generous as well so his lapses were forgiven His reign began with such promise… but as the years passed the lapses grew more frequent until…

Dany stopped him Do I want to hear this now

Ser Barristan considered a moment Perhaps not Not now

Not now she agreed One day One day you must tell me all The good and the bad There is some good to be said of my father surely

There is Your Grace Of him and those who came before him Your grandfather Jaehaerys and his brother their father Aegon your mother… and Rhaegar Him most of all

I wish I could have known him Her voice was wistful
