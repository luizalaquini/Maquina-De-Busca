there is liberty

318 But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as
by the Spirit of the LORD

41 Therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy
we faint not 42 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty
not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans
conscience in the sight of God

43 But if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost 44 In
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is
the image of God should shine unto them

45 For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
ourselves your servants for Jesus sake

46 For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath
shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ

47 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency
of the power may be of God and not of us

48 We are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are
perplexed but not in despair 49 Persecuted but not forsaken cast
down but not destroyed 410 Always bearing about in the body the
dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made
manifest in our body

411 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh

412 So then death worketh in us but life in you

413 We having the same spirit of faith according as it is written I
believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore
speak 414 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise
up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you

415 For all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might
through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God

416 For which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish
yet the inward man is renewed day by day

417 For our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 418 While we
look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not
seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which
are not seen are eternal

51 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved we have a building of God an house not made with hands
eternal in the heavens

52 For in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
our house which is from heaven 53 If so be that being clothed we
shall not be found naked

54 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not
for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might
be swallowed up of life

55 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God who
also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit

56 Therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at
home in the body we are absent from the Lord 57 For we walk by
faith not by sight 58 We are confident I say and willing rather
to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord

59 Wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be
accepted of him

510 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that
every one may receive the things done in his body according to that
he hath done whether it be good or bad

511 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men but we
are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your
consciences

512 For we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you
occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer
them which glory in appearance and not in heart

513 For whether we be beside ourselves it is to God or whether we
be sober it is for your cause

514 For the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge
that if one died for all then were all dead 515 And that he died
for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again

516 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though
