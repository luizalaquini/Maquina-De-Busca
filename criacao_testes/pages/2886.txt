591 Deliver me from mine enemies O my God defend me from them that
rise up against me

592 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody
men

593 For lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered
against me not for my transgression nor for my sin O LORD

594 They run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help
me and behold

595 Thou therefore O LORD God of hosts the God of Israel awake to
visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors
Selah

596 They return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go
round about the city

597 Behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their
lips for who say they doth hear

598 But thou O LORD shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the
heathen in derision

599 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee for God is my
defence

5910 The God of my mercy shall prevent me God shall let me see my
desire upon mine enemies

5911 Slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power
and bring them down O Lord our shield

5912 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they
speak

5913 Consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and
let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth
Selah

5914 And at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a
dog and go round about the city

5915 Let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not
satisfied

5916 But I will sing of thy power yea I will sing aloud of thy
mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the
day of my trouble

5917 Unto thee O my strength will I sing for God is my defence
and the God of my mercy



601 O God thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast
been displeased O turn thyself to us again

602 Thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal
the breaches thereof for it shaketh

603 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to
drink the wine of astonishment

604 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be
displayed because of the truth Selah

605 That thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and
hear me

606 God hath spoken in his holiness I will rejoice I will divide
Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth

607 Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine Ephraim also is the
strength of mine head Judah is my lawgiver

608 Moab is my washpot over Edom will I cast out my shoe Philistia
triumph thou because of me

609 Who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
Edom

6010 Wilt not thou O God which hadst cast us off and thou O God
which didst not go out with our armies

6011 Give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man

6012 Through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread
down our enemies



611 Hear my cry O God attend unto my prayer

612 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is
overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I
