However detecting prefixes by a simple splitting algorithm is dangerous
For example predate is a verb with stress on what appears to be a prefix
contrary to the rule while the pre in predator is not a prefix em at
least it is not pronounced as the prefix pre normally is
Moreover polysyllabic words like diplomat diplomacy diplomatic
or telegraph telegraphy telegraphic cannot be handled on such a simple
basis

In 1968 a remarkable work on English sound structure was published
Chomsky and Halle 1968 which proposes a system of rules to transform
English text into a phonetic representation in terms of distinctive features
with the aid of a lexicon

Chomsky Halle 1968

A great deal of attention is paid to stress and rules are given which
perform well in many tricky cases
pp
It uses the American system of levels of stress marking
so-called primary stress with a superscript 1 secondary stress with a
superscript 2 and so on
The superscripts are written on the vowel of the stressed
syllable  completely unstressed syllables receive no annotation
For example the sentence take Johns blackboard eraser is written
LB
tau2dke Jou3dhns blau1dckboau5drd erau4dser
LE
In foot notation this utterance
is
LB
take Johns blackboard eraser
LE
It undoubtedly contains less information than the stress-level version
For example the second syllable of blackboard and the first one of erase
are both unstressed although the rhythm rules given in Chapter 8
will cause them
to be treated differently because they occupy different places in the
syllable pattern of the foot
Take Johns and the second syllable of erase are all non-tonic
foot-initial syllables and hence are not distinguished in the notation
although the pitch contours schematized in Figure 89 will give them different
intonations
pp
An indefinite number of levels of stress can be used  For example according
to the rules given by Chomsky and Halle the word sad in
LB
my friend cant help being shocked at anyone who would fail to consider
his sad plight
LE
has level-8 stress the final two words being annotated
as sau8dd pliu1dght
However only the first few levels are used regularly and
it is doubtful whether acoustic distinctions are made in speech
between the weaker ones
pp
Chomsky and Halle are concerned to distinguish between such utterances as
LB
NI
blau2dck boau1drd-erau3dser    board eraser that is black
NI
blau1dckboau3drd erau2dser     eraser for a blackboard
NI
blau3dck boau1drd erau2dser    eraser of a black board
LE
and their stress assignment rules do indeed produce each version when
appropriate
In foot notation the distinctions can still be made
LB
NI
black board-eraser
NI
blackboard eraser
NI
black board eraser
LE
pp
The rules operate on a grammatical derivation tree
of the text
For instance input for the three examples would be written
LB
NI
dNPudAu black dAu dNudNu boarddNu
dNu eraser dNudNudNPu
NI
dNudNudAu black dAu dNu board dNudNu dNu eraser dNudNu
NI
dNudNPudAu black dAu dNu board dNudNPu dNu eraser dNudNu
LE
representing the trees shown in Figure 92
FC Figure 92
Here N stands for a noun NP for a noun phrase and A for an adjective
These categories appear explicitly as nodes in the tree
In the linearized textual representation they are used to label
brackets which represent the tree structure
An additional piece of information which is needed is the lexical entry for
eraser which would show that it has only one accented
that is potentially stressed syllable namely the second
