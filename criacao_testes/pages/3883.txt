Jon


He dreamt he was back in Winterfell limping past the stone kings on their thrones Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps You are no Stark he could hear them mutter in heavy granite voices There is no place for you here Go away He walked deeper into the darkness Father he called Bran Rickon No one answered A chill wind was blowing on his neck Uncle he called Uncle Benjen Father Please Father help me Up above he heard drums They are feasting in the Great Hall but I am not welcome there I am no Stark and this is not my place His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees The crypts were growing darker A light has gone out somewhere Ygritte he whispered Forgive me Please But it was only a direwolf grey and ghastly spotted with blood his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark…

The cell was dark the bed hard beneath him His own bed he remembered his own bed in his steward’s cell beneath the Old Bear’s chambers By rights it should have brought him sweeter dreams Even beneath the furs he was cold Ghost had shared his cell before the ranging warming it against the chill of night And in the wild Ygritte had slept beside him Both gone now He had burned Ygritte himself as he knew she would have wanted and Ghost… where are you Was he dead as well was that what his dream had meant the bloody wolf in the crypts But the wolf in the dream had been grey not white Grey like Bran’s wolf Had the Thenns hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown If so Bran was lost to him for good and all

Jon was trying to make sense of that when the horn blew

The Horn of Winter he thought still confused from sleep But Mance never found Joramun’s horn so that couldn’t be A second blast followed as long and deep as the first Jon had to get up and go to the Wall he knew but it was so hard…

He shoved aside his furs and sat The pain in his leg seemed duller nothing he could not stand He had slept in his breeches and tunic and smallclothes for the added warmth so he had only to pull on his boots and don leather and mail and cloak The horn blew again two long blasts so he slung Longclaw over one shoulder found his crutch and hobbled down the steps

It was the black of night outside bitter cold and overcast His brothers were spilling out of towers and keeps buckling their swordbelts and walking toward the Wall Jon looked for Pyp and Grenn but could not find them Perhaps one of them was the sentry blowing the horn It is Mance he thought He has come at last That was good We will fight a battle and then we’ll rest Alive or dead we’ll rest

Where the stair had been only an immense tangle of charred wood and broken ice remained below the Wall The winch raised them up now but the cage was only big enough for ten men at a time and it was already on its way up by the time Jon arrived He would need to wait for its return Others waited with him Satin Mully Spare Boot Kegs big blond Hareth with his buck teeth Everyone called him Horse He had been a stablehand in Mole’s Town one of the few moles who had stayed at Castle Black The rest had run back to their fields and hovels or their beds in the underground brothel Horse wanted to take the black though the great buck-toothed fool Zei remained as well the whore who’d proved so handy with a crossbow and Noye had kept three orphan boys whose father had died on the steps They were young—nine and eight and five—but no one else seemed to want them

As they waited for the cage to come back Clydas brought them cups of hot mulled wine while Three-Finger Hobb passed out chunks of black bread Jon took a heel from him and gnawed on it

Is it Mance Rayder Satin asked anxiously

We can hope so There were worse things than wildlings in the dark Jon remembered the words the wildling king had spoken on the Fist of the First Men as they stood amidst that pink snow When the dead walk walls and stakes and swords mean nothing You cannot fight the dead Jon Snow No man knows that half so well as me Just thinking of it made the wind seem a little colder

Finally the cage came clanking back down swaying at the end of the long chain and they crowded in silently and shut the door

Mully yanked the bell rope three times A moment later they began to rise by fits and starts at first then more smoothly No one spoke At the top the cage swung sideways and they clambered out one by one Horse gave Jon a hand down onto the ice The cold hit him in the teeth like a fist

A line of fires burned along the top of the Wall contained in iron baskets on poles taller than a man The cold knife of the wind stirred and swirled the flames so the lurid orange light was always shifting Bundles of quarrels arrows spears and scorpion bolts stood ready on every hand Rocks were piled ten feet high big wooden barrels of pitch and lamp oil lined up beside them Bowen Marsh had left Castle Black well supplied in everything save men The wind was whipping at the black cloaks of the scarecrow sentinels who stood along the ramparts spears in hand I hope it wasn’t one of them who blew the horn Jon said to Donal Noye when he limped up beside him

Did you hear that Noye asked

There was the wind and horses and something else A mammoth Jon said That was a mammoth

The armorer’s breath was frosting as it blew from his broad flat nose North of the Wall was a sea of darkness that seemed to stretch forever Jon could make out the faint red glimmer of distant fires moving through the wood It was Mance certain as sunrise The Others did not light torches

How do we fight them if we can’t see them Horse asked

Donal Noye turned toward the two great trebuchets that Bowen Marsh had restored to working order Give me light he roared

Barrels of pitch were loaded hastily into the slings and set afire with a torch The wind fanned the flames to a brisk red fury NOW Noye bellowed The counterweights plunged downward the throwing arms rose to thud against the padded crossbars The burning pitch went tumbling through the darkness casting an eerie flickering light upon the ground below Jon caught a glimpse of mammoths moving ponderously through the half-light and just as quickly lost them again A dozen maybe more The barrels struck the earth and burst They heard a deep bass trumpeting and a giant roared something in the Old Tongue his voice an ancient thunder that sent shivers up Jon’s spine

Again Noye shouted and the trebuchets were loaded once more Two more barrels of burning pitch went crackling through the gloom to come crashing down amongst the foe This time one of them struck a dead tree enveloping it in flame Not a dozen mammoths Jon saw a hundred

He stepped to the edge of the precipice Careful he reminded himself it is a long way down Red Alyn sounded his sentry’s horn once more Aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooooooooo aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooo And now the wildlings answered not with one horn but with a dozen and with drums and pipes as well We are come they seemed to say we are come to break your Wall to take your lands and steal your daughters The wind howled the trebuchets creaked and thumped the barrels flew Behind the giants and the mammoths Jon saw men advancing on the Wall with bows and axes Were there twenty or twenty thousand In the dark there was no way to tell This is a battle of blind men but Mance has a few thousand more of them than we do

The gate Pyp cried out They’re at the GATE

The Wall was too big to be stormed by any conventional means too high for ladders or siege towers too thick for battering rams No catapult could throw a stone large enough to breach it and if you tried to set it on fire the icemelt would quench the flames You could climb over as the raiders did near Greyguard but only if you were strong and fit and sure-handed and even then you might end up like Jarl impaled on a tree They must take the gate or they cannot pass

But the gate was a crooked tunnel through the ice smaller than any castle gate in the Seven Kingdoms so narrow that rangers must lead their garrons through single file Three iron grates closed the inner passage each locked and chained and protected by a murder hole The outer door was old oak nine inches thick and studded with iron not easy to break through But Mance has mammoths he reminded himself and giants as well

Must be cold down there said Noye What say we warm them up lads A dozen jars of lamp oil had been lined up on the precipice Pyp ran down the line with a torch setting them alight Owen the Oaf followed shoving them over the edge one by one Tongues of pale yellow fire swirled around the jars as they plunged downward When the last was gone Grenn kicked loose the chocks on a barrel of pitch and sent it rumbling and rolling over the edge as well The sounds below changed to shouts and screams sweet music to their ears

Yet still the drums beat on the trebuchets shuddered and thumped and the sound of skinpipes came wafting through the night like the songs of strange fierce birds Septon Cellador began to sing as well his voice tremulous and thick with wine





Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know…





Donal Noye rounded on him Any man here stays his sword I’ll chuck his puckered arse right off this Wall… starting with you Septon Archers Do we have any bloody archers

Here said Satin

And here said Mully But how can I find a target It’s black as the inside of a pig’s belly Where are they

Noye pointed north Loose enough arrows might be you’ll find a few At least you’ll make them fretful He looked around the ring of firelit faces I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if they break the gate More than ten stepped forward and the smith picked his four Jon you have the Wall till I return

For a moment Jon thought he had misheard It had sounded as if Noye were leaving him in command My lord

Lord I’m a blacksmith I said the Wall is yours

There are older men Jon wanted to say better men I am still as green as summer grass I’m wounded and I stand accused of desertion His mouth had gone bone dry Aye he managed

Afterward it would seem to Jon Snow as if he’d dreamt that night Side by side with the straw soldiers with longbows or crossbows clutched in half-frozen hands his archers launched a hundred flights of arrows against men they never saw From time to time a wildling arrow came flying back in answer He sent men to the smaller catapults and filled the air with jagged rocks the size of a giant’s fist but the darkness swallowed them as a man might swallow a handful of nuts Mammoths trumpeted in the gloom strange voices called out in stranger tongues and Septon Cellador prayed so loudly and drunkenly for the dawn to come that Jon was tempted to chuck him over the edge himself They heard a mammoth dying at their feet and saw another lurch burning through the woods trampling down men and trees alike The wind blew cold and colder Hobb rode up the chain with cups of onion broth and Owen and Clydas served them to the archers where they stood so they could gulp them down between arrows Zei took a place among them with her crossbow Hours of repeated jars and shocks knocked something loose on the right-hand trebuchet and its counterweight came crashing free suddenly and catastrophically wrenching the throwing arm sideways with a splintering crash The left-hand trebuchet kept throwing but the wildlings had quickly learned to shun the place where its loads were landing

We should have twenty trebuchets not two and they should be mounted on sledges and turntables so we could move them It was a futile thought He might as well wish for another thousand men and maybe a dragon or three

Donal Noye did not return nor any of them who’d gone down with him to hold that black cold tunnel The Wall is mine Jon reminded himself whenever he felt his strength flagging He had taken up a longbow himself and his fingers felt crabbed and stiff half-frozen His fever was back as well and his leg would tremble uncontrollably sending a white-hot knife of pain right through him One more arrow and I’ll rest he told himself half a hundred times Just one more Whenever his quiver was empty one of the orphaned moles would bring him another One more quiver and I’m done It couldn’t be long until the dawn

When morning came none of them quite realized it at first The world was still dark but the black had turned to grey and shapes were beginning to emerge half-seen from the gloom Jon lowered his bow to stare at the mass of heavy clouds that covered the eastern sky He could see a glow behind them but perhaps he was only dreaming He notched another arrow

Then the rising sun broke through to send pale lances of light across the battleground Jon found himself holding his breath as he looked out over the half-mile swath of cleared land that lay between the Wall and the edge of the forest In half a night they had turned it into a wasteland of blackened grass bubbling pitch shattered stone and corpses The carcass of the burned mammoth was already drawing crows There were giants dead on the ground as well but behind them…

Someone moaned to his left and he heard Septon Cellador say Mother have mercy oh Oh oh oh Mother have mercy

Beneath the trees were all the wildlings in the world raiders and giants wargs and skinchangers mountain men salt sea sailors ice river cannibals cave dwellers with dyed faces dog chariots from the Frozen Shore Hornfoot men with their soles like boiled leather all the queer wild folk Mance had gathered to break the Wall This is not your land Jon wanted to shout at them There is no place for you here Go away He could hear Tormund Giantsbane laughing at that You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte would have said He flexed his sword hand opening and closing the fingers though he knew full well that swords would not come into it up here
