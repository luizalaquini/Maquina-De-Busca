We have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished us to see she went on Rakharo go forth and look on the rest and tell me what you find Take good men with you—and women to go places where men are forbidden

As you say I do blood of my blood said Rakharo

Ser Jorah find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor It has been half a year since I last heard tidings from the Seven Kingdoms Perhaps the gods will have blown some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry us home

The knight frowned That would be no kindness The Usurper will kill you sure as sunrise Mormont hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt My place is here at your side

Jhogo can guard me as well You have more languages than my bloodriders and the Dothraki mistrust the sea and those who sail her Only you can serve me in this Go among the ships and speak to the crews learn where they are from and where they are bound and what manner of men command them

Reluctantly the exile nodded As you say my queen

When all the men had gone her handmaids stripped off the travel-stained silks she wore and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico The water was deliciously cool and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle It felt good to close her eyes and float knowing she could rest as long as she liked She wondered whether Aegon’s Red Keep had a pool like this and fragrant gardens full of lavender and mint It must surely Viserys always said the Seven Kingdoms were more beautiful than any other place in the world

The thought of home disquieted her If her sun-and-stars had lived he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies but his strength had left the world Her bloodriders remained sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter but only in the ways of the horselords The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms they did not rule them Dany had no wish to reduce King’s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts She had supped enough on tears I want to make my kingdom beautiful to fill it with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children I want my people to smile when they see me ride by the way Viserys said they smiled for my father

But before she could do that she must conquer

The Usurper will kill you sure as sunrise Mormont had said Robert had slain her gallant brother Rhaegar and one of his creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle a man who loved nothing better than war And with him stood the great lords her brother had named the Usurper’s dogs cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart and the golden Lannisters father and son so rich so powerful so treacherous

How could she hope to overthrow such men When Khal Drogo had lived men trembled and made him gifts to stay his wrath If they did not he took their cities wealth and wives and all But his khalasar had been vast while hers was meager Her people had followed her across the red waste as she chased her comet and would follow her across the poison water too but they would not be enough Even her dragons might not be enough Viserys had believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king    but Viserys had been a fool and fools believe in foolish things

Her doubts made her shiver Suddenly the water felt cold to her and the little fish prickling at her skin annoying Dany stood and climbed from the pool Irri she called Jhiqui

As the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe Dany’s thoughts went to the three who had sought her out in the City of Bones The Bleeding Star led me to Qarth for a purpose Here I will find what I need if I have the strength to take what is offered and the wisdom to avoid the traps and snares If the gods mean for me to conquer they will provide they will send me a sign and if not    if not   

It was near evenfall and Dany was feeding her dragons when Irri stepped through the silken curtains to tell her that Ser Jorah had returned from the docks    and not alone Send him in with whomever he has brought she said curious

When they entered she was seated on a mound of cushions her dragons all about her The man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet Your Grace the knight said I bring you Quhuru Mo captain of the Cinnamon Wind out of Tall Trees Town

The black man knelt I am greatly honored my queen he said not in the tongue of the Summer Isles which Dany did not know but in the liquid Valyrian of the Nine Free Cities

The honor is mine Quhuru Mo said Dany in the same language Have you come from the Summer Isles

This is so Your Grace but before not half a year past we called at Oldtown From there I bring you a wondrous gift

A gift

A gift of news Dragonmother Stormborn I tell you true Robert Baratheon is dead

Outside her walls dusk was settling over Qarth but a sun had risen in Dany’s heart Dead she repeated In her lap black Drogon hissed and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil You are certain The Usurper is dead

So it is said in Oldtown and Dorne and Lys and all the other ports where we have called

He sent me poisoned wine yet I live and he is gone What was the manner of his death On her shoulder pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream stirring the air

Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood or so I heard in Oldtown Others say his queen betrayed him or his brother or Lord Stark who was his Hand Yet all the tales agree in this King Robert is dead and in his grave

Dany had never looked upon the Usurper’s face yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place And now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow

The boy sits the Iron Throne now Ser Jorah said

King Joffrey reigns Quhuru Mo agreed but the Lannisters rule Robert’s brothers have fled King’s Landing The talk is they mean to claim the crown And the Hand has fallen Lord Stark who was King Robert’s friend He has been seized for treason

Ned Stark a traitor Ser Jorah snorted Not bloody likely The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor

What honor could he have Dany said He was a traitor to his true king as were these Lannisters It pleased her to hear that the Usurper’s dogs were fighting amongst themselves though she was unsurprised The same thing happened when her Drogo died and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces My brother is dead as well Viserys who was the true king she told the Summer Islander Khal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold Would her brother have been any wiser had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand

Then I grieve for you Dragonmother and for bleeding Westeros bereft of its rightful king

Beneath Dany’s gentle fingers green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold When his mouth opened his teeth gleamed like black needles When does your ship return to Westeros Captain

Not for a year or more I fear From here the Cinnamon Wind sails east to make the trader’s circle round the Jade Sea

I see said Dany disappointed I wish you fair winds and good trading then You have brought me a precious gift

I have been amply repaid great queen

She puzzled at that How so

His eyes gleamed I have seen dragons

Dany laughed And will see more of them one day I hope Come to me in King’s Landing when I am on my father’s throne and you shall have a great reward

The Summer Islander promised he would do so and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave Jhiqui showed him out while Ser Jorah Mormont remained

Khaleesi the knight said when they were alone I should not speak so freely of your plans if I were you This man will spread the tale wherever he goes now

Let him she said Let the whole world know my purpose The Usurper is dead what does it matter

Not every sailor’s tale is true Ser Jorah cautioned and even if Robert be truly dead his son rules in his place This changes nothing truly

This changes everything Dany rose abruptly Screeching her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings Drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway The others skittered across the floor wingtips scrabbling on the marble Before the Seven Kingdoms were like my Drogo’s khalasar a hundred thousand made as one by his strength Now they fly to pieces even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead

The high lords have always fought Tell me who’s won and I’ll tell you what it means Khaleesi the Seven Kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches You will need a fleet gold armies alliances—

All this I know She took his hands in hers and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes Sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed but does he ever truly see me as his queen I am not the frightened girl you met in Pentos I have counted only fifteen name days true    but I am as old as the crones in the dosh khaleen and as young as my dragons Jorah I have borne a child burned a khal and crossed the red waste and the Dothraki sea Mine is the blood of the dragon

As was your brother’s he said stubbornly

I am not Viserys

No he admitted There is more of Rhaegar in you I think but even Rhaegar could be slain Robert proved that on the Trident with no more than a warhammer Even dragons can die

Dragons die She stood on her toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek But so do dragonslayers
