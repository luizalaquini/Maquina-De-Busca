Viserys is dead I am his heir the last blood of House Targaryen Whatever was his is mine now

My… queen Ser Jorah said going to one knee My sword that was his is yours Dacnerys And my heart as well that never belonged to your brother I am only a knight and I have nothing to offer you but exile but I beg you hear me Let Khal Drogo go You shall not be alone I promise you no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go You need not join the dosh khaleen Come east with me Yi Ti Qarth the Jade Sea Asshai by the Shadow We will see all the wonders yet unseen and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us Please Khaleesi I know what you intend Do not Do not

I must Dany told him She touched his face fondly sadly You do not understand

I understand that you loved him Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair I loved my lady wife once yet I did not die with her You are my queen my sword is yours but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo’s pyre I will not watch you burn

Is that what you fear Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead I am not such a child as that sweet ser

You do not mean to die with him You swear it my queen

I swear it she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers

The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger and covered with dry leaves and twigs They laid them north to south from ice to fire and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done Dany called the Dothraki around her Fewer than a hundred were left How many had Aegon started with she wondered It did not matter

You will be my khalasar she told them I see the faces of slaves I free you Take off your collars Go if you wish no one shall harm you If you stay it will be as brothers and sisters husbands and wives The black eyes watched her wary expressionless I see the children women the wrinkled faces of the aged I was a child yesterday Today I am a woman Tomorrow I will be old To each of you I say give me your hands and your hearts and there will always be a place for you She turned to the three young warriors of her khas Jhogo to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift and name you ko and ask your oath that you will live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

Jhogo took the whip from her hands but his face was confused Khaleesi he said hesitantly this is not done It would shame me to be bloodrider to a woman

Aggo Dany called paying no heed to Jhogo’s words If I look back I am lost To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift It was double-curved shiny black and exquisite taller than she was I name you ko and ask your oath that you should live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes I cannot say these words Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko

Rakharo Dany said turning away from the refusal you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift with hilt and blade chased in gold And you too I name my ko and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm

You are khaleesi Rakharo said taking the arakh I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen No more can I promise

She nodded as calmly as if she had not heard his answer and turned to the last of her champions Ser Jorah Mormont she said first and greatest of my knights I have no bride gift to give you but I swear to you one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel And I would ask for your oath as well

You have it my queen Ser Jorah said kneeling to lay his sword at her feet I vow to serve you to obey you to die for you if need be

Whatever may come

Whatever may come

I shall hold you to that oath I pray you never regret the giving of it Dany lifted him to his feet Stretching on her toes to reach his lips she kissed the knight gently and said You are the first of my Queensguard

She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes They thought her mad Dany realized Perhaps she was She would know soon enough If I look back I am lost

Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud She liked the heat It made her feel clean Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak the steam rose moist and fragrant Doreah washed her hair and combed it out working loose the mats and tangles Irri scrubbed her back Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs She shuddered when it entered her and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve She floated

When she was clean her handmaids helped her from the water Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon a touch on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts The last dab was for her sex Irri’s finger felt as light and cool as a lover’s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips

Afterward Dany sent them all away so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair running her fingers through it for the last time feeling the weight of it remembering the first time she had touched it the night of their wedding ride His hair had never been cut How many men could die with their hair uncut She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils He smelled like grass and warm earth like smoke and semen and horses He smelled like Drogo Forgive me sun of my life she thought Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do I paid the price my star but it was too high too high…

Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one So many bells gold and silver and bronze Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest old and faded the one Drogo had loved best For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers sandals that laced halfway up her legs and a vest like Drogo’s

The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent Dany walked behind them They laid him down on his cushions and silks his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast

Oil she commanded and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance Bring my eggs Dany commanded her handmaids Something in her voice made them run

Ser Jorah took her arm My queen Drogo will have no use for dragon’s eggs in the night lands Better to sell them in Asshai Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days
