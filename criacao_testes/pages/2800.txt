to Hezekiah king of Judah so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thenceforth

3224 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto
the LORD and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign

3225 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon
him and upon Judah and Jerusalem

3226 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
heart both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the wrath of
the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah

3227 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made
himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones
and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant
jewels 3228 Storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and
oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks

3229 Moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and
herds in abundance for God had given him substance very much

3230 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David
And Hezekiah prospered in all his works

3231 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
Babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in
the land God left him to try him that he might know all that was in
his heart

3232 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness behold
they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel

3233 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death And Manasseh his
son reigned in his stead

331 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he
reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem 332 But did that which was
evil in the sight of the LORD like unto the abominations of the
heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel

333 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
broken down and he reared up altars for Baalim and made groves and
worshipped all the host of heaven and served them

334 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD whereof the LORD
had said In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever

335 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the LORD

336 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
of the son of Hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments
and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with
wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke him
to anger

337 And he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the
house of God of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son
In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen before all the
tribes of Israel will I put my name for ever 338 Neither will I any
more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have
appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that
I have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and
the ordinances by the hand of Moses

339 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err
and to do worse than the heathen whom the LORD had destroyed before
the children of Israel

3310 And the LORD spake to Manasseh and to his people but they
would not hearken

3311 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
the king of Assyria which took Manasseh among the thorns and bound
him with fetters and carried him to Babylon

3312 And when he was in affliction he besought the LORD his God and
humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers 3313 And
prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his
supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom
Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God

3314 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David on the
west side of Gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish
gate and compassed about Ophel and raised it up a very great height
and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah

3315 And he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house
of the LORD and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the
house of the LORD and in Jerusalem and cast them out of the city

3316 And he repaired the altar of the LORD and sacrificed thereon
peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded Judah to serve the
LORD God of Israel
