CH 10  DESIGNING THE MAN-COMPUTER DIALOGUE
ds RT The man-computer dialogue
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
Interactive computers are being used more and more by non-specialist people
without much previous computer experience
As processing costs continue to decline the overall expense of providing
highly interactive systems
becomes increasingly dominated by terminal and communications equipment
Taken together these two factors highlight the need for easy-to-use
low-bandwidth interactive terminals that make maximum use of the existing
telephone network for remote access
pp
Speech output can provide versatile feedback from a computer at very low
cost in distribution and terminal equipment  It is attractive from several
points of view
Terminals em telephones em are invariably in place already
People without experience of computers are accustomed to their use
and are not intimidated by them
The telephone network is cheap to use and extends all over the world
The touch-tone keypad or a portable tone generator
provides a complementary data input device which will do for many
purposes until the technology of speech recognition becomes better developed
and more widespread
Indeed many applications em especially information retrieval ones em need
a much smaller bandwidth from user to computer than in the reverse direction
and voice output combined with restricted keypad entry provides a good match
to their requirements
pp
There are however severe problems in implementing natural and useful
interactive systems using speech output
The eye can absorb information at a far greater rate than can the ear
You can scan a page of text in a way which has no analogy in auditory terms
Even so it is difficult to design a dialogue which allows you to search
computer output visually at high speed
In practice scanning a new report is often better done at your desk
with a printed copy than at a computer terminal with a viewing program
although this is likely to change in the near future
pp
With speech the problem of organizing output becomes even harder
Most of the information we learn using our ears is presented in a
conversational way either in face-to-face discussions or over the telephone
Verbal but non-conversational presentations as in the
university lecture theatre are known to be a rather inefficient way
of transmitting information
The degree of interaction is extremely high even in a telephone conversation
and communication relies heavily on speech gestures such as hesitations
grunts and pauses on prosodic features such as intonation pitch range
tempo and voice quality and on conversational gambits such as interruption
and long silence
I emphasized in the last two chapters the rudimentary state of knowledge
about how to synthesize
prosodic features and the situation is even worse
for the other paralinguistic phenomena
pp
There is also a very special problem with voice output namely the transient
nature of the speech signal
If you miss an utterance its gone
With a visual display unit at least the last few interactions usually remain
available
Even then it is not uncommon to look up beyond the top of the screen and
wish that more of the history was still visible
This obviously places a premium on a voice response systems
ability to repeat utterances
Moreover the dialogue designer must do his utmost to ensure that the user
is always aware of the current state of the interaction
for there is no opportunity to refresh the memory by glancing at earlier
entries and responses
pp
There are two separate aspects to the man-computer interface in a voice
response system
The first is the relationship between the system and the end user
that is the consumer of the synthesized dialogue
The second is the relationship between the system and the applications
programmer who creates the dialogue
These are treated separately in the next two sections
We will have more to say about the former aspect
for it is ultimately more important to more people
But the applications programmers view is important too for without him
