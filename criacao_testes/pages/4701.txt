There’s a daughter as well Galbart Glover reminded him The one who holds Deepwood Motte and Robett’s wife and child

If she stays at Deepwood Motte that’s all she can hope to hold said Robb What’s true for the brothers is even more true for her She will need to sail home to oust Euron and press her own claim Her son turned to Lord Jason Mallister You have a fleet at Seagard

A fleet Your Grace Half a dozen longships and two war galleys Enough to defend my own shores against raiders but I could not hope to meet the Iron Fleet in battle

Nor would I ask it of you The ironborn will be setting sail toward Pyke I expect Theon told me how his people think Every captain a king on his own deck They will all want a voice in the succession My lord I need two of your longships to sail around the Cape of Eagles and up the Neck to Greywater Watch

Lord Jason hesitated A dozen streams drain the wetwood all shallow silty and uncharted I would not even call them rivers The channels are ever drifting and changing There are endless sandbars deadfalls and tangles of rotting trees And Greywater Watch moves How are my ships to find it

Go upriver flying my banner The crannogmen will find you I want two ships to double the chances of my message reaching Howland Reed Lady Maege shall go on one Galbart on the second He turned to the two he’d named You’ll carry letters for those lords of mine who remain in the north but all the commands within will be false in case you have the misfortune to be taken If that happens you must tell them that you were sailing for the north Back to Bear Island or for the Stony Shore He tapped a finger on the map Moat Cailin is the key Lord Balon knew that which is why he sent his brother Victarion there with the hard heart of the Greyjoy strength

Succession squabbles or no the ironborn are not such fools as to abandon Moat Cailin said Lady Maege

No Robb admitted Victarion will leave the best part of his garrison I’d guess Every man he takes will be one less man we need to fight however And he will take many of his captains count on that The leaders He will need such men to speak for him if he hopes to sit the Seastone Chair

You cannot mean to attack up the causeway Your Grace said Galbart Glover The approaches are too narrow There is no way to deploy No one has ever taken the Moat

From the south said Robb But if we can attack from the north and west simultaneously and take the ironmen in the rear while they are beating off what they think is my main thrust up the causeway then we have a chance Once I link up with Lord Bolton and the Freys I will have more than twelve thousand men I mean to divide them into three battles and start up the causeway a half-day apart If the Greyjoys have eyes south of the Neck they will see my whole strength rushing headlong at Moat Cailin

Roose Bolton will have the rearguard while I command the center Greatjon you shall lead the van against Moat Cailin Your attack must be so fierce that the ironborn have no leisure to wonder if anyone is creeping down on them from the north

The Greatjon chuckled Your creepers best come fast or my men will swarm those walls and win the Moat before you show your face I’ll make a gift of it to you when you come dawdling up

That’s a gift I should be glad to have said Robb

Edmure was frowning You talk of attacking the ironmen in the rear sire but how do you mean to get north of them

There are ways through the Neck that are not on any map Uncle Ways known only to the crannogmen—narrow trails between the bogs and wet roads through the reeds that only boats can follow He turned to his two messengers Tell Howland Reed that he is to send guides to me two days after I have started up the causeway To the center battle where my own standard flies Three hosts will leave the Twins but only two will reach Moat Cailin Mine own battle will melt away into the Neck to reemerge on the Fever If we move swiftly once my uncle’s wed we can all be in position by year’s end We will fall upon the Moat from three sides on the first day of the new century as the ironmen are waking with hammers beating at their heads from the mead they’ll quaff the night before

I like this plan said the Greatjon I like it well

Galbart Glover rubbed his mouth There are risks If the crannogmen should fail you   

We will be no worse than before But they will not fail My father knew the worth of Howland Reed Robb rolled up the map and only then looked at Catelyn Mother

She tensed Do you have some part in this for me

Your part is to stay safe Our journey through the Neck will be dangerous and naught but battle awaits us in the north But Lord Mallister has kindly offered to keep you safe at Seagard until the war is done You will be comfortable there I know

Is this my punishment for opposing him about Jon Snow Or for being a woman and worse a mother It took her a moment to realize that they were all watching her They had known she realized Catelyn should not have been surprised She had won no friends by freeing the Kingslayer and more than once she had heard the Greatjon say that women had no place on a battlefield

Her anger must have blazed across her face because Galbart Glover spoke up before she said a word My lady His Grace is wise It’s best you do not come with us

Seagard will be brightened by your presence Lady Catelyn said Lord Jason Mallister

You would make me a prisoner she said

An honored guest Lord Jason insisted

Catelyn turned to her son I mean no offense to Lord Jason she said stiffly but if I cannot continue on with you I would sooner return to Riverrun

I left my wife at Riverrun I want my mother elsewhere If you keep all your treasures in one purse you only make it easier for those who would rob you After the wedding you shall go to Seagard that is my royal command Robb stood and as quick as that her fate was settled He picked up a sheet of parchment One more matter Lord Balon has left chaos in his wake we hope I would not do the same Yet I have no son as yet my brothers Bran and Rickon are dead and my sister is wed to a Lannister I’ve thought long and hard about who might follow me I command you now as my true and loyal lords to fix your seals to this document as witnesses to my decision

A king indeed Catelyn thought defeated She could only hope that the trap he’d planned for Moat Cailin worked as well as the one in which he’d just caught her





SAMWELL

Whitetree Sam thought Please let this be Whitetree He remembered Whitetree Whitetree was on the maps he’d drawn on their way north If this village was Whitetree he knew where they were Please it has to be He wanted that so badly that he forgot his feet for a little bit he forgot the ache in his calves and his lower back and the stiff frozen fingers he could scarcely feel He even forgot about Lord Mormont and Craster and the wights and the Others Whitetree Sam prayed to any god that might be listening

All wildling villages looked much alike though A huge weirwood grew in the center of this one    but a white tree did not mean Whitetree necessarily Hadn’t the weirwood at Whitetree been bigger than this one Maybe he was remembering it wrong The face carved into the bone pale trunk was long and sad red tears of dried sap leaked from its eyes Was that how it looked when we came north Sam couldn’t recall

Around the tree stood a handful of one-room hovels with sod roofs a longhall built of logs and grown over with moss a stone well a sheepfold    but no sheep nor any people The wildlings had gone to join Mance Rayder in the Frostfangs taking all they owned except their houses Sam was thankful for that Night was coming on and it would be good to sleep beneath a roof for once He was so tired It seemed as though he had been walking half his life His boots were falling to pieces and all the blisters on his feet had burst and turned to callus but now he had new blisters under the callus and his toes were getting frostbitten

But it was either walk or die Sam knew Gilly was still weak from childbirth and carrying the babe besides she needed the horse more than he did The second horse had died on them three days out from Craster’s Keep It was a wonder she lasted that long poor half-starved thing Sam’s weight had probably done for her They might have tried riding double but he was afraid the same thing would happen again It’s better that I walk

Sam left Gilly in the longhall to make a fire while he poked his head into the hovels She was better at making fires he could never seem to get the kindling to catch and the last time he’d tried to strike a spark off flint and steel he managed to cut himself on his knife Gilly bound up the gash for him but his hand was stiff and sore even clumsier than it had been before He knew he should wash the wound and change the binding but he was afraid to look at it Besides it was so cold that he hated taking off his gloves

Sam did not know what he hoped to find in the empty houses Maybe the wildlings had left some food behind He had to take a look Jon had searched the huts at Whitetree on their way north Inside one hovel Sam heard a rustling of rats from a dark corner but otherwise there was nothing in any of them but old straw old smells and some ashes beneath the smoke hole

He turned back to the weirwood and studied the carved face a moment It is not the face we saw he admitted to himself The tree’s not half as big as the one at Whitetree The red eyes wept blood and he didn’t remember that either Clumsily Sam sank to his knees Old gods hear my prayer The Seven were my father’s gods but I said my words to you when I joined the Watch Help us now I fear we might be lost We’re hungry too and so cold I don’t know what gods I believe in now but    please if you’re there help us Gilly has a little son That was all that he could think to say The dusk was deepening the leaves of the weirwood rustling softly waving like a thousand blood-red hands Whether Jon’s gods had heard him or not he could not say

By the time he returned to the longhall Gilly had the fire going She sat close to it with her furs opened the babe at her breast He’s as hungry as we are Sam thought The old women had smuggled out food for them from Craster’s but they had eaten most of it by now Sam had been a hopeless hunter even at Horn Hill where game was plentiful and he had hounds and huntsmen to help him here in this endless empty forest the chances of him catching anything were remote His efforts at fishing the lakes and half-frozen streams had been dismal failures as well

How much longer Sam Gilly asked Is it far still

Not so far Not so far as it was Sam shrugged out of his pack eased himself awkwardly to the floor and tried to cross his legs His back ached so abominably from the walking that he would have liked to lean up against one of the carved wooden pillars that supported the roof but the fire was in the center of the hall beneath the smoke hole and he craved warmth even more than comfort Another few days should see us there

Sam had his maps but if this wasn’t Whitetree then they weren’t going to be much use We went too far east to get around that lake he fretted or maybe too far west when I tried to double back He was coming to hate lakes and rivers Up here there was never a ferry or bridge which meant walking all the way around the lakes and searching for places to ford the rivers It was easier to follow a game trail than to struggle through the brush easier to circle a ridge instead of climbing it If Bannen or Dywen were with us we’d be at Castle Black by now warming our feet in the common room Bannen was dead though and Dywen gone with Grenn and Dolorous Edd and the others

The Wall is three hundred miles long and seven hundred feet high Sam reminded himself If they kept going south they had to find it sooner or later And he was certain that they had been going south By day he took directions from the sun and on clear nights they could follow the Ice Dragon’s tail though they hadn’t traveled much by night since the second horse had died Even when the moon was full it was too dark beneath the trees and it would have been so easy for Sam or the last garron to break a leg We have to be well south by now we have to be

What he wasn’t so certain of was how far east or west they might have strayed They would reach the Wall yes    in a day or a fortnight it couldn’t be farther than that surely surely    but where It was the gate at Castle Black they needed to find the only way through the Wall for a hundred leagues

Is the Wall as big as Craster used to say Gilly asked

Bigger Sam tried to sound cheerful So big you can’t even see the castles hidden behind it But they’re there you’ll see The Wall is all ice but the castles are stone and wood There are tall towers and deep vaults and a huge longhall with a great fire burning in the hearth day and night It’s so hot in there Gilly you’ll hardly believe it

Could I stand by the fire Me and the boy Not for a long time just till we’re good and warm

You can stand by the fire as long as you like You’ll have food and drink too Hot mulled wine and a bowl of venison stewed with onions and Hobb’s bread right out of the oven so hot it will burn your fingers Sam peeled a glove off to wriggle his own fingers near the flames and soon regretted it They had been numb with cold but as feeling returned they hurt so much he almost cried Sometimes one of the brothers will sing he said to take his mind off the pain Dareon sang best but they sent him to Eastwatch There’s still Halder though And Toad His real name is Todder but he looks like a toad so we call him that He likes to sing but he has an awful voice

Do you sing Gilly rearranged her furs and she moved the babe from one breast to the other

Sam blushed I    I know some songs When I was little I liked to sing I danced too but my lord father never liked me to He said if I wanted to prance around I should do it in the yard with a sword in my hand
