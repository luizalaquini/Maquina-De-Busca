3415 And ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name 3416 But
ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and
every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure
to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for
servants and for handmaids

3417 Therefore thus saith the LORD Ye have not hearkened unto me in
proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his
neighbour behold I proclaim a liberty for you saith the LORD to
the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and I will make you
to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth

3418 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant
which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made
before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the
parts thereof 3419 The princes of Judah and the princes of
Jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the
land which passed between the parts of the calf 3420 I will even
give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them
that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the
fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth

3421 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the
hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life
and into the hand of the king of Babylons army which are gone up
from you

3422 Behold I will command saith the LORD and cause them to return
to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn
it with fire and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without
an inhabitant

351 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah saying 352 Go unto the
house of the Rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the
house of the LORD into one of the chambers and give them wine to
drink

353 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habaziniah
and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the
Rechabites 354 And I brought them into the house of the LORD into
the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah a man of God
which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber
of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the keeper of the door 355 And I set
before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and
cups and I said unto them Drink ye wine

356 But they said We will drink no wine for Jonadab the son of
Rechab our father commanded us saying Ye shall drink no wine
neither ye nor your sons for ever 357 Neither shall ye build house
nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye
shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye
be strangers

358 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days
we our wives our sons nor our daughters 359 Nor to build houses
for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed
3510 But we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according
to all that Jonadab our father commanded us

3511 But it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
into the land that we said Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear
of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians
so we dwell at Jerusalem

3512 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah saying 3513 Thus
saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Go and tell the men of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Will ye not receive
instruction to hearken to my words saith the LORD

3514 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his
sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink
none but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding I have
spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto
me

3515 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising
up early and sending them saying Return ye now every man from his
evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve
them and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to
your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto
me

3516 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people
hath not hearkened unto me 3517 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
hosts the God of Israel Behold I will bring upon Judah and upon all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced
against them because I have spoken unto them but they have not
heard and I have called unto them but they have not answered

3518 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites Thus saith
the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Because ye have obeyed the
commandment of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and
done according unto all that he hath commanded you 3519 Therefore
thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Jonadab the son of
