My steward and squire Jon Snow

A bastard is it Craster looked Jon up and down Man wants to bed a woman seems like he ought to take her to wife That’s what I do He shooed Jon off with a wave Well run and do your service bastard and see that axe is good and sharp now I’ve no use for dull steel

Jon Snow bowed stiffly and took his leave Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as he was leaving and they almost collided at the deerhide door Outside the rain seemed to have slackened Tents had gone up all over the compound Jon could see the tops of others under the trees

Dolorous Edd was feeding the horses Give the wildling an axe why not He pointed out Mormont’s weapon a short-hafted battle-axe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black steel blade He’ll give it back I vow Buried in the Old Bear’s skull like as not Why not give him all our axes and our swords as well I mislike the way they clank and rattle as we ride We’d travel faster without them straight to hell’s door Does it rain in hell I wonder Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead

Jon smiled He wants an axe And wine as well

See the Old Bear’s clever If we get the wildling well and truly drunk perhaps he’ll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe I have two ears but only one head

Smallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch

Do you know the difference between a wildling who’s a friend to the Watch and one who’s not asked the dour squire Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves Our friends bury us in secret graves I wonder how long that bear’s been nailed up on that gate and what Craster had there before we came hallooing Edd looked at the axe doubtfully the rain running down his long face Is it dry in there

Drier than out here

If I lurk about after not too close to the fire belike they’ll take no note of me till morn The ones under his roof will be the first he murders but at least we’ll die dry

Jon had to laugh Craster’s one man We’re two hundred I doubt he’ll murder anyone

You cheer me said Edd sounding utterly morose And besides there’s much to be said for a good sharp axe I’d hate to be murdered with a maul I saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once Scarce split the skin at all but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd only purply-red A comely man but he died ugly It’s good that we’re not giving them mauls Edd walked away shaking his head his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him

Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear Wolf He sprinted around the hall toward the cry the earth sucking at his boots One of Craster’s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep Keep away she was shouting at Ghost You keep away The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him Get it away m’lord she pleaded when she saw him

He won’t hurt you He knew at once what had happened a wooden hutch its slats shattered lay on its side in the wet grass He must have been hungry We haven’t seen much game Jon whistled The direwolf bolted down the rabbit crunching the small bones between his teeth and padded over to him

The woman regarded them with nervous eyes She was younger than he’d thought at first A girl of fifteen or sixteen years he judged dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain her bare feet muddy to the ankles The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy Are you one of Craster’s daughters he asked

She put a hand over her belly Wife now Edging away from the wolf she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch I was going to breed them rabbits There’s no sheep left

The Watch will make good for them Jon had no coin of his own or he would have offered it to her… though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the Wall I’ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow

She wiped her hands on her skirt M’lord—

I’m no lord

But others had come crowding round drawn by the woman’s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch Don’t you believe him girl called out Lark the Sisterman a ranger mean as a cur That’s Lord Snow himself

Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings mocked Chett who’d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about

That wolf’s looking at you hungry girl Lark said Might be it fancies that tender bit in your belly

Jon was not amused You’re scaring her

Warning her more like Chett’s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face

We’re not to talk to you the girl remembered suddenly

Wait Jon said too late She bolted ran

Lark made a grab for the second rabbit but Ghost was quicker When he bared his teeth the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt The others laughed The direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to Jon
