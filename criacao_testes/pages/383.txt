Aaron and the Levites wait upon their business 1311 And they burn
unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and
sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure
table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn
every evening for we keep the charge of the LORD our God but ye have
forsaken him

1312 And behold God himself is with us for our captain and his
priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you O children of
Israel fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers for ye
shall not prosper

1313 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so
they were before Judah and the ambushment was behind them

1314 And when Judah looked back behold the battle was before and
behind and they cried unto the LORD and the priests sounded with the
trumpets

1315 Then the men of Judah gave a shout and as the men of Judah
shouted it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel
before Abijah and Judah

1316 And the children of Israel fled before Judah and God delivered
them into their hand

1317 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so
there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men

1318 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time and
the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the LORD God
of their fathers

1319 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him
Bethel with the towns thereof and Jeshanah with the towns thereof
and Ephraim with the towns thereof

1320 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
Abijah and the LORD struck him and he died

1321 But Abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat
twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters

1322 And the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his
sayings are written in the story of the prophet Iddo

141 So Abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city
of David and Asa his son reigned in his stead In his days the land
was quiet ten years

142 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD
his God 143 For he took away the altars of the strange gods and the
high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves 144
And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to do
the law and the commandment

145 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him

146 And he built fenced cities in Judah for the land had rest and
he had no war in those years because the LORD had given him rest

147 Therefore he said unto Judah Let us build these cities and make
about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet
before us because we have sought the LORD our God we have sought
him and he hath given us rest on every side So they built and
prospered

148 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of
Judah three hundred thousand and out of Benjamin that bare shields
and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were
mighty men of valour

149 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host
of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto
Mareshah

1410 Then Asa went out against him and they set the battle in array
in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah

1411 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God and said LORD it is
nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have
no power help us O LORD our God for we rest on thee and in thy
name we go against this multitude O LORD thou art our God let no
man prevail against thee

1412 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah
and the Ethiopians fled

1413 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
Gerar and the Ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover
themselves for they were destroyed before the LORD and before his
host and they carried away very much spoil

1414 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar for the fear of
the LORD came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there
was exceeding much spoil in them

1415 They smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and
camels in abundance and returned to Jerusalem
