And brothers a cheerful voice called out behind her Catelyn glanced over her shoulder as Lord Renly’s palfrey picked her way through the stumps The younger Baratheon was splendid in his green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair The crown of golden roses girded his temples jade stag’s head rising over his forehead long black hair spilling out beneath jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck

Renly had chosen a woman to carry his banner as well though Brienne hid face and form behind plate armor that gave no hint of her sex Atop her twelve-foot lance the crowned stag pranced black-on-gold as the wind off the sea rippled the cloth

His brother’s greeting was curt Lord Renly

King Renly Can that truly be you Stannis

Stannis frowned Who else should it be

Renly gave an easy shrug When I saw that standard I could not be certain Whose banner do you bear

Mine own

The red-clad priestess spoke up The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light

Renly seemed amused by that All for the good If we both use the same banner the battle will be terribly confused

Catelyn said Let us hope there will be no battle We three share a common foe who would destroy us all

Stannis studied her unsmiling The Iron Throne is mine by rights All those who deny that are my foes

The whole of the realm denies it brother said Renly Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers’wombs They deny it in Dorne and they deny it on the Wall No one wants you for their king Sorry

Stannis clenched his jaw his face taut I swore I would never treat with you while you wore your traitor’s crown Would that I had kept to that vow

This is folly Catelyn said sharply Lord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand swords The remnants of the Kingslayer’s army have regrouped at the Golden Tooth another Lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of Casterly Rock and Cersei and her son hold King’s Landing and your precious Iron Throne You each name yourself king yet the kingdom bleeds and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son

Renly shrugged Your son has won a few battles I shall win the war The Lannisters can wait my pleasure

If you have proposals to make make them Stannis said brusquely or I will be gone

Very well said Renly I propose that you dismount bend your knee and swear me your allegiance

Stannis choked back rage That you shall never have

You served Robert why not me

Robert was my elder brother You are the younger

Younger bolder and far more comely…

…and a thief and a usurper besides

Renly shrugged The Targaryens called Robert usurper He seemed to be able to bear the shame So shall I

This will not do Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine I would bang your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers

Stannis frowned at her You presume too much Lady Stark I am the rightful king and your son no less a traitor than my brother here His day will come as well

The naked threat fanned her fury You are very free to name others traitor and usurper my lord yet how are you any different You say you alone are the rightful king yet it seems to me that Robert had two sons By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms Prince Joffrey is his rightful heir and Tornmen after him… and we are all traitors however good our reasons

Renly laughed You must forgive Lady Catelyn Stannis She’s come all the way down from Riverrun a long way ahorse I fear she never saw your little letter

Joffrey is not my brother’s seed Stannis said bluntly Nor is Tommen They are bastards The girl as well All three of them abominations born of incest

Would even Cersei be so mad Catelyn was speechless

Isn’t that a sweet story my lady Renly asked I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received his letter and I must say it took my breath away He smiled at his brother I had never suspected you were so clever Stannis Were it only true you would indeed be Robert’s heir

Were it true Do you name me a liar

Can you prove any word of this fable

Stannis ground his teeth

Robert could never have known Catelyn thought or Cersei would have lost her head in an instant Lord Stannis she asked if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes why did you keep silent 

I did not keep silent Stannis declared I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn

Rather than your own brother

My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful said Stannis From me such accusations would have seemed peevish and self-serving a means of placing myself first in the line of succession I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn whom he loved

Ah said Renly So we have the word of a dead man

Do you think he died by happenstance you purblind fool Cersei had him poisoned for fear he would reveal her Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs—

—which doubtless died with him How inconvenient

Catelyn was remembering fitting pieces together My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell she admitted Later in the Eyrie she laid the murder at the feet of the queen’s brother Tyrion

Stannis snorted If you step in a nest of snakes does it matter which one bites you first

All this of snakes and incest is droll but it changes nothing You may well have the better claim Stannis but I still have the larger army Renly’s hand slid inside his cloak Stannis saw and reached at once for the hilt of his sword but before he could draw steel his brother produced… a peach Would you like one brother Renly asked smiling From Highgarden You’ve never tasted anything so sweet I promise you He took a bite juice ran from the corner of his mouth

I did not come here to eat fruit Stannis was fuming

My lords Catelyn said We ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance not trading taunts

A man should never refuse to taste a peach Renly said as he tossed the stone away He may never get the chance again Life is short Stannis Remember what the Starks say Winter is coming He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand

I did not come here to be threatened either

Nor were you Renly snapped back When I make threats you’ll know it If truth be told I’ve never liked you Stannis but you are my own blood and I have no wish to slay you So if it is Storm’s End you want take it… as a brother’s gift As Robert once gave it to me I give it to you

It is not yours to give It is mine by rights

Sighing Renly half turned in the saddle What am I to do with this brother of mine Brienne He refuses my peach he refuses my castle he even shunned my wedding…
