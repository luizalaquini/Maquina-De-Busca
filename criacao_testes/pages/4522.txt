Tyrion opened her robe and buried his face between her breasts She always smelled clean to him even in this reeking sty of a city Keep him if you like but keep him close I won’t have him wandering the city spreading tales in pot-shops

He won’t— she started

Tyrion covered her mouth with his own He’d had talk enough he needed the sweet simplicity of the pleasure he found between Shae’s thighs Here at least he was welcome wanted

Afterward he eased his arm out from under her head slipped on his tunic and went down to the garden A half-moon silvered the leaves of the fruit trees and shone on the surface of the stone bathing pond Tyrion seated himself beside the water Somewhere off to his right a cricket was chirping a curiously homey sound It is peaceful here he thought but for how long

A whiff of something rank made him turn his head Shae stood in the door behind him dressed in the silvery robe he’d given her I loved a maid as white as winter with moonglow in her hair Behind her stood one of the begging brothers a portly man in filthy patched robes his bare feet crusty with dirt a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a septon would have worn a crystal The smell of him would have gagged a rat

Lord Varys has come to see you Shae announced

The begging brother blinked at her astonished Tyrion laughed To be sure How is it you knew him when I did not

She shrugged It’s still him Only dressed different

A different look a different smell a different way of walking said Tyrion Most men would be deceived

And most women maybe But not whores A whore learns to see the man not his garb or she turns up dead in an alley

Varys looked pained and not because of the false scabs on his feet Tyrion chuckled Shae would you bring us some wine He might need a drink Whatever brought the eunuch here in the dead of night was not like to be good

I almost fear to tell you why I’ve come my lord Varys said when Shae had left them I bring dire tidings

You ought to dress in black feathers Varys you’re as bad an omen as any raven Awkwardly Tyrion pushed to his feet half afraid to ask the next question Is it Jaime If they have harmed him nothing will save them

No my lord A different matter Ser Cortnay Penrose is dead Storm’s End has opened its gates to Stannis Baratheon

Dismay drove all other thoughts from Tyrion’s mind When Shae returned with the wine he took one sip and flung the cup away to explode against the side of the house She raised a hand to shield herself from the shards as the wine ran down the stones in long fingers black in the moonlight Damn him Tyrion said

Varys smiled showing a mouth full of rotted teeth Who my lord Ser Cortnay or Lord Stannis

Both of them Storm’s End was strong it should have been able to hold out for half a year or more    time enough for his father to finish with Robb Stark How did this happen

Varys glanced at Shae My lord must we trouble your sweet lady’s sleep with such grim and bloody talk

A lady might be afraid said Shae but I’m not

You should be Tyrion told her With Storm’s End fallen Stannis will soon turn his attention toward King’s Landing He regretted flinging away that wine now Lord Varys give us a moment and I’ll ride back to the castle with you

I shall wait in the stables He bowed and stomped off

Tyrion drew Shae down beside him You are not safe here

I have my walls and the guards you gave me

Sellswords Tyrion said They like my gold well enough but will they die for it As for these walls a man could stand on another’s shoulders and be over in a heartbeat A manse much like this one was burned during the riots They killed the goldsmith who owned it for the crime of having a full larder just as they tore the High Septon to pieces raped Lollys half a hundred times and smashed Ser Aron’s skull in What do you think they would do if they got their hands on the Hand’s lady

The Hand’s whore you mean She looked at him with those big bold eyes of hers Though I would be your lady m’lord I’d dress in all the beautiful things you gave me in satin and samite and cloth-of-gold and I’d wear your jewels and hold your hand and sit by you at feasts I could give you sons I know I could    and I vow I’d never shame you

My love for you shames me enough A sweet dream Shae Now put it aside I beg you It can never be

Because of the queen I’m not afraid of her either

I am

Then kill her and be done with it It’s not as if there was any love between you

Tyrion sighed She’s my sister The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in the sight of gods and men Moreover whatever you and I may think of Cersei my father and brother hold her dear I can scheme with any man in the Seven Kingdoms but the gods have not equipped me to face Jaime with swords in hand

The Young Wolf and Lord Stannis have swords and they don’t scare you

How little you know sweetling Against them I have all the power of House Lannister Against Jaime or my father I have no more than a twisted back and a pair of stunted legs

You have me Shae kissed him her arms sliding around his neck as she pressed her body to his

The kiss aroused him as her kisses always did but this time Tyrion gently disentangled himself Not now Sweetling I have    well call it the seed of a plan I think I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens

Shae’s face went still The kitchens

Yes If I act through Varys no one will be the wiser

She giggled M’lord I’d poison you Every man who’s tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am

The Red Keep has sufficient cooks Butchers and bakers too You’d need to pose as a scullion

A pot girl she said in scratchy brown roughspun Is that how m’lord wants to see me

M’lord wants to see you alive Tyrion said You can scarcely scour pots in silk and velvet

Has m’lord grown tired of me She reached a hand under his tunic and found his cock In two quick strokes she had it hard He still wants me She laughed Would you like to fuck your kitchen wench m’lord You can dust me with flour and suck gravy off my titties if you   

Stop it The way she was acting reminded him of Dancy who had tried so hard to win her wager He yanked her hand away to keep her from further mischief This is not the time for bed sport Shae Your life may be at stake

Her grin was gone If I’ve displeased m’lord I never meant it only    couldn’t you just give me more guards

Tyrion breathed a deep sigh Remember how young she is he told himself He took her hand Your gems can be replaced and new gowns can be sewn twice as lovely as the old To me you’re the most precious thing within these walls The Red Keep is not safe either but it’s a deal safer than here I want you there

In the kitchens Her voice was flat Scouring pots

For a short while

My father made me his kitchen wench she said her mouth twisting That was why I ran off

You told me you ran off because your father made you his whore he reminded her

That too I didn’t like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me She tossed her head Why can’t you keep me in your tower Half the lords at court keep bedwarmers

I was expressly forbidden to take you to court
