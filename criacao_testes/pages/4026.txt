distance

  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves  `I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much if--if Id only been the right size to do it  Oh
dear  Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again  Let
me see--how IS it to be managed  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what

  The great question certainly was what  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

  `Who are YOU said the Caterpillar

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
replied rather shyly `I--I hardly know sir just at present--
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
I must have been changed several times since then

  `What do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly
`Explain yourself

  `I cant explain MYSELF Im afraid sir said Alice `because
Im not myself you see

  `I dont see said the Caterpillar

  `Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very
politely `for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing

  `It isnt said the Caterpillar

  `Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice `but
when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day you
know--and then after that into a butterfly I should think youll
feel it a little queer wont you

  `Not a bit said the Caterpillar

  `Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice
`all I know is it would feel very queer to ME

  `You said the Caterpillar contemptuously  `Who are YOU

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said
very gravely `I think you ought to tell me who YOU are first

  `Why said the Caterpillar

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away

  `Come back the Caterpillar called after her  `Ive something
important to say

  This sounded promising certainly  Alice turned and came back
again

  `Keep your temper said the Caterpillar

  `Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as
she could

  `No said the Caterpillar

  Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
again and said `So you think youre changed do you

  `Im afraid I am sir said Alice `I cant remember things as
I used--and I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together
