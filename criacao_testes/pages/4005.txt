wouldnt much care except the sight of my body brings back
the memory of the pain And why I was in pain And what
happened just before the pain started And how I watched
my little sister become a human torch
Closing my eyes doesnt help Fire burns brighter in
the darkness
Dr Aurelius shows up sometimes I like him because
he doesnt say stupid things like how Im totally safe or that
he knows I cant see it but Ill be happy again one day or
even that things will be better in Panem now He just asks if
I feel like talking and when I dont answer he falls asleep in
his chair In fact I think his visits are largely motivated by his
need for a nap The arrangement works for both of us
The time draws near although I could not give you
exact hours and minutes President Snow has been tried
and found guilty sentenced to execution Haymitch tells me
I hear talk of it as I drift past the guards in the hallways My
Mockingjay suit arrives in my room Also my bow looking
no worse for wear but no sheath of arrows Either because
they were damaged or more likely because I shouldnt have
weapons I vaguely wonder if I should be preparing for the
event in some way but nothing comes to mind
Late one afternoon after a long period in a cushioned
window seat behind a painted screen I emerge and turn
left instead of right I find myself in a strange part of the
mansion and immediately lose my bearings Unlike the
area where Im quartered there seems to be no one around
to ask I like it though Wish Id found it sooner Its so quiet
with the thick carpets and heavy tapestries soaking up the
sound Softly lit Muted colors Peaceful Until I smell the
roses I dive behind some curtains shaking too hard to run
while I await the mutts Finally I realize there are no mutts
coming So what do I smell Real roses Could it be that I
am near the garden where the evil things grow
As I creep down the hall the odor becomes
overpowering Perhaps not as strong as the actual mutts
but purer because its not competing with sewage and
explosives I turn a corner and find myself staring at two
surprised guards Not Peacekeepers of course There are
no more Peacekeepers But not the trim gray-uniformed
soldiers from 13 either These two a man and a woman
wear the tattered thrown-together clothes of actual rebels
Still bandaged and gaunt they are now keeping watch over
the doorway to the roses When I move to enter their guns
form an X in front of me
You cant go in miss says the man
Soldier the woman corrects him You cant go in
Soldier Everdeen Presidents orders
I just stand there patiently waiting for them to lower
their guns for them to understand without my telling them
that behind those doors is something I need Just a rose A
single bloom To place in Snows lapel before I shoot him
My presence seems to worry the guards Theyre
discussing calling Haymitch when a woman speaks up
behind me Let her go in
I know the voice but cant immediately place it Not
Seam not 13 definitely not Capitol I turn my head and find
myself face-to-face with Paylor the commander from 8
She looks even more beat up than she did at the hospital
but who doesnt
On my authority says Paylor She has a right to
anything behind that door These are her soldiers not
Coins They drop their weapons without question and let
me pass
At the end of a short hallway I push apart the glass
doors and step inside By now the smells so strong that it
begins to flatten out as if theres no more my nose can
absorb The damp mild air feels good on my hot skin And
the roses are glorious Row after row of sumptuous blooms
in lush pink sunset orange and even pale blue I wander
through the aisles of carefully pruned plants looking but not
touching because I have learned the hard way how deadly
these beauties can be I know when I find it crowning the
top of a slender bush A magnificent white bud just
beginning to open I pull my left sleeve over my hand so that
my skin wont actually have to touch it take up a pair of
pruning shears and have just positioned them on the stem
when he speaks
Thats a nice one
My hand jerks the shears snap shut severing the
stem
The colors are lovely of course but nothing says
perfection like white
I still cant see him but his voice seems to rise up from
an adjacent bed of red roses Delicately pinching the stem
of the bud through the fabric of my sleeve I move slowly
around the corner and find him sitting on a stool against the
wall Hes as well groomed and finely dressed as ever but
weighted down with manacles ankle shackles tracking
devices In the bright light his skins a pale sickly green
He holds a white handkerchief spotted with fresh blood
Even in his deteriorated state his snake eyes shine bright
and cold I was hoping youd find your way to my quarters
His quarters I have trespassed into his home the way
he slithered into mine last year hissing threats with his
bloody rosy breath This greenhouse is one of his rooms
perhaps his favorite perhaps in better times he tended the
plants himself But now its part of his prison Thats why the
guards halted me And thats why Paylor let me in
Id supposed he would be secured in the deepest
