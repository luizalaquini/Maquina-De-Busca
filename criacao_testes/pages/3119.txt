41 Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages
that dwell in all the earth Peace be multiplied unto you

42 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God
hath wrought toward me

43 How great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his
kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation
to generation

44 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my
palace 45 I saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon
my bed and the visions of my head troubled me

46 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of
the dream

47 Then came in the magicians the astrologers the Chaldeans and
the soothsayers and I told the dream before them but they did not
make known unto me the interpretation thereof

48 But at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was
Belteshazzar according to the name of my God and in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods and before him I told the dream saying 49
O Belteshazzar master of the magicians because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell
me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation
thereof

410 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed I saw and behold a
tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great

411 The tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached
unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth 412
The leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it
was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the
fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed
of it

413 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a
watcher and an holy one came down from heaven 414 He cried aloud
and said thus Hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off
his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under
it and the fowls from his branches 415 Nevertheless leave the stump
of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the
tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven
and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth 416
Let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given
unto him and let seven times pass over him

417 This matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by
the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that
the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to
whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men

418 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen Now thou O
Belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the
interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is
in thee

419 Then Daniel whose name was Belteshazzar was astonied for one
hour and his thoughts troubled him The king spake and said
Belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof
trouble thee Belteshazzar answered and said My lord the dream be to
them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies

420 The tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose
height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the
earth 421 Whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in
it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and
upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation 422
It is thou O king that art grown and become strong for thy
greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the
end of the earth

423 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
from heaven and saying Hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave
the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron
and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with
the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the
field till seven times pass over him 424 This is the
interpretation O king and this is the decree of the most High which
is come upon my lord the king 425 That they shall drive thee from
men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they
shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the
dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know
that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to
whomsoever he will

426 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots
thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known
that the heavens do rule

427 Wherefore O king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and
break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing
mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity

428 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar
