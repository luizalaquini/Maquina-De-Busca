Yes Ned thought as the door swung shut but whom

On the way back to his chambers he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet Ned stopped and looked at her Arya what are you doing

Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself

Ned had to smile Which toe he teased

Any toe Arya said exasperated with the question She hopped from her right leg to her left swaying dangerously before she regained her balance

Must you do your standing here he asked It’s a long hard fall down these steps

Syrio says a water dancer never falls She lowered her leg to stand on two feet Father will Bran come and live with us now

Not for a long time sweet one he told her He needs to win his strength back

Arya bit her lip What will Bran do when he’s of age

Ned knelt beside her He has years to find that answer Arya For now it is enough to know that he will live The night the bird had come from Winterfell Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river The heart tree there was a great oak its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving as if it had been a weirwood Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose Arya several hours later curling up in the grass under Ned’s cloak All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone When dawn broke over the city the dark red blooms of dragon’s breath surrounded the girls where they lay I dreamed of Bran Sansa had whispered to him I saw him smiling

He was going to be a knight Arya was saying now A knight of the Kingsguard Can he still be a knight

No Ned said He saw no use in lying to her Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon But he will never run beside his wolf again he thought with a sadness too deep for words or lie with a woman or hold his own son in his arms

Arya cocked her head to one side Can I be a king’s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon

You Ned said kissing her lightly on the brow will marry a king and rule his castle and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a High Septon

Arya screwed up her face No she said that’s Sansa She folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing Ned sighed and left her there

Inside his chambers he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed Alyn entered as he was drying his face My lord he said Lord Baelish is without and begs audience

Escort him to my solar Ned said reaching for a fresh tunic the lightest linen he could find I’ll see him at once

Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below If only old Selmy’s mind were as nimble as his blade he said wistfully our council meetings would be a good deal livelier

Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King’s Landing Ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged white-haired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

And as tiresome Littlefinger added though I daresay he should do well in the tourney Last year he unhorsed the Hound and it was only four years ago that he was champion

The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least Is there a reason for this visit Lord Petyr or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window

Littlefinger smiled I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries and so I have

That took Ned aback Promise or no promise he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish who struck him as too clever by half You have something for me

Someone Littlefinger corrected Four someones if truth be told Had you thought to question the Hand’s servants

Ned frowned Would that I could Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie Lysa had done him no favor in that regard All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled Jon’s maester his steward the captain of his guard his knights and retainers

Most of her household Littlefinger said not all A few remain A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly’s grooms a stablehand who joined the City Watch a potboy discharged from service for theft and Lord Arryn’s squire

His squire Ned was pleasantly surprised A man’s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and goings
