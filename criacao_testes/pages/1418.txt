He is a proud man and we’ve wounded him said Catelyn

The Others take his pride I will not be shamed in my own hall My answer is no

Robb gave him a weary look I will not command you Not in this But if you refuse Lord Frey will take it for another slight and any hope of putting this arights will be gone

You cannot know that Edmure insisted Frey has wanted me for one of his daughters since the day I was born He will not let a chance like this slip between those grasping fingers of his When Lothar brings him our answer he’ll come wheedling back and accept a betrothal… and to a daughter of my choosing

Perhaps in time said Brynden Blackfish But can we wait while Lothar rides back and forth with offers and counters

Robb’s hands curled into fists I must get back to the north My brothers dead Winterfell burned my smallfolk put to the sword… the gods only know what this bastard of Bolton’s is about or whether Theon is still alive and on the loose I can’t sit here waiting for a wedding that might or might not happen

It must happen said Catelyn though not gladly I have no more wish to suffer Walder Frey’s insults and complaints than you do Brother but I see little choice here Without this wedding Robb’s cause is lost Edmure we must accept

We must accept he echoed peevishly I don’t see you offering to become the ninth Lady Frey Cat

The eighth Lady Frey is still alive and well so far as I know she replied Thankfully Otherwise it might well have come to that knowing Lord Walder

The Blackfish said I am the last man in the Seven Kingdoms to tell anyone who they must wed Nephew Nonetheless you did say something of making amends for your Battle of the Fords

I had in mind a different sort of amends Single combat with the Kingslayer Seven years of penace as a begging brother Swimming the sunset sea with my legs tied When he saw that no one was smiling Edmure threw up his hands The Others take you all Very well I’ll wed the wench As amends





Davos


Lord Alester looked up sharply Voices he said Do you hear Davos Someone is coming for us

Lamprey said Davos It’s time for our supper or near enough Last night Lamprey had brought them half a beef-and-bacon pie and a flagon of mead as well Just the thought of it made his belly start to rumble

No there’s more than one

He’s right Davos heard two voices at least and footsteps growing louder He got to his feet and moved to the bars

Lord Alester brushed the straw from his clothes The king has sent for me Or the queen yes Selyse would never let me rot here her own blood

Outside the cell Lamprey appeared with a ring of keys in hand Ser Axell Florent and four guardsmen followed close behind him They waited beneath the torch while Lamprey searched for the correct key

Axell Lord Alester said Gods be good Is it the king who sends for me or the queen

No one has sent for you traitor Ser Axell said

Lord Alester recoiled as if he’d been slapped No I swear to you I committed no treason Why won’t you listen If His Grace would only let me explain—

Lamprey thrust a great iron key into the lock turned it and pulled open the cell The rusted hinges screamed in protest You he said to Davos Come

Where Davos looked to Ser Axell Tell me true ser do you mean to burn me

You are sent for Can you walk

I can walk Davos stepped from the cell Lord Alester gave a cry of dismay as Lamprey slammed the door shut once more

Take the torch Ser Axell commanded the gaoler Leave the traitor to the darkness

No his brother said Axell please don’t take the light… gods have mercy…

Gods There is only R’hllor and the Other Ser Axell gestured sharply and one of his guardsmen pulled the torch from its sconce and led the way to the stair

Are you taking me to Melisandre Davos asked

She will be there Ser Axell said She is never far from the king But it is His Grace himself who asked for you

Davos lifted his hand to his chest where once his luck had hung in a leather bag on a thong Gone now he remembered and the ends of four fingers as well But his hands were still long enough to wrap about a woman’s throat he thought especially a slender throat like hers

Up they went climbing the turnpike stair in single file The walls were rough dark stone cool to the touch The light of the torches went before them and their shadows marched beside them on the walls At the third turn they passed an iron gate that opened on blackness and another at the fifth turn Davos guessed that they were near the surface by then perhaps even above it The next door they came to was made of wood but still they climbed Now the walls were broken by arrow slits but no shafts of sunlight pried their way through the thickness of the stone It was night outside

His legs were aching by the time Ser Axell thrust open a heavy door and gestured him through Beyond a high stone bridge arched over emptiness to the massive central tower called the Stone Drum A sea wind blew restlessly through the arches that supported the roof and Davos could smell the salt water as they crossed He took a deep breath filling his lungs with the clean cold air Wind and water give me strength he prayed A huge nightfire burned in the yard below to keep the terrors of the dark at bay and the queen’s men were gathered around it singing praises to their new red god

They were in the center of the bridge when Ser Axell stopped suddenly He made a brusque gesture with his hand and his men moved out of earshot Were it my choice I would burn you with my brother Alester he told Davos You are both traitors

Say what you will I would never betray King Stannis

You would You will I see it in your face And I have seen it in the flames as well R’hllor has blessed me with that gift Like Lady Melisandre he shows me the future in the fire Stannis Baratheon will sit the Iron Throne I have seen it And I know what must be done His Grace must make me his Hand in place of my traitor brother And you will tell him so

Will I Davos said nothing

The queen has urged my appointment Ser Axell went on Even your old friend from Lys the pirate Saan he says the same We have made a plan together him and me Yet His Grace does not act The defeat gnaws inside him a black worm in his soul It is up to us who love him to show him what to do If you are as devoted to his cause as you claim smuggler you will join your voice to ours Tell him that I am the only Hand he needs Tell him and when we sail I shall see that you have a new ship

A ship Davos studied the other man’s face Ser Axell had big Florent ears much like the queen’s Coarse hair grew from them as from his nostrils more sprouted in tufts and patches beneath his double chin His nose was broad his brow beetled his eyes close-set and hostile He would sooner give me a pyre than a ship he said as much but if I do him this favor…

if you think to betray me Ser Axell said pray remember that I have been castellan of Dragonstone a good long time The garrison is mine Perhaps I cannot burn you without the king’s consent but who is to say you might not suffer a fall He laid a meaty hand on the back of Davos’s neck and shoved him bodily against the waist-high side of the bridge then shoved a little harder to force his face out over the yard Do you hear me

I hear said Davos And you dare name me traitor

Ser Axell released him Good He smiled His Grace awaits Best we do not keep him

At the very top of Stone Drum within the great round room called the Chamber of the Painted Table they found Stannis Baratheon standing behind the artifact that gave the hall its name a massive slab of wood carved and painted in the shape of Westeros as it had been in the time of Aegon the Conqueror An iron brazier stood beside the king its coals glowing a ruddy orange Four tall pointed windows looked out to north south east and west Beyond was the night and the starry sky Davos could hear the wind moving and fainter the sounds of the sea

Your Grace Ser Axell said as it please you I have brought the onion knight

So I see Stannis wore a grey wool tunic a dark red mantle and a plain black leather belt from which his sword and dagger hung A red-gold crown with flame-shaped points encircled his brows The look of him was a shock He seemed ten years older than the man that Davos had left at Storm’s End when he set sail for the Blackwater and the battle that would be their undoing The king’s close-cropped beard was spiderwebbed with grey hairs and he had dropped two stone or more of weight He had never been a fleshy man but now the bones moved beneath his skin like spears fighting to cut free Even his crown seemed too large for his head His eyes were blue pits lost in deep hollows and the shape of a skull could be seen beneath his face

Yet when he saw Davos a faint smile brushed his lips So the sea has returned me my knight of the fish and onions

It did Your Grace Does he know that he had me in his dungeon Davos went to one knee

Rise Ser Davos Stannis commanded I have missed you ser I have need of good counsel and you never gave me less So tell me true—what is the penalty for treason
