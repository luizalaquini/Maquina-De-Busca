1214 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he
leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his LORD return unto
him

131 When Ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in Israel but
when he offended in Baal he died

132 And now they sin more and more and have made them molten images
of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all
of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them Let the men that
sacrifice kiss the calves

133 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew
that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out
of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney

134 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt
know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me

135 I did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought

136 According to their pasture so were they filled they were
filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me

137 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way
will I observe them 138 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved
of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will I
devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them

139 O Israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help

1310 I will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all
thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst Give me a king and
princes  1311 I gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in
my wrath

1312 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up his sin is hid

1313 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an
unwise son for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking
forth of children

1314 I will ransom them from the power of the grave I will redeem
them from death O death I will be thy plagues O grave I will be
thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes

1315 Though he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall
come the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness and his
spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall
spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels

1316 Samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her
God they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in
pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up

141 O israel return unto the LORD thy God for thou hast fallen by
thine iniquity

142 Take with you words and turn to the LORD say unto him Take
away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we render the
calves of our lips

143 Asshur shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither
will we say any more to the work of our hands Ye are our gods for in
thee the fatherless findeth mercy

144 I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for mine
anger is turned away from him

145 I will be as the dew unto Israel he shall grow as the lily and
cast forth his roots as Lebanon

146 His branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive
tree and his smell as Lebanon

147 They that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive
as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the
wine of Lebanon

148 Ephraim shall say What have I to do any more with idols I have
heard him and observed him I am like a green fir tree From me is
thy fruit found

149 Who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and
he shall know them for the ways of the LORD are right and the just
shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein

12 Hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land

Hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers  13
Tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their
