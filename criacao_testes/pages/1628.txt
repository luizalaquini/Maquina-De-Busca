Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit


                                               

                                            

                                               

  `Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of
delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her

  `What CAN all that green stuff be said Alice  `And where
HAVE my shoulders got to  And oh my poor hands how is it I
cant see you  She was moving them about as she spoke but no
result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves

  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
like a serpent  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating
her violently with its wings

  `Serpent screamed the Pigeon

  `Im NOT a serpent said Alice indignantly  `Let me alone

  `Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more
subdued tone and added with a kind of sob `Ive tried every
way and nothing seems to suit them

  `I havent the least idea what youre talking about said
Alice

  `Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive
tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her `but
those serpents  Theres no pleasing them

  Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished

  `As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the
Pigeon `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and
day  Why I havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks

  `Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who was
beginning to see its meaning

  `And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood continued
the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek `and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky  Ugh Serpent

  `But Im NOT a serpent I tell you said Alice  `Im a--Im
a--

  `Well  WHAT are you said the Pigeon  `I can see youre
trying to invent something

  `I--Im a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day

  `A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt  `Ive seen a good many little girls in my
time but never ONE with such a neck as that  No no  Youre a
serpent and theres no use denying it  I suppose youll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg

  `I HAVE tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very
truthful child `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do you know

  `I dont believe it said the Pigeon `but if they do why
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say

  This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent
for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding `Youre looking for eggs I know THAT well enough and
what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a
serpent

  `It matters a good deal to ME said Alice hastily `but Im
not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt
want YOURS  I dont like them raw

  `Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it
settled down again into its nest  Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
