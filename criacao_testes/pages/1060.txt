Tyrion took a deep breath How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his Answer me that

You won it from him in a wager during the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day

When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers that was his story no

It was she admitted A line creased her brow

Riders

The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest

For a long second no one moved Catelyn Stark was the first to react Ser Rodrik Ser Willis to horse she shouted Get the other mounts behind us Mohor guard the prisoners—

Arm us Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm You will need every sword

She knew he was right Tyrion could see it The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor as they slaughtered each other They might spare Catelyn herself she was still young enough to bear sons Still she hesitated

I hear them Ser Rodrik called out Tyrion turned his head to listen and there it was hoofbeats a dozen horses or more coming nearer Suddenly everyone was moving reaching for weapons running to their mounts

Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap Twenty men maybe twenty-five he said breathless Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers by my guess They must have eyes out m’lady… hidden watchers… they know we’re here

Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse a longsword in hand Mohor crouched behind a boulder both hands on his iron-tipped spear a dagger between his teeth You singer Ser Willis Wode called out Help me with this breastplate Marillion sat frozen clutching his woodharp his face as pale as milk but Tyrion’s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor

Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark You have no choice he told her Three of us and a fourth man wasted guarding us… four men can be the difference between life and death up here

Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done

My word The hoofbeats were louder now Tyrion grinned crookedly Oh that you have my lady… on my honor as a Lannister

For a moment he thought she would spit at him but instead she snapped Arm them and as quick as that she was pulling away Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard and wheeled to meet the foe Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver and went to one knee beside the road He was a better archer than swordsman And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe

I have never fought with an axe The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands It had a short haft a heavy head a nasty spike on top

Pretend you’re splitting logs Bronn said drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back He spat and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik Ser Willis mounted up to join them fumbling with his helmet a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume

Logs don’t bleed Tyrion said to no one in particular He felt naked without armor He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding Move over

Go away the boy screamed back at him I’m a singer I want no part of this fight

What lost your taste for adventure Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over and not a moment too soon A heartbeat later the riders were on them

There were no heralds no banners no horns nor drums only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor faces hidden behind barred halfhelms In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons longswords and lances and sharpened scythes spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak armed with a two-handed greatsword

Ser Rodrik shouted Winterfell and rode to meet him with Bronn and Chiggen beside him screaming some wordless battle cry Ser Willis Wode followed swinging a spiked morningstar around his head Harrenhal Harrenhal he sang Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up brandish his axe and boom out Casterly Rock but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower

He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal Chiggen’s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind cutting down foes right and left Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak When he opened his mouth to scream only blood came out By the time he fell Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else

Suddenly Marillion shrieked covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them hefting a spiked maul Tyrion swung his axe with both hands The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk angling upward and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way Marillion was less fortunate Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer Tyrion danced back in while the brigand’s leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount and buried the axe in the man’s neck just above the shoulder blades

As he struggled to yank the blade loose he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies Someone help me the singer gasped Gods have mercy I’m bleeding

I believe that’s horse blood Tyrion said The singer’s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead animal scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch Close your eyes and pretend you’re dead he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away

After that things ran together The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood and the world had turned to chaos Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks He saw Bronn unhorsed fighting with a sword in each hand Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses He found a wounded clansman and left him dead helping himself to the man’s halfhelm It fit too snugly but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket’s body The pig face had been smashed in with a mace but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man’s dead fingers He was sliding it through his belt when he heard a woman’s scream

Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her one still mounted and the other two on foot She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides Let them have the bitch Tyrion thought and welcome to her yet somehow he was moving He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he was there and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood Logs that bleed Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him Tyrion ducked under his sword lashed out with the axe the man reeled backward… and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly

Tyrion looked around The enemy were all vanquished or vanished Somehow the fighting had ended when he wasn’t looking Dying horses and wounded men lay all around screaming or moaning To his vast astonishment he was not one of them He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground His hands were sticky with blood He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all

Your first battle Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck’s body pulling off his boots They were good boots as befit one of Lord Tywin’s men heavy leather oiled and supple much finer than what Bronn was wearing

Tyrion nodded My father will be so proud he said His legs were cramping so badly he could scarcely stand Odd he had never once noticed the pain during the battle

You need a woman now Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes He shoved the boots into his saddlebag Nothing like a woman after a man’s been blooded take my word

Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips

Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik’s wounds I’m willing if she is he said The freeriders broke into laughter and Tyrion grinned and thought There’s a start

Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice As he limped back to the others he glanced again at the slain The dead clansmen were thin ragged men their horses scrawny and undersized with every rib showing What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too impressive Mauls clubs a scythe… He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword but when he found his corpse sprawled on the stony ground the man was not so big after all the cloak was gone and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched its cheap steel spotted with rust Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on the ground

They had only three dead two of Lord Bracken’s men-at-arms Kurleket and Mohor and his own man Jyck who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge A fool to the end Tyrion thought

Lady Stark I urge you to press on with all haste Ser Willis Wode said his eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm We drove them off for the moment but they will not have gone far

We must bury our dead Ser Willis she said These were brave men I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats

This soil is too stony for digging Ser Willis said

Then we shall gather stones for cairns

Gather all the stones you want Bronn told her but do it without me or Chiggen I’ve better things to do than pile rocks on dead men… breathing for one He looked over the rest of the survivors Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall ride with us

My lady I fear he speaks the truth Ser Rodrik said wearily The old knight had been wounded in the fight a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck and he sounded his age If we linger here they will be on us again for a certainty and we may not live through a second attack

Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn’s face but she had no choice May the gods forgive us then We will ride at once

There was no shortage of horses now Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck’s spotted gelding who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said I’ll take that dirk now dwarf

Let him keep it Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse And see that he has his axe back as well We may have need of it if we are attacked again

You have my thanks lady Tyrion said mounting up

Save them she said curtly I trust you no more than I did before She was gone before he could frame a reply

Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn He remembered how he had begun the journey with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head and decided that this was a definite improvement Lady Stark could keep her trust so long as he could keep the axe he would count himself ahead in the game

Ser Willis Wode led them out Bronn took the rear with Lady Stark safely in the middle Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode The singer had broken several ribs his woodharp and all four fingers on his playing hand yet the day had not been an utter loss to him somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak thick black fur slashed by stripes of white He huddled beneath its folds silently and for once had nothing to say
