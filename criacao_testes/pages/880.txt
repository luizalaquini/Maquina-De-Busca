537 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and
all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed

538 And now I say unto you Refrain from these men and let them
alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to
nought 539 But if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it lest haply
ye be found even to fight against God

540 And to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles
and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name
of Jesus and let them go

541 And they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name

542 And daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ

61 And in those days when the number of the disciples was
multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the
Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily
ministration

62 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them
and said It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and
serve tables

63 Wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest
report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over
this business

64 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the
ministry of the word

65 And the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose
Stephen a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and
Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas a
proselyte of Antioch 66 Whom they set before the apostles and when
they had prayed they laid their hands on them

67 And the word of God increased and the number of the disciples
multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests
were obedient to the faith

68 And Stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and
miracles among the people

69 Then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the
synagogue of the Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of
them of Cilicia and of Asia disputing with Stephen

610 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake

611 Then they suborned men which said We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses and against God

612 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes
and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
613 And set up false witnesses which said This man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law 614 For
we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
place and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us

615 And all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw
his face as it had been the face of an angel

71 Then said the high priest Are these things so  72 And he said
Men brethren and fathers hearken The God of glory appeared unto
our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in
Charran 73 And said unto him Get thee out of thy country and from
thy kindred and come into the land which I shall shew thee

74 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans and dwelt in
Charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him
into this land wherein ye now dwell

75 And he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set
his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a
possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child

76 And God spake on this wise That his seed should sojourn in a
strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and
entreat them evil four hundred years

77 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge said
God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place

78 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so Abraham begat
Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and Isaac begat Jacob and
Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs

79 And the patriarchs moved with envy sold Joseph into Egypt but
God was with him 710 And delivered him out of all his afflictions
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt
and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house

711 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan
and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance
