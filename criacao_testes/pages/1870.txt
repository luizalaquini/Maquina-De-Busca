it contains a major section on speech communication
with computers as well as ones
on computer buses interfaces and graphics

CH 2  WHAT IS SPEECH
ds RT What is speech
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
People speak by using their vocal cords as a sound source and making rapid
gestures of the articulatory organs tongue lips jaw and so on
The resulting changes in shape of the vocal tract allow production
of the different sounds that we know as the vowels and consonants of
ordinary language
pp
What is it necessary to learn about this process for the purposes of
speech output from computers
That depends crucially upon how speech is represented in the system
If utterances are stored as time waveforms em and this is what we will be
discussing in the next chapter em the structure of speech is not important
If frequency-related parameters of particular natural utterances are
stored then it is advantageous to take into account some of the
acoustic properties of the speech waveform
pp
This point can be brought into focus by contrasting the transmission
or storage of speech with that of real-life television pictures
as has been proposed for a videophone service
Massive data reductions of the order of 501 can be achieved for speech
using techniques that are described in later chapters  For pictures
data reduction is still an important issue em even more so for the
videophone than for the telephone because of the vastly higher
information rates involved
Unfortunately the potential for data reduction is much
smaller em nothing like the 501 figure quoted above
This is because speech sounds have definite characteristics imparted
by the fact that they are produced by a human vocal tract which
can be exploited for data reduction
Television pictures have no equivalent generative structure for
they show just those things that the camera points at
pp
Moving up from frequency-related parameters of
ul
particular
utterances it
is possible to store such parameters in a
ul
general
form which characterizes the sound segments that appear in spoken language
This immediately raises the issue of
ul
classification
of sound segments to form a basis for storing generalized acoustic
information and for retrieval of the information needed to synthesize
any particular utterance
Speech is by nature continuous and any synthesis system based upon
discrete classification must come to terms with this by tackling
the problems of transition from one segment to another
and local modification of sound segments as a function of their context
pp
This brings us to another level of representation
So far we have talked of the
ul
acoustic
nature of speech but when we have to cope with transitions between
discrete sound segments it may be fruitful to consider
ul
articulatory
properties as well
Any model of the speech production process
is in effect a model of the articulatory process that generates the speech
Some speech research is concerned with
modelling
the vocal tract directly rather than modelling the acoustic output from it
One might specify for example position of tongue and posture of jaw and lips
for a vowel instead of giving frequency-related
characteristics of it  This is a potent
tool in linguistic research for it brings one closer to human production of
speech em in particular to the connection between brain and articulators
pp
Articulatory
synthesis holds a promise of high-quality speech for the transitional
