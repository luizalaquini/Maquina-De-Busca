I was born in a house much like this declared Dolorous Edd Those were my enchanted years Later I fell on hard times A nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of the room Edd looked at it with longing I’d give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a bed again

You call that a bed

If it’s softer than the ground and has a roof over it I call it a bed Dolorous Edd sniffed the air I smell dung

The smell was very faint Old dung said Jon The house felt as though it had been empty for some time Kneeling he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath then made a round of the walls It did not take very long There’s nothing here

Nothing was what he had expected Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed and it had been the same in all of them The people were gone vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked They were simply… empty What do you think happened to them all Jon asked

Something worse than we can imagine suggested Dolorous Edd Well I might be able to imagine it but I’d sooner not Bad enough to know you’re going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime

Two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged Other dogs ranged through the village Chett was cursing them loudly his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside The light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils on his face look even more inflamed than usual When he saw Jon his eyes narrowed there was no love lost between them

The other houses had yielded no wisdom Gone cried Mormont’s raven flapping up into the weirwood to perch above them Gone gone gone

There were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago Thoren Smallwood looked more a lord than Mormont did clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker’s gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate His heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable and clasped with the crossed hammers of the Rykkers wrought in silver Ser Jaremy’s cloak once… but the wight had claimed Ser Jaremy and the Night’s Watch wasted nothing

A year ago Robert was king and the realm was at peace declared Jarman Buckwell the square stolid man who commanded the scouts Much can change in a year’s time

One thing hasn’t changed Ser Mallador Locke insisted Fewer wildlings means fewer worries I won’t mourn whatever’s become of them Raiders and murderers the lot of them

Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above Two branches parted and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age The other rangers called him Giant He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said There’s water to the north A lake might be A few flint hills rising to the west not very high Nothing else to see my lords

We might camp here tonight Smallwood suggested

The Old Bear glanced up searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood No he declared Giant how much daylight remains to us

Three hours my lord

We’ll press on north Mormont decided If we reach this lake we can make camp by the shore perchance catch a few fish Jon fetch me paper it’s past time I wrote Maester Aemon

Jon found parchment quill and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the Lord Commander At Whitetree Mormont scrawled The fourth village All empty The wildlings are gone Find Tarly and see that he gets this on its way he said as he handed Jon the message When he whistled his raven came flapping down to land on his horse’s head Corn the raven suggested bobbing The horse whickered

Jon mounted his garron wheeled him about and trotted off Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night’s Watch stood beneath lesser trees tending their horses chewing strips of salt beef pissing scratching and talking When the command was given to move out again the talk died and they climbed back into their saddles Jarman Buckwell’s scouts rode out first with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper Then came the Old Bear with the main force Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and packhorses and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard Two hundred men all told with half again as many mounts

By day they followed game trails and streambeds the ranger’s roads that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root At night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits joking and trading tales but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter No one would admit to being afraid—they were men of the Night’s Watch after all—but Jon could feel the unease Four empty villages no wildlings anywhere even the game seemingly fled The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted even veteran rangers agreed

As he rode Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers Ugly things He remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya’s hair His little stick of a sister He wondered how she was faring It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again He began to flex his hand opening and closing the fingers If he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy it well might be the end of him he knew A man needed his sword beyond the Wall

Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards watering his horses He had three to tend his own mount and two packhorses each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens The birds flapped their wings at Jon’s approach and screamed at him through the bars A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words Have you been teaching them to talk he asked Sam

A few words Three of them can say snow

One bird croaking my name was bad enough said Jon and snow’s nothing a black brother wants to hear about Snow often meant death in the north

Was there anything in Whitetree

Bones ashes and empty houses Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment The Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon

Sam took a bird from one of the cages stroked its feathers attached the message and said Fly home now brave one Home The raven quorked something unintelligible back at him and Sam tossed it into the air Flapping it beat its way skyward through the trees I wish he could carry me with him

Still

Well said Sam yes but… I’m not as frightened as I was truly The first night every time I heard someone getting up to make water I thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat I was afraid that if I closed my eyes I might never open them again only… well… dawn came after all He managed a wan smile I may be craven but I’m not stupid I’m sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground but I’m hardly scared at all Look He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was I’ve been working on my maps

The world is strange Jon thought Two hundred brave men had left the Wall and the only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam the self-confessed coward We’ll make a ranger of you yet he joked Next thing you’ll want to be an outrider like Grenn Shall I speak to the Old Bear

Don’t you dare Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse It was a plow horse big and slow and clumsy but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode I had hoped we might stay the night in the village he said wistfully It would be nice to sleep under a roof again

Too few roofs for all of us Jon mounted again gave Sam a parting smile and rode off The column was well under way so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion He had seen enough of Whitetree

Ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game The woods were as empty as the villages Dywen had told him one night around the fire We’re a large party Jon had said The game’s probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march

Frightened away by something no doubt Dywen said

Once the horse had settled Ghost loped along easily beside him Jon caught up to Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket Is the bird away the Old Bear asked

Yes my lord Sam is teaching them to talk

The Old Bear snorted He’ll regret that Damned things make a lot of noise but they never say a thing worth hearing

They rode in silence until Jon said If my uncle found all these villages empty as well—

—he would have made it his purpose to learn why Lord Mormont finished for him and it may well be someone or something did not want that known Well we’ll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with We will find them Jon I promise you

Or they will find us thought Jon





ARYA

The river was a blue-green ribbon shining in the morning sun Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface ripples spreading out behind it as it went Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles

It seemed a peaceful place… until Koss spotted the dead man There in the reeds He pointed and Arya saw it The body of a soldier shapeless and swollen His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face I told you there was bodies Lommy announced I could taste them in that water

When Yoren saw the corpse he spat Dobber see if he’s got anything worth the taking Mail knife a bit o’ coin what have you He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened Yoren rode back angry his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees We won’t be crossing here Koss you’ll come with me upriver look for a ford Woth Gerren you go downstream The rest o’ you wait here Put a guard out

Dobber found a leather purse in the dead man’s belt Inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie shouting Mud Pie Mud Pie In the back of their wagon Rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while Yoren was gone but no one paid him any mind Kurz caught a fish with his bare hands Arya saw how he did it standing over a shallow pool calm as still water his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near It didn’t look as hard as catching cats Fish didn’t have claws

It was midday when the others returned Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream but someone had burned it up Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale Might be we could swim the horses over maybe the donkeys but there’s no way we’ll get those wagons across And there’s smoke to the north and west more fires could be this side o’ the river’s the place we want to be He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud a line trailing down from it That’s Gods Eye with the river flowing south We’re here He poked a hole beside the line of the river under the circle We can’t go round west of the lake like I thought East takes us back to the kingsroad He moved the stick up to where the line and circle met Near as I recall there’s a town here The holdfast’s stone and there’s a lordling got his seat there too just a towerhouse but he’ll have a guard might be a knight or two We follow the river north should be there before dark They’ll have boats so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one He drew the stick up through the circle of the lake from bottom to top Gods be good we’ll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown He thrust the point down at the top of the circle We can buy new mounts there or else take shelter at Harrenhal That’s Lady Whent’s seat and she’s always been a friend o’ the Watch

Hot Pie’s eyes got wide There’s ghosts in Harrenhal…

Yoren spat There’s for your ghosts He tossed the stick down in the mud Mount up

Arya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal Evil King Harren had walled himself up inside so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre Nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers Sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning all burnt up Arya didn’t really believe that and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago Hot Pie was being silly it wouldn’t be ghosts at Harrenhal it would be knights Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe That was what knights did they kept you safe especially women Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl
