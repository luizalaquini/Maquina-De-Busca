Well done Tyrion said Scum you may be but you’re undeniably useful and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime What do you want Bronn Gold Land Women Keep me alive and you’ll have it

Bronn blew gently on the fire and the flames leapt up higher And if you die

Why then I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere Tyrion said grinning The gold ends when I do

The fire was blazing up nicely Bronn stood tucked the flint back into his pouch and tossed Tyrion his dagger Fair enough he said My sword’s yours then… but don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and m’lord you every time you take a shit I’m no man’s toady

Nor any man’s friend Tyrion said I’ve no doubt you’d betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark if you saw a profit in it If the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out remember this Bronn—I’ll match their price whatever it is I like living And now do you think you could do something about finding us some supper

Take care of the horses Bronn said unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip He strode into the trees

An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed the fire was crackling away merrily and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames spitting and hissing All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid Tyrion said

That a woman and another dozen swords Bronn said He sat cross-legged beside the fire honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel It will be full dark soon the sellsword pointed out I’ll take first watch… for all the good it will do us It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep

Oh I imagine they’ll be here long before it comes to sleep The smell of the roasting meat made Tyrion’s mouth water

Bronn watched him across the fire You have a plan he said flatly with a scrape of steel on stone

A hope call it Tyrion said Another toss of the dice

With our lives as the stake

Tyrion shrugged What choice do we have He leaned over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid Ahhhh he sighed happily as he chewed Grease ran down his chin A bit tougher than I’d like and in want of spicing but I’ll not complain too loudly If I were back at the Eyrie I’d be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean

And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold Bronn said

A Lannister always pays his debts

Even Mord had scarcely believed it when Tyrion tossed him the leather purse The gaoler’s eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold I kept the silver Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile but you were promised the gold and there it is It was more than a man like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners And remember what I said this is only a taste If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn’s service present yourself at Casterly Rock and I’ll pay you the rest of what I owe you With golden dragons spilling out of both hands Mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that

Bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire He began to carve thick chunks of charred meat off the bone as Tyrion hollowed out two heels of stale bread to serve as trenchers If we do reach the river what will you do then the sellsword asked as he cut

Oh a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine for a start Tyrion held out his trencher and Bronn filled it with meat And then to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing I think I have some questions that want answering concerning a certain dagger

The sellsword chewed and swallowed So you were telling it true It was not your knife

Tyrion smiled thinly Do I look a liar to you

By the time their bellies were full the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over the mountains Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow Our friends are taking their sweet time

If I were them I’d fear a trap Bronn said Why else would we be so open if not to lure them in

Tyrion chuckled Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror He began to whistle a tune

You’re mad dwarf Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk

Where’s your love of music Bronn

If it was music you wanted you should have gotten the singer to champion you

Tyrion grinned That would have been amusing I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp He resumed his whistling Do you know this song he asked

You hear it here and there in inns and whorehouses

Myrish ‘The Seasons of My Love’ Sweet and sad if you understand the words The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it and I’ve never been able to put it out of my head Tyrion gazed up at the sky It was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth I met her on a night like this he heard himself saying Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels shouting threats My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them while I dismounted to protect the girl She was scarcely a year older than I was dark-haired slender with a face that would break your heart It certainly broke mine Lowborn half-starved unwashed… yet lovely They’d torn the rags she was wearing half off her back so I wrapped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods By the time he came trotting back I’d gotten a name out of her and a story She was a crofter’s child orphaned when her father died of fever on her way to… well nowhere really

Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men It was not often outlaws dared prey on travelers so near to Casterly Rock and he took it as an insult The girl was too frightened to send off by herself though so I offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her while my brother rode back to the Rock for help

She was hungrier than I would have believed We finished two whole chickens and part of a third and drank a flagon of wine talking I was only thirteen and the wine went to my head I fear The next thing I knew I was sharing her bed If she was shy I was shyer I’ll never know where I found the courage When I broke her maidenhead she wept but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song and by morning I was in love

You Bronn’s voice was amused

Absurd isn’t it Tyrion began to whistle the song again I married her he finally admitted

A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter’s daughter Bronn said How did you manage that

Oh you’d be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies fifty pieces of silver and a drunken septon I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock so I set her up in a cottage of her own and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father Tyrion was surprised at how desolate it made him feel to say it even after all these years Perhaps he was just tired That was the end of my marriage He sat up and stared at the dying fire blinking at the light

He sent the girl away

He did better than that Tyrion said First he made my brother tell me the truth The girl was a whore you see Jaime arranged the whole affair the road the outlaws all of it He thought it was time I had a woman He paid double for a maiden knowing it would be my first time

After Jaime had made his confession to drive home the lesson Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards They paid her fair enough A silver for each man how many whores command that high a price He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor she… The smoke was stinging his eyes Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire to gaze out into darkness Lord Tywin had me go last he said in a quiet voice And he gave me a gold coin to pay her because I was a Lannister and worth more

After a time he heard the noise again the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened his sword Thirteen or thirty or three I would have killed the man who did that to me

Tyrion swung around to face him You may get that chance one day Remember what I told you A Lannister always pays his debts He yawned I think I will try and sleep Wake me if we’re about to die

He rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes The ground was stony and cold but after a time Tyrion Lannister did sleep He dreamt of the sky cell This time he was the gaoler not the prisoner big with a strap in his hand and he was hitting his father driving him back toward the abyss…

Tyrion Bronn’s warning was low and urgent

Tyrion was awake in the blink of an eye The fire had burned down to embers and the shadows were creeping in all around them Bronn had raised himself to one knee his sword in one hand and his dirk in the other Tyrion held up a hand stay still it said Come share our fire the night is cold he called out to the creeping shadows I fear we’ve no wine to offer you but you’re welcome to some of our goat

All movement stopped Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal Our mountain a voice called out from the trees deep and hard and unfriendly Our goat

Your goat Tyrion agreed Who are you

When you meet your gods a different voice replied say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them A branch cracked underfoot as he stepped into the light a thin man in a horned helmet armed with a long knife

And Shagga son of Dolf That was the first voice deep and deadly A boulder shifted to their left and stood and became a man Massive and slow and strong he seemed dressed all in skins with a club in his right hand and an axe in his left He smashed them together as he lumbered closer

Other voices called other names Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion forgot the instant he heard them ten at least A few had swords and knives others brandished pitchforks and scythes and wooden spears He waited until they were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer I am Tyrion son of Tywin of the Clan Lannister the Lions of the Rock We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate

What do you have to give us Tyrion son of Tywin asked the one who named himself Gunthor who seemed to be their chief

There is silver in my purse Tyrion told them This hauberk I wear is large for me but it should fit Conn nicely and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga’s mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds
