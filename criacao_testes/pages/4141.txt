They heard the sound of wheels yet once more and
were re-animated to expectancy  it was only Mr Bold+
wood coming home again
His house stood recessed from the road and the
stables which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a
room were behind their lower portions being lost
amid bushes of laurel Inside the blue door open
half-way down were to be seen at this time the backs
and tails of half-a-dozen warm and contented horses
standing in their stalls and as thus viewed they pre+
sented alternations of roan and bay in shapes like a
Moorish arch the tail being a streak down the midst
of each Over these and lost to the eye gazing in
from the outer light the mouths of the same animals
could be heard busily sustaining the above-named
warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay
The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered
about a loose-box at the end whilst the steady grind
of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the
rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot
Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was
Farmer Boldwood himself This place was his almonry
and cloister in one  here after looking to the feeding
of his four-footed dependants the celibate would walk
and meditate of an evening till the moons rays streamed
in through the cobwebbed windows or total darkness
enveloped the scene
P 171
His square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully
now than in the crowd and bustle of the market-house
In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel
and toe simultaneously and his fine reddish-fleshed face
was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent
and broad chin A few clear and thread-like horizontal
lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth
surface of his large forehead
The phases of Boldwoods life were ordinary enough
but his was not an ordinary nature That stillness
which struck casual observers more than anything else
in his character and habit and seemed so precisely
like the rest of inanition may have been the perfect
balance of enormous antagonistic forces -- positives and
negatives in fine adjustment His equilibrium disturbed
he was in extremity at once If an emotion possessed
him at all it ruled him a feeling not mastering him
was entirely latent Stagnant or rapid it was never
slow He was always hit mortally or he was missed
He had no light and careless touches in his constitu+
tion either for good or for evil Stern in the outlines of
action mild in the details he was serious throughout all
He saw no absurd sides to the follies of life and thus
though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry
men and scoffers and those to whom all things show
life as a jest he was not intolerable to the earnest and
those acquainted with grief Being a man -who read
all the dramas of life seriously if he failed to please
when they were comedies there was no frivolous treat+
ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end
tragically
Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and
silent shape upon which she had so carelessly thrown a
seed was a hotbed of tropic intensity Had she known
Boldwoods moods her blame would have been fearful
and the stain upon her heart ineradicable Moreover
had she known her present power for good or evil over
this man she would have trembled at her responsibility
Luckily for her present unluckily for her future tran+
quillity her understanding had not yet told her what
Boldwood was Nobody knew entirely  for though it
was possible to form guesses concerning his wild capa+

bilities from old floodmarks faintly visible he had never
been seen at the high tides which caused them
Farmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked
forth across the level fields Beyond the first enclosure
was a hedge and on the other side of this a meadow
belonging to Bathshebas farm
It was now early spring -- the time of going to grass
with the sheep when they have the first feed of the
meadows before these are laid up for mowing The
wind which had been blowing east for several weeks
had veered to the southward and the middle of spring
had come abruptly -- almost without a beginning It
was that period in the vernal quarter when we map
suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season The
vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps
to rise till in the completest silence of lone gardens
and trackless plantations where- everything seems -help+
less and still after the bond and slavery of frost there
are bustlings strainings united thrusts and pulls-all+
together in comparison with which the powerful tugs of
cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but  pigmy efforts
Boldwood looking into the distant meadows saw
there three figures They were those of Miss Everdene
Shepherd Oak and Cainy Ball
When Bathshebas figure shone upon the farmers
eyes it lighted him up as the moon lights up a great
tower A mans body is as the shell or the tablet of
his soul as he is reserved or ingenuous overflowing or
