Direwolves loose in the realm after so many years muttered Hullen the master of horse I like it not

It is a sign Jory said

Father frowned This is only a dead animal Jory he said Yet he seemed troubled Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body Do we know what killed her

There’s something in the throat Robb told him proud to have found the answer before his father even asked There just under the jaw

His father knelt and groped under the beast’s head with his hand He gave a yank and held it up for all to see A foot of shattered antler tines snapped off all wet with blood

A sudden silence descended over the party The men looked at the antler uneasily and no one dared to speak Even Bran could sense their fear though he did not understand

His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow I’m surprised she lived long enough to whelp he said His voice broke the spell

Maybe she didn’t Jory said I’ve heard tales… maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came

Born with the dead another man put in Worse luck

No matter said Hullen They be dead soon enough too

Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay

The sooner the better Theon Greyjoy agreed He drew his sword Give the beast here Bran

The little thing squirmed against him as if it heard and understood No Bran cried out fiercely It’s mine

Put away your sword Greyjoy Robb said For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father like the lord he would someday be We will keep these pups

You cannot do that boy said Harwin who was Hullen’s son

It be a mercy to kill them Hullen said

Bran looked to his lord father for rescue but got only a frown a furrowed brow Hullen speaks truly son Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation

No He could feel tears welling in his eyes and he looked away He did not want to cry in front of his father

Robb resisted stubbornly Ser Rodrik’s red bitch whelped again last week he said It was a small litter only two live pups She’ll have milk enough

She’ll rip them apart when they try to nurse

Lord Stark Jon said It was strange to hear him call Father that so formal Bran looked at him with desperate hope There are five pups he told Father Three male two female

What of it Jon

You have five trueborn children Jon said Three sons two daughters The direwolf is the sigil of your House Your children were meant to have these pups my lord

Bran saw his father’s face change saw the other men exchange glances He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment Even at seven Bran understood what his brother had done The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself He had included the girls included even Rickon the baby but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own

Their father understood as well You want no pup for yourself Jon he asked softly

The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark Jon pointed out I am no Stark Father

Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully Robb rushed into the silence he left I will nurse him myself Father he promised I will soak a towel with warm milk and give him suck from that

Me too Bran echoed

The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes Easy to say and harder to do I will not have you wasting the servants’ time with this If you want these pups you will feed them yourselves Is that understood

Bran nodded eagerly The pup squirmed in his grasp licked at his face with a warm tongue

You must train them as well their father said You must train them The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters I promise you that And the gods help you if you neglect them or brutalize them or train them badly These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick A direwolf will rip a man’s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat Are you sure you want this

Yes Father Bran said

Yes Robb agreed

The pups may die anyway despite all you do

They won’t die Robb said We won’t let them die

Keep them then Jory Desmond gather up the other pups It’s time we were back to Winterfell

It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory By then his pup was snuggled inside his leathers warm against him safe for the long ride home Bran was wondering what to name him

Halfway across the bridge Jon pulled up suddenly

What is it Jon their lord father asked

Can’t you hear it

Bran could hear the wind in the trees the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks the whimpering of his hungry pup but Jon was listening to something else

There Jon said He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow watched him kneel A moment later he was riding back to them smiling

He must have crawled away from the others Jon said

Or been driven away their father said looking at the sixth pup His fur was white where the rest of the litter was grey His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind

An albino Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement This one will die even faster than the others

Jon Snow gave his father’s ward a long chilling look I think not Greyjoy he said This one belongs to me
