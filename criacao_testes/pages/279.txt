Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie the maester urged Dragonstone is a grim home for a child Let her fool go with her so she will have a familiar face about her

Familiar and hideous Stannis furrowed his brow in thought Still… perhaps it is worth the trying…

Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers a woman’s voice asked sharply

Maester Cressen turned sand bowed his head My lady he said chagrined that he had not heard her enter

Lord Stannis scowled I do not beg Of anyone Mind you remember that woman

I am pleased to hear it my lord Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband thin of body and thin of face with prominent ears a sharp nose and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly yet it never failed to return Her eyes were pale her mouth stern her voice a whip She cracked it now Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance as do the Starks your brother Renly and all the rest You are their one true king It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god

God she said not gods The red woman had won her heart and soul turning her from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms both old and new to worship the one they called the Lord of Light

Your god can keep his grace said Lord Stannis who did not share his wife’s fervent new faith It’s swords I need not blessings Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you’ve not told me of There was no affection in his tone Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women even his own wife When he had gone to King’s Landing to sit on Robert’s council he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter His letters had been few his visits fewer he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year but took no joy in it and the sons he had once hoped for had never come

My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies she told him House Florent will rally to your banner

House Florent can field two thousand swords at best It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I do my lady The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell’s wrath

There is another way Lady Selyse moved closer Look out your windows my lord There is the sign you have waited for blazoned on the sky Red it is the red of flame red for the fiery heart of the true god it is his banner—and yours See how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragon’s hot breath and you the Lord of Dragonstone It means your time has come Your Grace Nothing is more certain You are meant to sail from this desolate rock as Aegon the Conqueror once sailed to sweep all before you as he did Only say the word and embrace the power of the Lord of Light

How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand Stannis demanded again

All you need his wife promised The swords of Storm’s End and Highgarden for a start and all their lords bannermen

Davos would tell you different Stannis said Those swords are sworn to Renly They love my charming young brother as they once loved Robert… and as they have never loved me

Yes she answered but if Renly should die…

Stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes until Cressen could not hold his tongue It is not to be thought Your Grace whatever follies Renly has committed—

Follies I call them treasons Stannis turned back to his wife My brother is young and strong and he has a vast host around him and these rainbow knights of his

Melisandre has gazed into the flames and seen him dead

Cressen was horrorstruck Fratricide… my lord this is evil unthinkable… please listen to me

Lady Selyse gave him a measured look And what will you tell him Maester How he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn

I have heard your counsel Cressen Lord Stannis said Now I will hear hers You are dismissed

Maester Cressen bent a stiff knee He could feel Lady Selyse’s eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly across the room By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect Help me he said to Pylos

When he was safe back in his own rooms Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his balcony once more to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea One of Salladhor Saan’s warships was sweeping past the castle her gaily striped hull slicing through the grey-green waters as her oars rose and fell He watched until she vanished behind a headland Would that my fears could vanish so easily Had he lived so long for this

When a maester donned his collar he put aside the hope of children yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless Robert Stannis Renly… three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other He could not allow it would not allow it

The woman was the heart of it Not the Lady Selyse the other one The red woman the servants had named her afraid to speak her name I will speak her name Cressen told his stone hellhound Melisandre Her Melisandre of Asshai sorceress shadowbinder and priestess to R’hllor the Lord of Light the Heart of Fire the God of Flame and Shadow Melisandre whose madness must not be allowed to spread beyond Dragonstone

His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning With fumbling hands the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair where his ointments potions and medicines stood neatly on their shelves On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass no larger than his little finger It rattled when he shook it Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table Collapsing into his chair he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial’s contents A dozen crystals no larger than seeds rattled across the parchment he’d been reading They shone like jewels in the candlelight so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before

The chain around his throat felt very heavy He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea half a world away The leaves had to be aged and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles Afterward they could be discarded but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize The process was slow and difficult the necessaries costly and hard to acquire The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it though and the Faceless Men of Braavos… and the maesters of his order as well though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the Citadel All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of healing—but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill
