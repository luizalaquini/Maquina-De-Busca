has been received by eleven to-night they say theres
no chance at all
I do so hope his life will be spared said Liddy
If it is not shell go out of her mind too Poor thing
her sufferings have been dreadful she deserves any+
bodys pity
Is she altered much   said Coggan
If you havent seen poor mistress since Christmas
you wouldnt know her said Liddy  Her eyes are so
miserable that shes not the same woman Only two
years ago she was a romping girl and now shes this
Laban departed as directed and at eleven oclock
that night 
P 449
several of the villagers strolled along the
road to Casterbridge and awaited his arrivai-among
them Oak and nearly all the rest of Bathshebas men
Gabriels anxiety was great that Boldwood might be
saved even though in his conscience he felt that he
ought to die for there had been qualities in the farmer
which Oak loved At last when they all were weary
the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance --
First dead as if on turf it trode
Then clattering  on the village road
In other pace than forth he yode
We shall soon know now one way or other said
Coggan and they all stepped down from the bank on
which they had been standing into the road and the
rider pranced into the midst of them
Is that you Laban   said Gabriel
Yes -- tis come Hes not to die Tis confine+
ment during her Majestys pleasure
Hurrah said Coggan with a swelling heart Gods
above the devil yet

BEAUTY IN LONELINESS -- AFTER ALL
BATHSHEBA revived with the spring The utter
prostration that had followed the low fever from which
she had sufered diminished perceptibly when all un+
certainty upon every subject had come to an end
But she remained alone now for the greater part of
her time and stayed in the house or at furthest went
into the garden She shunned every one even Liddy
and could be brought to make no confidences and to
ask for no sympathy
As the summer drew on she passed more of her time
in the open air and began to examine into farming
matters from sheer necessity though she never rode
out or personally superintended as at former times
One Friday evening in August she walked a little way
along the road and entered the village for the first time
since the sombre event of the preceding Christmas
None of the old colour had as yet come to her cheek
and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black
of her gown till it appeared preternatural When she
reached a little shop at the other end of the place
which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard Bath+
sheba heard singing inside the church and she knew
that the singers were practising She crossed the road
opened the gate and entered the graveyard the high
sills of the church windows effectually screening her
from the eyes of those gathered within Her stealthy
walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at
planting flowers upon Fanny Robins grave and she
came to the marble tombstone
A motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she
read the complete inscription First came the words of
Troy himself --
P 451
ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY
IN BELOVEO MEMORY OF
FANNY ROBIN
WHO DIED OCTOBER 9 18 -- 
AGED 20 YEARS
Unerneath this was now inscribed in new letters --
IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE
THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID
FRANCIS TROY
WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH 18 -- 
Whilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of
the organ began again in the church and she went
with the same light step round to the porch and listened
The door was closed and the coir was learning a new
hymn Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which
latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within
her The little attenuated voices of the children
brought to her ear in destinct utterance the words they
sang without thought or comprehension --
Lead kindly Light amid the encircling gloom
Lead Thou me on
Bathshebas feeling was always to some extent de+
pendent upon her whim as is the case with many other
women Something big came into her throat and an
uprising to her eyes -- and she thought that she would
allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished They
did flow and plenteously and one fell upon the stone
bench beside her Once that she had begun to cry for
she hardly knew what she could not leave off for crowd+
ing thoughts she knew too well She would have given
