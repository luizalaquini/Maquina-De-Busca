He would have had a child with him said the singer A skinny girl about ten Or perhaps a boy the same age

I don’t think so said Merrett Not that I knew

No Ah that’s a pity Well up you go

No Merrett squealed loudly No don’t I gave you your answer you said you’d let me go

Seems to me that what I said was I’d tell them to let you go The singer looked at yellow cloak Lem let him go

Go bugger yourself the big outlaw replied brusquely

The singer gave Merrett a helpless shrug and began to play The Day They Hanged Black Robin

Please The last of Merrett’s courage was running down his leg I’ve done you no harm I brought the gold the way you said I answered your question I have children

That Young Wolf never will said the one-eyed outlaw

Merrett could hardly think for the pounding in his head He shamed us the whole realm was laughing we had to cleanse the stain on our honor His father had said all that and more

Maybe so What do a bunch o’ bloody peasants know about a lord’s honor Yellow cloak wrapped the end of the rope around his hand three times We know some about murder though

Not murder His voice was shrill It was vengeance we had a right to our vengeance It was war Aegon we called him Jinglebell a poor lackwit never hurt anyone Lady Stark cut his throat We lost half a hundred men in the camps Ser Garse Goodbrook Kyra’s husband and Ser Tytos Jared’s son… someone smashed his head in with an axe… Stark’s direwolf killed four of our wolfhounds and tore the kennelmaster’s arm off his shoulder even after we’d filled him full of quarrels…

So you sewed his head on Robb Stark’s neck after both o’ them were dead said yellow cloak

My father did that All I did was drink You wouldn’t kill a man for drinking Merrett remembered something then something that might be the saving of him They say Lord Beric always gives a man a trial that he won’t kill a man unless something’s proved against him You can’t prove anything against me The Red Wedding was my father’s work and Ryman’s and Lord Bolton’s Lothar rigged the tents to collapse and put the crossbowmen in the gallery with the musicians Bastard Walder led the attack on the camps… they’re the ones you want not me I only drank some wine… you have no witness

As it happens you’re wrong there The singer turned to the hooded woman Milady

The outlaws parted as she came forward saying no word When she lowered her hood something tightened inside Merrett’s chest and for a moment he could not breathe No No I saw her die She was dead for a day and night before they stripped her naked and threw her body in the river Raymund opened her throat from ear to ear She was dead

Her cloak and collar hid the gash his brother’s blade had made but her face was even worse than he remembered The flesh had gone pudding soft in the water and turned the color of curdled milk Half her hair was gone and the rest had turned as white and brittle as a crone’s Beneath her ravaged scalp her face was shredded skin and black blood where she had raked herself with her nails But her eyes were the most terrible thing Her eyes saw him and they hated

She don’t speak said the big man in the yellow cloak You bloody bastards cut her throat too deep for that But she remembers He turned to the dead woman and said What do you say m’lady Was he part of it

Lady Catelyn’s eyes never left him She nodded

Merrett Frey opened his mouth to plead but the noose choked off his words His feet left the ground the rope cutting deep into the soft flesh beneath his chin Up into the air he jerked kicking and twisting up and up and up
