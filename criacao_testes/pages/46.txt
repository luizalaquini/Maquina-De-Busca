498 Judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall
be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down
before thee

499 Judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up
he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall
rouse him up  4910 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a
lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall
the gathering of the people be

4911 Binding his foal unto the vine and his asss colt unto the
choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the
blood of grapes 4912 His eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth
white with milk

4913 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for
an haven of ships and his border shall be unto Zidon

4914 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
4915 And he saw that rest was good and the land that it was
pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto
tribute

4916 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel

4917 Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that
biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward

4918 I have waited for thy salvation O LORD

4919 Gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the
last

4920 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal
dainties

4921 Naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words

4922 Joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well
whose branches run over the wall 4923 The archers have sorely
grieved him and shot at him and hated him 4924 But his bow abode
in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands
of the mighty God of Jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of
Israel 4925 Even by the God of thy father who shall help thee and
by the Almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above
blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and
of the womb 4926 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above
the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
everlasting hills they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the
crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren

4927 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour
the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil

4928 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is it that
their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to
his blessing he blessed them

4929 And he charged them and said unto them I am to be gathered
unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the
field of Ephron the Hittite 4930 In the cave that is in the field of
Machpelah which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham
bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
buryingplace

4931 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried
Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried Leah

4932 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
from the children of Heth

4933 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he
gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was
gathered unto his people

501 And Joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and
kissed him

502 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father and the physicians embalmed Israel

503 And forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the
days of those which are embalmed and the Egyptians mourned for him
threescore and ten days

504 And when the days of his mourning were past Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh saying If now I have found grace in your eyes
speak I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying 505 My father made
me swear saying Lo I die in my grave which I have digged for me in
the land of Canaan there shalt thou bury me Now therefore let me go
up I pray thee and bury my father and I will come again

506 And Pharaoh said Go up and bury thy father according as he
made thee swear

507 And Joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all
the servants of Pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders
of the land of Egypt 508 And all the house of Joseph and his
brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their
