I saw a shadow I thought it was Renly’s shadow at the first but it was his brother’s

Lord Stannis

I felt him It makes no sense I know   

It made sense enough for Brienne I will kill him the tall homely girl declared With my lord’s own sword I will kill him I swear it I swear it I swear it

Hal Mollen and the rest of her escort were waiting with the horses Ser Wendel Manderly was all in a lather to know what was happening My lady the camp has gone mad he blurted when he saw them Lord Renly is he— He stopped suddenly staring at Brienne and the blood that drenched her

Dead but not by our hands

The battle— Hal Mollen began

There will be no battle Catelyn mounted and her escort formed up about her with Ser Wendel to her left and Ser Perwyn Frey on her right Brienne we brought mounts enough for twice our number Choose one and come with us

I have my own horse my lady And my armor—

Leave them We must be well away before they think to look for us We were both with the king when he was killed That will not be forgotten Wordless Brienne turned and did as she was bid Ride Catelyn commanded her escort when they were all ahorse If any man tries to stop us cut him down

As the long fingers of dawn fanned across the fields color was returning to the world Where grey men had sat grey horses armed with shadow spears the points of ten thousand lances now glinted silverly cold and on the myriad flapping banners Catelyn saw the blush of red and pink and orange the richness of blues and browns the blaze of gold and yellow All the power of Storm’s End and Highgarden the power that had been Renly’s an hour ago They belong to Stannis now she realized even if they do not know it themselves yet Where else are they to turn if not to the last Baratheon Stannis has won all with a single evil stroke

I am the rightful king he had declared his jaw clenched hard as iron and your son no less a traitor than my brother here His day will come as well

A chill went through her





JON

The hill jutted above the dense tangle of forest rising solitary and sudden its windswept heights visible from miles off The wildlings called it the Fist of the First Men rangers said It did look like a fist Jon Snow thought punching up through earth and wood its bare brown slopes knuckled with stone

He rode to the top with Lord Mormont and the officers leaving Ghost below under the trees The direwolf had run off three times as they climbed twice returning reluctantly to Jon’s whistle The third time the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped Let him go boy I want to reach the crest before dusk Find the wolf later

The way up was steep and stony the summit crowned by a chest-high wall of tumbled rocks They had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit the horses This is good ground Thoren the Old Bear proclaimed when at last they attained the top We could scarce hope for better We’ll make our camp here to await Halfhand The Lord Commander swung down off his saddle dislodging the raven from his shoulder Complaining loudly the bird took to the air

The views atop the hill were bracing yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon’s eye the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen their beards of green moss It was said that the Fist had been a ringfort of the First Men in the Dawn Age An old place and strong Thoren Smallwood said

Old Mormont’s raven screamed as it flapped in noisy circles about their heads Old old old

Quiet Mormont growled up at the bird The Old Bear was too proud to admit to weakness but Jon was not deceived The strain of keeping up with younger men was taking its toll

These heights will be easy to defend if need be Thoren pointed out as he walked his horse along the ring of stones his sable-trimmed cloak stirring in the wind

Yes this place will do The Old Bear lifted a hand to the wind and raven landed on his forearm claws scrabbling against his black ringmail

What about water my lord Jon wondered

We crossed a brook at the foot of the hill

A long climb for a drink Jon pointed out and outside the ring of stones

Thoren said Are you too lazy to climb a hill boy

When Lord Mormont said We’re not like to find another place as strong We’ll carry water and make certain we are well supplied Jon knew better than to argue So the command was given and the brothers of the Night’s Watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made Black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines and saw them fed and watered Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night A score of builders set to clearing brush digging latrines and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes I will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark the Old Bear had commanded

Once he’d put up the Lord Commander’s tent and seen to their horses Jon Snow descended the hill in search of Ghost The direwolf came at once all in silence One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees whistling and shouting alone in the green pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet the next the great white direwolf was walking beside him pale as morning mist

But when they reached the ringfort Ghost balked again He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones and then retreated as if he did not like what he’d smelled Jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring no easy task the wolf weighed as much as he did and was stronger by far Ghost what’s wrong with you It was not like him to be so unsettled In the end Jon had to give it up As you will he told the wolf Go hunt The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones

They ought to be safe here The hill offered commanding views and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east Yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees Jon’s sense of foreboding grew This is the haunted forest he told himself Maybe there are ghosts here the spirits of the First Men This was their place once

Stop acting the boy he told himself Clambering atop the piled rocks Jon gazed off toward the setting sun He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south Upriver the land was more rugged the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow Even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable

Closer at hand it was the trees that ruled To south and east the wood went on as far as Jon could see a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn When the wind blew he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was A thousand leaves fluttered and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea storm-tossed and heaving eternal and unknowable

Ghost was not like to be alone down there he thought Anything could be moving under that sea creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood concealed beneath those trees Anything How would they ever know He stood there for a long time until the sun vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest

Jon Samwell Tarly called up I thought it looked like you Are you well

Well enough Jon hopped down How did you fare today

Well I fared well Truly

Jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find his courage The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and the men from the Shadow Tower

It seems a strong place said Sam A ringfort of the First Men Do you think there were battles fought here

No doubt You’d best get a bird ready Mormont will want to send back word

I wish I could send them all They hate being caged

You would too if you could fly

If I could fly I’d be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie said Sam

Jon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand They walked back through the camp together Cookfires were being lit all around them Overhead the stars were coming out The long red tail of Mormont’s Torch burned as bright as the moon Jon heard the ravens before he saw them Some were calling his name The birds were not shy when it came to making noise

They feel it too I’d best see to the Old Bear he said He gets noisy when he isn’t fed as well

He found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers There you are the old man said gruffly Bring us some hot wine if you would The night is chilly

Yes my lord Jon built a cookfire claimed a small cask of Mormont’s favorite robust red from stores and poured it into a kettle He hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine So much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey not a drop more Raisins and nuts and dried berries but no lemon that was the rankest sort of southron heresy—which was queer since he always took lemon in his morning beer The drink must be hot to warm a man properly the Lord Commander insisted but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle

As he worked he could hear the voices from inside the tent Jarman Buckwell said The easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source Yet if we go that path Rayder will know of our approach certain as sunrise

The Giant’s Stair might serve said Ser Mallador Locke or the Skirling Pass if it’s clear
