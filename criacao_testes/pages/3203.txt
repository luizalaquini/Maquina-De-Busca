626 And the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and
for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her

627 And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his
head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison 628
And brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the
damsel gave it to her mother

629 And when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his
corpse and laid it in a tomb

630 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and
told him all things both what they had done and what they had
taught

631 And he said unto them Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and
they had no leisure so much as to eat

632 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately

633 And the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran
afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together
unto him

634 And Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with
compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a
shepherd and he began to teach them many things

635 And when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him
and said This is a desert place and now the time is far passed 636
Send them away that they may go into the country round about and
into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to
eat

637 He answered and said unto them Give ye them to eat And they say
unto him Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and
give them to eat  638 He saith unto them How many loaves have ye
go and see And when they knew they say Five and two fishes

639 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
green grass

640 And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties

641 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he
looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them
to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he
among them all

642 And they did all eat and were filled

643 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the
fishes

644 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men

645 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
ship and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida while he sent
away the people

646 And when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to
pray

647 And when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and
he alone on the land

648 And he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them
walking upon the sea and would have passed by them

649 But when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had
been a spirit and cried out 650 For they all saw him and were
troubled And immediately he talked with them and saith unto them Be
of good cheer it is I be not afraid

651 And he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and
they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered

652 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their
heart was hardened

653 And when they had passed over they came into the land of
Gennesaret and drew to the shore

654 And when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew
him 655 And ran through that whole region round about and began to
carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was

656 And whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or
country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they
might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as
touched him were made whole

71 Then came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the
scribes which came from Jerusalem

72 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled
that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault
