He did not understand What do you mean

If we are taken you must yield

Yield He blinked in disbelief The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows They killed them except for…They only spare oathbreakers Those who join them like Mance Rayder

And you

No He shook his head Never I won’t

You will I command it of you

Command it But…

Our honor means no more than our lives so long as the realm is safe Are you a man of the Night’s Watch

Yes but—

There is no but Jon Snow You are or you are not

Jon sat up straight I am

Then hear me If we are taken you will go over to them as the wildling girl you captured once urged you They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons that you swear them an oath on your father’s grave that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander You must not balk whatever is asked of you Do as they bid you… but in your heart remember who and what you are Ride with them eat with them fight with them for as long as it takes And watch

For what Jon asked

Would that I knew said Qhorin Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater What did they seek in such a bleak and distant place Did they find it That is what you must learn before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers That is the duty I lay on you Jon Snow

I’ll do as you say Jon said reluctantly but… you will tell them won’t you The Old Bear at least You’ll tell him that I never broke my oath

Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire his eyes lost in pools of shadow When I see him next I swear it He gestured at the fire More wood I want it bright and hot

Jon went to cut more branches snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames The tree had been dead a long time but it seemed to live again in the fire as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow red and orange

Enough Qhorin said abruptly Now we ride

Ride It was dark beyond the fire and the night was cold Ride where

Back Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time The fire will draw them past I hope Come brother

Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire The sun was long gone and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them He did not know what Qhorin had in mind but perhaps it was a chance He hoped so I do not want to play the oathbreaker even for good reason

They went cautiously moving as silent as man and horse could move retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains Jon remembered the place They had watered the horses here before the sun went down

The water’s icing up Qhorin observed as he turned aside else we’d ride in the streambed But if we break the ice they are like to see Keep close to the cliffs There’s a crook a half mile on that will hide us He rode into the defile Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire and followed

The farther in they went the closer the cliffs pressed to either side They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source Icicles bearded its stony banks but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust

A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up where a section of the cliff face had fallen but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through Beyond the walls pinched in sharply and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall The air was full of mist like the breath of some vast cold beast The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight Jon looked about in dismay There is no way out He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs but not with the horses He did not think they would last long afoot

Quickly now the Halfhand commanded The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones right into the curtain of water and vanished When he did not reappear Jon put his heels into his horse and went after His garron did his best to shy away The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon’s breath

Then he was through drenched and shivering but through
