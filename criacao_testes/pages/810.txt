Arya turned on Tom and Lem If you hadn’t caught me I would have been there I would have been home

Lord Beric paid no heed to her outburst My lady he said with weary courtesy would you know your grandfather’s brother by sight Ser Brynden Tully called the Blackfish Would he know you perchance

Arya shook her head miserably She had heard her mother speak of Ser Brynden Blackfish but if she had ever met him herself it had been when she was too little to remember

Small chance the Blackfish will pay good coin for a girl he doesn’t know said Tom Those Tullys are a sour suspicious lot he’s like to think we’re selling him false goods

We’ll convince him Lem Lemoncloak insisted She will or Harwin Riverrun is closest I say we take her there get the gold and be bloody well done with her

And if the lions catch us inside the castle said Tom They’d like nothing better than to hang his lordship in a cage from the top of Casterly Rock

I do not mean to be taken said Lord Beric A final word hung unspoken in the air Alive They all heard it even Arya though it never passed his lips Still we dare not go blindly here I want to know where the armies are the wolves and lions both Sharna will know something and Lord Vance’s maester will know more Acorn Hall’s not far Lady Smallwood will shelter us for a time while we send scouts ahead to learn…

His words beat at her ears like the pounding of a drum and suddenly it was more than Arya could stand She wanted Riverrun not Acorn Hall she wanted her mother and her brother Robb not Lady Smallwood or some uncle she never knew Whirling she broke for the door and when Harwin tried to grab her arm she spun away from him quick as a snake

Outside the stables the rain was still falling and distant lightning flashed in the west Arya ran as fast as she could She did not know where she was going only that she wanted to be alone away from all the voices away from their hollow words and broken promises All I wanted was to go to Riverrun It was her own fault for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal She would have been better alone If she had been alone the outlaws would never have caught her and she’d be with Robb and her mother by now They were never my pack If they had been they wouldn’t leave me She splashed through a puddle of muddy water Someone was shouting her name Harwin probably or Gendry but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills half a heartbeat behind the lightning The lightning lord she thought angrily Maybe he couldn’t die but he could lie

Somewhere off to her left a horse whinnied Arya couldn’t have gone more than fifty yards from the stables yet already she was soaked to the bone She ducked around the corner of one of the tumbledown houses hoping the mossy walls would keep the rain off and almost bowled right into one of the sentries A mailed hand closed hard around her arm

You’re hurting me she said twisting in his grasp Let go I was going to go back I…

Back Sandor Clegane’s laughter was iron scraping over stone Bugger that wolf girl You’re mine He needed only one hand to yank her off her feet and drag her kicking toward his waiting horse The cold rain lashed them both and washed away her shouts and all that Arya could think of was the question he had asked her Do you know what dogs do to wolves





Jaime


Though his fever lingered stubbornly the stump was healing clean and Qyburn said his arm was no longer in danger Jaime was anxious to be gone to put Harrenhal the Bloody Mummers and Brienne of Tarth all behind him A real woman waited for him in the Red Keep

I am sending Qyburn with you to look after you on the way to King’s Landing Roose Bolton said on the morn of their departure He has a fond hope that your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain in gratitude

We all have fond hopes If he grows me back a hand my father will make him Grand Maester

Steelshanks Walton commanded Jaime’s escort blunt brusque brutal at heart a simple soldier Jaime had served with his sort all his life Men like Walton would kill at their lord’s command rape when their blood was up after battle and plunder wherever they could but once the war was done they would go back to their homes trade their spears for hoes wed their neighbors’ daughters and raise a pack of squalling children Such men obeyed without question but the deep malignant cruelty of the Brave Companions was not a part of their nature

Both parties left Harrenhal the same morning beneath a cold grey sky that promised rain Ser Aenys Frey had marched three days before striking northeast for the kingsroad Bolton meant to follow him The Trident is in flood he told Jaime Even at the ruby ford the crossing will be difficult You will give my warm regards to your father

So long as you give mine to Robb Stark

That I shall

Some Brave Companions had gathered in the yard to watch them leave Jaime trotted over to where they stood Zollo How kind of you to see me off Pyg Timeon Will you miss me No last jest to share Shagwell To lighten my way down the road And Rorge did you come to kiss me goodbye

Bugger off cripple said Rorge

If you insist Rest assured though I will be back A Lannister always pays his debts Jaime wheeled his horse around and rejoined Steelshanks Walton and his two hundred

Lord Bolton had accoutred him as a knight preferring to ignore the missing hand that made such warlike garb a travesty Jaime rode with sword and dagger on his belt shield and helm hung from his saddle chainmail under a dark brown surcoat He was not such a fool as to show the lion of Lannister on his arms though nor the plain white blazon that was his right as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard He found an old shield in the armory battered and splintered the chipped paint still showing most of the great black bat of House Lothston upon a field of silver and gold The Lothstons held Harrenhal before the Whents and had been a powerful family in their day but they had died out ages ago so no one was likely to object to him bearing their arms He would be no one’s cousin no one’s enemy no one’s sworn sword… in sum no one

They left through Harrenhal’s smaller eastern gate and took their leave of Roose Bolton and his host six miles farther on turning south to follow along the lake road for a time Walton meant to avoid the kingsroad as long as he could preferring the farmer’s tracks and game trails near the Gods Eye
