CATELYN

Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest She seldom had to light a fire The castle had been built over natural hot springs and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body driving the chill from the stone halls filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth keeping the earth from freezing Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards That was a little thing in summer in winter it was the difference between life and death

Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming and her walls warm to the touch The warmth reminded her of Riverrun of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure but Ned could never abide the heat The Starks were made for the cold he would tell her and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place

So when they had finished Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed as he had a thousand times before He crossed the room pulled back the heavy tapestries and threw open the high narrow windows one by one letting the night air into the chamber

The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark naked and empty-handed Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun fifteen long years gone Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking It was a good ache She could feel his seed within her She prayed that it might quicken there It had been three years since Rickon She was not too old She could give him another son

I will refuse him Ned said as he turned back to her His eyes were haunted his voice thick with doubt

Catelyn sat up in the bed You cannot You must not

My duties are here in the north I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand

He will not understand that He is a king now and kings are not like other men If you refuse to serve him he will wonder why and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him Can’t you see the danger that would put us in

Ned shook his head refusing to believe Robert would never harm me or any of mine We were closer than brothers He loves me If I refuse him he will roar and curse and bluster and in a week we will laugh about it together I know the man

You knew the man she said The king is a stranger to you Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow the broken antler lodged deep in her throat She had to make him see Pride is everything to a king my lord Robert came all this way to see you to bring you these great honors you cannot throw them back in his face

Honors Ned laughed bitterly

In his eyes yes she said

And in yours

And in mine she blazed angry now Why couldn’t he see He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter what else would you call that Sansa might someday be queen Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne What is so wrong with that

Gods Catelyn Sansa is only eleven Ned said And Joffrey… Joffrey is…

She finished for him …crown prince and heir to the Iron Throne And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon

That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth Brandon Yes Brandon would know what to do He always did It was all meant for Brandon You Winterfell everything He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens I never asked for this cup to pass to me

Perhaps not Catelyn said but Brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not

Ned turned away from her back to the night He stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall

Catelyn softened then to see his pain Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son

She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected Ned turned frowning What is it

Desmond’s voice came through the door My lord Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience

You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed

Yes my lord He insists

Very well Send him in
