I’m to wait here until it’s done

Then stay out of the way Or better yet make yourself of use Run to the buttery his goatship will be wanting butter and cheese Wake up Pia and tell her she’d best be nimble for once if she wants to keep both of her feet

She ran as fast as she could Pia was awake in the loft moaning under one of the Mummers but she slipped back into her clothes quick enough when she heard Arya shout She filled six baskets with crocks of butter and big wedges of stinky cheese wrapped in cloth Here help me with these she told Arya

I can’t But you better hurry or Vargo Hoat will chop off your foot She darted off before Pia could grab her On the way back she wondered why none of the captives had their hands or feet chopped off Maybe Vargo Hoat was afraid to make Robb angry Though he didn’t seem the sort to be afraid of anyone

Hot Pie was stirring the kettles with a long wooden spoon when Arya returned to the kitchens She grabbed up a second spoon and started to help For a moment she thought maybe she should tell him but then she remembered the village and decided not to He’d only yield again

Then she heard the ugly sound of Rorge’s voice Cook he shouted We’ll take your bloody broth Arya let go of the spoon in dismay I never told him to bring them Rorge wore his iron helmet with the nasal that half hid his missing nose Jaqen and Biter followed him into the kitchen

The bloody broth isn’t bloody ready yet the cook said It needs to simmer We only now put in the onions and—

Shut your hole or I’ll shove a spit up your ass and we’ll baste you for a turn or two I said broth and I said now

Hissing Biter grabbed a handful of half-charred rabbit right off the spit and tore into it with his pointed teeth while honey dripped between his fingers

The cook was beaten Take your bloody broth then but if the goat asks why it tastes so thin you tell him

Biter licked the grease and honey off his fingers as Jaqen Hghar donned a pair of heavy padded mitts He gave a second pair to Arya A weasel will help The broth was boiling hot and the kettles were heavy Arya and Jaqen wrestled one between them Rorge carried one by himself and Biter grabbed two more hissing in pain when the handles burned his hands Even so he did not drop them They lugged the kettles out of the kitchens and across the ward Two guards had been posted at the door of the Widow’s Tower What’s this one said to Rorge

A pot of boiling piss want some

Jaqen smiled disarmingly A prisoner must eat too

No one said nothing about—

Arya cut him off It’s for them not you

The second guard waved them past Bring it down then

Inside the door a winding stair led down to the dungeons Rorge led the way with Jaqen and Arya bringing up the rear A girl will stay out of the way he told her

The steps opened onto a dank stone vault long gloomy and windowless A few torches burned in sconces at the near end where a group of Ser Amory’s guards sat around a scarred wooden table talking and playing at tiles Heavy iron bars separated them from where the captives were crowded together in the dark The smell of the broth brought many up to the bars

Arya counted eight guards They smelled the broth as well There’s the ugliest serving wench I ever saw their captain said to Rorge What’s in the kettle

Your cock and balls You want to eat or not

One of the guards had been pacing one standing near the bars a third sitting on the floor with his back to the wall but the prospect of food drew all of them to the table

About bloody time they fed us

That onions I smell

So where’s the bread

Fuck we need bowls cups spoons—

No you don’t Rorge heaved the scalding hot broth across the table full in their faces Jaqen H’ghar did the same Biter threw his kettles too swinging them underarm so they spun across the dungeon raining soup One caught the captain in the temple as he tried to rise He went down like a sack of sand and lay still The rest were screaming in agony praying or trying to crawl off

Arya pressed back against the wall as Rorge began to cut throats Biter preferred to grab the men behind the head and under the chin and crack their necks with a single twist of his huge pale hands Only one of the guards managed to get a blade out Jaqen danced away from his slash drew his own sword drove the man back into a corner with a flurry of blows and killed him with a thrust to the heart The Lorathi brought the blade to Arya still red with heart’s blood and wiped it clean on the front of her shift A girl should be bloody too This is her work
