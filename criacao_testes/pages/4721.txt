It wasn’t the sentinels he knew The sentinels never left the Wall But there might be other ghosts in the Nightfort ones even more terrible He remembered what Old Nan had said of Mad Axe how he took his boots off and prowled the castle halls barefoot in the dark with never a sound to tell you where he was except for the drops of blood that fell from his axe and his elbows and the end of his wet red beard Or maybe it wasn’t Mad Axe at all maybe it was the thing that came in the night The ’prentice boys all saw it Old Nan said but afterward when they told their Lord Commander every description had been different And three died within the year and the fourth went mad and a hundred years later when the thing had come again the ’prentice boys were seen shambling along behind it all in chains

That was only a story though He was just scaring himself There was no thing that comes in the night Maester Luwin had said so If there had ever been such a thing it was gone from the world now like giants and dragons It’s nothing Bran thought

But the sounds were louder now

It’s coming from the well he realized That made him even more afraid Something was coming up from under the ground coming up out of the dark Hodor woke it up He woke it up with that stupid piece of slate and now it’s coming It was hard to hear over Hodor’s snores and the thumping of his own heart Was that the sound blood made dripping from an axe Or was it the faint far-off rattling of ghostly chains Bran listened harder Footsteps It was definitely footsteps each one a little louder than the one before He couldn’t tell how many though The well made the sounds echo He didn’t hear any dripping or chains either but there was something else    a high thin whimpering sound like someone in pain and heavy muffled breathing But the footsteps were loudest The footsteps were coming closer

Bran was too frightened to shout The fire had burned down to a few faint embers and his friends were all asleep He almost slipped his skin and reached out for his wolf but Summer might be miles away He couldn’t leave his friends helpless in the dark to face whatever was coming up out of the well I told them not to come here he thought miserably I told them there were ghosts I told them that we should go to Castle Black

The footfalls sounded heavy to Bran slow ponderous scraping against the stone It must be huge Mad Axe had been a big man in Old Nan’s story and the thing that came in the night had been monstrous Back in Winterfell Sansa had told him that the demons of the dark couldn’t touch him if he hid beneath his blanket He almost did that now before he remembered that he was a prince and almost a man grown

Bran wriggled across the floor dragging his dead legs behind him until he could reach out and touch Meera on the foot She woke at once He had never known anyone to wake as quick as Meera Reed or to be so alert so fast Bran pressed a finger to his mouth so she’d know not to speak She heard the sound at once he could see that on her face the echoing footfalls the faint whimpering the heavy breathing

Meera rose to her feet without a word and reclaimed her weapons With her three-pronged frog spear in her right hand and the folds of her net dangling from her left she slipped barefoot toward the well Jojen dozed on oblivious while Hodor muttered and thrashed in restless sleep She kept to the shadows as she moved stepped around the shaft of moonlight as quiet as a cat Bran was watching her all the while and even he could barely see the faint sheen of her spear I can’t let her fight the thing alone he thought Summer was far away but   

   he slipped his skin and reached for Hodor

It was not like sliding into Summer That was so easy now that Bran hardly thought about it This was harder like trying to pull a left boot on your right foot It fit all wrong and the boot was scared too the boot didn’t know what was happening the boot was pushing the foot away He tasted vomit in the back of Hodor’s throat and that was almost enough to make him flee Instead he squirmed and shoved sat up gathered his legs under him—his huge strong legs—and rose I’m standing He took a step I’m walking It was such a strange feeling that he almost fell He could see himself on the cold stone floor a little broken thing but he wasn’t broken now He grabbed Hodor’s longsword The breathing was as loud as a blacksmith’s bellows

From the well came a wail a piercing creech that went through him like a knife A huge black shape heaved itself up into the darkness and lurched toward the moonlight and the fear rose up in Bran so thick that before he could even think of drawing Hodor’s sword the way he’d meant to he found himself back on the floor again with Hodor roaring Hodor hodor HODOR the way he had in the lake tower whenever the lightning flashed But the thing that came in the night was screaming too and thrashing wildly in the folds of Meera’s net Bran saw her spear dart out of the darkness to snap at it and the thing staggered and fell struggling with the net The wailing was still coming from the well even louder now On the floor the black thing flopped and fought screeching No no don’t please DON’T   

Meera stood over him the moonlight shining silver off the prongs of her frog spear Who are you she demanded

I’m SAM the black thing sobbed Sam Sam I’m Sam let me out you stabbed me    He rolled through the puddle of moonlight flailing and flopping in the tangles of Meera’s net Hodor was still shouting Hodor hodor hodor

It was Jojen who fed the sticks to the fire and blew on them until the flames leapt up crackling Then there was light and Bran saw the pale thin-faced girl by the lip of the well all bundled up in furs and skins beneath an enormous black cloak trying to shush the screaming baby in her arms The thing on the floor was pushing an arm through the net to reach his knife but the loops wouldn’t let him He wasn’t any monster beast or even Mad Axe drenched in gore only a big fat man dressed up in black wool black fur black leather and black mail He’s a black brother said Bran Meera he’s from the Night’s Watch

Hodor Hodor squatted down on his haunches to peer at the man in the net Hodor he said again hooting

The Night’s Watch yes The fat man was still breathing like a bellows I’m a brother of the Watch He had one cord under his chins forcing his head up and others digging deep into his cheeks I’m a crow please Let me out of this

Bran was suddenly uncertain Are you the three-eyed crow He can’t be the three-eyed crow

I don’t think so The fat man rolled his eyes but there were only two of them I’m only Sam Samwell Tarly Let me out it’s hurting me He began to struggle again

Meera made a disgusted sound Stop flopping around If you tear my net I’ll throw you back down the well Just lie still and I’ll untangle you

Who are you Jojen asked the girl with the baby

Gilly she said For the gillyflower He’s Sam We never meant to scare you She rocked her baby and murmured at it and finally it stopped crying

Meera was untangling the fat brother Jojen went to the well and peered down Where did you come from

From Craster’s the girl said Are you the one

Jojen turned to look at her The one

He said that Sam wasn’t the one she explained There was someone else he said The one he was sent to find

Who said Bran demanded

Coldhands Gilly answered softly

Meera peeled back one end of her net and the fat man managed to sit up He was shaking Bran saw and still struggling to catch his breath He said there would be people he huffed People in the castle I didn’t know you’d be right at the top of the steps though I didn’t know you’d throw a net on me or stab me in the stomach He touched his belly with a black-gloved hand Am I bleeding I can’t see

It was just a poke to get you off your feet said Meera Here let me have a look She went to one knee and felt around his navel You’re wearing mail I never got near your skin

Well it hurt all the same Sam complained

Are you really a brother of the Night’s Watch Bran asked

The fat man’s chins jiggled when he nodded His skin looked pale and saggy Only a steward I took care of Lord Mormont’s ravens For a moment he looked like he was going to cry I lost them at the Fist though It was my fault I got us lost too I couldn’t even find the Wall It’s a hundred leagues long and seven hundred feet high and I couldn’t find it

Well you’ve found it now said Meera Lift your rump off the ground I want my net back

How did you get through the Wall Jojen demanded as Sam struggled to his feet Does the well lead to an underground river is that where you came from You’re not even wet   

There’s a gate said fat Sam A hidden gate as old as the Wall itself The Black Gate he called it

The Reeds exchanged a look We’ll find this gate at the bottom of the well asked Jojen

Sam shook his head You won’t I have to take you

Why Meera demanded If there’s a gate   

You won’t find it If you did it wouldn’t open Not for you It’s the Black Gate Sam plucked at the faded black wool of his sleeve Only a man of the Night’s Watch can open it he said A Sworn Brother who has said his words

He said Jojen frowned This    Coldhands

That wasn’t his true name said Gilly rocking We only called him that Sam and me His hands were cold as ice but he saved us from the dead men him and his ravens and he brought us here on his elk

His elk said Bran wonderstruck

His elk said Meera startled

His ravens said Jojen

Hodor said Hodor

Was he green Bran wanted to know Did he have antlers

The fat man was confused The elk

Coldhands said Bran impatiently The green men ride on elks Old Nan used to say Sometimes they have antlers too

He wasn’t a green man He wore blacks like a brother of the Watch but he was pale as a wight with hands so cold that at first I was afraid The wights have blue eyes though and they don’t have tongues or they’ve forgotten how to use them The fat man turned to Jojen He’ll be waiting We should go Do you have anything warmer to wear The Black Gate is cold and the other side of the Wall is even colder You—

Why didn’t he come with you Meera gestured toward Gilly and her babe They came with you why not him Why didn’t you bring him through this Black Gate too
