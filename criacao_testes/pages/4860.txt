saying What is this that thou shalt say unto him By strength of
hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt from the house of bondage
1315 And it came to pass when Pharaoh would hardly let us go that
the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both the
firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore I sacrifice to
the LORD all that openeth the matrix being males but all the
firstborn of my children I redeem

1316 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets
between thine eyes for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth
out of Egypt

1317 And it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that
God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines
although that was near for God said Lest peradventure the people
repent when they see war and they return to Egypt 1318 But God led
the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea
and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt

1319 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straitly
sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and
ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you

1320 And they took their journey from Succoth and encamped in Etham
in the edge of the wilderness

1321 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to
lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them
light to go by day and night 1322 He took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the
people

141 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 142 Speak unto the
children of Israel that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth
between Migdol and the sea over against Baalzephon before it shall
ye encamp by the sea

143 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel They are
entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in

144 And I will harden Pharaohs heart that he shall follow after
them and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh and upon all his host that
the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD And they did so

145 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the
heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people
and they said Why have we done this that we have let Israel go from
serving us  146 And he made ready his chariot and took his people
with him 147 And he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the
chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them

148 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he
pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went
out with an high hand

149 But the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots
of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them
encamping by the sea beside Pihahiroth before Baalzephon

1410 And when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up
their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they
were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD

1411 And they said unto Moses Because there were no graves in Egypt
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt  1412 Is not this
the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying Let us alone that we
may serve the Egyptians For it had been better for us to serve the
Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness

1413 And Moses said unto the people Fear ye not stand still and
see the salvation of the LORD which he will shew to you to day for
the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no
more for ever

1414 The LORD shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace

1415 And the LORD said unto Moses Wherefore criest thou unto me
speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward 1416 But
lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and
divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through
the midst of the sea

1417 And I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and
they shall follow them and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh and
upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen

1418 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD when I have
gotten me honour upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his
horsemen

1419 And the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel
removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from
before their face and stood behind them 1420 And it came between
the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud
and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the
one came not near the other all the night

1421 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the LORD
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and
