A tumult of sound drowned his last words a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed them from all sides Bastard someone screamed at Joffrey bastard monster Other voices flung calls of Whore and Brotherfucker at the queen while Tyrion was pelted with shouts of Freak and Halfman Mixed in with the abuse he heard a few cries of Justice and Robb King Robb the Young Wolf of Stannis and even Renly From both sides of the street the crowd surged against the spear shafts while the gold cloaks struggled to hold the line Stones and dung and fouler things whistled overhead Feed us a woman shrieked Bread boomed a man behind her We want bread bastard In a heartbeat a thousand voices took up the chant King Joffrey and King Robb and King Stannis were forgotten and King Bread ruled alone Bread they clamored Bread bread

Tyrion spurred to his sister’s side yelling Back to the castle Now Cersei gave a curt nod and Ser Lancel unsheathed his sword Ahead of the column Jacelyn Bywater was roaring commands His riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge The king was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks grasping for him One managed to get hold of his leg but only for an instant Ser Mandon’s sword slashed down parting hand from wrist Ride Tyrion shouted at his nephew giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump The animal reared trumpeting and plunged ahead the press shattering before him

Tyrion drove into the gap hard on the king’s hooves Bronn kept pace sword in hand A jagged rock flew past his head as he rode and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser Mandon’s shield To their left three gold cloaks went down under the surge and then the crowd was rushing forward trampling the fallen men The Hound had vanished behind though his riderless horse galloped beside them Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the saddle the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp Ser Balon Swann dropped the Lannister lion to draw his longsword He slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped apart the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind In an instant they were gone Someone staggered in front of Joffrey’s horse and shrieked as the king rode him down Whether it had been man woman or child Tyrion could not have said Joffrey was galloping at his side whey-faced with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on his left

And suddenly the madness was behind and they were clattering across the cobbled square that fronted on the castle barbican A line of spearmen held the gates Ser Jacelyn was wheeling his lances around for another charge The spears parted to let the king’s party pass under the portcullis Pale red walls loomed up about them reassuringly high and aswarm with crossbowmen

Tyrion did not recall dismounting Ser Mandon was helping the shaken king off his horse when Cersei Tommen and Lancel rode through the gates with Ser Meryn and Ser Boros close behind Boros had blood smeared along his blade while Meryn’s white cloak had been torn from his back Ser Balon Swann rode in helmetless his mount lathered and bleeding at the mouth Horas Redwyne brought in Lady Tanda half-crazed with fear for her daughter Lollys who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind Lord Gyles more grey of face than ever stammered out a tale of seeing the High Septon spilled from his litter screeching prayers as the crowd swept over him Jalabhar Xho said he thought he’d seen Ser Preston Greenfield of the Kingsguard riding back toward the High Septon’s overturned litter but he was not certain

Tyrion was dimly aware of a maester asking if he was injured He pushed his way across the yard to where his nephew stood his dung-encrusted crown askew Traitors Joffrey was babbling excitedly I’ll have all their heads I’ll—

The dwarf slapped his flushed face so hard the crown flew from Joffrey’s head Then he shoved him with both hands and knocked him sprawling You blind bloody fool

They were traitors Joffrey squealed from the ground They called me names and attacked me

You set your dog on them What did you imagine they would do bend the knee meekly while the Hound lopped off some limbs You spoiled witless little boy you’ve killed Clegane and gods know how many more and yet you come through unscratched Damn you And he kicked him It felt so good he might have done more but Ser Mandon Moore pulled him off as Joffrey howled and then Bronn was there to take him in hand Cersei knelt over her son while Ser Balon Swann restrained Ser Lancel Tyrion wrenched free of Bronn’s grip How many are still out there he shouted to no one and everyone

My daughter cried Lady Tanda Please someone must go back for Lollys   

Ser Preston is not returned Ser Boros Blount reported nor Aron Santagar

Nor Wet Nurse said Ser Horas Redwyne That was the mocking name the other squires had hung on young Tyrek Lannister

Tyrion glanced round the yard Where’s the Stark girl

For a moment no one answered Finally Joffrey said She was riding by me I don’t know where she went

Tyrion pressed blunt fingers into his throbbing temples If Sansa Stark had come to harm Jaime was as good as dead Ser Mandon you were her shield

Ser Mandon Moore remained untroubled When they mobbed the Hound I thought first of the king

And rightly so Cersei put in Boros Meryn go back and find the girl

And my daughter Lady Tanda sobbed Please sers   

Ser Boros did not look pleased at the prospect of leaving the safety of the castle Your Grace he told the queen the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob

Tyrion had stomached all he cared to The Others take your fucking cloaks Take them off if you’re afraid to wear them you bloody oaf    but find me Sansa Stark or I swear I’ll have Shagga split that ugly head of yours in two to see if there’s anything inside but black pudding

Ser Boros went purple with rage You would call me ugly you He started to raise the bloody sword still clutched in his mailed fist Bronn shoved Tyrion unceremoniously behind him

Stop it Cersei snapped Boros you’ll do as you’re bid or we’ll find someone else to wear that cloak Your oath—

There she is Joffrey shouted pointing

Sandor Clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride Sansa’s chestnut courser The girl was seated behind both arms tight around the Hound’s chest

Tyrion called to her Are you hurt Lady Sansa

Blood was trickling down Sansa’s brow from a deep gash on her scalp They    they were throwing things    rocks and filth eggs    I tried to tell them I had no bread to give them A man tried to pull me from the saddle The Hound killed him I think    his arm    Her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth He cut off his arm

Clegane lifted her to the ground His white cloak was torn and stained and blood seeped through a jagged tear in his left sleeve The little bird’s bleeding Someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut Maester Frenken scurried forward to obey They did for Santagar the Hound continued Four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone I gutted one not that it did Ser Aron much good

Lady Tanda approached him My daughter—

Never saw her The Hound glanced around the yard scowling Where’s my horse If anything’s happened to that horse someone’s going to pay

He was running with us for a time Tyrion said but I don’t know what became of him after that

Fire a voice screamed down from atop the barbican My lords there’s smoke in the city Flea Bottom’s afire

Tyrion was inutterably weary but there was no time for despair Bronn take as many men as you need and see that the water wagons are not molested Gods be good the wildfire if any blaze should reach that    We can lose all of Flea Bottom if we must but on no account must the fire reach the Guildhall of the Alchemists is that understood Clegane you’ll go with him

For half a heartbeat Tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the Hound’s dark eyes Fire he realized The Others take me of course he hates fire he’s tasted it too well The look was gone in an instant replaced by Clegane’s familiar scowl I’ll go he said though not by your command I need to find that horse

Tyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the Kingsguard Each of you will ride escort to a herald Command the people to return to their homes Any man found on the streets after the last peal of the evenfall bell will be killed

Our place is beside the king Ser Meryn said complacent

Cersei reared up like a viper Your place is where my brother says it is she spit The Hand speaks with the king’s own voice and disobedience is treason

Boros and Meryn exchanged a look Should we wear our cloaks Your Grace Ser Boros asked

Go naked for all I care It might remind the mob that you’re men They’re like to have forgotten after seeing the way you behaved out there in the street

Tyrion let his sister rage His head was throbbing He thought he could smell smoke though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying Two of the Stone Crows guarded the door of the Tower of the Hand Find me Timett son of Timett

Stone Crows do not run squeaking after Burned Men one of the wildlings informed him haughtily

For a moment Tyrion had forgotten who he was dealing with Then find me Shagga

Shagga sleeps

It was an effort not to scream Wake Him

It is no easy thing to wake Shagga son of Dolf the man complained His wrath is fearsome He went off grumbling

The clansman wandered in yawning and scratching Half the city is rioting the other half is burning and Shagga lies snoring Tyrion said

Shagga mislikes your muddy water here so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine and after his head hurts

I have Shae in a manse near the Iron Gate I want you to go to her and keep her safe whatever may come

The huge man smiled his teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of his beard Shagga will fetch her here

Just see that no harm comes to her Tell her I will come to her as soon as I may This very night perhaps or on the morrow for a certainty

Yet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil though Bronn reported that the fires were quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of Shae’s arms he realized he would go nowhere that night
