designing a strategy for his recovery
Gales not supposed to visit me as hes confined to
bed with some kind of shoulder wound But on the third
night after Ive been medicated and the lights turned down
low for bedtime he slips silently into my room He doesnt
speak just runs his fingers over the bruises on my neck
with a touch as light as moth wings plants a kiss between
my eyes and disappears
The next morning Im discharged from the hospital with
instructions to move quietly and speak only when
necessary Im not imprinted with a schedule so I wander
around aimlessly until Prims excused from her hospital
duties to take me to our familys latest compartment 2212
Identical to the last one but with no window
Buttercup has now been issued a daily food allowance
and a pan of sand thats kept under the bathroom sink As
Prim tucks me into bed he hops up on my pillow vying for
her attention She cradles him but stays focused on me
Katniss I know this whole thing with Peeta is terrible for
you But remember Snow worked on him for weeks and
weve only had him for a few days Theres a chance that
the old Peeta the one who loves you is still inside Trying
to get back to you Dont give up on him
I look at my little sister and think how she has inherited
the best qualities our family has to offer my mothers
healing hands my fathers level head and my fight Theres
something else there as well something entirely her own
An ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see
things for what they are Is it possible she could be right
That Peeta could return to me
I have to get back to the hospital Prim says placing
Buttercup on the bed beside me You two keep each other
company okay
Buttercup springs off the bed and follows her to the
door complaining loudly when hes left behind Were about
as much company for each other as dirt After maybe thirty
seconds I know I cant stand being confined in the
subterranean cell and leave Buttercup to his own devices I
get lost several times but eventually I make my way down
to Special Defense Everyone I pass stares at the bruises
and I cant help feeling self-conscious to the point that I tug
my collar up to my ears
Gale must have been released from the hospital this
morning as well because I find him in one of the research
rooms with Beetee Theyre immersed heads bent over a
drawing taking a measurement Versions of the picture
litter the table and floor Tacked on the corkboard walls and
occupying several computer screens are other designs of
some sort In the rough lines of one I recognize Gales
twitch-up snare What are these I ask hoarsely pulling
their attention from the sheet
Ah Katniss youve found us out says Beetee
cheerfully
What Is this a secret I know Gales been down
here working with Beetee a lot but I assumed they were
messing around with bows and guns
Not really But Ive felt a little guilty about it Stealing
Gale away from you so much Beetee admits
Since Ive spent most of my time in 13 disoriented
worried angry being remade or hospitalized I cant say
Gales absences have inconvenienced me Things havent
been exactly harmonious between us either But I let
Beetee think he owes me I hope youve been putting his
time to good use
Come and see he says waving me over to a
computer screen
This is what theyve been doing Taking the
fundamental ideas behind Gales traps and adapting them
into weapons against humans Bombs mostly Its less
about the mechanics of the traps than the psychology
behind them Booby-trapping an area that provides
something essential to survival A water or food supply
Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater
destruction Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the
actual desired target the parent Luring the victim into what
appears to be a safe haven--where death awaits it At
some point Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind
and focused on more human impulses Like compassion A
bomb explodes Time is allowed for people to rush to the
aid of the wounded Then a second more powerful bomb
kills them as well
That seems to be crossing some kind of line I say
So anything goes They both stare at me--Beetee with
doubt Gale with hostility I guess there isnt a rule book for
what might be unacceptable to do to another human being
Sure there is Beetee and I have been following the
same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked
Peeta says Gale
Cruel but to the point I leave without further comment I
feel if I dont get outside immediately Ill just go ballistic but
Im still in Special Defense when Im waylaid by Haymitch
Come on he says We need you back up at the
hospital
What for I ask
Theyre going to try something on Peeta he answers
Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can
come up with Find someone Peeta might share childhood
memories with but nothing too close to you Theyre
screening people now
I know this will be a difficult task since anyone Peeta
