gathered every man according to his eating

1619 And Moses said Let no man leave of it till the morning

1620 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses but some of them
left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and Moses
was wroth with them

1621 And they gathered it every morning every man according to his
eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted

1622 And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice
as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the
congregation came and told Moses

1623 And he said unto them This is that which the LORD hath said To
morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD bake that which
ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning

1624 And they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade and it did
not stink neither was there any worm therein

1625 And Moses said Eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto
the LORD to day ye shall not find it in the field

1626 Six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is
the sabbath in it there shall be none

1627 And it came to pass that there went out some of the people on
the seventh day for to gather and they found none

1628 And the LORD said unto Moses How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws  1629 See for that the LORD hath given you
the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day

1630 So the people rested on the seventh day

1631 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna and it
was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey

1632 And Moses said This is the thing which the LORD commandeth
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see
the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness when I brought
you forth from the land of Egypt

1633 And Moses said unto Aaron Take a pot and put an omer full of
manna therein and lay it up before the LORD to be kept for your
generations

1634 As the LORD commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the
Testimony to be kept

1635 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years until they
came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the
borders of the land of Canaan

1636 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah

171 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
the wilderness of Sin after their journeys according to the
commandment of the LORD and pitched in Rephidim and there was no
water for the people to drink

172 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said Give us
water that we may drink And Moses said unto them Why chide ye with
me wherefore do ye tempt the LORD  173 And the people thirsted
there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said
Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill
us and our children and our cattle with thirst  174 And Moses cried
unto the LORD saying What shall I do unto this people they be
almost ready to stone me

175 And the LORD said unto Moses Go on before the people and take
with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest
the river take in thine hand and go

176 Behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it
that the people may drink And Moses did so in the sight of the elders
of Israel

177 And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because
of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted the
LORD saying Is the LORD among us or not  178 Then came Amalek
and fought with Israel in Rephidim

179 And Moses said unto Joshua Choose us out men and go out fight
with Amalek to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of God in mine hand

1710 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek
and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill

1711 And it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel
prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailed
