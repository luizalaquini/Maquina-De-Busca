Then it passes back through a chain of delays along the bottom
backward path and is used to modify subsequent forward signals
Finally it is discarded at the lower left-hand corner
pp
There are p stages in the lattice structure of Figure 68 where p is the
order of the linear predictive filter
Each stage involves two multiplications by the appropriate
reflection coefficients one by the backward signal em the
result of which is added into the forward path em and the other by
the forward signal em the result of which is subtracted from the
backward path  Thus the number of multiplications is twice
the order of the filter and hence twice as many as for the
realization using coefficients a sub k  If the labour necessary
to turn the reflection coefficients into a sub ks is included
the computational load becomes the same  Moreover since the
reflection coefficients need fewer quantization bits than the a sub ks
for a given speech quality the word lengths are smaller in the
lattice realization
pp
The advantages of the lattice method of synthesis over direct evaluation
of the prediction using filter coefficients a sub k then are
LB
NP
the reflection coefficients are used directly
NP
the stability of the filter is obvious from the reflection coefficient
values
NP
the system is more tolerant to quantization errors in fixed-point
implementations
LE
Although it may seem unlikely that an unstable filter would be produced
by linear predictive analysis instability is in fact a real problem
in non-lattice implementations  For example
coefficients are often interpolated at the receiver to allow longer
frame times and smooth over sudden transitions and it is quite likely that
an unstable configuration is obtained when interpolating filter coefficients
between two stable configurations
This cannot happen with reflection coefficients however because a
necessary and sufficient condition for stability is that all
coefficients lie in the interval -1+1

Lattice filters are an important new method of linear predictive

analysis
as well as synthesis and so
it is worth considering the theory behind them a little further
rh Theory of the lattice synthesis filter
Figure 69 shows a single stage of the synthesis lattice given earlier
FC Figure 69
There are two signals at each side of the lattice and the z-transforms
of these have been labelled X sup + and X sup - at the left-hand side
and Y sup + and Y sup - at the right-hand side
The direction of signal flow is forwards along the upper positive path
and backwards along the lower negative one
pp
The signal flows show that the following two relationships hold

Y sup + = X sup + + k z sup -1 Y sup -

X sup -  = -kY sup + + z sup -1 Y sup -

Re-arranging the first equation yields

X sup +  = Y sup + - k z sup -1 Y sup -

and so we can describe the function of the lattice by a single matrix
equation

It would be nice to be able to
call this an input-output equation but it is not
for the input signals to the lattice stage are X sup + and Y sup -
and the outputs are X sup - and Y sup +
We have written it in this form because it allows a multi-stage lattice to
be described by cascading these matrix equations
pp
A single-stage lattice filter has Y sup + and Y sup - connected together
forming its output call this X sub output while the input is X sup +
X sub input
Hence the input is related to the output by
