205 And there was war again with the Philistines and Elhanan the son
of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite whose spear
staff was like a weavers beam

206 And yet again there was war at Gath where was a man of great
stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each
hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant

207 But when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of Shimea Davids
brother slew him

208 These were born unto the giant in Gath and they fell by the hand
of David and by the hand of his servants

211 And Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number
Israel

212 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people Go
number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan and bring the number of them
to me that I may know it

213 And Joab answered The LORD make his people an hundred times so
many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my
lords servants  why then doth my lord require this thing why will
he be a cause of trespass to Israel  214 Nevertheless the kings
word prevailed against Joab Wherefore Joab departed and went
throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem

215 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David And
all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
men that drew sword and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten
thousand men that drew sword

216 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them for the kings
word was abominable to Joab

217 And God was displeased with this thing therefore he smote
Israel

218 And David said unto God I have sinned greatly because I have
done this thing but now I beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy
servant for I have done very foolishly

219 And the LORD spake unto Gad Davids seer saying 2110 Go and
tell David saying Thus saith the LORD I offer thee three things
choose thee one of them that I may do it unto thee

2111 So Gad came to David and said unto him Thus saith the LORD
Choose thee 2112 Either three years famine or three months to be
destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies
overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the LORD even the
pestilence in the land and the angel of the LORD destroying
throughout all the coasts of Israel Now therefore advise thyself what
word I shall bring again to him that sent me

2113 And David said unto Gad I am in a great strait let me fall now
into the hand of the LORD for very great are his mercies but let me
not fall into the hand of man

2114 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel and there fell of
Israel seventy thousand men

2115 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it and as he
was destroying the LORD beheld and he repented him of the evil and
said to the angel that destroyed It is enough stay now thine hand
And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite

2116 And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD
stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over Jerusalem Then David and the elders of
Israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces

2117 And David said unto God Is it not I that commanded the people
to be numbered even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed
but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray
thee O LORD my God be on me and on my fathers house but not on
thy people that they should be plagued

2118 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that
David should go up and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite

2119 And David went up at the saying of Gad which he spake in the
name of the LORD

2120 And Ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with
him hid themselves Now Ornan was threshing wheat

2121 And as David came to Ornan Ornan looked and saw David and went
out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to David with his face to
the ground

2122 Then David said to Ornan Grant me the place of this
threshingfloor that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD thou
shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed
from the people

2123 And Ornan said unto David Take it to thee and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his eyes lo I give thee the oxen also
