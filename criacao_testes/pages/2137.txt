The wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere

No doubt they did Upstream or down We keep on we’ll find the place but which way

I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles said Reek A man might If he knew he was being hunted he might But a wolf

Yet Theon wondered These beasts were not as other wolves I should have skinned the cursed things

It was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss Murch and Aggar The huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the Starks might have parted company with the direwolves Farlen’s hounds seemed as frustrated as their masters sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other

Theon dared not admit defeat We’ll return to the brook Search again This time we’ll go as far as we must

We won’t find them the Frey boy said suddenly Not so long as the frogeaters are with them Mudmen are sneaks they won’t fight like decent folks they skulk and use poison arrows You never see them but they see you Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out Their houses move even the castles like Greywater Watch He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides They might be out there right now listening to everything we say

Farlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion My dogs would smell anything in them bushes Be all over them before you could break wind boy

Frogeaters don’t smell like men Frey insisted They have a boggy stink like frogs and trees and scummy water Moss grows under their arms in place of hair and they can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water

Theon was about to tell him what he ought to do with his wet nurse’s fable when Maester Luwin spoke up The histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck It may be that they have secret knowledge

Suddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than it had a moment before as if a cloud had passed before the sun It was one thing to have some fool boy spouting folly but maesters were supposed to be wise The only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon Theon said Back to the stream Now

For a moment he did not think they were going to obey but in the end old habit asserted itself They followed sullenly but they followed The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits he’d flushed earlier Theon put men on either bank and followed the current They rode for miles going slow and careful dismounting to lead the horses over treacherous ground letting the good-for-bear-bait hounds sniff at every bush Where a fallen tree dammed the flow the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool but if the direwolves had done the same they’d left neither print nor spoor The beasts had taken to swimming it seemed When I catch them they’ll have all the swimming they can stomach I’ll give them both to the Drowned God

When the woods began to darken Theon Greyjoy knew he was beaten Either the crannogmen did know the magic of the children of the forest or else Osha had deceived them with some wildling trick He made them press on through the dusk but when the last light faded Joseth finally worked up the courage to say This is fruitless my lord We will lame a horse break a leg

Joseth has the right of it said Maester Luwin Groping through the woods by torchlight will avail us nothing

Theon could taste bile at the back of his throat and his stomach was a nest of snakes twining and snapping at each other If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed he might as well dress in motley henceforth and wear a pointed hat the whole north would know him for a fool And when my father hears and Asha   

M’lord prince Reek urged his horse near Might be them Starks never came this way If I was them I would have gone north and east maybe To the Umbers Good Stark men they are But their lands are a long way The boys will shelter someplace nearer Might be I know where

Theon looked at him suspiciously Tell me

You know that old mill sitting lonely on the Acorn Water We stopped there when I was being dragged to Winterfell a captive The miller’s wife sold us hay for our horses while that old knight clucked over her brats Might be the Starks are hiding there

Theon knew the mill He had even tumbled the miller’s wife a time or two There was nothing special about it or her Why there There are a dozen villages and holdfasts just as close

Amusement shone in those pale eyes Why Now that’s past knowing But they’re there I have a feeling

He was growing sick of the man’s sly answers His lips look like two worms fucking What are you saying If you’ve kept some knowledge from me—

M’lord prince Reek dismounted and beckoned Theon to do the same When they were both afoot he pulled open the cloth sack he’d fetched from Winterfell Have a look here

It was growing hard to see Theon thrust his hand into the sack impatiently groping amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool A sharp point pricked his skin and his fingers closed around something cold and hard He drew out a wolf’s-head brooch silver and jet Understanding came suddenly His hand closed into a fist Gelmarr he said wondering whom he could trust None of them Aggar Rednose With us The rest of you may return to Winterfell with the hounds I’ll have no further need of them I know where Bran and Rickon are hiding now

Prince Theon Maester Luwin entreated you will remember your promise Mercy you said

Mercy was for this morning said Theon It is better to be feared than laughed at Before they made me angry





JON

They could see the fire in the night glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star It burned redder than the other stars and did not twinkle though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark dull and faint

Half a mile ahead and two thousand feet up Jon judged and perfectly placed to see anything moving in the pass below

Watchers in the Skirling Pass wondered the oldest among them In the spring of his youth he had been squire to a king so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge What is it Mance Rayder fears I wonder

If he knew they’d lit a fire he’d flay the poor bastards said Ebben a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks

Fire is life up here said Qhorin Halfhand but it can be death as well By his command they’d risked no open flames since entering the mountains They ate cold salt beef hard bread and harder cheese and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs grateful for each other’s warmth It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell when he’d shared a bed with his brothers These men were brothers too though the bed they shared was stone and earth

They’ll have a horn said Stonesnake

The Halfhand said A horn they must not blow

That’s a long cruel climb by night Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them The sky was cloudless the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight

And a longer fall said Qhorin Halfhand Two men I think There are like to be two up there sharing the watch

Me The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them It would have to be him

And me said Jon Snow

Qhorin Halfhand looked at him Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through the high pass above them One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter The wolf will remain with us Qhorin said White fur is seen too easily by moonlight He turned to Stonesnake When it’s done throw down a burning brand We’ll come when we see it fall

No better time to start than now said Stonesnake

They each took a long coil of rope Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt Their garrons they left behind along with their helms mail and Ghost Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off Stay he commanded I’ll be back for you

Stonesnake took the lead He was a short wiry man near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known He needed them tonight By day the mountains were blue-grey brushed with frost but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black Now the rising moon had limned them in white and silver

The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks working their way up a steep twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air Jon felt almost naked without his mail but he did not miss its weight This was hard going and slow To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken uneven ground

The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes a long twisting course that went up around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun Apart from his companions Jon had glimpsed no living man since they’d left the wood behind and begun to make their way upward The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place the gods had made and as inimical to men The wind cut like a knife up here and shrilled in the night like a mother mourning her slain children What few trees they saw were stunted grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a distance

Yet even so Jon Snow was not sorry he had come There were wonders here as well He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper’s grass in russet and gold He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce

Now it is our turn to pounce He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat and kill as quickly Longclaw was sheathed across his back but he might not have room to use it He carried dirk and dagger for closer work They will have weapons as well and I am not armored He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night’s end and who the ram

For a long way they stayed to the trail following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain upward ever upward Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire but soon or late it would always reappear The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab inch by inch Even where the track widened it was treacherous there were cracks big enough to swallow a man’s leg rubble to stumble over hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night One step and then another Jon told himself One step and then another and I will not fall

He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men and the hair on his lip was soon stiff with frost Two hours into the climb the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock praying he would not be blown off the mountain One step and then another he resumed when the gale subsided One step and then another and I will not fall

Soon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered There was nothing below but yawning blackness nothing above but moon and stars The mountain is your mother Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past Cling to her press your face up against her teats and she won’t drop you Jon had made a joke of it saying how he’d always wondered who his mother was but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs It did not seem nearly so amusing now One step and then another he thought clinging tight
