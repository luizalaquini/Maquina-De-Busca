513 And withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to
house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking
things which they ought not

514 I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children
guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully

515 For some are already turned aside after Satan

516 If any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve
them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that
are widows indeed

517 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine

518 For the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn And The labourer is worthy of his reward

519 Against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or
three witnesses

520 Them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear

521 I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the
elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one
before another doing nothing by partiality

522 Lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens
sins keep thyself pure

523 Drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs
sake and thine often infirmities

524 Some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment
and some men they follow after

525 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and
they that are otherwise cannot be hid

61 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
worthy of all honour that the name of God and his doctrine be not
blasphemed

62 And they that have believing masters let them not despise them
because they are brethren but rather do them service because they
are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit These things teach
and exhort

63 If any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is
according to godliness 64 He is proud knowing nothing but doting
about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife
railings evil surmisings 65 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt
minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness
from such withdraw thyself

66 But godliness with contentment is great gain

67 For we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can
carry nothing out

68 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content

69 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and
into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction
and perdition

610 For the love of money is the root of all evil which while some
coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows

611 But thou O man of God flee these things and follow after
righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness

612 Fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life
whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession
before many witnesses

613 I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all
things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a
good confession 614 That thou keep this commandment without spot
unrebukable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ 615 Which
in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate the
King of kings and Lord of lords 616 Who only hath immortality
dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath
seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting Amen

617 Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not
highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living God who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy 618 That they do good that
they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to
communicate 619 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life

620 O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding
profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so
called 621 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith
Grace be with thee Amen
