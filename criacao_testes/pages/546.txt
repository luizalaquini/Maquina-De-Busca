Bolton glanced up at the banners waving above the gatehouse towers As the Starks are wont to remind us winter is coming Have it done When he saw Arya looking on he said Nan I’ll want a flagon of hot spice wine I took a chill in the woods See that it doesn’t get cold I’m of a mind to sup alone Barley bread butter and boar

At once my lord That was always the best thing to say

Hot Pie was making oatcakes when she entered the kitchen Three other cooks were boning fish while a spit boy turned a boar over the flames My lord wants his supper and hot spice wine to wash it down Arya announced and he doesn’t want it cold One of the cooks washed his hands took out a kettle and filled it with a heavy sweet red Hot Pie was told to crumble in the spices as the wine heated Arya went to help

I can do it he said sullenly I don’t need you to show me how to spice wine

He hates me too or else he’s scared of me She backed away more sad than angry When the food was ready the cooks covered it with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick towel to keep it warm Dusk was settling outside On the walls the crows muttered round the heads like courtiers round a king One of the guards held the door to Kingspyre Hope that’s not weasel soup he jested

Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leatherbound book when she entered Light some candles he commanded her as he turned a page It grows gloomy in here

She placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger then closed the book and placed it carefully in the fire He watched the flames consume it pale eyes shining with reflected light The old dry leather went up with a whoosh and the yellow pages stirred as they burned as if some ghost were reading them I will have no further need of you tonight he said never looking at her

She should have gone silent as a mouse but something had hold of her My lord she asked will you take me with you when you leave Harrenhal

He turned to stare at her and from the look in his eyes it was as if his supper had just spoken to him Did I give you leave to question me Nan

No my lord She lowered her eyes

You should not have spoken then Should you

No My lord

For a moment he looked amused I will answer you just this once I mean to give Harrenhal to Lord Vargo when I return to the north You will remain here with him

But I don’t— she started

He cut her off I am not in the habit of being questioned by servants Nan Must I have your tongue out

He would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog she knew No my lord

Then I’ll hear no more from you

No my lord

Go then I shall forget this insolence

Arya went but not to her bed When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard the guard on the door nodded at her and said Storm coming Smell the air The wind was gusting flames swirling off the torches mounted atop the walls beside the rows of heads On her way to the godswood she passed the Wailing Tower where once she had lived in fear of Weese The Freys had taken it for their own since Harrenhal’s fall She could hear angry voices coming from a window many men talking and arguing all at once Elmar was sitting on the steps outside alone

What’s wrong Arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks

My princess he sobbed We’ve been dishonored Aenys says There was a bird from the Twins My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else or be a septon

A stupid princess she thought that’s nothing to cry over My brothers might be dead she confided

Elmar gave her a scornful look No one cares about a serving girl’s brothers

It was hard not to hit him when he said that I hope your princess dies she said and ran off before he could grab her In the godswood she found her broomstick sword where she had left it and carried it to the heart tree There she knelt Red leaves rustled Red eyes peered inside her The eyes of the gods Tell me what to do you gods she prayed

For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb And then far far off beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal from somewhere out in the world came the long lonely howl of a wolf Gooseprickles rose on Arya’s skin and for an instant she felt dizzy Then so faintly it seemed as if she heard her father’s voice When the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives he said

But there is no pack she whispered to the weirwood Bran and Rickon were dead the Lannisters had Sansa Jon had gone to the Wall I’m not even me now I’m Nan
