overhead it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide
twilight in the evening dark as midnight at dusk and
black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight To
describe the spot is to call it a vast low naturally formed
hall the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender
pillars of living wood the floor being covered with a soft
dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones with
a tuft of grass-blades here and there
This bit of the path was always the crux of the
nights ramble though before starting her apprehen+
sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to
take a companion Slipping along here covertly as
Time Bathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps enter+
ing the track at the opposite end It was certainly a
rustle of footsteps Her own instantly fell as gently as
snowflakes She reassured herself by a remembrance
that the path was public and that the traveller was
probably some villager returning home  regetting at
the same time that the meeting should be about to
occur in the darkest point of her route even though
only just outside her own door
The noise approached came close and a figure was
apparently on the point of gliding past her when some+
thing tugged at her skirt and pinned it forcibly to the
ground The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath+
sheba off her balance In recovering she struck against
warm clothes and buttons
A rum start upon my soul said a masculine voice
a foot or so above her head Have I hurt you mate
No said Bathsheba attempting to shrink a way
P 214
 We have got hitched together somehow I think
 Yes
Are you a woman 
Yes
A lady I should have said
It doesnt matter
I am a man
Oh
Bathsheba softly tugged again but to no purpose
Is that a dark lantern you have  I fancy so said
the man
Yes
If youll allow me Ill open it and set you free
A hand seized the lantern the door was opened the
rays burst out from their prison and Bathsheba beheld
her position with astonishment
The man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in
brass and scarlet He was a soldier His sudden
appearance was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet
is to silense Gloom the genius loci at all times hitherto
was now totally overthrown less by the lantern-light
than by what the lantern lighted The contrast of this
revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure
in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the
effect of a fairy transformation
It was immediately apparent that the military mans
spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
the skirt of her dress He caught a view of her face
Ill unfasten you in one moment miss he said
with new-born gallantry
 O no -- I can do it thank you she hastily replied
and stooped for the performance
The unfastening was not such a trifling affair The
rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
cords in those few moments that separation was likely
to be a matter of time
He too stooped and the lantern standing on the
ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side
among the fir-tree needles and the blades of long damp
grass with the effect of a large glowworm It radiated
upwards into their

faces and sent over half the planta+
tion gigantic shadows of both man and woman each
dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the
tree-trunks till it wasted to nothing
He looked hard into her eyes when she raised them
for a moment Bathsheba looked down again for his
gaze was too strong to be received point-blank with her
own But she had obliquely noticed that he was young
and slim and that he wore three chevrons upon his
sleeve
Bathsheba pulled again
 You are a prisoner miss it is no use blinking the
matter said the soldier drily  I must cut your dress
if you are in such a hurry
 Yes -- please do she exclaimed helplessly 
It wouldnt be necessary if you could wait a
moment and he unwound a cord from the little
wheel She withdrew her own hand but whether by
accident or design he touched it Bathsheba was
vexed she hardly knew why
His unravelling went on but it nevertheless seemed
coming to no end She looked at him again
Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face
said the young sergeant without ceremony
She coloured with embarrassment Twas un+
willingly shown she replied stiffly and with as much
dignity -- which was very little -- as she could infuse into
