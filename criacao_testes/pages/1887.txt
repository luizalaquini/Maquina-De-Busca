Consider the positive part of the curve  The first two segments which
are actually collinear correspond exactly to 12-bit linear conversion
Thus the output codes 0 to 31 correspond to inputs from 0 to 312048
in equal steps  Remember that both positive and negative signals
must be converted so a 12-bit linear converter will allocate 2048 levels
for positive signals and 2048 for negative ones  The next
segment provides 11-bit linear quantization
output codes 32 to 47 corresponding to inputs from 161024 to 311024
Similarly the next segment corresponds to 10-bit quantization covering
inputs from 16512 to 31512  And so on the last section giving 6-bit
quantization of inputs from 1632 to 3132 the full-scale positive value
Negative inputs are converted similarly
For signal levels of less than 322048 that is 2 sup -8 this implementation
of the A-law provides full 12-bit precision
As the signal level increases the precision decreases gradually to 6 bits
at maximum amplitudes

Logarithmic encoding provides what is in effect a floating-point representation
of the input  The conventional floating-point format however is not used
because many different codes can represent the same value  For example with
a 4-bit exponent preceding a 4-bit mantissa the words 00001000
00010100 00100010 and 00110001 represent the numbers
01  times  2 sup 0  001  times  2 sup 1
  0001  times  2 sup 2  c
and  00001  times  2 sup 3  respectively
which are the same  Some floating-point conventions assume that an unwritten
1 bit precedes the mantissa except when the whole word is zero but this
gives decreased resolution around zero em which is exactly where we want the
resolution to be greatest  Table 31 shows the 8-bit A-law codes

Logarithmic encoders and decoders are available from many semiconductor
manufacturers as single-chip devices
called codecs for coderdecoder  Intended for use on digital communication
links these generally provide a serial output bit-stream which
should be converted to parallel by a shift register if the data is intended
for a computer
Because of the potentially vast market for codecs in telecommunications
they are made in great quantities and are consequently very cheap
Estimates of the speech quality necessary for telephone applications indicate
that somewhat less than this accuracy is needed em 7-bit logarithmic encoding
was used in early digital communications links and it may be that even 6 bits
are adequate  However during the transition period when digital
networks must coexist with the present analogue one it is anticipated that
a particular telephone call may have to pass through several links some
using analogue technology and some being digital  The possibility of
several successive encodings and decodings has led telecommunications
engineers to standardize on 8-bit representations leaving some margin
before additional degradation of signal quality becomes unduly distracting
pp
Unfortunately world telecommunications authorities cannot agree on a single
standard for logarithmic encoding  The A-law which we have described
is the European standard but there is another system called
the mu-law which is used universally in North America  It also is available
in single-chip form with an 8-bit code  It has very similar
