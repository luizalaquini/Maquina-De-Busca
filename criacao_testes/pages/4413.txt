essential tasks
A two-multiplier lattice section takes 20 instructions
and so only six sections can fit into the remaining program space
It may be possible to use two 2920s to implement a complete 10 or 12th
order lattice but the results of the first stage must be passed to the
second by transmitting analogue or digital data between each of the
2920s analogue ports em not a terribly satisfactory method
pp
Since a formant filter occupies only 14 instructions up to nine of them
would fit in the program space left after the above-mentioned essential
subsystems
Although other necessary house-keeping tasks may reduce this number
substantially
it does seem possible to implement a formant synthesizer on a single 2920
rh The Programmable Digital Signal Processor
Whereas the 2920 is intended for general signal-processing jobs
Telesensory Systems PDSP
Programmable Digital Signal Processor is aimed specifically at speech
synthesis
It comprises two separate chips a control unit and an arithmetic unit
To build a synthesizer these must be augmented with external memory
and a DA converter arranged in a configuration like that of Figure 1112
FC Figure 1112
pp
The control unit accepts parameter data from a host computer one byte at a time
The data is temporarily held in buffer memory before being serialized and passed
to the arithmetic unit
Notice that for the 2920 we assumed that parameters were presented
to the chip already serialized and precisely timed  the PDSP control unit
effectively releases the host from this high-speed real-time operation
But it does more
It generates both a voiced and an unvoiced excitation source and passes them
to the arithmetic unit to relieve the latter of the general-purpose
programming required for both these tasks and allow its instruction set
to be highly specialized for digital filtering
pp
The arithmetic unit has rather a peculiar structure
It accomodates only 16 program steps and can execute the full 16-instruction
program at a rate of 10 kHz
The internal word-length is 18 bits but coefficients and the digital output
are only 10 bits
Each instruction can accomplish quite a lot of work
Figure 1113 shows that there are four separate blocks of store in addition
to the program memory
FC Figure 1113
One location of each block is automatically associated with each program step
Thus on instruction 2 for example two 18-bit scratchpad registers MA2
and MB2 and two 10-bit coefficient registers A12 and A22 are
accessible
In addition five general registers curiously numbered R1 R2 R5 R6 R7
are available to every program step
pp
Each instruction has five fields
A single instruction loads all the general registers and simultaneously
performs two multiplications and up to three additions
The fields specify exactly which operands are involved in these operations
pp
The instructions of the PDSP arithmetic unit are really very powerful
For example a second-order digital formant resonator requires only
two program steps
A two-multiplier lattice stage needs only one step and
a complete 12-stage lattice filter can be implemented in the 16 steps available
An important feature of the architecture is that it
is quite easy to incorporate more than one
arithmetic unit into a system with a single control unit
Intermediate data can be transferred digitally between arithmetic units
since the DA converter is off-chip
A four-multiplier normalized lattice Chapter 6 with 12 stages can be implemented
on two arithmetic units as can a lattice filter which incorporates zeros
as well as poles and a complex seriesparallel formant synthesizer
with a total of 12 resonators whose centre frequencies and bandwidths
can be controlled independently Klatt 1980

How this device will fare in actual commercial products is yet to be seen
It is certainly much more sophisticated than the TI Speak n Spell chip
and a complete system will necessitate a much higher chip count and consequently
more expense
Telesensory Systems are committed to producing a text-to-speech
system based upon it
for use both in a reading machine for the blind and as a text-input
speech-output computer peripheral
