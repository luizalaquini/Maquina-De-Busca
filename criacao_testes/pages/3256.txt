small fishes but what are they among so many  610 And Jesus said
Make the men sit down Now there was much grass in the place So the
men sat down in number about five thousand

611 And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he
distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set
down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would

612 When they were filled he said unto his disciples Gather up the
fragments that remain that nothing be lost

613 Therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and
above unto them that had eaten

614 Then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did
said This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world

615 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain
himself alone

616 And when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea
617 And entered into a ship and went over the sea toward Capernaum
And it was now dark and Jesus was not come to them

618 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew

619 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs
they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and
they were afraid

620 But he saith unto them It is I be not afraid

621 Then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they went

622 The day following when the people which stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered and that Jesus went not with his
disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone
623 Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread after that the Lord had given thanks 624
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there neither his
disciples they also took shipping and came to Capernaum seeking for
Jesus

625 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea they
said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither  626 Jesus answered
them and said Verily verily I say unto you Ye seek me not because
ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were
filled

627 Labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life which the Son of man shall give unto
you for him hath God the Father sealed

628 Then said they unto him What shall we do that we might work the
works of God  629 Jesus answered and said unto them This is the
work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath sent

630 They said therefore unto him What sign shewest thou then that
we may see and believe thee what dost thou work  631 Our fathers
did eat manna in the desert as it is written He gave them bread from
heaven to eat

632 Then Jesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Moses
gave you not that bread from heaven but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven

633 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life unto the world

634 Then said they unto him Lord evermore give us this bread

635 And Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh
to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst

636 But I said unto you That ye also have seen me and believe not

637 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out

638 For I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the
will of him that sent me

639 And this is the Fathers will which hath sent me that of all
which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up
again at the last day

640 And this is the will of him that sent me that every one which
seeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I
will raise him up at the last day

641 The Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread
which came down from heaven

642 And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father
and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from
