Riders Gendry’s shout was shrill with alarm The door burst open and there he was Soldiers he panted Coming down the river road a dozen of them

Hot Pie leapt up knocking over his tankard but Tom and the others were unpertubed There’s no cause for spilling good ale on my floor said Sharna Sit back down and calm yourself boy there’s rabbit coming You too girl Whatever harm’s been done you it’s over and it’s done and you’re with king’s men now We’ll keep you safe as best we can

Arya’s only answer was to reach over her shoulder for her sword but before she had it halfway drawn Lem grabbed her wrist We’ll have no more of that now He twisted her arm until her hand opened His fingers were hard with callus and fearsomely strong Again Arya thought It’s happening again like it happened in the village with Chiswyck and Raff and the Mountain That Rides They were going to steal her sword and turn her back into a mouse Her free hand closed around her tankard and she swung it at Lem’s face The ale sloshed over the rim and splashed into his eyes and she heard his nose break and saw the spurt of blood When he roared his hands went to his face and she was free Run she screamed bolting

But Lem was on her again at once with his long legs that made one of his steps equal to three of hers She twisted and kicked but he yanked her off her feet effortlessly and held her dangling while the blood ran down his face

Stop it you little fool he shouted shaking her back and forth Stop it now Gendry moved to help her until Tom Sevenstrings stepped in front of him with a dagger

By then it was too late to flee She could hear horses outside and the sound of men’s voices A moment later a man came swaggering through the open door a Tyroshi even bigger than Lem with a great thick beard bright green at the ends but growing out grey Behind came a pair of crossbowmen helping a wounded man between them and then others…

A more ragged band Arya had never seen but there was nothing ragged about the swords axes and bows they carried One or two gave her curious glances as they entered but no one said a word A one-eyed man in a rusty pothelm sniffed the air and grinned while an archer with a head of stiff yellow hair was shouting for ale After them came a spearman in a lioncrested helm an older man with a limp a Braavosi sellsword a…

Harwin Arya whispered It was Under the beard and the tangled hair was the face of Hullen’s son who used to lead her pony around the yard ride at quintain with Jon and Robb and drink too much on feast days He was thinner harder somehow and at Winterfell he had never worn a beard but it was him—her father’s man Harwin Squirming she threw herself forward trying to wrench free of Lem’s iron grip It’s me she shouted Harwin it’s me don’t you know me don’t you The tears came and she found herself weeping like a baby just like some stupid little girl Harwin it’s me

Harwin’s eyes went from her face to the flayed man on her doublet How do you know me he said frowning suspiciously The flayed man… who are you some serving boy to Lord Leech

For a moment she did not know how to answer She’d had so many names Had she only dreamed Arya Stark I’m a girl she sniffed I was Lord Bolton’s cupbearer but he was going to leave me for the goat so I ran off with Gendry and Hot Pie You have to know me You used to lead my pony when I was little

His eyes went wide Gods be good he said in a choked voice Arya Underfoot Lem let go of her

She broke my nose Lem dumped her unceremoniously to the floor Who in seven hells is she supposed to be

The Hand’s daughter Harwin went to one knee before her Arya Stark of Winterfell





Catelyn


Robb she knew the moment she heard the kennels erupt

Her son had returned to Riverrun and Grey Wind with him Only the scent of the great grey direwolf could send the hounds into such a frenzy of baying and barking He will come to me she knew Edmure had not returned after his first visit preferring to spend his days with Marq Piper and Patrek Mallister listening to Rymund the Rhymer’s verses about the battle at the Stone Mill Robb is not Edmure though Robb will see me

It had been raining for days now a cold grey downpour that well suited Catelyn’s mood Her father was growing weaker and more delirious with every passing day waking only to mutter Tansy and beg forgiveness Edmure shunned her and Ser Desmond Grell still denied her freedom of the castle however unhappy it seemed to make him Only the return of Ser Robin Ryger and his men footweary and drenched to the bone served to lighten her spirits They had walked back it seemed Somehow the Kingslayer had contrived to sink their galley and escape Maester Vyman confided Catelyn asked if she might speak with Ser Robin to learn more of what had happened but that was refused her

Something else was wrong as well On the day her brother returned a few hours after their argument she had heard angry voices from the yard below When she climbed to the roof to see there were knots of men gathered across the castle beside the main gate Horses were being led from the stables saddled and bridled and there was shouting though Catelyn was too far away to make out the words One of Robb’s white banners lay on the ground and one of the knights turned his horse and trampled over the direwolf as he spurred toward the gate Several others did the same Those are men who fought with Edmure on the fords she thought What could have made them so angry Has my brother slighted them somehow given them some insult She thought she recognized Ser Perwyn Frey who had traveled with her to Bitterbridge and Storm’s End and back and his bastard half brother Martyn Rivers as well but from this vantage it was hard to be certain Close to forty men poured out through the castle gates to what end she did not know

They did not come back Nor would Maester Vyman tell her who they had been where they had gone or what had made them so angry I am here to see to your father and only that my lady he said Your brother will soon be Lord of Riverrun What he wishes you to know he must tell you

But now Robb was returned from the west returned in triumph He will forgive me Catelyn told herself He must forgive me he is my own son and Arya and Sansa are as much his blood as mine He will free me from these rooms and then I will know what has happened

By the time Ser Desmond came for her she had bathed and dressed and combed out her auburn hair King Robb has returned from the west my lady the knight said and commands that you attend him in the Great Hall

It was the moment she had dreamt of and dreaded Have I lost two sons or three She would know soon enough

The hall was crowded when they entered Every eye was on the dais but Catelyn knew their backs Lady Mormont’s patched ringmail the Greatjon and his son looming above every other head in the hall Lord Jason Mallister white-haired with his winged helm in the crook of his arm Tytos Blackwood in his magnificent raven-feather cloak… Half of them will want to hang me now The other half may only turn their eyes away She had the uneasy feeling that someone was missing too

Robb stood on the dais He is a boy no longer she realized with a pang He is sixteen now a man grown Just look at him War had melted all the softness from his face and left him hard and lean He had shaved his beard away but his auburn hair fell uncut to his shoulders The recent rains had rusted his mail and left brown stains on the white of his cloak and surcoat Or perhaps the stains were blood On his head was the sword crown they had fashioned him of bronze and iron He bears it more comfortably now He bears it like a king

Edmure stood below the crowded dais head bowed modestly as Robb praised his victory …fell at the Stone Mill shall never be forgotten Small wonder Lord Tywin ran off to fight Stannis He’d had his fill of northmen and rivermen both That brought laughter and approving shouts but Robb raised a hand for quiet Make no mistake though The Lannisters will march again and there will be other battles to win before the kingdom is secure

The Greatjon roared out King in the North and thrust a mailed fist into the air The river lords answered with a shout of King of the Trident The hall grew thunderous with pounding fists and stamping feet

Only a few noted Catelyn and Ser Desmond amidst the tumult but they elbowed their fellows and slowly a hush grew around her She held her head high and ignored the eyes Let them think what they will It is Robb’s judgment that matters

The sight of Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face on the dais gave her comfort A boy she did not know seemed to be acting as Robb’s squire Behind him stood a young knight in a sand-colored surcoat blazoned with seashells and an older one who wore three black pepperpots on a saffron bend across a field of green and silver stripes Between them were a handsome older lady and a pretty maid who looked to be her daughter There was another girl as well near Sansa’s age The seashells were the sigil of some lesser house Catelyn knew the older man’s she did not recognize Prisoners Why would Robb bring captives onto the dais

Utherydes Wayn banged his staff on the floor as Ser Desmond escorted her forward If Robb looks at me as Edmure did I do not know what I will do But it seemed to her that it was not anger she saw in her son’s eyes but something else… apprehension perhaps No that made no sense What should he fear He was the Young Wolf King of the Trident and the North

Her uncle was the first to greet her As black a fish as ever Ser Brynden had no care for what others might think He leapt off the dais and pulled Catelyn into his arms When he said It is good to see you home Cat she had to struggle to keep her composure And you she whispered

Mother

Catelyn looked up at her tall kingly son Your Grace I have prayed for your safe return I had heard you were wounded

I took an arrow through the arm while storming the Crag he said It’s healed well though I had the best of care

The gods are good then Catelyn took a deep breath Say it It cannot be avoided They will have told you what I did Did they tell you my reasons

For the girls

I had five children Now I have three

Aye my lady Lord Rickard Karstark pushed past the Greatjon like some grim specter with his black mail and long ragged grey beard his narrow face pinched and cold And I have one son who once had three You have robbed me of my vengeance

Catelyn faced him calmly Lord Rickard the Kingslayer’s dying would not have bought life for your children His living may buy life for mine

The lord was unappeased Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool You’ve bought a bag of empty words no more My Torrhen and my Eddard deserved better of you

Leave off Karstark rumbled the Greatjon crossing his huge arms against his chest It was a mother’s folly Women are made that way

A mother’s folly Lord Karstark rounded on Lord Umber I name it treason

Enough For just an instant Robb sounded more like Brandon than his father No man calls my lady of Winterfell a traitor in my hearing Lord Rickard When he turned to Catelyn his voice softened If I could wish the Kingslayer back in chains I would You freed him without my knowledge or consent… but what you did I know you did for love For Arya and Sansa and out of grief for Bran and Rickon Love’s not always wise I’ve learned It can lead us to great folly but we follow our hearts… wherever they take us Don’t we Mother

Is that what I did If my heart led me into folly I would gladly make whatever amends I can to Lord Karstark and yourself

Lord Rickard’s face was implacable Will your amends warm Torrhen and Eddard in the cold graves where the Kingslayer laid them He shouldered between the Greatjon and Maege Mormont and left the hall

Robb made no move to detain him Forgive him Mother

If you will forgive me

I have I know what it is to love so greatly you can think of nothing else

Catelyn bowed her head Thank you I have not lost this child at least
