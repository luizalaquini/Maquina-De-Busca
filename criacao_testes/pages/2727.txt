717 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and
he died as the man of God had said who spake when the king came down
to him

718 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king
saying Two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine
flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of
Samaria 719 And that lord answered the man of God and said Now
behold if the LORD should make windows in heaven might such a thing
be And he said Behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt
not eat thereof

720 And so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the
gate and he died

81 Then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to
life saying Arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn
wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the LORD hath called for a famine
and it shall also come upon the land seven years

82 And the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God
and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines seven years

83 And it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman
returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry
unto the king for her house and for her land

84 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God
saying Tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha hath
done

85 And it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had
restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he
had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her
land And Gehazi said My lord O king this is the woman and this is
her son whom Elisha restored to life

86 And when the king asked the woman she told him So the king
appointed unto her a certain officer saying Restore all that was
hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the
land even until now

87 And Elisha came to Damascus and Benhadad the king of Syria was
sick and it was told him saying The man of God is come hither

88 And the king said unto Hazael Take a present in thine hand and
go meet the man of God and enquire of the LORD by him saying Shall
I recover of this disease  89 So Hazael went to meet him and took a
present with him even of every good thing of Damascus forty camels
burden and came and stood before him and said Thy son Benhadad king
of Syria hath sent me to thee saying Shall I recover of this
disease  810 And Elisha said unto him Go say unto him Thou mayest
certainly recover howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall
surely die

811 And he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed
and the man of God wept

812 And Hazael said Why weepeth my lord And he answered Because I
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel their
strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay
with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women
with child

813 And Hazael said But what is thy servant a dog that he should
do this great thing And Elisha answered The LORD hath shewed me that
thou shalt be king over Syria

814 So he departed from Elisha and came to his master who said to
him What said Elisha to thee And he answered He told me that thou
shouldest surely recover

815 And it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth
and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died
and Hazael reigned in his stead

816 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat
king of Judah began to reign

817 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned eight years in Jerusalem

818 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house
of Ahab for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the
sight of the LORD

819 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servants
sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his
children

820 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and made
a king over themselves

821 So Joram went over to Zair and all the chariots with him and he
rose by night and smote the Edomites which compassed him about and
the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents
