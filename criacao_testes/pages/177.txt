No Sansa blurted He wouldn’t do that He wouldn’t

The queen picked up a letter The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood but the broken seal was her father’s the direwolf stamped in pale wax We found this on the captain of your household guard Sansa It is a letter to my late husband’s brother Stannis inviting him to take the crown

Please Your Grace there’s been a mistake Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint Please send for my father he’ll tell you he would never write such a letter the king was his friend

Robert thought so said the queen This betrayal would have broken his heart The gods are kind that he did not live to see it She sighed Sansa sweetling you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in You are innocent of any wrong we all know that and yet you are the daughter of a traitor How can I allow you to marry my son

But I love him Sansa wailed confused and frightened What did they mean to do to her What had they done to her father It was not supposed to happen this way She had to wed Joffrey they were betrothed he was promised to her she had even dreamed about it It wasn’t fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done

How well I know that child Cersei said her voice so kind and sweet Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father’s plan to send you away from us if not for love

It was for love Sansa said in a rush Father wouldn’t even give me leave to say farewell She was the good girl the obedient girl but she had felt as wicked as Arya that morning sneaking away from Septa Mordane defying her lord father She had never done anything so willful before and she would never have done it then if she hadn’t loved Joffrey as much as she did He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight even though it was Joff I wanted I told him but he wouldn’t listen The king had been her last hope The king could command Father to let her stay in King’s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey Sansa knew he could but the king had always frightened her He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not and he would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard if they even let her see him So she went to the queen instead and poured out her heart and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly… only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast and posted guards and a few hours later the fighting had begun outside Please she finished you have to let me marry Joffrey I’ll be ever so good a wife to him you’ll see I’ll be a queen just like you I promise

Queen Cersei looked to the others My lords of the council what do you say to her plea

The poor child murmured Varys A love so true and innocent Your Grace it would be cruel to deny it… and yet what can we do Her father stands condemned His soft hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress

A child born of traitor’s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her said Grand Maester Pycelle She is a sweet thing now but in ten years who can say what treasons she may hatch

No Sansa said horrified I’m not I’d never… I wouldn’t betray Joffrey I love him I swear it I do

Oh so poignant said Varys And yet it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths

She reminds me of the mother not the father Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly Look at her The hair the eyes She is the very image of Cat at the same age

The queen looked at her troubled and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes Child she said if I could truly believe that you were not like your father why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey I know he loves you with all his heart She sighed And yet I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it The blood will tell I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son

I’m not like Arya Sansa blurted She has the traitor’s blood not me I’m good ask Septa Mordane she’ll tell you I only want to be Joffrey’s loyal and loving wife

She felt the weight of Cersei’s eyes as the queen studied her face I believe you mean it child She turned to face the others My lords it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest

Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard his wide brow furrowed in thought Lord Eddard has three sons

Mere boys Lord Petyr said with a shrug I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys

The queen took Sansa’s hand in both of hers Child do you know your letters

Sansa nodded nervously She could read and write better than any of her brothers although she was hopeless at sums

I am pleased to hear that Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still…

What do you want me to do

You must write your lady mother and your brother the eldest… what is his name

Robb Sansa said

The word of your lord father’s treason will no doubt reach them soon Better that it should come from you You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king

Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking But he never… I don’t… Your Grace I wouldn’t know what to say…

The queen patted her hand We will tell you what to write child The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king’s peace
