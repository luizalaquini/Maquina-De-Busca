Tucker Bates 1978

This is of
course a much more difficult problem than pitch estimation for
speech where the range is typically 3 octaves
In fact for speech the feature
detectors are usually preceded by
a low-pass filter to attenuate the myriad
of peaks
caused by higher formants and this
is inappropriate for
musical applications
pp
There is evidence which shows that additional features can
assist with pitch identification  The above features are all
based upon the signal amplitude and could be described as
ul
secondary
features derived from a single
ul
primary
feature  Other primary features can easily be defined
Tucker and Bates 1978 used a centre-clipped waveform and considered only
the peaks rising above the central region

Tucker Bates 1978

They defined two
further primary features in addition to the peak amplitude  the
ul
time width
of a peak period for which it is
outside the clipping level and its
ul
energy
again outside the clipping level  The primary
features are shown in Figure 417
FC Figure 417
Secondary features are
defined based on these three primary ones and pitch estimates
are made for each one  A further innovation was to combine the
individual estimates on a way which is based upon
autocorrelation analysis reducing to some degree the
ul
ad-hocery
of the pitch detection process

There are a lot of books on digital signal analysis although in general
I find them rather turgid and difficult to read

This is a remarkable collection of tried and tested Fortran programs
for digital signal analysis
They are all available from the IEEE in machine-readable form on magnetic
tape
Included are programs for digital filter design discrete Fourier transformation
and cepstral analysis as well as others like linear predictive analysis
see Chapter 6
Each program is accompanied by a concise well-written description of how
it works with references to the relevant literature
