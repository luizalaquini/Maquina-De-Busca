The queen’s orders are to raise the bridge at night Ser Meryn had always been Cersei’s creature

The queen’s asleep and I have business with my father

There was magic in the name of Lord Tywin Lannister Grumbling Ser Meryn Trant gave the command and the drawbridge was lowered A second Kingsguard knight stood sentry across the moat Ser Osmund Kettleblack managed a smile when he saw Tyrion waddling toward him Feeling stronger m’lord

Much When’s the next battle I can scarcely wait

When Pod and he reached the serpentine steps however Tyrion could only gape at them in dismay I will never climb those by myself he confessed to himself Swallowing his dignity he asked Bronn to carry him hoping against hope that at this hour there would be no one to see and smile no one to tell the tale of the dwarf being carried up the steps like a babe in arms

The outer ward was crowded with tents and pavilions dozens of them Tyrell men Podrick Payne explained as they threaded their way through a maze of silk and canvas Lord Rowan’s too and Lord Redwyne’s There wasn’t room enough for all In the castle I mean Some took rooms Rooms in the city In inns and all They’re here for the wedding The king’s wedding King Joffrey’s Will you be strong enough to attend my lord

Ravening weasels could not keep me away There was this to be said for weddings over battles at least it was less likely that someone would cut off your nose

Lights still burned dimly behind shuttered windows in the Tower of the Hand The men on the door wore the crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms of his father’s household guard Tyrion knew them both and they admitted him on sight… though neither could bear to look long at his face he noted

Within they came upon Ser Addam Marbrand descending the turnpike stair in the ornate black breastplate and cloth-of-gold cloak of an officer in the City Watch My lord he said how good to see you on your feet I’d heard—

—rumors of a small grave being dug Me too Under the circumstances it seemed best to get up I hear you’re commander of the City Watch Shall I offer congratulations or condolences

Both I fear Ser Addam smiled Death and desertion have left me with some forty-four hundred Only the gods and Littlefinger know how we are to go on paying wages for so many but your sister forbids me to dismiss any

Still anxious Cersei The battle’s done the gold cloaks won’t help you now Do you come from my father he asked

Aye I fear I did not leave him in the best of moods Lord Tywin feels forty-four hundred guardsmen more than sufficient to find one lost squire but your cousin Tyrek remains missing

Tyrek was the son of his late Uncle Tygett a boy of thirteen He had vanished in the riot not long after wedding the Lady Ermesande a suckling babe who happened to be the last surviving heir of House Hayford And likely the first bride in the history of the Seven Kingdoms to be widowed before she was weaned I couldn’t find him either confessed Tyrion

He’s feeding worms said Bronn with his usual tact Ironhand looked for him and the eunuch rattled a nice fat purse They had no more luck than we did Give it up ser

Ser Addam gazed at the sellsword with distaste Lord Tywin is stubborn where his blood is concerned He will have the lad alive or dead and I mean to oblige him He looked back to Tyrion You will find your father in his solar

My solar thought Tyrion I believe I know the way

The way was up more steps but this time he climbed under his own power with one hand on Pod’s shoulder Bronn opened the door for him Lord Tywin Lannister was seated beneath the window writing by the glow of an oil lamp He raised his eyes at the sound of the latch Tyrion Calmly he laid his quill aside

I’m pleased you remember me my lord Tyrion released his grip on Pod leaned his weight on the stick and waddled closer Something is wrong he knew at once

Ser Bronn Lord Tywin said Podrick Perhaps you had best wait without until we are done

The look Bronn gave the Hand was little less than insolent nonetheless he bowed and withdrew with Pod on his heels The heavy door swung shut behind them and Tyrion Lannister was alone with his father Even with the windows of the solar shuttered against the night the chill in the room was palpable What sort of lies has Cersei been telling him

The Lord of Casterly Rock was as lean as a man twenty years younger even handsome in his austere way Stiff blond whiskers covered his cheeks framing a stern face a bald head a hard mouth About his throat he wore a chain of golden hands the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next That’s a handsome chain Tyrion said Though it looked better on me

Lord Tywin ignored the sally You had best be seated Is it wise for you to be out of your sickbed

I am sick of my sickbed Tyrion knew how much his father despised weakness He claimed the nearest chair Such pleasant chambers you have Would you believe it while I was dying someone moved me to a dark little cell in Maegor’s

The Red Keep is overcrowded with wedding guests Once they depart we will find you more suitable accommodations

I rather liked these accommodations Have you set a date for this great wedding

Joffrey and Margaery shall marry on the first day of the new year which as it happens is also the first day of the new century The ceremony will herald the dawn of a new era

A new Lannister era thought Tyrion Oh bother I fear I’ve made other plans for that day

Did you come here just to complain of your bedchamber and make your lame japes I have important letters to finish

Important letters To be sure

Some battles are won with swords and spears others with quills and ravens Spare me these coy reproaches Tyrion I visited your sickbed as often as Maester Ballabar would allow it when you seemed like to die He steepled his fingers under his chin Why did you dismiss Ballabar

Tyrion shrugged Maester Frenken is not so determined to keep me insensate

Ballabar came to the city in Lord Redwyne’s retinue A gifted healer it’s said It was kind of Cersei to ask him to look after you She feared for your life

Feared that I might keep it you mean Doubtless that’s why she’s never once left my bedside

Don’t be impertinent Cersei has a royal wedding to plan I am waging a war and you have been out of danger for at least a fortnight Lord Tywin studied his son’s disfigured face his pale green eyes unflinching Though the wound is ghastly enough I’ll grant you What madness possessed you

The foe was at the gates with a battering ram If Jaime had led the sortie you’d call it valor

Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle I trust you killed the man who cut you

Oh the wretch is dead enough Though it had been Podrick Payne who’d killed Ser Mandon shoving him into the river to drown beneath the weight of his armor A dead enemy is a joy forever Tyrion said blithely though Ser Mandon was not his true enemy The man had no reason to want him dead He was only a catspaw and I believe I know the cat She told him to make certain I did not survive the battle But without proof Lord Tywin would never listen to such a charge Why are you here in the city Father he asked Shouldn’t you be off fighting Lord Stannis or Robb Stark or someone And the sooner the better

Until Lord Redwyne brings his fleet up we lack the ships to assail Dragonstone It makes no matter Stannis Baratheon’s sun set on the Blackwater As for Stark the boy is still in the west but a large force of northmen under Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are descending toward Duskendale I’ve sent Lord Tarly to meet them while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off their retreat Tallhart and Glover will be caught between them with a third of Stark’s strength

Duskendale There was nothing at Duskendale worth such a risk Had the Young Wolf finally blundered

It’s nothing you need trouble yourself with Your face is pale as death and there’s blood seeping through your dressings Say what you want and take yourself back to bed

What I want… His throat felt raw and tight What did he want More than you can ever give me Father Pod tells me that Littlefinger’s been made Lord of Harrenhal

An empty title so long as Roose Bolton holds the castle for Robb Stark yet Lord Baelish was desirous of the honor He did us good service in the matter of the Tyrell marriage A Lannister pays his debts

The Tyrell marriage had been Tyrion’s notion in point of fact but it would seem churlish to try to claim that now That title may not be as empty as you think he warned Littlefinger does nothing without good reason But be that as it may You said something about paying debts I believe

And you want your own reward is that it Very well What is it you would have of me Lands castle some office

A little bloody gratitude would make a nice start

Lord Tywin stared at him unblinking Mummers and monkeys require applause So did Aerys for that matter You did as you were commanded and I am sure it was to the best of your ability No one denies the part you played

The part I played What nostrils Tyrion had left must surely have flared I saved your bloody city it seems to me

Most people seem to feel that it was my attack on Lord Stannis’s flank that turned the tide of battle Lords Tyrell Rowan Redwyne and Tarly fought nobly as well and I’m told it was your sister Cersei who set the pyromancers to making the wildfire that destroyed the Baratheon fleet

While all I did was get my nosehairs trimmed is that it Tyrion could not keep the bitterness out of his voice
