1822 But if ye say unto me We trust in the LORD our God is not that
he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away and
hath said to Judah and Jerusalem Ye shall worship before this altar
in Jerusalem  1823 Now therefore I pray thee give pledges to my
lord the king of Assyria and I will deliver thee two thousand horses
if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them

1824 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my masters servants and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots
and for horsemen  1825 Am I now come up without the LORD against
this place to destroy it  The LORD said to me Go up against this
land and destroy it

1826 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah unto
Rabshakeh Speak I pray thee to thy servants in the Syrian language
for we understand it and talk not with us in the Jews language in
the ears of the people that are on the wall

1827 But Rabshakeh said unto them Hath my master sent me to thy
master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the
men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink
their own piss with you  1828 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a
loud voice in the Jews language and spake saying Hear the word of
the great king the king of Assyria 1829 Thus saith the king Let
not Hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out
of his hand 1830 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD
saying The LORD will surely deliver us and this city shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria

1831 Hearken not to Hezekiah for thus saith the king of Assyria
Make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then
eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and
drink ye every one the waters of his cistern 1832 Until I come and
take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a
land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye
may live and not die and hearken not unto Hezekiah when he
persuadeth you saying The LORD will deliver us

1833 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
out of the hand of the king of Assyria  1834 Where are the gods of
Hamath and of Arpad where are the gods of Sepharvaim Hena and
Ivah have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand  1835 Who are
they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their
country out of mine hand that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out
of mine hand  1836 But the people held their peace and answered him
not a word for the kings commandment was saying Answer him not

1837 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah which was over the
household and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the
recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words
of Rabshakeh

191 And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it that he rent
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the
house of the LORD

192 And he sent Eliakim which was over the household and Shebna the
scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz

193 And they said unto him Thus saith Hezekiah This day is a day of
trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth

194 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh
whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living
God and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left

195 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah

196 And Isaiah said unto them Thus shall ye say to your master Thus
saith the LORD Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with
which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me

197 Behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and shall return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the
sword in his own land

198 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish

199 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia Behold he is
come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto
Hezekiah saying 1910 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah
saying Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying
Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria

1911 Behold thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
1912 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of
Eden which were in Thelasar  1913 Where is the king of Hamath and
the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim of Hena
and Ivah  1914 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up into the house of the
LORD and spread it before the LORD

1915 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said O LORD God of
Israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the God even
