 -- Consider if I cannot promise soon
But soon is perhaps never
O no it is not I mean soon Christmas well
say
Christmas He said nothing further till he
added  Well Ill say no more to you about it till that
time
Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind
which showed how entirely the soul is the slave of the
body the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon
the tangible flesh and blood It is hardly too much to
say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than her
own will not only into the act of promising upon this
singularly remote and vague matter but into the emo+
tion of fancying that she ought to promise When the
weeks intervening between the night of this conversa+

tion and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish
her anxiety and perplexity increased
One day she was led by an accident into an oddly
confidential dialogue with Gabriel about her difficulty
It afforded her a little relief -- of a dull and cheerless
kind They were auditing accounts and something
occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak
to say speaking of Boldwood  Hell never forget you
maam never
Then out came her trouble before she was aware 
and she told him how she had again got into the toils
what Boldwood had asked her and how he was ex+
pecting her assent The most mournful reason of all
for my agreeing to it she said sadly and the true
reason why I think to do so for good or for evil is this
 -- it is a thing I have not breathed to a living soul as
yet-i believe that if I dont give my word hell go out
of his mind
Really do ye said Gabriel gravely
I believe this she continued with reckless frank+
ness and Heaven knows I say it in a spirit the very
reverse of vain for I am grieved and troubled to my
soul about it-i believe I hold that mans future in my
hand His career depends entirely upon my treatment
of him O Gabriel I tremble at my responsibility for
it is terrible
Well I think this much maam as I told you years
ago said Oak that his life is a total blank whenever
he isnt hoping for ee but I cant suppose-i hope
that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy
His natural manner has always been dark and strange
you know But since the case is so sad and oddiike
why dont ye give the conditional promise I think I
would
But is it right Some rash acts of my past life
have taught me that a watched woman must have very
much circumspection to retain only a very little credit
and I do want and long to be discreet in this And
six years -- why we may all be in our graves by that

time even if Mr Troy does not come back again which
he may not impossibly do Such thoughts give a sort
of absurdity to the scheme Now isnt it preposterous

Gabriel However he came to dream of it I cannot think
But is it wrong You know -- you are older than I
Eight years older maam
Yes eight years -- and is it wrong
Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a
man and woman to make  I dont see anything really
wrong about it said Oak slowly In fact the very
thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en
under any condition that is your not caring about him
 -- for I may suppose --  -- 
Yes you may suppose that love is wanting she
said shortly Love is an utterly bygone sorry worn+
out miserable thing with me -- for him or any one else
Well your want of love seems to me the one thing
that takes away harm from such an agreement with him
If wild heat had to do wi it making ye long to over+
come the awkwardness about your husbands vanishing
it mid be wrong  but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige
a man seems different somehow The real sin maam
in my mind lies in thinking of ever wedding wi a man
you dont love honest and true
That Im willing to pay the penalty of said Bath+
sheba firmly  You know Gabriel this is what I can+
not get off my conscience -- that I once seriously injured
him in sheer idleness If I had never played a trick
upon him he would never have wanted to marry me
O if I could only pay some heavy damages in money
to him for the harm I did and so get the sin off my
soul that way Well theres the debt which can
only be discharged in one way and I believe I am
bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power without
any consideration of my own future at all When a
rake gambles away his expectations the fact that it is
an inconvenient debt doesnt make him the less liable
Ive been a rake and the single point I ask you is con+
sidering that my own scruples and the fact that in the
eye of the law my husband is only missing will keep
any man from marrying me until seven years have
passed -- am I free to entertain such an idea even
