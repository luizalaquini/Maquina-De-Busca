his back Ultimately he was reduced welinigh to a
homogeneous sop and the dyes of his clothes trickled
down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder
The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo+
sphere in liquid spines unbroken in continuity between
their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him
Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before
this time he had been fighting against fire in the same
spot as desperately as he was fighting against water
now -- and for a futile love of the same woman As for
her --  --  But Oak was generous and true and dis+
missed his reflections
It was about seven oclock in the dark leaden
morning when Gabriel came down from the last stack
and thankfully exclaimed It is done   He was
P 314
drenched weary and sad and yet not so sad as drenched
and weary for he was cheered by a sense of success in
a good cause
Faint sounds came from the barn and he looked
that way Figures stepped singly and in pairs through
the doors -- all walking awkwardly and abashed save
the foremost who wore a red jacket and advanced
with his hands in his pockets whistling The others
shambled after with a conscience-stricken air  the whole
procession was not unlike Flaxmans group of the suitors
tottering on towards the infernal regions under the
conduct of Mercury The gnarled shapes passed into
the village Troy their leader entering the farmhouse
Not a single one of them had turned his face to the
ricks or apparently bestowed one thought upon their
condition
Soon Oak too went homeward by a different route
from theirs In front of him against the wet glazed
surface of the lane he saw a person walking yet more
slowly than himself under an umbrella The man
turned and plainly started he was Boldwood
 How are you this morning sir  said Oak
Yes it is a wet day -- Oh I am well very well I
thank you  quite well
I am glad to hear it sir
Boldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees
 You look tired and ill Oak he said then desultorily
regarding his companion
 I am tired You look strangely altered sir
I Not a bit of it  I am well enough What put
that into your head 
I thought you didnt look quite so topping as you
used to that was all
 Indeed then you are mistaken said Boldwood
shortly Nothing hurts me My constitution is an
iron one
Ive been working hard to get our ricks covered
and was barely in time Never had such a struggle in
my life Yours of course are safe sir
 O yes Boldwood added after an interval of
silence   What did you ask Oak  
 Your ricks are all covered before this time  
P 315
No
 At any rate the large ones upon the stone staddles 
 They are not
Them under the hedge 
 No I forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it
 Nor the little one by the stile 
Nor the little one by the stile I overlooked the
ricks this year
Then not a tenth of your corn will come to measure
sir
 Possibly not
 Overlooked them repeated Gabriel slowly to him+
self It is difficult to describe the intensely dramatic
effect that announcement had upon Oak at such a
moment All the night he had been feeling that the
neglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and
isolated -- the only instance of the kind within the circuit
of the county Yet at this very time within the same
parish a greater waste had been going on uncomplained
of and disregarded A few months earlier Boldwoods
forgetting his husbandry would have been as preposter+
ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he was in a ship Oak
was just thinking that whatever he himself might have
suffered from Bathshebas marriage here was a man
who had suffered more when Boldwood spoke in a
changed voice -- that of one who yearned to make a
confidence and relieve his heart by an outpouring
Oak you know as well as I that things have gone
wrong with me lately I may as well own it I was
going to get a little settled in life but in some way my
plan has come to nothing
I thought my mistress would have married you
said Gabriel not knowing enough of the full depths of
Boldwoods love to keep silence on the farmers account
and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on
his own However it is so sometimes and nothing
happens that we expect he added with the repose of
a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub+
dued
I daresay I am a joke about the parish said Bold+
wood as if the subject came irresistibly to his tongue
