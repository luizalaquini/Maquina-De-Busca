However one excellent result of her general apathy
was the long-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff but
he having virtually exercised that function for a long
time already the change beyond the substantial in+
crease of wages it brought was little more than a
nominal one addressed to the outside world
Boldwood lived secluded and inactive Much of
his wheat and all his barley of that season had been
spoilt by the rain It sprouted grew into intricate
mats and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls
The strange neglect which had produced this ruin
and waste became the subject of whispered talk among
all the people round and it was elicited from one of
Boldwoods men that forgetfulness had nothing to do
with it for he had been reminded of the danger to
his corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors
dared to do The sight of the
P 391
pigs turning in disgust
from the rotten ears seemed to arouse Boldwood and
he one evening sent for Oak Whether it was sug+
gested by Bathshebas recent act of promotion or not
the farmer proposed at the interview that Gabriel
should undertake the superintendence of the Lower
Farm as well as of Bathshebas because of the necessity
Boldwood felt for such aid and the impossibility of
discovering a more trustworthy man Gabriels malig+
nant star was assuredly setting fast
Bathsheba when she learnt of this proposai-for
Oak was obliged to consult her -- at first languidly
objected She considered that the two farms together
were too extensive for the observation of one man
Boldwood who was apparently determined by personal
rather than commercial reasons suggested that Oak
should be furnished with a horse for his sole use
when the plan would present no difficulty the two
farms lying side by side Boldwood did not directly
communicate with her during these negotiations only
speaking to Oak who was the go-between throughout
All was harmoniously arranged at last and we now
see Oak mounted on a strong cob and daily trotting
the length breadth of about two thousand acres
in a cheerful spirit of surveillance as if the crops
belonged to him -- the actual mistress of the one-half
and the master of the other sitting in their respective
homes in gloomy and sad seclusion
Out of this there arose during the spring succeeding
a talk in the parish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his
nest fast
 Whatever dye think said Susan Tall  Gable Oak
is coming it quite the dand He now wears shining
boots with hardly a hob in em two or three times
a-week and a tall hat a-Sundays and a hardly knows
the name of smockfrock When I see people strut
enough to he cut up into bantam cocks I stand
dormant with wonder and says no more  
It was eventually known that Gabriel though paid
a fixed wage by Bathslieba independent of the fluctua+
tions of agricultural profits had made an engagement
with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a share
of the receipts -- a small share certainly yet it was
money of a higher quality than mere wages and
capable of expansion in a way that wages were not
P 392
Some were beginning to consider Oak a near man
for though his condition had thus far improved he
lived in no better style than hefore occupying the
same cottage paring his own potatoes mending his
stockings and sometimes even making his bed with
his own hands But as Oak was not only provokingly
indifferent to public opinion but a man who clung
persistently to old habits and usages simply because
they were old there was room for doubt as to his
motives
A great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood
whose unreasoning devotion to Bathsheba could only
be characterized as a fond madness which neither
time nor circumstance evil nor good report could
weaken or destroy This fevered hope had grown up
again like a grain of mustard-seed during the quiet
which followed the hasty conjecture that Troy was
drowned He nourished it fearfully and almost
shunned the contemplation of it in earnest lest facts
should reveal the wildness of the dream Bathsheba
having at last been persuaded to wear mourning her
appearance as she entered the church in that guise
was in itself a weekly addition to his faith that a
time was coming -- very far off perhaps yet surely
nearing -- when his waiting on events should have
its reward How long he might have to wait he had
not yet closely considered what he would try to
recognize was that the severe schooling she had been
subjected to had made Bathsheba much more con+
siderate than she had formerly been of the feelings of
others and he trusted that should she be willing at
any time in the future to marry any man at all that
man would be himself There was a substratum of
good feeling in her her self-reproach for the injury
she had thoughtlessly done him might be depended
upon now to a much greater extent than before her
