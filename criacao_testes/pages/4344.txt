If information is stored about phonological units of
speech em phonemes em the difficult task of phonological-to-phonetic
conversion must necessarily be performed automatically
Allophones are created by altering the transitions between units
and to a lesser extent by modifying the central parts of the units
themselves
The rules for making transitions will have a big effect on the
quality of the resulting speech
Instead of trying to perform this task automatically by a computer
program the allophones themselves could be stored  This will
ease the job of generating transitions between segments but
will certainly not eliminate it
The total number of allophones will depend on the narrowness of the
transcription system  60-80 is typical and it is unlikely to exceed
one or two hundred  In any case there will not be a storage problem
However now the burden of producing an allophonic transcription
has been transferred to the person who codes the utterance prior
to synthesizing it  If he is skilful and patient he should
be able to coax the system into producing fairly understandable
speech but the effort required for this on a per-utterance basis
should not be underestimated

FG Table 71  Some issues relevant to choice of basic unit
pp
Table 71 summarizes in broad brush-strokes the issues which relate to the
choice of basic unit for concatenation
The sections which follow provide more detail about the different
methods of joining segments of speech together
Only segmental aspects are considered for the important problems of
prosody will be treated in the next chapter
All of the methods rely to some extent on the acoustic properties of speech
and as smaller basic units are considered the role of speech acoustics
becomes more important
It is impossible in a book like this to give a detailed account of acoustic
phonetics for it would take several volumes
What I aim to do in the following pages is to highlight some salient features
which are relevant to segment concatenation without attempting to be
complete
sh 71  Word concatenation
pp
For general speech output word concatenation is an inherently limited
technique because of the large number of phonetically different words
Despite this fact it is at present the most widely-used synthesis
method and is likely to remain so for several years
We have seen that the primary problems are word-to-word
coarticulation and prosody and both can be overcome at least to a useful
approximation by coding the words in source-filter form
rh Time-domain techniques
Nevertheless a surprising number of applications simply store
the time waveform coded usually by one of the techniques described in
Chapter 3
From an implementation point of view there are many advantages to this
Speech quality can easily be controlled by selecting a suitable sampling
rate and coding scheme
A natural-sounding voice is guaranteed male or female as desired
The equipment required is minimal em a digital-to-analogue
converter and post-sampling filter will do for synthesis if
PCM coding is used and
DPCM ADPCM and delta modulation decoders are not much more complicated
