This one does not recall your worship Blue Toad perhaps Or Blue Worm

Tell her all their names are such Kraznys commanded the girl It reminds them that by themselves they are vermin The name disks are thrown in an empty cask at duty’s end and each dawn plucked up again at random

More madness said Arstan when he heard How can any man possibly remember a new name every day

Those who cannot are culled in training along with those who cannot run all day in full pack scale a mountain in the black of night walk across a bed of coals or slay an infant

Dany’s mouth surely twisted at that Did he see or is he blind as well as cruel She turned away quickly trying to keep her face a mask until she heard the translation Only then did she allow herself to say Whose infants do they slay

To win his spiked cap an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find some wailing newborn and kill it before its mother’s eyes In this way we make certain that there is no weakness left in them

She was feeling faint The heat she tried to tell herself You take a babe from its mother’s arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin

When the translation was made for him Kraznys mo Nakloz laughed aloud What a soft mewling fool this one is Tell the whore of Westeros that the mark is for the child’s owner not the mother The Unsullied are not permitted to steal He tapped his whip against his leg Tell her that few ever fail that test The dogs are harder for them it must be said We give each boy a puppy on the day that he is cut At the end of the first year he is required to strangle it Any who cannot are killed and fed to the surviving dogs It makes for a good strong lesson we find

Arstan Whitebeard tapped the end of his staff on the bricks as he listened to that Tap tap tap Slow and steady Tap tap tap Dany saw him turn his eyes away as if he could not bear to look at Kraznys any longer

The Good Master has said that these eunuchs cannot be tempted with coin or flesh Dany told the girl but if some enemy of mine should offer them freedom for betraying me…

They would kill him out of hand and bring her his head tell her that the slaver answered Other slaves may steal and hoard up silver in hopes of buying freedom but an Unsullied would not take it if the little mare offered it as a gift They have no life outside their duty They are soldiers and that is all

It is soldiers I need Dany admitted

Tell her it is well she came to Astapor then Ask her how large an army she wishes to buy

How many Unsullied do you have to sell

Eight thousand fully trained and available at present We sell them only by the unit she should know By the thousand or the century Once we sold by the ten as household guards but that proved unsound Ten is too few They mingle with other slaves even freemen and forget who and what they are Kraznys waited for that to be rendered in the Common Tongue and then continued This beggar queen must understand such wonders do not come cheaply In Yunkai and Meereen slave swordsmen can be had for less than the price of their swords but Unsullied are the finest foot in all the world and each represents many years of training Tell her they are like Valyrian steel folded over and over and hammered for years on end until they are stronger and more resilient than any metal on earth

I know of Valyrian steel said Dany Ask the Good Master if the Unsullied have their own officers

You must set your own officers over them We train them to obey not to think If it is wits she wants let her buy scribes

And their gear

Sword shield spear sandals and quilted tunic are included said Kraznys And the spiked caps to be sure They will wear such armor as you wish but you must provide it

Dany could think of no other questions She looked at Arstan You have lived long in the world Whitebeard Now that you have seen them what do you say

I say no Your Grace the old man answered at once

Why she asked Speak freely Dany thought she knew what he would say but she wanted the slave girl to hear so Kraznys mo Nakloz might hear later

My queen said Arstan there have been no slaves in the Seven Kingdoms for thousands of years The old gods and the new alike hold slavery to be an abomination Evil If you should land in Westeros at the head of a slave army many good men will oppose you for no other reason than that You will do great harm to your cause and to the honor of your House

Yet I must have some army Dany said The boy Joffrey will not give me the Iron Throne for asking politely

When the day comes that you raise your banners half of Westeros will be with you Whitebeard promised Your brother Rhaegar is still remembered with great love

And my father Dany said

The old man hesitated before saying King Aerys is also remembered He gave the realm many years of peace Your Grace you have no need of slaves Magister Illyrio can keep you safe while your dragons grow and send secret envoys across the narrow sea on your behalf to sound out the high lords for your cause

Those same high lords who abandoned my father to the Kingslayer and bent the knee to Robert the Usurper

Even those who bent their knees may yearn in their hearts for the return of the dragons

May said Dany That was such a slippery word may In any language She turned back to Kraznys mo Nakloz and his slave girl I must consider carefully

The slaver shrugged Tell her to consider quickly There are many other buyers Only three days past I showed these same Unsullied to a corsair king who hopes to buy them all

The corsair wanted only a hundred your worship Dany heard the slave girl say

He poked her with the end of the whip Corsairs are all liars He’ll buy them all Tell her that girl

Dany knew she would take more than a hundred if she took any at all Remind your Good Master of who I am Remind him that I am Daenerys Stormborn Mother of Dragons the Unburnt trueborn queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros My blood is the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and of old Valyria before him

Yet her words did not move the plump perfumed slaver even when rendered in his own ugly tongue Old Ghis ruled an empire when the Valyrians were still fucking sheep he growled at the poor little scribe and we are the sons of the harpy He gave a shrug My tongue is wasted wagging at women East or west it makes no matter they cannot decide until they have been pampered and flattered and stuffed with sweetmeats Well if this is my fate so be it Tell the whore that if she requires a guide to our sweet city Kraznys mo Nakloz will gladly serve her… and service her as well if she is more woman than she looks

Good Master Kraznys would be most pleased to show you Astapor while you ponder Your Grace the translator said

I will feed her jellied dog brains and a fine rich stew of red octopus and unborn puppy He wiped his lips

Many delicious dishes can be had here he says

Tell her how pretty the pyramids are at night the slaver growled Tell her I will lick honey off her breasts or allow her to lick honey off mine if she prefers

Astapor is most beautiful at dusk Your Grace said the slave girl The Good Masters light silk lanterns on every terrace so all the pyramids glow with colored lights Pleasure barges ply the Worm playing soft music and calling at the little islands for food and wine and other delights

Ask her if she wishes to view our fighting pits Kraznys added Douquor’s Pit has a fine folly scheduled for the evening A bear and three small boys One boy will be rolled in honey one in blood and one in rotting fish and she may wager on which the bear will eat first

Tap tap tap Dany heard Arstan Whitebeard’s face was still but his staff beat out his rage Tap tap tap She made herself smile I have my own bear on Balerion she told the translator and he may well eat me if I do not return to him

See said Kraznys when her words were translated It is not the woman who decides it is this man she runs to As ever

Thank the Good Master for his patient kindness Dany said and tell him that I will think on all I learned here She gave her arm to Arstan Whitebeard to lead her back across the plaza to her litter Aggo and Jhogo fell in to either side of them walking with the bowlegged swagger all the horselords affected when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals

Dany climbed into her litter frowning and beckoned Arstan to climb in beside her A man as old as him should not be walking in such heat She did not close the curtains as they got under way With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red brick every stray breeze was to be cherished even if it did come with a swirl of fine red dust Besides I need to see

Astapor was a queer city even to the eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb of the World beneath the Mother of Mountains All the streets were made of the same red brick that had paved the plaza So too were the stepped pyramids the deep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats the sulfurous fountains and gloomy wine caves and the ancient walls that encircled them So many bricks she thought and so old and crumbling Their fine red dust was everywhere dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces the brick dust stung the eyes worse than sand

Make way Jhogo shouted as he rode before her litter Make way for the Mother of Dragons But when he uncoiled the great silverhandled whip that Dany had given him and made to crack it in the air she leaned out and told him nay Not in this place blood of my blood she said in his own tongue These bricks have heard too much of the sound of whips

The streets had been largely deserted when they had set out from the port that morning and scarcely seemed more crowded now An elephant lumbered past with a latticework litter on its back A naked boy with peeling skin sat in a dry brick gutter picking his nose and staring sullenly at some ants in the street He lifted his head at the sound of hooves and gaped as a column of mounted guards trotted by in a cloud of red dust and brittle laughter The copper disks sewn to their cloaks of yellow silk glittered like so many suns but their tunics were embroidered linen and below the waist they wore sandals and pleated linen skirts Bareheaded each man had teased and oiled and twisted his stiff red-black hair into some fantastic shape horns and wings and blades and even grasping hands so they looked like some troupe of demons escaped from the seventh hell The naked boy watched them for a bit along with Dany but soon enough they were gone and he went back to his ants and a knuckle up his nose

An old city this she reflected but not so populous as it was in its glory nor near so crowded as Qarth or Pentos or Lys

Her litter came to a sudden halt at the cross street to allow a coffle of slaves to shuffle across her path urged along by the crack of an overseer’s lash These were no Unsullied Dany noted but a more common sort of men with pale brown skins and black hair There were women among them but no children All were naked Two Astapori rode behind them on white asses a man in a red silk tokar and a veiled woman in sheer blue linen decorated with flakes of lapis lazuli In her red-black hair she wore an ivory comb The man laughed as he whispered to her paying no more mind to Dany than to his slaves nor the overseer with his twisted five-thonged lash a squat broad Dothraki who had the harpy and chains tattooed proudly across his muscular chest
