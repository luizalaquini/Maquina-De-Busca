214 When he arose he took the young child and his mother by night
and departed into Egypt 215 And was there until the death of Herod
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet saying Out of Egypt have I called my son

216 Then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was
exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were
in Bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and
under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the
wise men

217 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet
saying 218 In Rama was there a voice heard lamentation and
weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and
would not be comforted because they are not

219 But when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeareth
in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 220 Saying Arise and take the young
child and his mother and go into the land of Israel for they are
dead which sought the young childs life

221 And he arose and took the young child and his mother and came
into the land of Israel

222 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
of his father Herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding
being warned of God in a dream he turned aside into the parts of
Galilee 223 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets He shall be
called a Nazarene

31 In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness
of Judaea 32 And saying Repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand

33 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias saying
The voice of one crying in the wilderness Prepare ye the way of the
Lord make his paths straight

34 And the same John had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern
girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey

35 Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the region
round about Jordan 36 And were baptized of him in Jordan confessing
their sins

37 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
baptism he said unto them O generation of vipers who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come  38 Bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance 39 And think not to say within yourselves We
have Abraham to our father for I say unto you that God is able of
these stones to raise up children unto Abraham

310 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down
and cast into the fire

311 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that
cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to
bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire 312
Whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and
gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire

313 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
baptized of him

314 But John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee
and comest thou to me  315 And Jesus answering said unto him Suffer
it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
Then he suffered him

316 And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the
water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him 317 And
lo a voice from heaven saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased

41 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted of the devil

42 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was
afterward an hungred

43 And when the tempter came to him he said If thou be the Son of
God command that these stones be made bread

44 But he answered and said It is written Man shall not live by
bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God

45 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him
on a pinnacle of the temple 46 And saith unto him If thou be the
Son of God cast thyself down for it is written He shall give his
angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee
up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone

47 Jesus said unto him It is written again Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God
