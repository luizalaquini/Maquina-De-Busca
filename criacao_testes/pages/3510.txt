Ah poor sad thing sighed Varys She is only a babe my lords she does not know what she asks

Sansa had eyes only for Joffrey He must listen to me he must she thought The king shifted on his seat Let her speak he commanded I want to hear what she says

Thank you Your Grace Sansa smiled a shy secret smile just for him He was listening She knew he would

Treason is a noxious weed Pycelle declared solemnly It must be torn up root and stem and seed lest new traitors sprout from every roadside

Do you deny your father’s crime Lord Baelish asked

No my lords Sansa knew better than that I know he must be punished All I ask is mercy I know my lord father must regret what he did He was King Robert’s friend and he loved him you all know he loved him He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or… or somebody they must have lied otherwise…

King Joffrey leaned forward hands grasping the arms of the throne Broken sword points fanned out between his fingers He said I wasn’t the king Why did he say that

His leg was broken Sansa replied eagerly It hurt ever so much Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds Otherwise he would never have said it

Varys said A child’s faith… such sweet innocence… and yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes

Treason is treason Pycelle replied at once

Joffrey rocked restlessly on the throne Mother

Cersei Lannister considered Sansa thoughtfully If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime she said at last we would know he had repented his folly

Joffrey pushed himself to his feet Please Sansa thought please please be the king I know you are good and kind and noble please Do you have any more to say he asked her

Only… that as you love me you do me this kindness my prince Sansa said

King Joffrey looked her up and down Your sweet words have moved me he said gallantly nodding as if to say all would be well I shall do as you ask… but first your father has to confess He has to confess and say that I’m the king or there will be no mercy for him

He will Sansa said heart soaring Oh I know he will





EDDARD

The straw on the floor stank of urine There was no window no bed not even a slop bucket He remembered walls of pale red stone festooned with patches of nitre a grey door of splintered wood four inches thick and studded with iron He had seen them briefly a quick glimpse as they shoved him inside Once the door had slammed shut he had seen no more The dark was absolute He had as well been blind

Or dead Buried with his king Ah Robert he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone wall his leg throbbing with every motion He remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of Winterfell as the Kings of Winter looked on with cold stone eyes The king eats Robert had said and the Hand takes the shit How he had laughed Yet he had gotten it wrong The king dies Ned Stark thought and the Hand is buried

The dungeon was under the Red Keep deeper than he dared imagine He remembered the old stories about Maegor the Cruel who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle so they might never reveal its secrets

He damned them all Littlefinger Janos Slynt and his gold cloaks the queen the Kingslayer Pycelle and Varys and Ser Barristan even Lord Renly Robert’s own blood who had run when he was needed most Yet in the end he blamed himself Fool he cried to the darkness thrice-damned blind fool

Cersei Lannister’s face seemed to float before him in the darkness Her hair was full of sunlight but there was mockery in her smile When you play the game of thrones you win or you die she whispered Ned had played and lost and his men had paid the price of his folly with their life’s blood

When he thought of his daughters he would have wept gladly but the tears would not come Even now he was a Stark of Winterfell and his grief and his rage froze hard inside him

When he kept very still his leg did not hurt so much so he did his best to lie unmoving For how long he could not say There was no sun and no moon He could not see to mark the walls Ned closed his eyes and opened them it made no difference He slept and woke and slept again He did not know which was more painful the waking or the sleeping When he slept he dreamed dark disturbing dreams of blood and broken promises When he woke there was nothing to do but think and his waking thoughts were worse than nightmares The thought of Cat was as painful as a bed of nettles He wondered where she was what she was doing He wondered whether he would ever see her again

Hours turned to days or so it seemed He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg an itch beneath the plaster When he touched his thigh the flesh was hot to his fingers The only sound was his breathing After a time he began to talk aloud just to hear a voice He made plans to keep himself sane built castles of hope in the dark Robert’s brothers were out in the world raising armies at Dragonstone and Storm’s End Alyn and Harwin would return to King’s Landing with the rest of his household guard once they had dealt with Ser Gregor Catelyn would raise the north when the word reached her and the lords of river and mountain and Vale would join her

He found himself thinking of Robert more and more He saw the king as he had been in the flower of his youth tall and handsome his great antlered helm on his head his warhammer in hand sitting his horse like a horned god He heard his laughter in the dark saw his eyes blue and clear as mountain lakes Look at us Ned Robert said Gods how did we come to this You here and me killed by a pig We won a throne together…

I failed you Robert Ned thought He could not say the words I lied to you hid the truth I let them kill you

The king heard him You stiff-necked fool he muttered too proud to listen Can you eat pride Stark Will honor shield your children Cracks ran down his face fissures opening in the flesh and he reached up and ripped the mask away It was not Robert at all it was Littlefinger grinning mocking him When he opened his mouth to speak his lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing

Ned was half-asleep when the footsteps came down the hall At first he thought he dreamt them it had been so long since he had heard anything but the sound of his own voice Ned was feverish by then his leg a dull agony his lips parched and cracked When the heavy wooden door creaked open the sudden light was painful to his eyes

A gaoler thrust a jug at him The clay was cool and beaded with moisture Ned grasped it with both hands and gulped eagerly Water ran from his mouth and dripped down through his beard He drank until he thought he would be sick How long… he asked weakly when he could drink no more

The gaoler was a scarecrow of a man with a rat’s face and frayed beard clad in a mail shirt and a leather half cape No talking he said as he wrenched the jug from Ned’s hands

Please Ned said my daughters… The door crashed shut He blinked as the light vanished lowered his head to his chest and curled up on the straw It no longer stank of urine and shit It no longer smelled at all

He could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping The memory came creeping upon him in the darkness as vivid as a dream It was the year of false spring and he was eighteen again down from the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal He could see the deep green of the grass and smell the pollen on the wind Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine He remembered Brandon’s laughter and Robert’s berserk valor in the melee the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right He remembered Jaime Lannister a golden youth in scaled white armor kneeling on the grass in front of the king’s pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King Aerys Afterward Ser Oswell Whent helped Jaime to his feet and the White Bull himself Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders All six White Swords were there to welcome their newest brother

Yet when the jousting began the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen The crown prince wore the armor he would die in gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode and it seemed no lance could touch him Brandon fell to him and Bronze Yohn Royce and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning

Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion’s crown Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife the Dornish princess Elia Martell to lay the queen of beauty’s laurel in Lyanna’s lap He could see it still a crown of winter roses blue as frost

Ned Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown but beneath the pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden He felt them clawing at his skin sharp and cruel saw the slow trickle of blood run down his fingers and woke trembling in the dark

Promise me Ned his sister had whispered from her bed of blood She had loved the scent of winter roses

Gods save me Ned wept I am going mad

The gods did not deign to answer

Each time the turnkey brought him water he told himself another day had passed At first he would beg the man for some word of his daughters and the world beyond his cell Grunts and kicks were his only replies Later when the stomach cramps began he begged for food instead It made no matter he was not fed Perhaps the Lannisters meant for him to starve to death No he told himself If Cersei had wanted him dead he would have been cut down in the throne room with his men She wanted him alive Weak desperate yet alive Catelyn held her brother she dare not kill him or the Imp’s life would be forfeit as well

From outside his cell came the rattle of iron chains As the door creaked open Ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed himself toward the light The glare of a torch made him squint Food he croaked

Wine a voice answered It was not the rat-faced man this gaoler was stouter shorter though he wore the same leather half cape and spiked steel cap Drink Lord Eddard He thrust a wineskin into Ned’s hands

The voice was strangely familiar yet it took Ned Stark a moment to place it Varys he said groggily when it came He touched the man’s face I’m not… not dreaming this You’re here The eunuch’s plump cheeks were covered with a dark stubble of beard Ned felt the coarse hair with his fingers Varys had transformed himself into a grizzled turnkey reeking of sweat and sour wine How did you… what sort of magician are you

A thirsty one Varys said Drink my lord

Ned’s hands fumbled at the skin Is this the same poison they gave Robert

You wrong me Varys said sadly Truly no one loves a eunuch Give me the skin He drank a trickle of red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney but no more poisonous than most he concluded wiping his lips Here

Ned tried a swallow Dregs He felt as though he were about to bring the wine back up

All men must swallow the sour with the sweet High lords and eunuchs alike Your hour has come my lord
