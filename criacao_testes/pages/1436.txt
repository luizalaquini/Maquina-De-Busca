Drogon looped his neck around to nip at her hand His teeth were very sharp but he never broke her skin when they played like this Dany laughed and rolled him back and forth until he roared his tail lashing like a whip It is longer than it was she saw and tomorrow it will be longer still They grow quickly now and when they are grown I shall have my wings Mounted on a dragon she could lead her own men into battle as she had in Astapor but as yet they were still too small to bear her weight

A stillness settled over her camp when midnight came and went Dany remained in her pavilion with her maids while Arstan Whitebeard and Strong Belwas kept the guard The waiting is the hardest part To sit in her tent with idle hands while her battle was being fought without her made Dany feel half a child again

The hours crept by on turtle feet Even after Jhiqui rubbed the knots from her shoulders Dany was too restless for sleep Missandei offered to sing her a lullaby of the Peaceful People but Dany shook her head Bring me Arstan she said

When the old man came she was curled up inside her hrakkar pelt whose musty smell still reminded her of Drogo I cannot sleep when men are dying for me Whitebeard she said Tell me more of my brother Rhaegar if you would I liked the tale you told me on the ship of how he decided that he must be a warrior

Your Grace is kind to say so

Viserys said that our brother won many tourneys

Arstan bowed his white head respectfully It is not meet for me to deny His Grace’s words…

But said Dany sharply Tell me I command it

Prince Rhaegar’s prowess was unquestioned but he seldom entered the lists He never loved the song of swords the way that Robert did or Jaime Lannister It was something he had to do a task the world had set him He did it well for he did everything well That was his nature But he took no joy in it Men said that he loved his harp much better than his lance

He won some tourneys surely said Dany disappointed

When he was young His Grace rode brilliantly in a tourney at Storm’s End defeating Lord Steffon Baratheon Lord Jason Mallister the Red Viper of Dorne and a mystery knight who proved to be the infamous Simon Toyne chief of the kingswood outlaws He broke twelve lances against Ser Arthur Dayne that day

Was he the champion then

No Your Grace That honor went to another knight of the Kingsguard who unhorsed Prince Rhaegar in the final tilt

Dany did not want to hear about Rhaegar being unhorsed But what tourneys did my brother win

Your Grace The old man hesitated He won the greatest tourney of them all

Which was that Dany demanded

The tourney Lord Whent staged at Harrenhal beside the Gods Eye in the year of the false spring A notable event Besides the jousting there was a mêlée in the old style fought between seven teams of knights as well as archery and axe-throwing a horse race a tournament of singers a mummer show and many feasts and frolics Lord Whent was as open handed as he was rich The lavish purses he proclaimed drew hundreds of challengers Even your royal father came to Harrenhal when he had not left the Red Keep for long years The greatest lords and mightiest champions of the Seven Kingdoms rode in that tourney and the Prince of Dragonstone bested them all

But that was the tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty said Dany Princess Elia was there his wife and yet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl and later stole her away from her betrothed How could he do that Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill

It is not for such as me to say what might have been in your brother’s heart Your Grace The Princess Elia was a good and gracious lady though her health was ever delicate

Dany pulled the lion pelt tighter about her shoulders Viserys said once that it was my fault for being born too late She had denied it hotly she remembered going so far as to tell Viserys that it was his fault for not being born a girl He beat her cruelly for that insolence If I had been born more timely he said Rhaegar would have married me instead of Elia and it would all have come out different If Rhaegar had been happy in his wife he would not have needed the Stark girl

Perhaps so Your Grace Whitebeard paused a moment But I am not certain it was in Rhaegar to be happy

You make him sound so sour Dany protested

Not sour no but… there was a melancholy to Prince Rhaegar a sense… The old man hesitated again

Say it she urged A sense…

…of doom He was born in grief my queen and that shadow hung over him all his days

Viserys had spoken of Rhaegar’s birth only once Perhaps the tale saddened him too much It was the shadow of Summerhall that haunted him was it not

Yes And yet Summerhall was the place the prince loved best He would go there from time to time with only his harp for company Even the knights of the Kingsguard did not attend him there He liked to sleep in the ruined hall beneath the moon and stars and whenever he came back he would bring a song When you heard him play his high harp with the silver strings and sing of twilights and tears and the death of kings you could not but feel that he was singing of himself and those he loved

What of the Usurper Did he play sad songs as well

Arstan chuckled Robert Robert liked songs that made him laugh the bawdier the better He only sang when he was drunk and then it was like to be ‘A Cask of Ale’ or ‘Fifty-Four Tuns’ or ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ Robert was much—

As one her dragons lifted their heads and roared

Horses Dany leapt to her feet clutching the lion pelt Outside she heard Strong Belwas bellow something and then other voices and the sounds of many horses Irri go see who…

The tent flap pushed open and Ser Jorah Mormont entered He was dusty and spattered with blood but otherwise none the worse for battle The exile knight went to one knee before Dany and said Your Grace I bring you victory The Stormcrows turned their cloaks the slaves broke and the Second Sons were too drunk to fight just as you said Two hundred dead Yunkai’i for the most part Their slaves threw down their spears and ran and their sellswords yielded We have several thousand captives

Our own losses

A dozen If that many

Only then did she allow herself to smile Rise my good brave bear Was Grazdan taken Or the Titan’s Bastard

Grazdan went to Yunkai to deliver your terms Ser Jorah got to his feet Mero fled once he realized the Stormcrows had turned I have men hunting him He shouldn’t escape us long

Very well Dany said Sellsword or slave spare all those who will pledge me their faith If enough of the Second Sons will join us keep the company intact

The next day they marched the last three leagues to Yunkai The city was built of yellow bricks instead of red elsewise it was Astapor all over again with the same crumbling walls and high stepped pyramids and a great harpy mounted above its gates The wall and towers swarmed with crossbowmen and slingers Ser Jorah and Grey Worm deployed her men Irri and Jhiqui raised her pavilion and Dany sat down to wait

On the morning of the third day the city gates swung open and a line of slaves began to emerge Dany mounted her silver to greet them As they passed little Missandei told them that they owed their freedom to Daenerys Stormborn the Unburnt Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and Mother of Dragons

Mhysa a brown-skinned man shouted out at her He had a child on his shoulder a little girl and she screamed the same word in her thin voice Mhysa Mhysa

Dany looked at Missandei What are they shouting

It is Ghiscari the old pure tongue It means ‘Mother’

Dany felt a lightness in her chest I will never bear a living child she remembered Her hand trembled as she raised it Perhaps she smiled She must have because the man grinned and shouted again and others took up the cry Mhysa they called Mhysa MHYSA They were all smiling at her reaching for her kneeling before her Maela some called her while others cried Aelalla or Qathei or Tato but whatever the tongue it all meant the same thing Mother They are calling me Mother

The chant grew spread swelled It swelled so loud that it frightened her horse and the mare backed and shook her head and lashed her silver-grey tail It swelled until it seemed to shake the yellow walls of Yunkai More slaves were streaming from the gates every moment and as they came they took up the call They were running toward her now pushing stumbling wanting to touch her hand to stroke her horse’s mane to kiss her feet Her poor bloodriders could not keep them all away and even Strong Belwas grunted and growled in dismay

Ser Jorah urged her to go but Dany remembered a dream she had dreamed in the House of the Undying They will not hurt me she told him They are my children Jorah She laughed put her heels into her horse and rode to them the bells in her hair ringing sweet victory She trotted then cantered then broke into a gallop her braid streaming behind The freed slaves parted before her Mother they called from a hundred throats a thousand ten thousand Mother they sang their fingers brushing her legs as she flew by Mother Mother Mother
