211 The king shall joy in thy strength O LORD and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice

212 Thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden
the request of his lips Selah

213 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head

214 He asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of
days for ever and ever

215 His glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him

216 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance

217 For the king trusteth in the LORD and through the mercy of the
most High he shall not be moved

218 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee

219 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger
the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour
them

2110 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed
from among the children of men

2111 For they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous
device which they are not able to perform

2112 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them

2113 Be thou exalted LORD in thine own strength so will we sing
and praise thy power



221 My God my God why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far
from helping me and from the words of my roaring

222 O my God I cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the
night season and am not silent

223 But thou art holy O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel

224 Our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver
them

225 They cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee
and were not confounded

226 But I am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of
the people

227 All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip
they shake the head saying

228 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him let him deliver

2213 They gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a

2214 I am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint
my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels

2215 My strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth

2217 I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me

2218 They part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture

2219 But be not thou far from me O LORD O my strength haste thee
to help me

2220 Deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the

2221 Save me from the lions mouth for thou hast heard me from the
