LORD commanded Moses so did the children of Israel

96 And there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a
man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on that day 97 And those men said unto
him We are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept
back that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed
season among the children of Israel  98 And Moses said unto them
Stand still and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning
you

99 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 910 Speak unto the
children of Israel saying If any man of you or of your posterity
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar
off yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD

911 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs

912 They shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone
of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep
it

913 But the man that is clean and is not in a journey and
forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people because he brought not the offering of the LORD
in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin

914 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the
passover unto the LORD according to the ordinance of the passover
and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one
ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the
land

915 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until
the morning

916 So it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance
of fire by night

917 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after
that the children of Israel journeyed and in the place where the
cloud abode there the children of Israel pitched their tents

918 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed
and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched as long as the cloud
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents

919 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and journeyed
not

920 And so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle
according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents
and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed

921 And so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they
journeyed

922 Or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of
Israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken
up they journeyed

923 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents and at
the commandment of the LORD they journeyed they kept the charge of
the LORD at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses

101 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 102 Make thee two
trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the
journeying of the camps

103 And when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation

104 And if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which
are heads of the thousands of Israel shall gather themselves unto
thee

105 When ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward

106 When ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on
the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys

107 But when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall
blow but ye shall not sound an alarm

108 And the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations

109 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
