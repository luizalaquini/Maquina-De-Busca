199 And the LORD said unto Moses Lo I come unto thee in a thick
cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe
thee for ever

And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD

1910 And the LORD said unto Moses Go unto the people and sanctify
them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes 1911 And
be ready against the third day for the third day the LORD will come
down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai

1912 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying
Take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch
the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
death 1913 There shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be
stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not
live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount

1914 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people and
sanctified the people and they washed their clothes

1915 And he said unto the people Be ready against the third day
come not at your wives

1916 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there
were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and
the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that
was in the camp trembled

1917 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
God and they stood at the nether part of the mount

1918 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the LORD
descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly

1919 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder
and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a voice

1920 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai on the top of the
mount and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount and Moses
went up

1921 And the LORD said unto Moses Go down charge the people lest
they break through unto the LORD to gaze and many of them perish

1922 And let the priests also which come near to the LORD sanctify
themselves lest the LORD break forth upon them

1923 And Moses said unto the LORD The people cannot come up to mount
Sinai for thou chargedst us saying Set bounds about the mount and
sanctify it

1924 And the LORD said unto him Away get thee down and thou shalt
come up thou and Aaron with thee but let not the priests and the
people break through to come up unto the LORD lest he break forth
upon them

1925 So Moses went down unto the people and spake unto them

201 And God spake all these words saying 202 I am the LORD thy
God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the
house of bondage

203 Thou shalt have no other gods before me

204 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath
or that is in the water under the earth

205 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I
the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me 206 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love
me and keep my commandments

207 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain

208 Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy

209 Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work 2010 But the
seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor
thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates 2011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth the sea
and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the
LORD blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it

2012 Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee

2013 Thou shalt not kill

2014 Thou shalt not commit adultery

2015 Thou shalt not steal

2016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
