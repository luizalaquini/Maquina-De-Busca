Rather too well Littlefinger said I still carry a token of his esteem Did Brandon speak of me too

Often and with some heat Ned said hoping that would end it He had no patience with this game they played this dueling with words

I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks Littlefinger said Here in the south they say you are all made of ice and melt when you ride below the Neck

I do not plan on melting soon Lord Baelish You may count on it Ned moved to the council table and said Maester Pycelle I trust you are well

The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table Well enough for a man of my years my lord he replied yet I do tire easily I fear Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face His maester’s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast The links were forged of every metal known to man black iron and red gold bright copper and dull lead steel and tin and pale silver brass and bronze and platinum Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork and here and there an emerald or ruby Perhaps we might begin soon the Grand Maester said hands knitting together atop his broad stomach I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer

As you will The king’s seat sat empty at the head of the table the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows Ned took the chair beside it as the right hand of his king My lords he said formally I am sorry to have kept you waiting

You are the King’s Hand Varys said We serve at your pleasure Lord Stark

As the others took their accustomed seats it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here in this room with these men He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell I am surrounded by flatterers and fools the king had insisted Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools He thought he knew already We are but five he pointed out

Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north Varys said and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us Ned suggested

Renly Baratheon laughed aloud If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence it could be a long sit

Our good King Robert has many cares Varys said He entrusts some small matters to us to lighten his load

What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears Lord Renly said so it falls to us to govern the realm He does send us a command from time to time He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once He has an urgent task for us

Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned It bore the royal seal Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king’s urgent command reading the words with mounting disbelief Was there no end to Robert’s folly And to do this in his name that was salt in the wound Gods be good he swore

What Lord Eddard means to say Lord Renly announced is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King

How much asked Littlefinger mildly

Ned read the answer off the letter Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion Twenty thousand to the man who comes second another twenty to the winner of the melee and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition

Ninety thousand gold pieces Littlefinger sighed And we must not neglect the other costs Robert will want a prodigious feast That means cooks carpenters serving girls singers jugglers fools…

Fools we have in plenty Lord Renly said

Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked Will the treasury bear the expense

What treasury is that Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth Spare me the foolishness Maester You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years I shall have to borrow the money No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present what matter another hundred thousand

Ned was stunned Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt

The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt Lord Stark The Lannisters are the biggest part of it but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell the Iron Bank of Braavos and several Tyroshi trading cartels Of late I’ve had to turn to the Faith The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger

Ned was aghast Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold How could you let this happen

Littlefinger gave a shrug The master of coin finds the money The king and the Hand spend it

I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm Ned said hotly

Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head his chains clinking softly Lord Arryn was a prudent man but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel
