233 Then said Paul unto him God shall smite thee thou whited wall
for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law  234 And they that stood by said
Revilest thou Gods high priest  235 Then said Paul I wist not
brethren that he was the high priest for it is written Thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people

236 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the
other Pharisees he cried out in the council Men and brethren I am a
Pharisee the son of a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the
dead I am called in question

237 And when he had so said there arose a dissension between the
Pharisees and the Sadducees and the multitude was divided

238 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither
angel nor spirit but the Pharisees confess both

239 And there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the
Pharisees part arose and strove saying We find no evil in this
man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight
against God

2310 And when there arose a great dissension the chief captain
fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded
the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and
to bring him into the castle

2311 And the night following the Lord stood by him and said Be of
good cheer Paul for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem so
must thou bear witness also at Rome

2312 And when it was day certain of the Jews banded together and
bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor
drink till they had killed Paul

2313 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy

2314 And they came to the chief priests and elders and said We have
bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we
have slain Paul

2315 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire
something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near
are ready to kill him

2316 And when Pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he
went and entered into the castle and told Paul

2317 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him and said Bring
this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to
tell him

2318 So he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said
Paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this
young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee

2319 Then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him
aside privately and asked him What is that thou hast to tell me
2320 And he said The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council as though they
would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly

2321 But do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him
of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath
that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and
now are they ready looking for a promise from thee

2322 So the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged
him See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me

2323 And he called unto him two centurions saying Make ready two
hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten
and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night 2324 And
provide them beasts that they may set Paul on and bring him safe
unto Felix the governor

2325 And he wrote a letter after this manner 2326 Claudius Lysias
unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting

2327 This man was taken of the Jews and should have been killed of
them then came I with an army and rescued him having understood
that he was a Roman

2328 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
him I brought him forth into their council 2329 Whom I perceived to
be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his
charge worthy of death or of bonds

2330 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man
I sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also
to say before thee what they had against him Farewell

2331 Then the soldiers as it was commanded them took Paul and
brought him by night to Antipatris

2332 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and
returned to the castle 2333 Who when they came to Caesarea and
delivered the epistle to the governor presented Paul also before him
