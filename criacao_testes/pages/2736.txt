163 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel yea and made
his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the
heathen whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel

164 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on
the hills and under every green tree

165 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
came up to Jerusalem to war and they besieged Ahaz but could not
overcome him

166 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria and
drave the Jews from Elath and the Syrians came to Elath and dwelt
there unto this day

167 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria
saying I am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the
hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel
which rise up against me

168 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
the LORD and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a
present to the king of Assyria

169 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him for the king of
Assyria went up against Damascus and took it and carried the people
of it captive to Kir and slew Rezin

1610 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria and saw an altar that was at Damascus and king Ahaz sent to
Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it
according to all the workmanship thereof

1611 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king
Ahaz had sent from Damascus so Urijah the priest made it against king
Ahaz came from Damascus

1612 And when the king was come from Damascus the king saw the
altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon

1613 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and
poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace
offerings upon the altar

1614 And he brought also the brasen altar which was before the LORD
from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house
of the LORD and put it on the north side of the altar

1615 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest saying Upon the
great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat
offering and the kings burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with
the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat
offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the
blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and
the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by

1616 Thus did Urijah the priest according to all that king Ahaz
commanded

1617 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the
laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones

1618 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house
and the kings entry without turned he from the house of the LORD for
the king of Assyria

1619 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah  1620
And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead

171 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of
Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years

172 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD but not
as the kings of Israel that were before him

173 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria and Hoshea
became his servant and gave him presents

174 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea for he had
sent messengers to So king of Egypt and brought no present to the
king of Assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of
Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison

175 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land and
went up to Samaria and besieged it three years

176 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and
carried Israel away into Assyria and placed them in Halah and in
Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes

177 For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the
LORD their God which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt
from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt and had feared other
gods 178 And walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the LORD
cast out from before the children of Israel and of the kings of
Israel which they had made
