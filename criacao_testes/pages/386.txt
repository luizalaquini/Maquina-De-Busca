We may If any of us still live That’s for the Old Bear to say the one you call the Lord Crow I’m only his squire I do not choose the road I ride

No He could hear the defeat in her voice Sorry to be of trouble m’lord I only… they said the king keeps people safe and I thought… Despairing she ran Sam’s cloak flapping behind her like great black wings

Jon watched her go his joy in the morning’s brittle beauty gone Damn her he thought resentfully and damn Sam twice for sending her to me What did he think I could do for her We’re here to fight wildlings not save them

Other men were crawling from their shelters yawning and stretching The magic was already faded icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun Someone had gotten a fire started he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees and the smoky scent of bacon Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell Afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells

Grenn and Dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire Hake handed Jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in bacon grease He wolfed it down while listening to Dywen boast of having three of Craster’s women during the night

You did not Grenn said scowling I would have seen

Dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand You Seen You’re blind as Maester Aemon You never even saw that bear

What bear Was there a bear

There’s always a bear declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation One killed my brother when I was young Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong And they were good teeth too better than mine I’ve had nothing but trouble with my teeth

Did Sam sleep in the hall last night Jon asked him

I’d not call it sleeping The ground was hard the rushes ill-smelling and my brothers snore frightfully Speak of bears if you will none ever growled so fierce as Brown Bernarr I was warm though Some dogs crawled atop me during the night My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it Or perhaps it was Brown Bernarr Have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me It will start again now that I’m back out Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me

I’d best go see to Lord Mormont said Jon

The rain might have stopped but the compound was still a morass of shallow lakes and slippery mud Black brothers were folding their tents feeding their horses and chewing on strips of salt beef Jarman Buckwell’s scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before setting out Jon Buckwell greeted him from horseback Keep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours We’ll be needing it soon enough

Craster’s hall was dim after daylight Inside the night’s torches had burned low and it was hard to know that the sun had risen Lord Mormont’s raven was the first to spy him enter Three lazy flaps of its great black wings and it perched atop Longclaw’s hilt Corn It nipped at a strand of Jon’s hair

Ignore that wretched beggar bird Jon it’s just had half my bacon The Old Bear sat at Craster’s board breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread bacon and sheepgut sausage Craster’s new axe was on the table its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight Its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above but the women were all up moving about and serving What sort of day do we have

Cold but the rain has stopped

Very good See that my horse is saddled and ready I mean for us to ride within the hour Have you eaten Craster serves plain fare but filling

I will not eat Craster’s food he decided suddenly I broke my fast with the men my lord Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw The bird hopped back to Mormont’s shoulder where it promptly shat You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me the Old Bear grumbled The raven quorked

He found Sam behind the hall standing with Gilly at the broken rabbit hutch She was helping him back into his cloak but when she saw Jon she stole away Sam gave him a look of wounded reproach I thought you would help her

And how was I to do that Jon said sharply Take her with us wrapped up in your cloak We were commanded not to—

I know said Sam guiltily but she was afraid I know what it is to be afraid I told her… He swallowed

What That we’d take her with us

Sam’s fat face blushed a deep red On the way home He could not meet Jon’s eyes She’s going to have a baby

Sam have you taken leave of all your sense We may not even return this way And if we do do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster’s wives

I thought… maybe by then I could think of a way…

I have no time for this I have horses to groom and saddle Jon walked away as confused as he was angry Sam’s heart was a big as the rest of him but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times It was impossible and dishonorable besides So why do I feel so ashamed

Jon took his accustomed position at Mormont’s side as the Night’s Watch streamed out past the skulls on Craster’s gate They struck off north and west along a crooked game trail Melting ice dripped down all about them a slower sort of rain with its own soft music North of the compound the brook was in full spate choked with leaves and bits of wood but the scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across The water ran as high as a horse’s belly Ghost swam emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping brown When he shook spraying mud and water in all directions Mormont said nothing but on his shoulder the raven screeched
