516 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
holy thing and shall add the fifth part thereto and give it unto the
priest and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
the trespass offering and it shall be forgiven him

517 And if a soul sin and commit any of these things which are
forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD though he wist
it not yet is he guilty and shall bear his iniquity

518 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock with
thy estimation for a trespass offering unto the priest and the
priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
wherein he erred and wist it not and it shall be forgiven him

519 It is a trespass offering he hath certainly trespassed against
the LORD

61 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 62 If a soul sin and
commit a trespass against the LORD and lie unto his neighbour in that
which was delivered him to keep or in fellowship or in a thing taken
away by violence or hath deceived his neighbour 63 Or have found
that which was lost and lieth concerning it and sweareth falsely in
any of all these that a man doeth sinning therein 64 Then it shall
be because he hath sinned and is guilty that he shall restore that
which he took violently away or the thing which he hath deceitfully
gotten or that which was delivered him to keep or the lost thing
which he found 65 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely he
shall even restore it in the principal and shall add the fifth part
more thereto and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth in the day
of his trespass offering

66 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD a ram
without blemish out of the flock with thy estimation for a trespass
offering unto the priest 67 And the priest shall make an atonement
for him before the LORD and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of
all that he hath done in trespassing therein

68 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 69 Command Aaron and his
sons saying This is the law of the burnt offering It is the burnt
offering because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the
morning and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it

610 And the priest shall put on his linen garment and his linen
breeches shall he put upon his flesh and take up the ashes which the
fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar and he shall
put them beside the altar

611 And he shall put off his garments and put on other garments and
carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place

612 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it it shall not
be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and
lay the burnt offering in order upon it and he shall burn thereon the
fat of the peace offerings

613 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar it shall never go
out

614 And this is the law of the meat offering the sons of Aaron shall
offer it before the LORD before the altar

615 And he shall take of it his handful of the flour of the meat
offering and of the oil thereof and all the frankincense which is
upon the meat offering and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour even the memorial of it unto the LORD

616 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat with
unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place in the court of
the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it

617 It shall not be baken with leaven I have given it unto them for
their portion of my offerings made by fire it is most holy as is the
sin offering and as the trespass offering

618 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it It
shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
offerings of the LORD made by fire every one that toucheth them shall
be holy

619 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 620 This is the offering
of Aaron and of his sons which they shall offer unto the LORD in the
day when he is anointed the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for
a meat offering perpetual half of it in the morning and half thereof
at night

621 In a pan it shall be made with oil and when it is baken thou
shalt bring it in and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt
thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD

622 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
offer it it is a statute for ever unto the LORD it shall be wholly
burnt

623 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt it
shall not be eaten

624 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 625 Speak unto Aaron and
to his sons saying This is the law of the sin offering In the place
where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed
before the LORD it is most holy
