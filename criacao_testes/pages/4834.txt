Here am I

3714 And he said to him Go I pray thee see whether it be well with
thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again So he
sent him out of the vale of Hebron and he came to Shechem

3715 And a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in
the field and the man asked him saying What seekest thou  3716
And he said I seek my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed
their flocks

3717 And the man said They are departed hence for I heard them say
Let us go to Dothan And Joseph went after his brethren and found
them in Dothan

3718 And when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto
them they conspired against him to slay him

3719 And they said one to another Behold this dreamer cometh

3720 Come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some
pit and we will say Some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall
see what will become of his dreams

3721 And Reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands
and said Let us not kill him

3722 And Reuben said unto them Shed no blood but cast him into this
pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might
rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again

3723 And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren
that they stript Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that
was on him 3724 And they took him and cast him into a pit and the
pit was empty there was no water in it

3725 And they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes
and looked and behold a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry
it down to Egypt

3726 And Judah said unto his brethren What profit is it if we slay
our brother and conceal his blood  3727 Come and let us sell him
to the Ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our
brother and our flesh And his brethren were content

3728 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt

3729 And Reuben returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in
the pit and he rent his clothes

3730 And he returned unto his brethren and said The child is not
and I whither shall I go  3731 And they took Josephs coat and
killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood 3732 And
they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their
father and said This have we found know now whether it be thy sons
coat or no

3733 And he knew it and said It is my sons coat an evil beast
hath devoured him Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces

3734 And Jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins
and mourned for his son many days

3735 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him
but he refused to be comforted and he said For I will go down into
the grave unto my son mourning Thus his father wept for him

3736 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar an officer
of Pharaohs and captain of the guard

381 And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his
brethren and turned in to a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah

382 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name
was Shuah and he took her and went in unto her

383 And she conceived and bare a son and he called his name Er

384 And she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name
Onan

385 And she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name
Shelah and he was at Chezib when she bare him

386 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn whose name was Tamar

387 And Er Judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the LORD
and the LORD slew him

388 And Judah said unto Onan Go in unto thy brothers wife and
marry her and raise up seed to thy brother

389 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to
pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on
the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother

3810 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD wherefore he
