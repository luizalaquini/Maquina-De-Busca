and it is not surprising that it proved to be the most difficult target
A more sophisticated smoothing algorithm than the
one used may be worth investigating
pp
In a third experiment sentences with two variable parts were used to check
that the results of the second experiment extended to more complex
utterances
The overall success rate was 75 significantly different from chance
However a breakdown of the results by source and target utterance
showed that there was one contour for the utterance
the price is 19 dollars and 8 cents which exhibited very successful
transfer subjects identifying the transferred-pitch utterances at only
a chance level
pp
Finally transfers of pitch from utterances with two variable parts
to those with one variable part were tested
Pitch contours were transferred to sentences with the same cents
figure but no dollars part for example
the price is five dollars and thirteen cents
to
the price is thirteen cents  The
contour was simply copied between the corresponding
syllables so that no adjustment needed to be made
for different syllable structures
The overall score was 60 successes in 100 judgements em
the same percentage as in the second experiment
pp
To summarize the results of these four experiments
LB
NP
even accomplished linguists cannot distinguish an utterance from one with
pitch transferred from a different recording of it
NP
when the utterance contained only one variable part embedded in a
carrier sentence
lay listeners identified the original correctly in 60 of cases
over a wide variety of syllable structures  this
figure differs significantly from the chance value of 50
NP
lay listeners identified the original confidently and correctly in
50 of cases confidently but incorrectly in 25 of cases
NP
the greatest hindrance to successful transfer was the presence of
a long uninterrupted period of voicing in the target utterance
NP
the performance of the method deteriorates as the number
of variable parts in the utterances increases
NP
some utterances seemed to serve better than others as the pitch source for
transfer although this was not correlated with complexity of syllable structure
NP
even when the utterance contained two variable parts
there was one source utterance whose pitch contour was
transferred to all the others so successfully that listeners could not identify
the original
LE
pp
The fact that only 60 of originals in the second experiment were
spotted by lay listeners in a stringent
paired-comparison test em many of them being identified without confidence em
does encourage the use of the procedure for generating stereotyped
but different utterances of high quality in voice-response systems
The experiments indicate that although different syllable patterns
can be handled satisfactorily by this procedure
long voiced periods should be avoided if possible when designing
the message set
and that if individual utterances must contain multiple variable parts
the source utterance should be chosen with the aid of listening tests
sh 83  Assigning timing and pitch to synthetic speech
pp
The pitch transfer method can give good results within a fairly narrow
domain of application
But like any speech output technique which treats complete utterances
as a single unit with provision for a small number of slot-fillers to
accomodate data-dependent messages it becomes unmanageable in more general
situations with a large variety of utterances
As with segmental synthesis it becomes necessary to consider methods
which use a textual rather than an acoustically-based representation
of the prosodic features
pp
This raises a problem with prosodics that was not there for segmentals  how
ul
can
prosodic features be written in text form
The standard phonetic transcription method does not give much help with
notation for prosodics  It does provide a diacritical mark to indicate
stress but this is by no means enough information for synthesis
Furthermore text-to-speech procedures described in the next chapter
promise to allow segmentals to be specified by an ordinary orthographic
representation of the utterance but we have seen that considerable
intelligence is required to derive prosodic features from text
More than mere intelligence may be needed  this is underlined by a paper
