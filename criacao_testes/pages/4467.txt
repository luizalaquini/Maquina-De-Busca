Is this what Father intended Tyrion rolled up Stark’s map These terms will never do

Will you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem Ser Cleos asked plaintively

Tion Frey was his younger brother Tyrion recalled No he said gently but we’ll propose our own exchange of captives Let me consult with Cersei and the council We shall send you back to Riverrun with our terms

Clearly the prospect did not cheer him My lord I do not believe Robb Stark will yield easily It is Lady Catelyn who wants this peace not the boy

Lady Catelyn wants her daughters Tyrion pushed himself down from the bench letter and map in hand Ser Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire You look in dire need of sleep cousin I will send for you when we know more

He found Ser Jacelyn on the ramparts watching several hundred new recruits drilling in the field below With so many seeking refuge in King’s Landing there was no lack of men willing to join the City Watch for a full belly and a bed of straw in the barracks but Tyrion had no illusions about how well these ragged defenders of theirs would fight if it came to battle

You did well to send for me Tyrion said I shall leave Ser Cleos in your hands He is to have every hospitality

And his escort the commander wanted to know

Give them food and clean garb and find a maester to see to their hurts They are not to set foot inside the city is that understood It would never do to have the truth of conditions in King’s Landing reach Robb Stark in Riverrun

Well understood my lord

Oh and one more thing The alchemists will be sending a large supply of clay pots to each of the city gates You’re to use them to train the men who will work your spitfires Fill the pots with green paint and have them drill at loading and firing Any man who spatters should be replaced When they have mastered the paint pots substitute lamp oil and have them work at lighting the jars and firing them while aflame Once they learn to do that without burning themselves they may be ready for wildfire

Ser Jacelyn scratched at his cheek with his iron hand Wise measures Though I have no love for that alchemist’s piss

Nor I but I use what I’m given

Once back inside his litter Tyrion Lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion under his elbow Cersei would be displeased to learn that he had intercepted Stark’s letter but his father had sent him here to rule not to please Cersei

It seemed to him that Robb Stark had given them a golden chance Let the boy wait at Riverrun dreaming of an easy peace Tyrion would reply with terms of his own giving the King in the North just enough of what he wanted to keep him hopeful Let Ser Cleos wear out his bony Frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters All the while their cousin Ser Stafford would be training and arming the new host he’d raised at Casterly Rock Once he was ready he and Lord Tywin could smash the Tullys and Starks between them

Now if only Robert’s brothers would be so accommodating Glacial as his progress was still Renly Baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host and scarcely a night passed that Tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that Lord Stannis was sailing his fleet up the Blackwater Rush Well it would seem I have a goodly stock of wildfire but still   

The sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries Tyrion peered out cautiously between the curtains They were passing through Cobbler’s Square where a sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers

Corruption the man cried shrilly There is the warning Behold the Father’s scourge He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky From this vantage the distant castle on Aegon’s High Hill was directly behind him with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers A clever choice of stage Tyrion reflected We have become swollen bloated foul Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve Pride comes before prayer maggots rule our castles and gold is all    but no more The Rotten Summer is at an end and the Whoremonger King is brought low When the boar did open him a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly hissing and biting He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle There comes the Harbinger Cleanse yourselves the gods cry out lest ye be cleansed Bathe in the wine of righteousness or you shall be bathed in fire Fire

Fire other voices echoed but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out Tyrion took solace from that He gave the command to continue and the litter rocked like a ship on a rough sea as the Burned Men cleared a path Twisted little monkey demon indeed The wretch did have a point about the High Septon to be sure What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table The memory of the fool’s jape made Tyrion smile

He was pleased to reach the Red Keep without further incident As he climbed the steps to his chambers Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn Time that’s all I truly need time to piece it all together Once the chain is done    He opened the door to his solar

Cersei turned away from the window her skirts swirling around her slender hips How dare you ignore my summons

Who admitted you to my tower

Your tower This is my son’s royal castle

So they tell me Tyrion was not amused Crawn would be even less so his Moon Brothers had the guard today I was about to come to you as it happens

Were you

He swung the door shut behind him You doubt me

Always and with good reason

I’m hurt Tyrion waddled to the sideboard for a cup of wine He knew no surer way to work up a thirst than talking with Cersei If I’ve given you offense I would know how

What a disgusting little worm you are Myrcella is my only daughter Did you truly imagine that I would allow you to sell her like a bag of oats

Myrcella he thought Well that egg has hatched Let’s see what color the chick is Hardly a bag of oats Myrcella is a princess Some would say this is what she was born for Or did you plan to marry her to Tommen

Her hand lashed out knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor Brother or no I should have your tongue out for that I am Joffrey’s regent not you and I say that Myrcella will not be shipped off to this Dornishman the way I was shipped to Robert Baratheon

Tyrion shook wine off his fingers and sighed Why not She’d be a deal safer in Dorne than she is here

Are you utterly ignorant or simply perverse You know as well as I that the Martells have no cause to love us

The Martells have every cause to hate us Nonetheless I expect them to agree Prince Doran’s grievance against House Lannister goes back only a generation but the Dornishmen have warred against Storm’s End and Highgarden for a thousand years and Renly has taken Dorne’s allegiance for granted Myrcella is nine Trystane Martell eleven I have proposed they wed when she reaches her fourteenth year Until such time she would be an honored guest at Sunspear under Prince Doran’s protection

A hostage Cersei said mouth tightening

An honored guest Tyrion insisted and I suspect Martell will treat Myrcella more kindly than Joffrey has treated Sansa Stark I had in mind to send Ser Arys Oakheart with her With a knight of the Kingsguard as her sworn shield no one is like to forget who or what she is

Small good Ser Arys will do her if Doran Martell decides that my daughter’s death would wash out his sister’s

Martell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl particularly one as sweet and innocent as Myrcella So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we’ll keep faith on our side and the terms are too rich to refuse Myrcella is the least part of it I’ve also offered him his sister’s killer a council seat some castles on the Marches   

Too much Cersei paced away from him restless as a lioness skirts swirling You’ve offered too much and without my authority or consent

This is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of If I’d offered less he’d likely spit in my face

Too much Cersei insisted whirling back

What would you have offered him that hole between your legs Tyrion said his own anger flaring

This time he saw the slap coming His head snapped around with a crack Sweet sweet sister he said I promise you that was the last time you will ever strike me

His sister laughed Don’t threaten me little man Do you think Father’s letter keeps you safe A piece of paper Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too for all the good it did him

Eddard Stark did not have the City Watch Tyrion thought nor my clansmen nor the sellswords that Bronn has hired I do Or so he hoped Trusting in Varys in Ser Jacelyn Bywater in Bronn Lord Stark had probably had his delusions as well

Yet he said nothing A wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier Instead he poured a fresh cup of wine How safe do you think Myrcella will be if King’s Landing falls Renly and Stannis will mount her head beside yours

And Cersei began to cry

Tyrion Lannister could not have been more astonished if Aegon the Conqueror himself had burst into the room riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies He had not seen his sister weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock Awkwardly he took a step toward her When your sister cries you were supposed to comfort her    but this was Cersei He reached a tentative hand for her shoulder

Don’t touch me she said wrenching away It should not have hurt yet it did more than any slap Red-faced as angry as she was grief-stricken Cersei struggled for breath Don’t look at me not    not like this    not you

Politely Tyrion turned his back I did not mean to frighten you I promise you nothing will happen to Myrcella
