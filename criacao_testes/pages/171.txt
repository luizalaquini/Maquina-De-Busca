The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard hesitated In the blink of an eye he was surrounded by Stark guardsmen bare steel in their mailed fists

And now the treason moves from words to deeds Cersei said Do you think Ser Barristan stands alone my lord With an ominous rasp of metal on metal the Hound drew his longsword The knights of the Kingsguard and twenty Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks moved to support him

Kill him the boy king screamed down from the Iron Throne Kill all of them I command it

You leave me no choice Ned told Cersei Lannister He called out to Janos Slynt Commander take the queen and her children into custody Do them no harm but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there under guard

Men of the Watch Janos Slynt shouted donning his helm A hundred gold cloaks leveled their spears and closed

I want no bloodshed Ned told the queen Tell your men to lay down their swords and no one need—

With a single sharp thrust the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into Tomard’s back Fat Tom’s blade dropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through his ribs piercing leather and mail He was dead before his sword hit the floor

Ned’s shout came far too late Janos Slynt himself slashed open Varly’s throat Cayn whirled steel flashing drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows for an instant it looked as though he might cut his way free Then the Hound was on him Sandor Clegane’s first cut took off Cayn’s sword hand at the wrist his second drove him to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone

As his men died around him Littlefinger slid Ned’s dagger from its sheath and shoved it up under his chin His smile was apologetic I did warn you not to trust me you know





ARYA

High Syrio Forel called out slashing at her head The stick swords clacked as Arya parried

Left he shouted and his blade came whistling Hers darted to meet it The clack made him click his teeth together

Right he said and Low and Left and Left again faster and faster moving forward Arya retreated before him checking each blow

Lunge he warned and when he thrust she sidestepped swept his blade away and slashed at his shoulder She almost touched him almost so close it made her grin A strand of hair dangled in her eyes limp with sweat She pushed it away with the back of her hand

Left Syrio sang out Low His sword was a blur and the Small Hall echoed to the clack clack clack Left Left High Left Right Left Low Left

The wooden blade caught her high in the breast a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it came from the wrong side Ow she cried out She would have a fresh bruise there by the time she went to sleep somewhere out at sea A bruise is a lesson she told herself and each lesson makes us better

Syrio stepped back You are dead now

Arya made a face You cheated she said hotly You said left and you went right

Just so And now you are a dead girl

But you lied

My words lied My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth but you were not seeing

I was so Arya said I watched you every second

Watching is not seeing dead girl The water dancer sees Come put down the sword it is time for listening now

She followed him over to the wall where he settled onto a bench Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos and are you knowing how that came to pass

You were the finest swordsman in the city
