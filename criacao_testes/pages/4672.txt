Who’s Rulore She couldn’t even say it

The Lord of Light Thoros has taught us—

She didn’t care what Thoros had taught them She yanked Greenbeard’s dagger from its sheath and spun away before he could catch her Gendry made a grab for her as well but she had always been too fast for Gendry

Tom Sevenstrings and some woman were helping the Hound to his feet The sight of his arm shocked her speechless There was a strip of pink where the leather strap had clung but above and below the flesh was cracked and red and bleeding from elbow to wrist When his eyes met hers his mouth twitched You want me dead that bad Then do it wolf girl Shove it in It’s cleaner than fire Clegane tried to stand but as he moved a piece of burned flesh sloughed right off his arm and his knees went out from under him Tom caught him by his good arm and held him up

His arm Arya thought and his face But he was the Hound He deserved to burn in a fiery hell The knife felt heavy in her hand She gripped it tighter You killed Mycah she said once more daring him to deny it Tell them You did You did

I did His whole face twisted I rode him down and cut him in half and laughed I watched them beat your sister bloody too watched them cut your father’s head off

Lem grabbed her wrist and twisted wrenching the dagger away She kicked at him but he would not give it back You go to hell Hound she screamed at Sandor Clegane in helpless empty-handed rage You just go to hell

He has said a voice scarce stronger than a whisper

When Arya turned Lord Beric Dondarrion was standing behind her his bloody hand clutching Thoros by the shoulder





CATELYN

Let the kings of winter have their cold crypt under the earth Catelyn thought The Tullys drew their strength from the river and it was to the river they returned when their lives had run their course

They laid Lord Hoster in a slender wooden boat clad in shining silver armor plate-and-mail His cloak was spread beneath him rippling blue and red His surcoat was divided blue-and-red as well A trout scaled in silver and bronze crowned the crest of the greathelm they placed beside his head On his chest they placed a painted wooden sword his fingers curled about its hilt Mail gauntlets hid his wasted hands and made him look almost strong again His massive oak-and-iron shield was set by his left side his hunting horn to his right The rest of the boat was filled with driftwood and kindling and scraps of parchment and stones to make it heavy in the water His banner flew from the prow the leaping trout of Riverrun

Seven were chosen to push the funereal boat to the water in honor of the seven faces of god Robb was one Lord Hoster’s liege lord With him were the Lords Bracken Blackwood Vance and Mallister Ser Marq Piper    and Lame Lothar Frey who had come down from the Twins with the answer they had awaited Forty soldiers rode in his escort commanded by Walder Rivers the eldest of Lord Walder’s bastard brood a stern grey-haired man with a formidable reputation as a warrior Their arrival coming within hours of Lord Hoster’s passing had sent Edmure into a rage Walder Frey should be flayed and quartered he’d shouted He sends a cripple and a bastard to treat with us tell me there is no insult meant by that

I have no doubt that Lord Walder chose his envoys with care she replied It was a peevish thing to do a petty sort of revenge but remember who we are dealing with The Late Lord Frey Father used to call him The man is ill-tempered envious and above all prideful

Blessedly her son had shown better sense than her brother Robb had greeted the Freys with every courtesy found barracks space for the escort and quietly asked Ser Desmond Grell to stand aside so Lothar might have the honor of helping to send Lord Hoster on his last voyage He has learned a rough wisdom beyond his years my son House Frey might have abandoned the King in the North but the Lord of the Crossing remained the most powerful of Riverrun’s bannermen and Lothar was here in his stead

The seven launched Lord Hoster from the water stair wading down the steps as the portcullis was winched upward Lothar Frey a soft-bodied portly man was breathing heavily as they shoved the boat out into the current Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood at the prow stood chest deep in the river to guide it on its way

Catelyn watched from the battlements waiting and watching as she had waited and watched so many times before Beneath her the swift wild Tumblestone plunged like a spear into the side of the broad Red Fork its blue-white current churning the muddy red-brown flow of the greater river A morning mist hung over the water as thin as gossamer and the wisps of memory

Bran and Rickon will be waiting for him Catelyn thought sadly as once I used to wait

The slim boat drifted out from under the red stone arch of the Water Gate picking up speed as it was caught in the headlong rush of the Tumblestone and pushed out into the tumult where the waters met As the boat emerged from beneath the high sheltering walls of the castle its square sail filled with wind and Catelyn saw sunlight flashing on her father’s helm Lord Hoster Tully’s rudder held true and he sailed serenely down the center of the channel into the rising sun

Now her uncle urged Beside him her brother Edmure—Lord Edmure now in truth and how long would that take to grow used to—nocked an arrow to his bowstring His squire held a brand to its point Edmure waited until the flame caught then lifted the great bow drew the string to his ear and let fly With a deep thrum the arrow sped upward Catelyn followed its flight with her eyes and heart until it plunged into the water with a soft hiss well astern of Lord Hoster’s boat

Edmure cursed softly The wind he said pulling a second arrow Again The brand kissed the oil-soaked rag behind the arrowhead the flames went licking up Edmure lifted pulled and released High and far the arrow flew Too far It vanished in the river a dozen yards beyond the boat its fire winking out in an instant A flush was creeping up Edmure’s neck red as his beard Once more he commanded taking a third arrow from the quiver He is as tight as his bowstring Catelyn thought

Ser Brynden must have seen the same thing Let me my lord he offered

I can do it Edmure insisted He let them light the arrow jerked the bow up took a deep breath drew back the arrow For a long moment he seemed to hesitate while the fire crept up the shaft crackling Finally he released The arrow flashed up and up and finally curved down again falling falling    and hissing past the billowing sail

A narrow miss no more than a handspan and yet a miss The Others take it her brother swore The boat was almost out of range drifting in and out among the river mists Wordless Edmure thrust the bow at his uncle

Swiftly Ser Brynden said He nocked an arrow held it steady for the brand drew and released before Catelyn was quite sure that the fire had caught    but as the shot rose she saw the flames trailing through the air a pale orange pennon The boat had vanished in the mists Falling the flaming arrow was swallowed up as well    but only for a heartbeat Then sudden as hope they saw the red bloom flower The sails took fire and the fog glowed pink and orange For a moment Catelyn saw the outline of the boat clearly wreathed in leaping flames

Watch for me little cat she could hear him whisper

Catelyn reached out blindly groping for her brother’s hand but Edmure had moved away to stand alone on the highest point of the battlements Her uncle Brynden took her hand instead twining his strong fingers through hers Together they watched the little fire grow smaller as the burning boat receded in the distance

And then it was gone    drifting downriver still perhaps or broken up and sinking The weight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft mud of the riverbed in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court with schools of fish their last attendants

No sooner had the burning boat vanished from their sight than Edmure walked off Catelyn would have liked to embrace him if only for a moment to sit for an hour or a night or the turn of a moon to speak of the dead and mourn Yet she knew as well as he that this was not the time he was Lord of Riverrun now and his knights were falling in around him murmuring condolences and promises of fealty walling him off from something as small as a sister’s grief Edmure listened hearing none of the words

It is no disgrace to miss your shot her uncle told her quietly Edmure should hear that The day my own lord father went downriver Hoster missed as well

With his first shaft Catelyn had been too young to remember but Lord Hoster had often told the tale His second found the sail She sighed Edmure was not as strong as he seemed Their father’s death had been a mercy when it came at last but even so her brother had taken it hard

Last night in his cups he had broken down and wept full of regrets for things undone and words unsaid He ought never to have ridden off to fight his battle on the fords he told her tearfully he should have stayed at their father’s bedside I should have been with him as you were he said Did he speak of me at the end Tell me true Cat Did he ask for me

Lord Hoster’s last word had been Tansy but Catelyn could not bring herself to tell him that He whispered your name she lied and her brother had nodded gratefully and kissed her hand If he had not tried to drown his grief and guilt he might have been able to bend a bow she thought to herself sighing but that was something else she dare not say

The Blackfish escorted her down from the battlements to where Robb stood among his bannermen his young queen at his side When he saw her her son took her silently in his arms

Lord Hoster looked as noble as a king my lady murmured Jeyne Would that I had been given the chance to know him

And I to know him better added Robb

He would have wished that too said Catelyn There were too many leagues between Riverrun and Winterfell And too many mountains and rivers and armies between Riverrun and the Eyrie it would seem Lysa had made no reply to her letter

And from King’s Landing came only silence as well By now she had hoped that Brienne and Ser Cleos would have reached the city with their captive It might even be that Brienne was on her way back and the girls with her Ser Cleos swore he would make the Imp send a raven once the trade was made He swore it Ravens did not always win through Some bowman could have brought the bird down and roasted him for supper The letter that would have set her heart at ease might even now be lying by the ashes of some campfire beside a pile of raven bones

Others were waiting to offer Robb their consolations so Catelyn stood aside patiently while Lord Jason Mallister the Greatjon and Ser Rolph Spicer spoke to him each in turn But when Lothar Frey approached she gave his sleeve a tug Robb turned and waited to hear what Lothar would say

Your Grace A plump man in his middle thirties Lothar Frey had close-set eyes a pointed beard and dark hair that fell to his shoulders in ringlets A leg twisted at birth had earned him the name Lame Lothar He had served as his father’s steward for the past dozen years We are loath to intrude upon your grief but perhaps you might grant us audience tonight

It would be my pleasure said Robb It was never my wish to sow enmity between us

Nor mine to be the cause of it said Queen Jeyne

Lothar Frey smiled I understand as does my lord father He instructed me to say that he was young once and well remembers what it is like to lose one’s heart to beauty

Catelyn doubted very much that Lord Walder had said any such thing or that he had ever lost his heart to beauty The Lord of the Crossing had outlived seven wives and was now wed to his eighth but he spoke of them only as bedwarmers and brood mares Still the words were fairly spoken and she could scarce object to the compliment Nor did Robb Your father is most gracious he said I shall look forward to our talk

Lothar bowed kissed the queen’s hand and withdrew By then a dozen others had gathered for a word Robb spoke with them each giving a thanks here a smile there as needed Only when the last of them was done did he turn back to Catelyn There is something we must speak of Will you walk with me

As you command Your Grace

That wasn’t a command Mother

It will be my pleasure then Her son had treated her kindly enough since returning to Riverrun yet he seldom sought her out If he was more comfortable with his young queen she could scarcely blame him Jeyne makes him smile and I have nothing to share with him but grief He seemed to enjoy the company of his bride’s brothers as well young Rollam his squire and Ser Raynald his standard-bearer They are standing in the boots of those he’s lost Catelyn realized when she watched them together Rollam has taken Bran’s place and Raynald is part Theon and part Jon Snow Only with the Westerlings did she see Robb smile or hear him laugh like the boy he was To the others he was always the King in the North head bowed beneath the weight of the crown even when his brows were bare
