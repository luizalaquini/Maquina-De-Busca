The kingsroad would be faster Jaime was anxious to return to Cersei as quickly as he could If they made haste he might even arrive in time for Joffrey’s wedding

I want no trouble said Steelshanks Gods know who we’d meet along that kingsroad

No one you need fear surely You have two hundred men

Aye But others might have more M’lord said to bring you safe to your lord father and that’s what I mean to do

I have come this way before Jaime reflected a few miles further on when they passed a deserted mill beside the lake Weeds now grew where once the miller’s daughter had smiled shyly at him and the miller himself had shouted out The tourney’s back the other way ser As if I had not known

King Aerys made a great show of Jaime’s investiture He said his vows before the king’s pavilion kneeling on the green grass in white armor while half the realm looked on When Ser Gerold Hightower raised him up and put the white cloak about his shoulders a roar went up that Jaime still remembered all these years later But that very night Aerys had turned sour declaring that he had no need of seven Kingsguard here at Harrenhal Jaime was commanded to return to King’s Landing to guard the queen and little Prince Viserys who’d remained behind Even when the White Bull offered to take that duty himself so Jaime might compete in Lord Whent’s tourney Aerys had refused He’ll win no glory here the king had said He’s mine now not Tywin’s He’ll serve as I see fit I am the king I rule and he’ll obey

That was the first time that Jaime understood It was not his skill with sword and lance that had won him his white cloak nor any feats of valor he’d performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood Aerys had chosen him to spite his father to rob Lord Tywin of his heir

Even now all these years later the thought was bitter And that day as he’d ridden south in his new white cloak to guard an empty castle it had been almost too much to stomach He would have ripped the cloak off then and there if he could have but it was too late He had said the words whilst half the realm looked on and a Kingsguard served for life

Qyburn fell in beside him Is your hand troubling you

The lack of my hand is troubling me The mornings were the hardest In his dreams Jaime was a whole man and each dawn he would lie half-awake and feel his fingers move It was a nightmare some part of him would whisper refusing to believe even now only a nightmare But then he would open his eyes

I understand you had a visitor last night said Qyburn I trust that you enjoyed her

Jaime gave him a cool look She did not say who sent her

The maester smiled modestly Your fever was largely gone and I thought you might enjoy a bit of exercise Pia is quite skilled would you not agree And so… willing

She had been that certainly She had slipped in his door and out of her clothes so quickly that Jaime had thought he was still dreaming

It hadn’t been until the woman slid in under his blankets and put his good hand on her breast that he roused She was a pretty little thing too I was a slip of a girl when you came for Lord Whent’s tourney and the king gave you your cloak she confessed You were so handsome all in white and everyone said what a brave knight you were Sometimes when I’m with some man I close my eyes and pretend it’s you on top of me with your smooth skin and gold curls I never truly thought I’d have you though

Sending her away had not been easy after that but Jaime had done it all the same I have a woman he reminded himself Do you send girls to everyone you leech he asked Qyburn

More often Lord Vargo sends them to me He likes me to examine them before… well suffice it to say that once he loved unwisely and he has no wish to do so again But have no fear Pia is quite healthy As is your maid of Tarth

Jaime gave him a sharp look Brienne

Yes A strong girl that one And her maidenhead is still intact As of last night at least Qyburn gave a chuckle

He sent you to examine her

To be sure He is… fastidious shall we say

Does this concern the ransom Jaime asked Does her father require proof she is still maiden

You have not heard Qyburn gave a shrug We had a bird from Lord Selwyn In answer to mine The Evenstar offers three hundred dragons for his daughter’s safe return I had told Lord Vargo there were no sapphires on Tarth but he will not listen He is convinced the Evenstar intends to cheat him

Three hundred dragons is a fair ransom for a knight The goat should take what he can get

The goat is Lord of Harrenhal and the Lord of Harrenhal does not haggle

The news irritated him though he supposed he should have seen it coming The lie spared you awhile wench Be grateful for that much If her maidenhead’s as hard as the rest of her the goat will break his cock off trying to get in he jested Brienne was tough enough to survive a few rapes Jaime judged though if she resisted too vigorously Vargo Hoat might start lopping off her hands and feet And if he does why should I care I might still have a hand if she had let me have my cousin’s sword without getting stupid He had almost taken off her leg himself with that first stroke of his but after that she had given him more than he wanted Hoat may not know how freakish strong she is He had best be careful or she’ll snap that skinny neck of his and wouldn’t that be sweet

Qyburn’s companionship was wearing on him Jaime trotted toward the head of the column A round little tick of a northman name of Nage went before Steelshanks with the peace banner a rainbow-striped flag with seven long tails on a staff topped by a seven-pointed star Shouldn’t you northmen have a different sort of peace banner he asked Walton What are the Seven to you
