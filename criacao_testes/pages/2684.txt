thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day I perceive
that if Absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had
pleased thee well

197 Now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy
servants for I swear by the LORD if thou go not forth there will
not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now

198 Then the king arose and sat in the gate And they told unto all
the people saying Behold the king doth sit in the gate And all the
people came before the king for Israel had fled every man to his
tent

199 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
Israel saying The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and
he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines and now he is fled
out of the land for Absalom

1910 And Absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle Now
therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back  1911
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests saying
Speak unto the elders of Judah saying Why are ye the last to bring
the king back to his house seeing the speech of all Israel is come to
the king even to his house

1912 Ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then
are ye the last to bring back the king  1913 And say ye to Amasa
Art thou not of my bone and of my flesh God do so to me and more
also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the
room of Joab

1914 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah even as the
heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king Return
thou and all thy servants

1915 So the king returned and came to Jordan And Judah came to
Gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over Jordan

1916 And Shimei the son of Gera a Benjamite which was of Bahurim
hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David

1917 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him and Ziba the
servant of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him and they went over Jordan before the king

1918 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings
household and to do what he thought good And Shimei the son of Gera
fell down before the king as he was come over Jordan 1919 And said
unto the king Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do
thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my
lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to
his heart

1920 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned therefore behold
I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king

1921 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said Shall not
Shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the LORDs
anointed  1922 And David said What have I to do with you ye sons
of Zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall
there any man be put to death this day in Israel for do not I know
that I am this day king over Israel  1923 Therefore the king said
unto Shimei Thou shalt not die And the king sware unto him

1924 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king and
had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his
clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in
peace

1925 And it came to pass when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
king that the king said unto him Wherefore wentest not thou with me
Mephibosheth  1926 And he answered My lord O king my servant
deceived me for thy servant said I will saddle me an ass that I may
ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame

1927 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my
lord the king is as an angel of God do therefore what is good in
thine eyes

1928 For all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord
the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at
thine own table What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto
the king  1929 And the king said unto him Why speakest thou any
more of thy matters I have said Thou and Ziba divide the land

1930 And Mephibosheth said unto the king Yea let him take all
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
house

1931 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went
over Jordan with the king to conduct him over Jordan

1932 Now Barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim for
he was a very great man

1933 And the king said unto Barzillai Come thou over with me and I
will feed thee with me in Jerusalem
