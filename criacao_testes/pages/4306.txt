There is no reason to believe that detection of the fundamental
period of this signal will be any easier in the autocorrelation
domain than in the time domain
pp
The most common error of pitch detection by autocorrelation
analysis is that the periodicities of the formants are confused
with the pitch  This typically leads to the repetition time
being identified as  T sub pitch  +-  T sub formant1  where the
Ts are the periods of the pitch and first formant  Fortunately
there are simple ways of processing the signal non-linearly to
reduce the effect of formants on pitch estimation using autocorrelation
pp
One way
is to low-pass filter the
signal with a cut-off above the maximum pitch period say 600
Hz  However formant 1 is often below this value  A different
technique which may be used in conjunction with filtering is
to centre-clip the signal as shown in Figure 413
FC Figure 413
This
removes many of
the ripples which are associated with formants  However it
entails the use of an adjustable clipping threshold to cater for
speech of varying amplitudes  Sondhi 1968 who introduced the
technique set the clipping level at 30 of the maximum
amplitude

Sondhi 1968

An alternative which achieves
much the same effect without the need to fiddle with thresholds
is to cube the signal or raise it to some other high odd
power before taking the autocorrelation  This highlights the
peaks and suppresses the effect of low-amplitude parts
pp
For very accurate pitch detection it is best to combine the evidence
from several different methods of analysis of the time waveform
The autocorrelation function provides one source of evidence
and the cepstrum provides another
A third source comes from the time waveform itself
McGonegal
ul
et al
1975 have described a semi-automatic method of pitch
detection which uses human judgement to make a final decision based upon these
three sources of evidence

McGonegal Rabiner Rosenberg 1975 SAPD

This appears to provide highly accurate pitch contours at the expense of
considerable human effort em it takes an experienced user 30 minutes to
process each second of speech
rh Speeding up autocorrelation
Calculating the autocorrelation function is an
arithmetic-intensive procedure  For large lags it can best be
done using FFT methods although there are simpler arithmetic
tricks which speed it up without going to such complexity
However with the availability of analogue delay lines using
charge-coupled devices autocorrelation can now be done
effectively and cheaply by analogue sampled-data hardware
pp
Nevertheless some techniques to speed up digital
calculation of short-time autocorrelations are in wide use  It
is tempting to hard-limit the signal so that it becomes binary
Figure 414a thus eliminating multiplication
FC Figure 414
This can be
disastrous however because hard-limited speech is known to
retain considerable intelligibility and therefore the formant
structure is still there  A better plan is to take
centre-clipped speech and hard-limit that to a ternary signal
Figure 414b  This simplifies the computation considerably
with essentially no degradation in performance Dubnowski

A different approach to reducing the amount of calculation is to
perform a kind of autocorrelation which does not use
multiplications  The
