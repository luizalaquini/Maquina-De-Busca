Indeed Jowly balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself We have sore need of you my lord Rebellion everywhere this grim omen in the sky rioting in the city streets…

And whose fault is that Lord Janos Cersei lashed out Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order As to you Tyrion you could better serve us on the field of battle

He laughed No I’m done with fields of battle thank you I sit a chair better than a horse and I’d sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe All that about the thunder of the drums sunlight flashing on armor magnificent destriers snorting and prancing Well the drums gave me headaches the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere Not that I am complaining Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn drums horseshit and fly bites are my favorite things

Littlefinger laughed Well said Lannister A man after my own heart

Tyrion smiled at him remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade We must have a talk about that and soon He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as well Please he told them do let me be of service in whatever small way I can

Cersei read the letter again How many men have you brought with you 

A few hundred My own men chiefly Father was loath to part with any of his He is fighting a war after all

What use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city or Stannis sails from Dragonstone I ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf The king names the Hand with the consent of council Joffrey named our lord father

And our lord father named me

He cannot do that Not without Joff’s consent

Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host if you’d care to take it up with him Tyrion said politely My lords perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister

Varys slithered to his feet smiling in that unctuous way he had How you must have yearned for the sound of your sweet sister’s voice My lords please let us give them a few moments together The woes of our troubled realm shall keep

Janos Slynt rose hesitantly and Grand Maester Pycelle ponderously yet they rose Littlefinger was the last Shall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegor’s Holdfast

My thanks Lord Petyr but I will be taking Lord Stark’s former quarters in the Tower of the Hand

Littlefinger laughed You’re a braver man than me Lannister You do know the fate of our last two Hands

Two If you mean to frighten me why not say four

Four Littlefinger raised an eyebrow Did the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some dire end in the Tower I’m afraid I was too young to pay them much mind

Aerys Targaryen’s last Hand was killed during the Sack of King’s Landing though I doubt he’d had time to settle into the Tower He was only Hand for a fortnight The one before him was burned to death And before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile and counted themselves lucky I believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart King’s Landing with his name properties and parts all intact

Fascinating said Littlefinger And all the more reason I’d sooner bed down in the dungeon

Perhaps you’ll get that wish Tyrion thought but he said Courage and folly are cousins or so I’ve heard Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand I pray I’m small enough to escape its notice

Janos Slynt laughed Littlefinger smiled and Grand Maester Pycelle followed them both out bowing gravely

I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons his sister said when they were alone

How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice Tyrion sighed to her

How I have yearned to have that eunuch’s tongue pulled out with hot pincers Cersei replied Has father lost his senses Or did you forge this letter She read it once more with mounting annoyance Why would he inflict you on me I wanted him to come himself She crushed Lord Tywin’s letter in her fingers I am Joffrey’s regent and I sent him a royal command

And he ignored you Tyrion pointed out He has quite a large army he can do that Nor is he the first Is he

Cersei’s mouth tightened He could see her color rising If I name this letter a forgery and tell them to throw you in a dungeon no one will ignore that I promise you

He was walking on rotten ice now Tyrion knew One false step and he would plunge through No one he agreed amiably least of all our father The one with the army But why should you want to throw me into a dungeon sweet sister when I’ve come all this long way to help you 

I do not require your help It was our father’s presence that I commanded

Yes he said quietly but it’s Jaime you want

His sister fancied herself subtle but he had grown up with her He could read her face like one of his favorite books and what he read now was rage and fear and despair Jaime—

—is my brother no less than yours Tyrion interrupted Give me your support and I promise you we will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed

How Cersei demanded The Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded Lord Eddard

True Tyrion agreed yet you still hold his daughters don’t you I saw the older girl out in the yard with Joffrey

Sansa the queen said I’ve given it out that I have the younger brat as well but it’s a lie I sent Meryn Trant to take her in hand when Robert died but her wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled No one has seen her since Likely she’s dead A great many people died that day

Tyrion had hoped for both Stark girls but he supposed one would have to do Tell me about our friends on the council

His sister glanced at the door What of them

Father seems to have taken a dislike to them When I left him he was wondering how their heads might look on the wall beside Lord Stark’s He leaned forward across the table Are you certain of their loyalty Do you trust them

I trust no one Cersei snapped I need them Does Father believe they are playing us false

Suspects rather

Why What does he know

Tyrion shrugged He knows that your son’s short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel

Cersei gave him a searching look Joff has had no lack of good counsel He’s always been strong-willed Now that he’s king he believes he should do as he pleases not as he’s bid

Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them Tyrion agreed This business with Eddard Stark… Joffrey’s work

The queen grimaced He was instructed to pardon Stark to allow him to take the black The man would have been out of our way forever and we might have made peace with that son of his but Joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show What was I to do He called for Lord Eddard’s head in front of half the city And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me Her hand tightened into a fist The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor’s Sept with blood after lying to him about our intent

It would seem he has a point said Tyrion So this Lord Slynt he was part of it was he Tell me whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council

Littlefinger made the arrangements We needed Slynt’s gold cloaks Eddard Stark was plotting with Renly and he’d written to Lord Stannis offering him the throne We might have lost all Even so it was a close thing If Sansa hadn’t come to me and told me all her father’s plans…

Tyrion was surprised Truly His own daughter Sansa had always seemed such a sweet child tender and courteous

The girl was wet with love She would have done anything for Joffrey until he cut off her father’s head and called it mercy That put an end to that

His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects Tyrion said with a crooked smile Was it Joffrey’s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too

Cersei sighed Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert’s death Varys suggested Ser Barristan Why not It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog He is very fond of Sandor Clegane We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse more than the useless old fool deserved
