Yes my lord Sam is teaching them to talk

The Old Bear snorted He’ll regret that Damned things make a lot of noise but they never say a thing worth hearing

They rode in silence until Jon said If my uncle found all these villages empty as well—

—he would have made it his purpose to learn why Lord Mormont finished for him and it may well be someone or something did not want that known Well we’ll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with We will find them Jon I promise you

Or they will find us thought Jon





ARYA

The river was a blue-green ribbon shining in the morning sun Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface ripples spreading out behind it as it went Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles

It seemed a peaceful place    until Koss spotted the dead man There in the reeds He pointed and Arya saw it The body of a soldier shapeless and swollen His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face I told you there was bodies Lommy announced I could taste them in that water

When Yoren saw the corpse he spat Dobber see if he’s got anything worth the taking Mail knife a bit o’ coin what have you He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened Yoren rode back angry his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees We won’t be crossing here Koss you’ll come with me upriver look for a ford Woth Gerren you go downstream The rest o’ you wait here Put a guard out

Dobber found a leather purse in the dead man’s belt Inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie shouting Mud Pie Mud Pie In the back of their wagon Rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while Yoren was gone but no one paid him any mind Kurz caught a fish with his bare hands Arya saw how he did it standing over a shallow pool calm as still water his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near It didn’t look as hard as catching cats Fish didn’t have claws

It was midday when the others returned Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream but someone had burned it up Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale Might be we could swim the horses over maybe the donkeys but there’s no way we’ll get those wagons across And there’s smoke to the north and west more fires could be this side o’ the river’s the place we want to be He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud a line trailing down from it That’s Gods Eye with the river flowing south We’re here He poked a hole beside the line of the river under the circle We can’t go round west of the lake like I thought East takes us back to the kingsroad He moved the stick up to where the line and circle met Near as I recall there’s a town here The holdfast’s stone and there’s a lordling got his seat there too just a towerhouse but he’ll have a guard might be a knight or two We follow the river north should be there before dark They’ll have boats so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one He drew the stick up through the circle of the lake from bottom to top Gods be good we’ll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown He thrust the point down at the top of the circle We can buy new mounts there or else take shelter at Harrenhal That’s Lady Whent’s seat and she’s always been a friend o’ the Watch

Hot Pie’s eyes got wide There’s ghosts in Harrenhal   

Yoren spat There’s for your ghosts He tossed the stick down in the mud Mount up

Arya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal Evil King Harren had walled himself up inside so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre Nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers Sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning all burnt up Arya didn’t really believe that and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago Hot Pie was being silly it wouldn’t be ghosts at Harrenhal it would be knights Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe That was what knights did they kept you safe especially women Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl

The river track was no kingsroad yet it was not half bad for what it was and for once the wagons rolled along smartly They saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall a snug little thatch-roofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat Yoren rode out ahead hallooing but got no answer Dead might be Or hiding Dobber Rey with me The three men went into the cottage Pots is gone no sign o’ any coin laid by Yoren muttered when they returned No animals Run most like Might be we met ’em on the kingsroad At least the house and field had not been burned and there were no corpses about Tarber found a garden out back and they pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before they went on their way

A little farther up the road they glimpsed a forester’s cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall both deserted They passed more fields wheat and corn and barley ripening in the sun but here there were no men sitting in trees nor walking the rows with scythes Finally the town came into view a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast a big sept with a shingled wooden roof the lord’s towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west    and no sign of any people anywhere

Yoren sat on his horse frowning through his tangle of beard Don’t like it he said but there it is We’ll go have us a look A careful look See maybe there’s some folk hiding Might be they left a boat behind or some weapons we can use

The black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl and split the rest of them into four groups of five to search the town Keep your eyes and ears open he warned them before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling or his guards

Arya found herself with Gendry Hot Pie and Lommy Squat kettle-bellied Woth had pulled an oar on a galley once which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor so Yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat As they rode between the silent white houses gooseprickles crawled up Arya’s arms This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they’d found the crying girl and the one-armed woman Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything What could scare them so much

The sun was low to the west and the houses cast long dark shadows A sudden clap of sound made Arya reach for Needle but it was only a shutter banging in the wind After the open river shore the closeness of the town unnerved her

When she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees Arya put her knees into her horse galloping past Woth and Gendry She burst out onto the grassy sward beside the pebbled shore The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper It was the biggest lake she had ever seen with no hint of a far shore She saw a rambling inn to her left built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings To her right a long pier jutted into the lake and there were other docks farther east wooden fingers reaching out from the town But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn its bottom thoroughly rotted out They’re gone Arya said dejected What would they do now

There’s an inn Lommy said when the others rode up Do you think they left any food Or ale

Let’s go see Hot Pie suggested

Never you mind about no inn snapped Woth Yoren said we’re to find a boat

They took the boats Somehow Arya knew it was true they could search the whole town and they’d find no more than the upside-down rowboat Despondent she climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake The water lapped softly around her legs A few lantern bugs were coming out their little lights blinking on and off The green water was warm as tears but there was no salt in it It tasted of summer and mud and growing things Arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar They felt good She wished she could take off her clothes and swim gliding through the warm water like an skinny pink otter Maybe she could swim all the way to Winterfell

Woth was shouting at her to help search so she did peering into boathouses and sheds while her horse grazed along the shore They found some sails some nails buckets of tar gone hard and a mother cat with a litter of new-born kittens But no boats

The town was as dark as any forest when Yoren and the others reappeared Tower’s empty he said Lord’s gone off to fight maybe or to get his smallfolk to safety no telling Not a horse or pig left in town but we’ll eat Saw a goose running loose and some chickens and there’s good fish in the Gods Eye

The boats are gone Arya reported

We could patch the bottom of that rowboat said Koss

Might do for four o’ us Yoren said

There’s nails Lommy pointed out And there’s trees all around We could build us all boats

Yoren spat You know anything ’bout boat-building dyer’s boy Lommy looked blank

A raft suggested Gendry Anyone can build a raft and long poles for pushing

Yoren looked thoughtful Lake’s too deep to pole across but if we stayed to the shallows near shore    it’d mean leaving the wagons Might be that’s best I’ll sleep on it

Can we stay at the inn Lommy asked

We’ll stay in the holdfast with the gates barred the old man said I like the feel o’ stone walls about me when I sleep

Arya could not keep quiet We shouldn’t stay here she blurted The people didn’t They all ran off even their lord

Arry’s scared Lommy announced braying laughter

I’m not she snapped back but they were

Smart boy said Yoren Thing is the folks who lived here were at war like it or no We’re not Night’s Watch takes no part so no man’s our enemy

And no man’s our friend she thought but this time she held her tongue Lommy and the rest were looking at her and she did not want to seem craven in front of them

The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails Within they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate When they slotted the bars through the brackets they made a huge X brace It was no Red Keep Yoren announced when they’d explored the holdfast top to bottom but it was better than most and should do for a night well enough The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements There was a postern gate to the north and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn leading to a narrow winding tunnel He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake Yoren had them roll a wagon on top of the trap to make certain no one came in that way He divided them into three watches and sent Tarber Kurz and Cutjack off to the abandoned towerhouse to keep an eye out from on high Kurz had a hunting horn to sound if danger threatened

They drove their wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind them The barn was a ramshackle thing large enough to hold half the animals in the town The haven where the townfolk would shelter in times of trouble was even larger low and long and built of stone with a thatched roof Koss went out the postern gate and brought the goose back and two chickens as well and Yoren allowed a cookfire There was a big kitchen inside the holdfast though all the pots and kettles had been taken Gendry Dobber and Arya drew cook duty Dobber told Arya to pluck the fowl while Gendry split wood Why can’t I split the wood she asked but no one listened Sullenly she set to plucking a chicken while Yoren sat on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of his dirk with a whetstone

When the food was ready Arya ate a chicken leg and a bit of onion No one talked much not even Lommy Gendry went off by himself afterward polishing his helm with a look on his face like he wasn’t even there The crying girl whimpered and wept but when Hot Pie offered her a bit of goose she gobbled it down and looked for more

Arya drew second watch so she found a straw pallet in the haven Sleep did not come easy so she borrowed Yoren’s stone and set to honing Needle Syrio Forel had said that a dull blade was like a lame horse Hot Pie squatted on the pallet beside her watching her work Where’d you get a good sword like that he asked When he saw the look she gave him he raised his hands defensively I never said you stole it I just wanted to know where you got it is all

My brother gave it to me she muttered

I never knew you had no brother

Arya paused to scratch under her shirt There were fleas in the straw though she couldn’t see why a few more would bother her I have lots of brothers
