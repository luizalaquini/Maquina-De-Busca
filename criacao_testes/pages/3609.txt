Jon had to laugh Craster’s one man We’re two hundred I doubt he’ll murder anyone

You cheer me said Edd sounding utterly morose And besides there’s much to be said for a good sharp axe I’d hate to be murdered with a maul I saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once Scarce split the skin at all but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd only purply-red A comely man but he died ugly It’s good that we’re not giving them mauls Edd walked away shaking his head his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him

Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper He was wondering where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear Wolf He sprinted around the hall toward the cry the earth sucking at his boots One of Craster’s women was backed up against the mud-spattered wall of the keep Keep away she was shouting at Ghost You keep away The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him Get it away m’lord she pleaded when she saw him

He won’t hurt you He knew at once what had happened a wooden hutch its slats shattered lay on its side in the wet grass He must have been hungry We haven’t seen much game Jon whistled The direwolf bolted down the rabbit crunching the small bones between his teeth and padded over to him

The woman regarded them with nervous eyes She was younger than he’d thought at first A girl of fifteen or sixteen years he judged dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain her bare feet muddy to the ankles The body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy Are you one of Craster’s daughters he asked

She put a hand over her belly Wife now Edging away from the wolf she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch I was going to breed them rabbits There’s no sheep left

The Watch will make good for them Jon had no coin of his own or he would have offered it to her… though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the Wall I’ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow

She wiped her hands on her skirt M’lord—

I’m no lord

But others had come crowding round drawn by the woman’s scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch Don’t you believe him girl called out Lark the Sisterman a ranger mean as a cur That’s Lord Snow himself

Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings mocked Chett who’d left his hounds to see what the commotion was about

That wolf’s looking at you hungry girl Lark said Might be it fancies that tender bit in your belly

Jon was not amused You’re scaring her

Warning her more like Chett’s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face

We’re not to talk to you the girl remembered suddenly

Wait Jon said too late She bolted ran

Lark made a grab for the second rabbit but Ghost was quicker When he bared his teeth the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt The others laughed The direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to Jon

There was no call to scare the girl he told them

We’ll hear no scolds from you bastard Chett blamed Jon for the loss of his comfortable position with Maester Aemon and not without justice If he had not gone to Aemon about Sam Tarly Chett would still be tending an old blind man instead of a pack of ill-tempered hunting hounds You may be the Lord Commander’s pet but you’re not the Lord Commander… and you wouldn’t talk so bloody bold without that monster of yours always about

I’ll not fight a brother while we’re beyond the Wall Jon answered his voice cooler than he felt

Lark got to one knee He’s afraid of you Chett On the Sisters we have a name for them like him

I know all the names Save your breath He walked away Ghost at his side The rain had dwindled to a thin drizzle by the time he reached the gate Dusk would be on them soon followed by another wet dark dismal night The clouds would hide moon and stars and Mormont’s Torch turning the woods black as pitch Every piss would be an adventure if not quite of the sort Jon Snow had once envisioned

Out under the trees some rangers had found enough duff and dry wood to start a fire beneath a slanting ridge of slate Others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching their cloaks over low branches Giant had crammed himself inside the hollow of a dead oak How d’ye like my castle Lord Snow

It looks snug You know where Sam is

Keep on the way you were If you come on Ser Ottyn’s pavilion you’ve gone too far Giant smiled Unless Sam’s found him a tree too What a tree that would be

It was Ghost who found Sam in the end The direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a crossbow Under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain Sam was feeding the ravens His boots squished when he moved My feet are soaked through he admitted miserably When I climbed off my horse I stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees

Take off your boots and dry your stockings I’ll find some dry wood If the ground’s not wet under the rock we might be able to get a fire burning Jon showed Sam the rabbit And we’ll feast

Won’t you be attending Lord Mormont in the hall

No but you will The Old Bear wants you to map for him Craster says he’ll find Mance Rayder for us

Oh Sam did not look anxious to meet Craster even if it meant a warm fire

He said eat first though Dry your feet Jon went to gather fuel digging down under deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until he found likely kindling Even then it seemed to take forever for a spark to catch He hung his cloak from the rock to keep the rain off his smoky little fire making them a small snug alcove

As he knelt to skin the rabbit Sam pulled off his boots I think there’s moss growing between my toes he declared mournfully wriggling the toes in question The rabbit will taste good I don’t even mind about the blood and all He looked away Well only a little…

Jon spitted the carcass banked the fire with a pair of rocks and balanced their meal atop them The rabbit had been a scrawny thing but as it cooked it smelled like a king’s feast Other rangers gave them envious looks Even Ghost looked up hungrily flames shining in his red eyes as he sniffed You had yours before Jon reminded him

Is Craster as savage as the rangers say Sam asked The rabbit was a shade underdone but tasted wonderful What’s his castle like

A midden heap with a roof and a firepit Jon told Sam what he had seen and heard in Craster’s Keep

By the time the telling was done it was dark outside and Sam was licking his fingers That was good but now I’d like a leg of lamb A whole leg just for me sauced with mint and honey and cloves Did you see any lambs

There was a sheepfold but no sheep

How does he feed all his men

I didn’t see any men Just Craster and his women and a few small girls I wonder he’s able to hold the place His defenses were nothing to speak of only a muddy dike You had better go up to the hall and draw that map Can you find the way

If I don’t fall in the mud Sam struggled back into his boots collected quill and parchment and shouldered out into the night the rain pattering down on his cloak and floppy hat

Ghost laid his head on his paws and went to sleep by the fire Jon stretched out beside him grateful for the warmth He was cold and wet but not so cold and wet as he’d been a short time before Perhaps tonight the Old Bear will learn something that will lead us to Uncle Benjen

He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air When he moved his bones ached Ghost was gone the fire burnt out Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he’d hung over the rock and found it stiff and frozen He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal

The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone Every blade of grass was carved from emerald every drip of water turned to diamond Flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen Through the shimmering greenery the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice

So there is magic beyond the Wall after all He found himself thinking of his sisters perhaps because he’d dreamed of them last night Sansa would call this an enchantment and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it but Arya would run out laughing and shouting wanting to touch it all

Lord Snow he heard Soft and meek He turned

Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her Sam’s cloak Jon realized at once Why is she wearing Sam’s cloak The fat one told me I’d find you here m’lord she said

We ate the rabbit if that’s what you came for The admission made him feel absurdly guilty

Old Lord Crow him with the talking bird he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits Her arms closed over the swell of her belly Is it true m’lord Are you brother to a king

A half brother he admitted I’m Ned Stark’s bastard My brother Robb is the King in the North Why are you here

The fat one that Sam he said to see you He give me his cloak so no one would say I didn’t belong
