with the very latest in VLSI technology
Packaged in the Speak n Spell toy Figure 117 it was a striking demonstration
of imagination and prowess in integrated electronics

It gave TI a long lead over its competitors and surprised many experts
in the speech field

Overnight it seemed digital speech technology had descended from
research laboratories with their expensive and specialized equipment into
a 5000 consumer item

Naturally TI did not sell the chip separately but only as part of their
mass-market product nor would they make available information on how to
drive it directly
Only recently when other similar devices appeared on the market did they
unbundle the package and sell the chip
rh The Speak n Spell toy
The TI chip TMC0280 uses the linear predictive method of synthesis
primarily because of the ease of the speech analysis procedure and the known
high quality at low data rates
Speech researchers incidentally sometimes scoff at what they perceive to be
the poor quality of the toys speech but considering the data rate
used which averages 1200 bits per second of speech it is remarkably good
Anyway I have never heard a child complain em although it is not uncommon
to misunderstand a word
Two 128 Kbit read-only memories are used in the toy to hold data for about
330 words and phrases em lasting between 3 and 4 minutes em of speech
At the time mid-1978 these memories were the largest that were available
in the industry
The data flow and user dialogue are handled by a microprocessor
which is the fourth LSI circuit in the photograph of Figure 118

A schematic diagram of the toy is given in Figure 119
FC Figure 119
It has a small display which shows upper-case letters
Some teachers of spelling hold that the lack of lower case destroys
any educational value that the toy may have  It
has a full 26-key alphanumeric keyboard with 14 additional control keys
This is the toys Achilles heel for the keys fall out after extended use
More recent toys from TI use an improved keyboard  The
keyboard is laid out alphabetically instead of in QWERTY order possibly
missing an opportunity to teach kids to type as well as spell
An internal connector permits vocabulary expansion with up to 14 more
read-only memory chips
Controlling the toy is a 4-bit microprocessor a modified TMS1000
However the synthesizer chip does not receive data from the processor
During speech it accesses the memory directly and only returns control
to the processor when an end-of-phrase marker is found in the data stream
Meanwhile the processor is idle and cannot even be interrupted from the
keyboard
Moreover in one operational mode say-it the toy embarks upon a long
monologue and remains deaf to the keyboard em it cannot even be turned off
Any three-year-old will quickly discover that a sharp slap solves the problem
A useful feature is that the device switches itself off if unused for more
than a few minutes
A fascinating account of the development of the toy from the point of view
of product design and market assessment has been published

rh Control parameters
The lattice filtering method of linear predictive synthesis see Chapter 6
was selected because of its good stability properties and guaranteed
performance with small word sizes
The lattice has 10 stages
All the control parameters are represented as 10-bit fixed-point numbers
and the lattice operates with an internal precision of 14 bits including
sign
pp
There are twelve parameters for the device  ten reflection coefficients
energy and pitch
These are updated every 20 msec
However if 10-bit values were stored for each a data rate of 120 bits
every 20 msec or 6 Kbits would be needed
This would reduce the capacity of the two read-only memory chips to well
under a minute of speech em perhaps 65 words and phrases
But one of the desirable properties of the reflection coefficients
which drive the lattice filter is that they are amenable to quantization
A non-linear quantization scheme is used with the parameter data addressing
an on-chip quantization table to yield a 10-bit coefficient
pp
Table 116 shows the number of bits devoted to each parameter
