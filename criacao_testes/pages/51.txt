LORD had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the
people

431 And the people believed and when they heard that the LORD had
visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their
affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped

51 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh Thus
saith the LORD God of Israel Let my people go that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness

52 And Pharaoh said Who is the LORD that I should obey his voice to
let Israel go I know not the LORD neither will I let Israel go

53 And they said The God of the Hebrews hath met with us let us go
we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto
the LORD our God lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the
sword

54 And the king of Egypt said unto them Wherefore do ye Moses and
Aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens

55 And Pharaoh said Behold the people of the land now are many and
ye make them rest from their burdens

56 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people
and their officers saying 57 Ye shall no more give the people straw
to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for
themselves

58 And the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye
shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be
idle therefore they cry saying Let us go and sacrifice to our God

59 Let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour
therein and let them not regard vain words

510 And the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers
and they spake to the people saying Thus saith Pharaoh I will not
give you straw

511 Go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished

512 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw

513 And the taskmasters hasted them saying Fulfil your works your
daily tasks as when there was straw

514 And the officers of the children of Israel which Pharaohs
taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded Wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
day as heretofore  515 Then the officers of the children of Israel
came and cried unto Pharaoh saying Wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy servants  516 There is no straw given unto thy servants and
they say to us Make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but
the fault is in thine own people

517 But he said Ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say Let us
go and do sacrifice to the LORD

518 Go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given
you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks

519 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
in evil case after it was said Ye shall not minish ought from your
bricks of your daily task

520 And they met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way as they came
forth from Pharaoh 521 And they said unto them The LORD look upon
you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the
eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in
their hand to slay us

522 And Moses returned unto the LORD and said LORD wherefore hast
thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me
523 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done
evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all

61 Then the LORD said unto Moses Now shalt thou see what I will do
to Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land

62 And God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the LORD 63
And I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name
of God Almighty but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them

64 And I have also established my covenant with them to give them
the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were
strangers

65 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom
the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my covenant

66 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the LORD and I
will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will
rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched
out arm and with great judgments 67 And I will take you to me for a
people and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the
