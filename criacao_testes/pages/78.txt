He is proud He may be too shamed to come back

Jorah laughed Where else should he go If he cannot find the khalasar the khalasar will most surely find him It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea child

Dany saw the truth of that The khalasar was like a city on the march but it did not march blindly Always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies while outriders guarded their flanks They missed nothing not here in this land the place where they had come from These plains were a part of them… and of her now

I hit him she said wonder in her voice Now that it was over it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed Ser Jorah do you think… he’ll be so angry when he gets back… She shivered I woke the dragon didn’t I

Ser Jorah snorted Can you wake the dead girl Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon and he died on the Trident Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake

His blunt words startled her It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question You… you swore him your sword…

That I did girl Ser Jorah said And if your brother is the shadow of a snake what does that make his servants His voice was bitter

He is still the true king He is…

Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her Truth now Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne

Dany thought about that He would not be a very good king would he

There have been worse… but not many The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again

Dany rode close beside him Still she said the common people are waiting for him Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them

The common people pray for rain healthy children and a summer that never ends Ser Jorah told her It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones so long as they are left in peace He gave a shrug They never are

Dany rode along quietly for a time working his words like a puzzle box It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them Yet the more she thought on Jorah’s words the more they rang of truth

What do you pray for Ser Jorah she asked him

Home he said His voice was thick with longing

I pray for home too she told him believing it

Ser Jorah laughed Look around you then Khaleesi

But it was not the plains Dany saw then It was King’s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built It was Dragonstone where she had been born In her mind’s eye they burned with a thousand lights a fire blazing in every window In her mind’s eye all the doors were red

My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms Dany said She had known that for a long time she realized She had known it all her life Only she had never let herself say the words even in a whisper but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear

Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look You think not

He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one Dany said He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake The Dothraki make mock of his weakness He will never take us home

Wise child The knight smiled

I am no child she told him fiercely Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount rousing the silver to a gallop Faster and faster she raced leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face By the time she reached the khalasar it was dusk

The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool She could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill Soon there would be laughter when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today By the time Viserys came limping back among them every man woman and child in the camp would know him for a walker There were no secrets in the khalasar

Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent It was cool and dim beneath the silk As she let the door flap close behind her Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon’s eggs across the tent For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes She blinked and they were gone

Stone she told herself They are only stone even Illyrio said so the dragons are all dead She put her palm against the black egg fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell The stone was warm Almost hot The sun Dany whispered The sun warmed them as they rode
