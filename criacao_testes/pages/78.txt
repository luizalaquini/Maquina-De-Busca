319 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the
laver and his foot 3110 And the cloths of service and the holy
garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to
minister in the priests office 3111 And the anointing oil and
sweet incense for the holy place according to all that I have
commanded thee shall they do

3112 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3113 Speak thou also
unto the children of Israel saying Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep
for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that
ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you

3114 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever
doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his
people

3115 Six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of
rest holy to the LORD whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day
he shall surely be put to death

3116 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath to
observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual
covenant

3117 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever for
in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he
rested and was refreshed

3118 And he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of communing
with him upon mount Sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone
written with the finger of God

321 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and
said unto him Up make us gods which shall go before us for as for
this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we
wot not what is become of him

322 And Aaron said unto them Break off the golden earrings which
are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters
and bring them unto me

323 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
their ears and brought them unto Aaron

324 And he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a
graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said These
be thy gods O Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt

325 And when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron
made proclamation and said To morrow is a feast to the LORD

326 And they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt
offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat
and to drink and rose up to play

327 And the LORD said unto Moses Go get thee down for thy people
which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted
themselves 328 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped
it and have sacrificed thereunto and said These be thy gods O
Israel which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt

329 And the LORD said unto Moses I have seen this people and
behold it is a stiffnecked people 3210 Now therefore let me alone
that my wrath may wax hot against them and that I may consume them
and I will make of thee a great nation

3211 And Moses besought the LORD his God and said LORD why doth
thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth
out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
3212 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say For mischief did
he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them
from the face of the earth Turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of
this evil against thy people

3213 Remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to whom thou
swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them I will multiply your
seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever

3214 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
his people

3215 And Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two
tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on
both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written

3216 And the tables were the work of God and the writing was the
writing of God graven upon the tables

3217 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted
he said unto Moses There is a noise of war in the camp

3218 And he said It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the
noise of them that sing do I hear

3219 And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that
