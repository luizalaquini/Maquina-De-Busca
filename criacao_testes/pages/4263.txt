FG Table 13  Making contact with the telephone enquiry system
pp
Advantage is taken of the disparate speeds of input keyboard and
output speech to hasten the dialogue by imposing a question-answer structure
on it with the computer taking the initiative  The machine can
afford to be slightly verbose if by so doing it makes the callers
response easier and therefore more rapid  Moreover operators who
are experienced enough with the system to anticipate questions can
easily forestall them just by typing ahead for the computer is programmed
to examine its input buffer before issuing prompts and to suppress them if
input has already been provided
pp
An important aim of the system is to allow application programmers with no
special knowledge of speech to write independent services for it
Table 14 shows an example of the use of one such application program

FG Table 14  The Stores Information Service
the
Stores Information Service which permits enquiries to be made of a database
holding information on electronic components kept in stock
This subsystem is driven by
ul
alphanumeric
data entered on the touch-tone keypad  Two or three letters are associated
with each digit in a manner which is fairly standard in touch-tone telephone
applications  These are printed on a card overlay
that fits the keypad see Figure 13  Although true alphanumeric data entry
would require a multiple key press for each character
the ambiguity inherent in
a single-key-per-character convention can usually be resolved by the computer
if it has a list of permissible entries  For example the component names
SN7406 and ZTX300 are read by the machine as 767406 and 189300 respectively
Confusion rarely occurs if the machine is expecting a valid component code
The same holds true of peoples names and file names em although with these
one must take care not to identify a series of files by similar names like
TX38A TX38B TX38C  It is easy for the machine to detect the rare cases
where ambiguity occurs and respond by requesting further information  The
component name is SN7406  Is this correct  In fact the Stores Information
Service illustrated in Table 14 is defective in that it
ul
always
requests confirmation of an entry even when no ambiguity exists  The
