We’ll have our own hostage Tyrion said A council seat was also part of the bargain Unless Prince Doran brings an army when he comes to claim it he’ll be putting himself in our power

Would that a council seat were all Martell came to claim Lord Tywin said You promised him vengeance as well

I promised him justice

Call it what you will It still comes down to blood

Not an item in short supply surely I splashed through lakes of it during the battle Tyrion saw no reason not to cut to the heart of the matter Or have you grown so fond of Gregor Clegane that you cannot bear to part with him

Ser Gregor has his uses as did his brother Every lord has need of a beast from time to time… a lesson you seem to have learned judging from Ser Bronn and those clansmen of yours

Tyrion thought of Timett’s burned eye Shagga with his axe Chella in her necklace of dried ears And Bronn Bronn most of all The woods are full of beasts he reminded his father The alleyways as well

True Perhaps other dogs would hunt as well I shall think on it If there is nothing else…

You have important letters yes Tyrion rose on unsteady legs closed his eyes for an instant as a wave of dizziness washed over him and took a shaky step toward the door Later he would reflect that he should have taken a second and then a third Instead he turned What do I want you ask I’ll tell you what I want I want what is mine by rights I want Casterly Rock

His father’s mouth grew hard Your brother’s birthright

The knights of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry to father children and to hold land you know that as well as I The day Jaime put on that white cloak he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock but never once have you acknowledged it It’s past time I want you to stand up before the realm and proclaim that I am your son and your lawful heir

Lord Tywin’s eyes were a pale green flecked with gold as luminous as they were merciless Casterly Rock he declared in a flat cold dead tone And then Never

The word hung between them huge sharp poisoned

I knew the answer before I asked Tyrion thought Eighteen years since Jaime joined the Kingsguard and I never once raised the issue I must have known I must always have known Why he made himself ask though he knew he would rue the question

You ask that You who killed your mother to come into the world You are an ill-made devious disobedient spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine To teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him But neither gods nor men shall ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse

My whorehouse The dawn broke Tyrion understood all at once where this bile had come from He ground his teeth together and said Cersei told you about Alayaya

Is that her name I confess I cannot remember the names of all your whores Who was the one you married as a boy

Tysha He spat out the answer defiant

And that camp follower on the Green Fork

Why do you care he asked unwilling even to speak Shae’s name in his presence

I don’t No more than I care if they live or die

It was you who had Yaya whipped It was not a question

Your sister told me of your threats against my grandsons Lord Tywin’s voice was colder than ice Did she lie

Tyrion would not deny it I made threats yes To keep Alayaya safe So the Kettleblacks would not misuse her

To save a whore’s virtue you threatened your own House your own kin Is that the way of it

You were the one who taught me that a good threat is often more telling than a blow Not that Joffrey hasn’t tempted me sore a few hundred times If you’re so anxious to whip people start with him But Tommen… why would I harm Tommen He’s a good lad and mine own blood

As was your mother Lord Tywin rose abruptly to tower over his dwarf son Go back to your bed Tyrion and speak to me no more of your rights to Casterly Rock You shall have your reward but it shall be one I deem appropriate to your service and station And make no mistake—this was the last time I will suffer you to bring shame onto House Lannister You are done with whores The next one I find in your bed I’ll hang
