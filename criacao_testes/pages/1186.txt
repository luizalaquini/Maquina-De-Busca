I will not suffer to be called a whore

Why sister he never claims Jaime paid you Tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again There had been some niggling phrase…Done in the Light of the Lord he read A queer choice of words that

Pycelle cleared his throat These words often appear in letters and documents from the Free Cities They mean no more than let us say written in the sight of god The god of the red priests It is their usage I do believe

Varys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a red priest Littlefinger reminded them

Tyrion tapped the paper And now it would seem her lord husband has done the same We can use that against him Urge the High Septon to reveal how Stannis has turned against the gods as well as his rightful king…

Yes yes the queen said impatiently but first we must stop this filth from spreading further The council must issue an edict Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joff a bastard should lose his tongue for it

A prudent measure said Grand Maester Pycelle his chain of office clinking as he nodded

A folly sighed Tyrion When you tear out a man’s tongue you are not proving him a liar you’re only telling the world that you fear what he might say

So what would you have us do his sister demanded

Very little Let them whisper they’ll grow bored with the tale soon enough Any man with a thimble of sense will see it for a clumsy attempt to justify usurping the crown Does Stannis offer proof How could he when it never happened Tyrion gave his sister his sweetest smile

That’s so she had to say Still…

Your Grace your brother has the right of this Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers If we attempt to silence this talk we only lend it credence Better to treat it with contempt like the pathetic lie it is And meantime fight fire with fire

Cersei gave him a measuring look What sort of fire

A tale of somewhat the same nature perhaps But more easily believed Lord Stannis has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife Not that I fault him I’d do the same were I married to Lady Selyse Nonetheless if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold well… the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords particularly those as stern sour and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon

He has never been much loved that’s true Cersei considered a moment So we pay him back in his own coin Yes I like this Who can we name as Lady Selyse’s lover She has two brothers I believe And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this time…

Ser Axell Florent is her castellan Loath as Tyrion was to admit it Littlefinger’s scheme had promise Stannis had never been enamored of his wife but he was bristly as a hedgehog where his honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature If they could sow discord between him and his followers it could only help their cause The child has the Florent ears I’m told

Littlefinger gestured languidly A trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord Stannis must love his daughter very well since he’d erected hundreds of statues of her all along the walls of Dragonstone ‘My lord’ I had to tell him ‘those are gargoyles’ He chuckled Ser Axell might serve for Shireen’s father but in my experience the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated Stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool a lackwit with a tattooed face

Grand Maester Pycelle gaped at him aghast Surely you do not mean to suggest that Lady Selyse would bring a fool into her bed

You’d have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse Florent said Littlefinger Doubtless Patchface reminded her of Stannis And the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth enough to give a listener pause As it happens this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and follows her everywhere They even look somewhat alike Shireen has a mottled half-frozen face as well

Pycelle was lost But that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe poor thing

I like my tale better said Littlefinger and so will the smallfolk Most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant her child will be born with long floppy ears

Cersei smiled the sort of smile she customarily reserved for Jaime Lord Petyr you are a wicked creature

Thank you Your Grace

And a most accomplished liar Tyrion added less warmly This one is more dangerous than I knew he reflected

Littlefinger’s grey-green eyes met the dwarf’s mismatched stare with no hint of unease We all have our gifts my lord

The queen was too caught up in her revenge to take note of the exchange Cuckolded by a halfwit fool Stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea

The story should not come from us Tyrion said or it will be seen for a self-serving lie Which it is to be sure

Once more Littlefinger supplied the answer Whores love to gossip and as it happens I own a brothel or three And no doubt Varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and pot-shops

Varys Cersei said frowning Where is Varys

I have been wondering about that myself Your Grace

The Spider spins his secret webs day and night Grand Maester Pycelle said ominously I mistrust that one my lords

And he speaks so kindly of you Tyrion pushed himself off his chair As it happened he knew what the eunuch was about but it was nothing the other councillors needed to hear Pray excuse me my lords Other business calls

Cersei was instantly suspicious King’s business

Nothing you need trouble yourself about

I’ll be the judge of that

Would you spoil my surprise Tyrion said I’m having a gift made for Joffrey A little chain

What does he need with another chain He has gold chains and silver more than he can wear If you think for a moment you can buy Joff’s love with gifts—

Why surely I have the king’s love as he has mine And this chain I believe he may one day treasure above all others The little man bowed and waddled to the door

Bronn was waiting outside the council chambers to escort him back to the Tower of the Hand The smiths are in your audience chamber waiting your pleasure he said as they crossed the ward

Waiting my pleasure I like the ring of that Bronn You almost sound a proper courtier Next you’ll be kneeling

Fuck you dwarf

That’s Shae’s task Tyrion heard Lady Tanda calling to him merrily from the top of the serpentine steps Pretending not to notice her he waddled a bit faster See that my litter is readied I’ll be leaving the castle as soon as I’m done here Two of the Moon Brothers had the door guard Tyrion greeted them pleasantly and grimaced before starting up the stairs The climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache

Within he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed his squire such that he was Podrick Payne was so shy he was furtive Tyrion had never quite gotten over the suspicion that his father had inflicted the boy on him as a joke

Your garb my lord the boy mumbled when Tyrion entered staring down at his boots Even when he worked up the courage to speak Pod could never quite manage to look at you For the audience And your chain The Hand’s chain

Very good Help me dress The doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in the shape of lions’ heads the chain a loop of solid gold hands the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold cut to his height On a normal man it would be no more than a half cape

The Hand’s private audience chamber was not so large as the king’s nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room but Tyrion liked its Myrish rugs wall hangings and sense of intimacy As he entered his steward cried out Tyrion Lannister Hand of the King He liked that too The gaggle of smiths armorers and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell to their knees

He hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them rise Goodmen I know you are all busy so I will be succinct Pod if you please The boy handed him a canvas sack Tyrion yanked the drawstring and upended the bag Its contents spilled onto the rug with a muffled thunk of metal on wool I had these made at the castle forge I want a thousand more just like them

One of the smiths knelt to inspect the object three immense steel links twisted together A mighty chain

Mighty but short the dwarf replied Somewhat like me I fancy one a good deal longer Do you have a name

They call me Ironbelly m’lord The smith was squat and broad plainly dressed in wool and leather but his arms were as thick as a bull’s neck
