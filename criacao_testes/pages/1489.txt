Tyrion laughed in his face Those were the same terms Cersei offered Eddard Stark We all know how that ended

Your father had no part in that

That much was true at least Castle Black teems with murderers thieves and rapists Tyrion said but I don’t recall meeting many regicides while I was there You expect me to believe that if I admit to being a kinslayer and kingslayer my father will simply nod forgive me and pack me off to the Wall with some warm woolen smallclothes He hooted rudely

Naught was said of forgiveness Ser Kevan said sternly A confession would put this matter to rest It is for that reason your father sends me with this offer

Thank him kindly for me Uncle said Tyrion but tell him I am not presently in a confessing mood

Were I you I’d change my mood Your sister wants your head and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to give it to her

So one of my judges has already condemned me without hearing a word in my defense It was no more than he expected Will I still be allowed to speak and present witnesses

You have no witnesses his uncle reminded him Tyrion if you are guilty of this enormity the Wall is a kinder fate than you deserve And if you are blameless… there is fighting in the north I know but even so it will be a safer place for you than King’s Landing whatever the outcome of this trial The mob is convinced of your guilt Were you so foolish as to venture out into the streets they would tear you limb from limb

I can see how much that prospect upsets you

You are my brother’s son

You might remind him of that

Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you were not his own blood and Joanna’s Tywin seems a hard man to you I know but he is no harder than he’s had to be Our own father was gentle and amiable but so weak his bannermen mocked him in their cups Some saw fit to defy him openly Other lords borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay it At court they japed of toothless lions Even his mistress stole from him A woman scarcely one step above a whore and she helped herself to my mother’s jewels It fell to Tywin to restore House Lannister to its proper place Just as it fell to him to rule this realm when he was no more than twenty He bore that heavy burden for twenty years and all it earned him was a mad king’s envy Instead of the honor he deserved he was made to suffer slights beyond count yet he gave the Seven Kingdoms peace plenty and justice He is a just man You would be wise to trust him

Tyrion blinked in astonishment Ser Kevan had always been solid stolid pragmatic he had never heard him speak with such fervor before You love him

He is my brother

I… I will think on what you’ve said

Think carefully then And quickly

He thought of little else that night but come morning was no closer to deciding if his father could be trusted A servant brought him porridge and honey to break his fast but all he could taste was bile at the thought of confession They will call me kinslayer till the end of my days For a thousand years or more if I am remembered at all it will be as the monstrous dwarf who poisoned his young nephew at his wedding feast The thought made him so bloody angry that he flung the bowl and spoon across the room and left a smear of porridge on the wall Ser Addam Marbrand looked at it curiously when he came to escort Tyrion to trial but had the good grace not to inquire

Lord Varys the herald said master of whisperers

Powdered primped and smelling of rosewater the Spider rubbed his hands one over the other all the time he spoke Washing my life away Tyrion thought as he listened to the eunuch’s mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the Hound’s protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tommen as king Half-truths are worth more than outright lies And unlike the others Varys had documents parchments painstakingly filled with notes details dates whole conversations So much material that its recitation took all day and so much of it damning Varys confirmed Tyrion’s midnight visit to Grand Maester Pycelle’s chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions confirmed the threat he’d made to Cersei the night of their supper confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself When Prince Oberyn asked him how he could possibly know all this not having been present at any of these events the eunuch only giggled and said My little birds told me Knowing is their purpose and mine

How do I question a little bird thought Tyrion I should have had the eunuch’s head off my first day in King’s Landing Damn him And damn me for whatever trust I put in him

Have we heard it all Lord Tywin asked his daughter as Varys left the hall

Almost said Cersei I beg your leave to bring one final witness before you on the morrow

As you wish Lord Tywin said

Oh good thought Tyrion savagely After this farce of a trial execution will almost come as a relief

That night as he sat by his window drinking he heard voices outside his door Ser Kevan come for my answer he thought at once but it was not his uncle who entered

Tyrion rose to give Prince Oberyn a mocking bow Are judges permitted to visit the accused

Princes are permitted to go where they will Or so I told your guards The Red Viper took a seat

My father will be displeased with you

The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on my list of concerns Is it Dornish wine you’re drinking

From the Arbor

Oberyn made a face Red water Did you poison him

No Did you

The prince smiled Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours Someone is going to cut it out one of these days

You are not the first to tell me that Perhaps I should cut it out myself it seems to make no end of trouble

So I’ve seen I think I may drink some of Lord Redwyne’s grape juice after all

As you like Tyrion served him a cup

The man took a sip sloshed it about in his mouth and swallowed It will serve for the moment I will send you up some strong Dornish wine on the morrow He took another sip I have turned up that golden-haired whore I was hoping for

So you found Chataya’s

At Chataya’s I bedded the black-skinned girl Alayaya I believe she is called Exquisite despite the stripes on her back But the whore I referred to is your sister

Has she seduced you yet Tyrion asked unsurprised

Oberyn laughed aloud No but she will if I meet her price The queen has even hinted at marriage Her Grace needs another husband and who better than a prince of Dorne Ellaria believes I should accept Just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes her wet the randy wench And we should not even need to pay the dwarf’s penny All your sister requires from me is one head somewhat overlarge and missing a nose

And said Tyrion waiting

By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine and said When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne so long ago he left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear This Tyrell moved with his tail from keep to keep chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent He would arrive in force take a castle for his own stay a moon’s turn and ride on to the next castle It was his custom to turn the lords out of their own chambers and take their beds for himself One night he found himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy A sash hung down near the pillows should he wish to summon a wench He had a taste for Dornish women this Lord Tyrell and who can blame him So he pulled upon the sash and when he did the canopy above him split open and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon his head His death lit a fire that soon swept across Dorne undoing all the Young Dragon’s victories in a fortnight The kneeling men stood up and we were free again

I know the tale said Tyrion What of it

Just this If I should ever find a sash beside my own bed and pull on it I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty

Tyrion grinned We have that much in common then

To be sure I have much to thank your sister for If not for her accusation at the feast it might well be you judging me instead of me judging you The prince’s eyes were dark with amusement Who knows more of poison than the Red Viper of Dorne after all Who has better reason to want to keep the Tyrells far from the crown And with Joffrey in his grave by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his sister Myrcella who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew thanks to you

Dornish law does not apply Tyrion had been so ensnared in his own troubles that he’d never stopped to consider the succession My father will crown Tommen count on that

He may indeed crown Tommen here in King’s Landing Which is not to say that my brother may not crown Myrcella down in Sunspear Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your nephew Will your sister He gave a shrug Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all on the condition that she support her daughter over her son Do you think she would

Never Tyrion wanted to say but the word caught in his throat Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of her sex If Dornish law applied in the west she would be the heir to Casterly Rock in her own right She and Jaime were twins but Cersei had come first into the world and that was all it took By championing Myrcella’s cause she would be championing her own I do not know how my sister would choose between Tommen and Myrcella he admitted It makes no matter My father will never give her that choice
