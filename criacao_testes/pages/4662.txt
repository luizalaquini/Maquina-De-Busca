She is well As is your    nephew Bolton paused before he said nephew a pause that said I know Your brother also lives though he took a wound in the battle He beckoned to a dour northman in a studded brigantine Escort Ser Jaime to Qyburn And unbind this woman’s hands As the rope between Brienne’s wrists was slashed in two he said Pray forgive us my lady In such troubled times it is hard to know friend from foe

Brienne rubbed inside her wrist where the hemp had scraped her skin bloody My lord these men tried to rape me

Did they Lord Bolton turned his pale eyes on Vargo Hoat I am displeased By that and this of Ser Jaime’s hand

There were five northmen and as many Freys in the yard for every Brave Companion The goat might not be as clever as some but he could count that high at least He held his tongue

They took my sword Brienne said my armor   

You shall have no need of armor here my lady Lord Bolton told her In Harrenhal you are under my protection Amabel find suitable rooms for the Lady Brienne Walton you will see to Ser Jaime at once He did not wait for an answer but turned and climbed the steps his fur-trimmed cloak swirling behind Jaime had only enough time to exchange a quick look with Brienne before they were marched away separately

In the maester’s chambers beneath the rookery a grey-haired fatherly man named Qyburn sucked in his breath when he cut away the linen from the stump of Jaime’s hand

That bad Will I die

Qyburn pushed at the wound with a finger and wrinkled his nose at the gush of pus No Though in a few more days    He sliced away Jaime’s sleeve The corruption has spread See how tender the flesh is I must cut it all away The safest course would be to take the arm off

Then you’ll die Jaime promised Clean the stump and sew it up I’ll take my chances

Qyburn frowned I can leave you the upper arm make the cut at your elbow but   

Take any part of my arm and you’d best chop off the other one as well or I’ll strangle you with it afterward

Qyburn looked in his eyes Whatever he saw there gave him pause Very well I will cut away the rotten flesh no more Try to burn out the corruption with boiling wine and a poultice of nettle mustard seed and bread mold Mayhaps that will suffice It is on your head You will want milk of the poppy—

No Jaime dare not let himself be put to sleep he might be short an arm when he woke no matter what the man said

Qyburn was taken aback There will be pain

I’ll scream

A great deal of pain

I’ll scream very loudly

Will you take some wine at least

Does the High Septon ever pray

Of that I am not certain I shall bring the wine Lie back I must needs strap down your arm

With a bowl and a sharp blade Qyburn cleaned the stump while Jaime gulped down strongwine spilling it all over himself in the process His left hand did not seem to know how to find his mouth but there was something to be said for that The smell of wine in his sodden beard helped disguise the stench of pus

Nothing helped when the time came to pare away the rotten flesh Jaime did scream then and pounded his table with his good fist over and over and over again He screamed again when Qyburn poured boiling wine over what remained of his stump Despite all his vows and all his fears he lost consciousness for a time When he woke the maester was sewing at his arm with needle and catgut I left a flap of skin to fold back over your wrist

You have done this before muttered Jaime weakly He could taste blood in his mouth where he’d bitten his tongue

No man who serves with Vargo Hoat is a stranger to stumps He makes them wherever he goes

Qyburn did not look a monster Jaime thought He was spare and soft-spoken with warm brown eyes How does a maester come to ride with the Brave Companions

The Citadel took my chain Qyburn put away his needle I should do something about that wound above your eye as well The flesh is badly inflamed

Jaime closed his eyes and let the wine and Qyburn do their work Tell me of the battle As keeper of Harrenhal’s ravens Qyburn would have been the first to hear the news

Lord Stannis was caught between your father and the fire It’s said the Imp set the river itself aflame

Jaime saw green flames reaching up into the sky higher than the tallest towers as burning men screamed in the streets I have dreamed this dream before It was almost funny but there was no one to share the joke

Open your eye Qyburn soaked a cloth in warm water and dabbed at the crust of dried blood The eyelid was swollen but Jaime found he could force it open halfway Qyburn’s face loomed above How did you come by this one the maester asked

A wench’s gift

Rough wooing my lord

This wench is bigger than me and uglier than you You’d best see to her as well She’s still limping on the leg I pricked when we fought

I will ask after her What is this woman to you

My protector Jaime had to laugh no matter how it hurt

I’ll grind some herbs you can mix with wine to bring down your fever Come back on the morrow and I’ll put a leech on your eye to drain the bad blood

A leech Lovely

Lord Bolton is very fond of leeches Qyburn said primly

Yes said Jaime He would be





TYRION

Nothing remained beyond the King’s Gate but mud and ashes and bits of burned bone yet already there were people living in the shadow of the city walls and others selling fish from barrows and barrels Tyrion felt their eyes on him as he rode past chilly eyes angry and unsympathetic No one dared speak to him or try to bar his way not with Bronn beside him in oiled black mail If I were alone though they would pull me down and smash my face in with a cobblestone as they did for Preston Greenfield

They come back quicker than the rats he complained We burned them out once you’d think they’d take that as a lesson

Give me a few dozen gold cloaks and I’ll kill them all said Bronn Once they’re dead they don’t come back

No but others come in their places Leave them be    but if they start throwing up hovels against the wall again pull them down at once The war’s not done yet no matter what these fools may think He spied the Mud Gate up ahead I have seen enough for now We’ll return on the morrow with the guild masters to go over their plans He sighed Well I burned most of this I suppose it’s only just that I rebuild it

That task was to have been his uncle’s but solid steady tireless Ser Kevan Lannister had not been himself since the raven had come from Riverrun with word of his son’s murder Willem’s twin Martyn had been taken captive by Robb Stark as well and their elder brother Lancel was still abed beset by an ulcerating wound that would not heal With one son dead and two more in mortal danger Ser Kevan was consumed by grief and fear Lord Tywin had always relied on his brother but now he had no choice but to turn again to his dwarf son

The cost of rebuilding was going to be ruinous but there was no help for that King’s Landing was the realm’s principal harbor rivaled only by Oldtown The river had to be reopened and the sooner the better And where am I going to find the bloody coin It was almost enough to make him miss Littlefinger who had sailed north a fortnight past While he beds Lysa Arryn and rules the Vale beside her I get to clean up the mess he left behind him Though at least his father was giving him significant work to do He won’t name me heir to Casterly Rock but he’ll make use of me wherever he can Tyrion thought as a captain of gold cloaks waved them through the Mud Gate

The Three Whores still dominated the market square inside the gate but they stood idle now and the boulders and barrels of pitch had all been trundled away There were children climbing the towering wooden structures swarming up like monkeys in roughspun to perch on the throwing arms and hoot at each other
