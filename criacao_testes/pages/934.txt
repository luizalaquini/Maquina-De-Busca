Threats mean nothing He swears he did not do it

Oh he swears is that it And dwarfs don’t lie is that what you think

Not to me No more than you would

You great golden fool He’s lied to you a thousand times and so have I She bound up her hair again and scooped up the hairnet from the bedpost where she’d hung it Think what you will The little monster is in a black cell and soon Ser Ilyn will have his head off Perhaps you’d like it for a keepsake She glanced at the pillow He can watch over you as you sleep alone in that cold white bed Until his eyes rot out that is

You had best go Cersei You’re making me angry

Oh an angry cripple How terrifying She laughed A pity Lord Tywin Lannister never had a son I could have been the heir he wanted but I lacked the cock And speaking of such best tuck yours away brother It looks rather sad and small hanging from your breeches like that

When she was gone Jaime took her advice fumbling one-handed at his laces He felt a bone-deep ache in his phantom fingers I’ve lost a hand a father a son a sister and a lover and soon enough I will lose a brother And yet they keep telling me House Lannister won this war

Jaime donned his cloak and went downstairs where he found Ser Boros Blount having a cup of wine in the common room When you’re done with your drink tell Ser Loras I’m ready to see her

Ser Boros was too much of a coward to do much more than glower You are ready to see who

Just tell Loras

Aye Ser Boros drained his cup Aye Lord Commander

He took his own good time about it though or else the Knight of Flowers proved hard to find Several hours had passed by the time they arrived the slim handsome youth and the big ugly maid Jaime was sitting alone in the round room leafing idly through the White Book Lord Commander Ser Loras said you wished to see the Maid of Tarth

I did Jaime waved them closer with his left hand You have talked with her I take it

As you commanded my lord

And

The lad tensed I… it may be it happened as she says ser That it was Stannis I cannot be certain

Varys tells me that the castellan of Storm’s End perished strangely as well said Jaime

Ser Cortnay Penrose said Brienne sadly A good man

A stubborn man One day he stood square in the way of the King of Dragonstone The next he leapt from a tower Jaime stood Ser Loras we will talk more of this later You may leave Brienne with me

The wench looked as ugly and awkward as ever he decided when Tyrell left them Someone had dressed her in woman’s clothes again but this dress fit much better than that hideous pink rag the goat had made her wear Blue is a good color on you my lady Jaime observed It goes well with your eyes She does have astonishing eyes

Brienne glanced down at herself flustered Septa Donyse padded out the bodice to give it that shape She said you sent her to me She lingered by the door as if she meant to flee at any second You look…

Different He managed a half-smile More meat on the ribs and fewer lice in my hair that’s all The stump’s the same Close the door and come here

She did as he bid her The white cloak…

…is new but I’m sure I’ll soil it soon enough

That wasn’t… I was about to say that it becomes you

She came closer hesitant Jaime did you mean what you told Ser Loras About… about King Renly and the shadow

Jaime shrugged I would have killed Renly myself if we’d met in battle what do I care who cut his throat
