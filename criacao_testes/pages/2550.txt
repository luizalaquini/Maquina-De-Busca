bond with an oath 3011 And her husband heard it and held his peace
at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand

3012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her
vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband
hath made them void and the LORD shall forgive her

3013 Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her
husband may establish it or her husband may make it void

3014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to
day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are
upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the
day that he heard them

3015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
them then he shall bear her iniquity

3016 These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses between
a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in
her youth in her fathers house

311 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 312 Avenge the children
of Israel of the Midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy
people

313 And Moses spake unto the people saying Arm some of yourselves
unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the
LORD of Midian

314 Of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of Israel
shall ye send to the war

315 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a
thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war

316 And Moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war with the holy
instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand

317 And they warred against the Midianites as the LORD commanded
Moses and they slew all the males

318 And they slew the kings of Midian beside the rest of them that
were slain namely Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba five
kings of Midian Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword

319 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives
and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all
their flocks and all their goods

3110 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all
their goodly castles with fire

3111 And they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and
of beasts

3112 And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto
Moses and Eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the
children of Israel unto the camp at the plains of Moab which are by
Jordan near Jericho

3113 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the
congregation went forth to meet them without the camp

3114 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the
captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from
the battle

3115 And Moses said unto them Have ye saved all the women alive
3116 Behold these caused the children of Israel through the counsel
of Balaam to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor
and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD

3117 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill
every woman that hath known man by lying with him

3118 But all the women children that have not known a man by lying
with him keep alive for yourselves

3119 And do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath
killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both
yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day

3120 And purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and
all work of goats hair and all things made of wood

3121 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
the battle This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded
Moses 3122 Only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the
tin and the lead 3123 Every thing that may abide the fire ye shall
make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it
shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth
not the fire ye shall make go through the water

3124 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall
be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp
