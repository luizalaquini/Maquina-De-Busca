with Coin for the privilege of executing Snow after the war
and this unauthorized flight through the Capitol But not like
this I say Its been a complete disaster
I think it would be considered a highly successful
mission says Gale Weve infiltrated the enemy camp
showing that the Capitols defenses can be breached
Weve managed to get footage of ourselves all over the
Capitols news Weve thrown the whole city into chaos
trying to find us
Trust me Plutarchs thrilled Cressida adds
Thats because Plutarch doesnt care who dies I say
Not as long as his Games are a success
Cressida and Gale go round and round trying to
convince me Pollux nods at their words to back them up
Only Peeta doesnt offer an opinion
What do you think Peeta I finally ask him
I thinkyou still have no idea The effect you can
have He slides his cuffs up the support and pushes
himself to a sitting position None of the people we lost
were idiots They knew what they were doing They followed
you because they believed you really could kill Snow
I dont know why his voice reaches me when no one
elses can But if hes right and I think he is I owe the others
a debt that can only be repaid in one way I pull my paper
map from a pocket in my uniform and spread it out on the
floor with new resolve Where are we Cressida
Tigriss shop sits about five blocks from the City Circle
and Snows mansion Were in easy walking distance
through a zone in which the pods are deactivated for the
residents safety We have disguises that perhaps with
some embellishments from Tigriss furry stock could get us
safely there But then what The mansions sure to be
heavily guarded under round-the-clock camera
surveillance and laced with pods that could become live at
the flick of a switch
What we need is to get him out in the open Gale
says to me Then one of us could pick him off
Does he ever appear in public anymore asks
Peeta
I dont think so says Cressida At least in all the
recent speeches Ive seen hes been in the mansion Even
before the rebels got here I imagine he became more
vigilant after Finnick aired his crimes
Thats right Its not just the Tigrises of the Capitol who
hate Snow now but a web of people who know what he did
to their friends and families It would have to be something
bordering on miraculous to lure him out Something like
I bet hed come out for me I say If I were captured
Hed want that as public as possible Hed want my
execution on his front steps I let this sink in Then Gale
could shoot him from the audience
No Peeta shakes his head There are too many
alternative endings to that plan Snow might decide to keep
you and torture information out of you Or have you
executed publicly without being present Or kill you inside
the mansion and display your body out front
Gale I say
It seems like an extreme solution to jump to
immediately he says Maybe if all else fails Lets keep
thinking
In the quiet that follows we hear Tigriss soft footfall
overhead It must be closing time Shes locking up
fastening the shutters maybe A few minutes later the panel
at the top of the stairs slides open
Come up says a gravelly voice I have some food
for you Its the first time shes talked since we arrived
Whether its natural or from years of practice I dont know
but theres something in her manner of speaking that
suggests a cats purr
As we climb the stairs Cressida asks Did you
contact Plutarch Tigris
No way to Tigris shrugs Hell figure out youre in a
safe house Dont worry
Worry I feel immensely relieved by the news that I
wont be given--and have to ignore--direct orders from 13
Or make up some viable defense for the decisions Ive
made over the last couple of days
In the shop the counter holds some stale hunks of
bread a wedge of moldy cheese and half a bottle of
mustard It reminds me that not everyone in the Capitol has
full stomachs these days I feel obliged to tell Tigris about
our remaining food supplies but she waves my objections
away I eat next to nothing she says And then only raw
meat This seems a little too in character but I dont
question it I just scrape the mold off the cheese and divide
up the food among the rest of us
While we eat we watch the latest Capitol news
coverage The government has the rebel survivors
narrowed down to the five of us Huge bounties are offered
for information leading to our capture They emphasize how
dangerous we are Show us exchanging gunfire with the
Peacekeepers although not the mutts ripping off their
heads Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we left
her with my arrow still in her heart Someone has redone
her makeup for the cameras
The rebels let the Capitol broadcast run on
uninterrupted Have the rebels made a statement today I
ask Tigris She shakes her head I doubt Coin knows what
to do with me now that Im still alive
Tigris gives a throaty cackle No one knows what to
