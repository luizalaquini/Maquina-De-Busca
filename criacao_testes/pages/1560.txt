it go Plutarch he says Prim stays
So Katniss Peetas condition has come as a shock
to all of us says Plutarch We couldnt help but notice his
deterioration in the last two interviews Obviously hed
been abused and we put his psychological state down to
that Now we believe something more was going on That
the Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommon
technique known as hijacking Beetee
Im sorry Beetee says but I cant tell you all the
specifics of it Katniss The Capitols very secretive about
this form of torture and I believe the results are
inconsistent This we do know Its a type of fear
conditioning The term hijack comes from an old English
word that means to capture or even better seize We
believe it was chosen because the technique involves the
use of tracker jacker venom and the jack suggested
hijack You were stung in your first Hunger Games so
unlike most of us you have firsthand knowledge of the
effects of the venom
Terror Hallucinations Nightmarish visions of losing
those I love Because the venom targets the part of the
brain that houses fear
Im sure you remember how frightening it was Did you
also suffer mental confusion in the aftermath asks
Beetee A sense of being unable to judge what was true
and what was false Most people who have been stung
and lived to tell about it report something of the kind
Yes That encounter with Peeta Even after I was
clearheaded I wasnt sure if he had saved my life by taking
on Cato or if Id imagined it
Recall is made more difficult because memories can
be changed Beetee taps his forehead Brought to the
forefront of your mind altered and saved again in the
revised form Now imagine that I ask you to remember
something--either with a verbal suggestion or by making
you watch a tape of the event--and while that experience is
refreshed I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom Not
enough to induce a three-day blackout Just enough to
infuse the memory with fear and doubt And thats what your
brain puts in long-term storage
I start to feel sick Prim asks the question thats in my
mind Is that what theyve done to Peeta Taken his
memories of Katniss and distorted them so theyre scary
Beetee nods So scary that hed see her as lifethreatening
That he might try to kill her Yes thats our
current theory
I cover my face with my arms because this isnt
happening It isnt possible For someone to make Peeta
forget he loves meno one could do that
But you can reverse it right asks Prim
Umvery little data on that says Plutarch None
really If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted before
we have no access to those records
Well youre going to try arent you Prim persists
Youre not just going to lock him up in some padded room
and leave him to suffer
Of course well try Prim says Beetee Its just we
dont know to what degree well succeed If any My guess
is that fearful events are the hardest to root out Theyre the
ones we naturally remember the best after all
And apart from his memories of Katniss we dont yet
know what else has been tampered with says Plutarch
Were putting together a team of mental health and military
professionals to come up with a counterattack I personally
feel optimistic that hell make a full recovery
Do you asks Prim caustically And what do you
think Haymitch
I shift my arms slightly so I can see his expression
through the crack Hes exhausted and discouraged as he
admits I think Peeta might get somewhat better ButI
dont think hell ever be the same I snap my arms back
together closing the crack shutting them all out
At least hes alive says Plutarch as if hes losing
patience with the lot of us Snow executed Peetas stylist
and his prep team on live television tonight Weve no idea
what happened to Effie Trinket Peetas damaged but hes
here With us And thats a definite improvement over his
situation twelve hours ago Lets keep that in mind all
right
Plutarchs attempt to cheer me up--laced with the news
of another four possibly five murders--somehow backfires
Portia Peetas prep team Effie The effort to fight back
tears makes my throat throb until Im gasping again
Eventually they have no choice but to sedate me
When I wake I wonder if this will be the only way I
sleep now with drugs shot into my arm Im glad Im not
supposed to talk for the next few days because theres
nothing I want to say Or do In fact Im a model patient my
lethargy taken for restraint obedience to the doctors
orders I no longer feel like crying In fact I can only manage
to hold on to one simple thought an image of Snows face
accompanied by the whisper in my head I will kill you
My mother and Prim take turns nursing me coaxing
me to swallow bites of soft food People come in
periodically to give me updates on Peetas condition The
high levels of tracker jacker venom are working their way
out of his body Hes being treated only by strangers
natives of 13--no one from home or the Capitol has been
allowed to see him--to keep any dangerous memories from
triggering A team of specialists works long hours
