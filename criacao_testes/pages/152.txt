3216 And they came near unto him and said We will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle and cities for our little ones 3217 But we
ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel until we
have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in
the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land

3218 We will not return unto our houses until the children of Israel
have inherited every man his inheritance

3219 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan or
forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan
eastward

3220 And Moses said unto them If ye will do this thing if ye will
go armed before the LORD to war 3221 And will go all of you armed
over Jordan before the LORD until he hath driven out his enemies from
before him 3222 And the land be subdued before the LORD then
afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the LORD and
before Israel and this land shall be your possession before the LORD

3223 But if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the
LORD and be sure your sin will find you out

3224 Build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep
and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth

3225 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
Moses saying Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth

3226 Our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle
shall be there in the cities of Gilead 3227 But thy servants will
pass over every man armed for war before the LORD to battle as my
lord saith

3228 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest and
Joshua the son of Nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
children of Israel 3229 And Moses said unto them If the children of
Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan every
man armed to battle before the LORD and the land shall be subdued
before you then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a
possession 3230 But if they will not pass over with you armed they
shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan

3231 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered
saying As the LORD hath said unto thy servants so will we do

3232 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan
that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be
ours

3233 And Moses gave unto them even to the children of Gad and to
the children of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of
Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of
Og king of Bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts
even the cities of the country round about

3234 And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer
3235 And Atroth Shophan and Jaazer and Jogbehah 3236 And
Bethnimrah and Bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep

3237 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and
Kirjathaim 3238 And Nebo and Baalmeon their names being changed
and Shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded

3239 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead
and took it and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it

3240 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh and he
dwelt therein

3241 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
thereof and called them Havothjair

3242 And Nobah went and took Kenath and the villages thereof and
called it Nobah after his own name

331 These are the journeys of the children of Israel which went
forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of
Moses and Aaron

332 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by
the commandment of the LORD and these are their journeys according to
their goings out

333 And they departed from Rameses in the first month on the
fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the
children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the
Egyptians

334 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn which the LORD had
smitten among them upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments

335 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses and pitched in
Succoth

336 And they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham which is in
the edge of the wilderness

337 And they removed from Etham and turned again unto Pihahiroth
