The prince laughed Viserys hardly reigned a fortnight

He reigned more than a year said Tyrion

Oberyn gave a shrug A year or a fortnight what does it matter He poisoned his own nephew to gain the throne and then did nothing once he had it

Baelor starved himself to death fasting said Tyrion His uncle served him loyally as Hand as he had served the Young Dragon before him Viserys might only have reigned a year but he ruled for fifteen while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed He made a sour face And if he did remove his nephew can you blame him Someone had to save the realm from Baelor’s follies

Sansa was shocked But Baelor the Blessed was a great king He walked the Boneway barefoot to make peace with Dorne and rescued the Dragonknight from a snakepit The vipers refused to strike him because he was so pure and holy

Prince Oberyn smiled If you were a viper my lady would you want to bite a bloodless stick like Baelor the Blessed I’d sooner save my fangs for someone juicier…

My prince is playing with you Lady Sansa said the woman Ellaria Sand The septons and singers like to say that the snakes did not bite Baelor but the truth is very different He was bitten half a hundred times and should have died from it

If he had Viserys would have reigned a dozen years said Tyrion and the Seven Kingdoms might have been better served Some believe Baelor was deranged by all that venom

Yes said Prince Oberyn but I’ve seen no snakes in this Red Keep of yours So how do you account for Joffrey

I prefer not to Tyrion inclined his head stiffly If you will excuse us Our litter awaits The dwarf helped Sansa up inside and clambered awkwardly after her Close the curtains my lady if you’d be so good

Must we my lord Sansa did not want to be shut behind the curtains The day is so lovely

The good people of King’s Landing are like to throw dung at the litter if they see me inside it Do us both a kindness my lady Close the curtains 

She did as he bid her They sat for a time as the air grew warm and stuffy around them I was sorry about your book my lord she made herself say

It was Joffrey’s book He might have learned a thing or two if he’d read it He sounded distracted I should have known better I should have seen… a good many things

Perhaps the dagger will please him more

When the dwarf grimaced his scar tightened and twisted The boy’s earned himself a dagger wouldn’t you say Thankfully Tyrion did not wait for her reply Joff quarreled with your brother Robb at Winterfell Tell me was there ill feeling between Bran and His Grace as well

Bran The question confused her Before he fell you mean She had to try and think back It was all so long ago Bran was a sweet boy Everyone loved him He and Tommen fought with wooden swords I remember but just for play

Tyrion lapsed back into moody silence Sansa heard the distant clank of chains from outside the portcullis was being drawn up A moment later there was a shout and their litter swayed into motion Deprived of the passing scenery she chose to stare at her folded hands uncomfortably aware of her husand’s mismatched eyes Why is he looking at me that way

You loved your brothers much as I love Jaime

Is this some Lannister trap to make me speak treason My brothers were traitors and they’ve gone to traitors’ graves It is treason to love a traitor 

Her little husband snorted Robb rose in arms against his rightful king By law that made him a traitor The others died too young to know what treason was He rubbed his nose Sansa do you know what happened to Bran at Winterfell

Bran fell He was always climbing things and finally he fell We always feared he would And Theon Greyjoy killed him but that was later

Theon Greyjoy Tyrion sighed Your lady mother once accused me… well I will not burden you with the ugly details She accused me falsely I never harmed your brother Bran And I mean no harm to you

What does he want me to say That is good to know my lord He wanted something from her but Sansa did not know what it was He looks like a starving child but I have no food to give him Why won’t he leave me be

Tyrion rubbed at his scarred scabby nose yet again an ugly habit that drew the eye to his ugly face You have never asked me how Robb died or your lady mother

I… would sooner not know It would give me bad dreams

Then I will say no more

That… that’s kind of you

Oh yes said Tyrion I am the very soul of kindness And I know about bad dreams





Tyrion


The new crown that his father had given the Faith stood twice as tall as the one the mob had smashed a glory of crystal and spun gold Rainbow light flashed and shimmered every time the High Septon moved his head but Tyrion had to wonder how the man could bear the weight And even he had to concede that Joffrey and Margaery made a regal couple as they stood side-by-side between the towering gilded statues of the Father and the Mother

The bride was lovely in ivory silk and Myrish lace her skirts decorated with floral patterns picked out in seed pearls As Renly’s widow she might have worn the Baratheon colors gold and black yet she came to them a Tyrell in a maiden’s cloak made of a hundred cloth-of-gold roses sewn to green velvet He wondered if she really was a maiden Not that Joffrey is like to know the difference

The king looked near as splendid as his bride in his doublet of dusky rose beneath a cloak of deep crimson velvet blazoned with his stag and lion The crown rested easily on his curls gold on gold I saved that bloody crown for him Tyrion shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other He could not stand still Too much wine He should have thought to relieve himself before they set out from the Red Keep The sleepless night he’d spent with Shae was making itself felt too but most of all he wanted to strangle his bloody royal nephew

I am no stranger to Valyrian steel the boy had boasted The septons were always going on about how the Father Above judges us all If the Father would be so good as to topple over and crush Joff like a dung beetle I might even believe it

He ought to have seen it long ago Jaime would never send another man to do his killing and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to her but Joff arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that he was…

He remembered a cold morning when he’d climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell’s library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves Send a dog to kill a wolf he said Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark however the Hound would have gone to Cersei Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders merchants and camp followers who’d attached themselves to the king’s party as they made their way north Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince’s favor and a little coin Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran’s throat Joff’s most like No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning

The prince’s own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade Tyrion seemed to recall At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that Instead he went poking among his father’s weapons Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity and would have given his son any dagger he wanted… but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers a huge wheelhouse and a baggage train No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king’s weapons went with him in case he should desire any of them

The blade Joff chose was nice and plain No goldwork no jewels in the hilt no silver inlay on the blade King Robert never wore it had likely forgotten he owned it Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp… sharp enough to slice through skin flesh and muscle in one quick stroke I am no stranger to Valyrian steel But he had been hadn’t he Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger’s knife

The why of it still eluded him Simple cruelty perhaps His nephew had that in abundance It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he’d drunk piss in his breeches or both He squirmed uncomfortably He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast The boy knows I know now My big mouth will be the death of me I swear it

The seven vows were made the seven blessings invoked and the seven promises exchanged When the wedding song had been sung and the challenge had gone unanswered it was time for the exchange of cloaks Tyrion shifted his weight from one stunted leg to the other trying to see between his father and his uncle Kevan If the gods are just Joff will make a hash of this He made certain not to look at Sansa lest his bitterness show in his eyes You might have knelt damn you Would it have been so bloody hard to bend those stiff Stark knees of yours and let me keep a little dignity

Mace Tyrell removed his daughter’s maiden cloak tenderly while Joffrey accepted the folded bride’s cloak from his brother Tommen and shook it out with a flourish The boy king was as tall at thirteen as his bride was at sixteen he would not require a fool’s back to climb upon He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten it at her throat And that easily she passed from her father’s protection to her husband’s But who will protect her from Joff Tyrion glanced at the Knight of Flowers standing with the other Kingsguard You had best keep your sword well honed Ser Loras

With this kiss I pledge my love Joffrey declared in ringing tones When Margaery echoed the words he pulled her close and kissed her long and deep Rainbow lights danced once more about the High Septon’s crown as he solemnly declared Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister and Margaery of House Tyrell to be one flesh one heart one soul

Good that’s done with Now let’s get back to the bloody castle so I can have a piss

Ser Loras and Ser Meryn led the procession from the sept in their white scale armor and snowy cloaks Then came Prince Tommen scattering rose petals from a basket before the king and queen After the royal couple followed Queen Cersei and Lord Tyrell then the bride’s mother arm-in-arm with Lord Tywin The Queen of Thorns tottered after them with one hand on Ser Kevan Lannister’s arm and the other on her cane her twin guardsmen close behind her in case she fell Next came Ser Garlan Tyrell and his lady wife and finally it was their turn

My lady Tyrion offered Sansa his arm She took it dutifully but he could feel her stiffness as they walked up the aisle together She never once looked down at him

He heard them cheering outside even before he reached the doors The mob loved Margaery so much they were even willing to love Joffrey again She had belonged to Renly the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them And the bounty of Highgarden had come with her flowing up the roseroad from the south The fools didn’t seem to remember that it had been Mace Tyrell who closed the roseroad to begin with and made the bloody famine

They stepped out into the crisp autumn air I feared we’d never escape Tyrion quipped

Sansa had no choice but to look at him then I… yes my lord As you say She looked sad It was such a beautiful ceremony though
