No my lord

Go then I shall forget this insolence

Arya went but not to her bed When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard the guard on the door nodded at her and said Storm coming Smell the air The wind was gusting flames swirling off the torches mounted atop the walls beside the rows of heads On her way to the godswood she passed the Wailing Tower where once she had lived in fear of Weese The Freys had taken it for their own since Harrenhal’s fall She could hear angry voices coming from a window many men talking and arguing all at once Elmar was sitting on the steps outside alone

What’s wrong Arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks

My princess he sobbed We’ve been dishonored Aenys says There was a bird from the Twins My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else or be a septon

A stupid princess she thought that’s nothing to cry over My brothers might be dead she confided

Elmar gave her a scornful look No one cares about a serving girl’s brothers

It was hard not to hit him when he said that I hope your princess dies she said and ran off before he could grab her In the godswood she found her broomstick sword where she had left it and carried it to the heart tree There she knelt Red leaves rustled Red eyes peered inside her The eyes of the gods Tell me what to do you gods she prayed

For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf and limb And then far far off beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal from somewhere out in the world came the long lonely howl of a wolf Gooseprickles rose on Arya’s skin and for an instant she felt dizzy Then so faintly it seemed as if she heard her father’s voice When the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives he said

But there is no pack she whispered to the weirwood Bran and Rickon were dead the Lannisters had Sansa Jon had gone to the Wall I’m not even me now I’m Nan

You are Arya of Winterfell daughter of the north You told me you could be strong You have the wolf blood in you

The wolf blood Arya remembered now I’ll be as strong as Robb I said I would She took a deep breath then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across her knee It broke with a loud crack and she threw the pieces aside I am a direwolf and done with wooden teeth

That night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise They were the only voices she trusted anymore She could hear the sound of her own breath and the wolves as well a great pack of them now They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood she thought They are calling to me

Finally she slipped from under the blanket wriggled into a tunic and padded barefoot down the stairs Roose Bolton was a cautious man and the entrance to Kingspyre was guarded day and night so she had to slip out of a narrow cellar window The yard was still the great castle lost in haunted dreams Above the wind keened through the Wailing Tower

At the forge she found the fires extinguished and the doors closed and barred She crept in a window as she had once before Gendry shared a mattress with two other apprentice smiths She crouched in the loft for a long time before her eyes adjusted enough for her to be sure that he was the one on the end Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched him His eyes opened He could not have been very deeply asleep Please she whispered She took her hand off his mouth and pointed

For a moment she did not think he understood but then he slid out from under the blankets Naked he padded across the room shrugged into a loose roughspun tunic and climbed down from the loft after her The other sleepers did not stir What do you want now Gendry said in a low angry voice

A sword

Blackthumb keeps all the blades locked up I told you that a hundred times Is this for Lord Leech

For me Break the lock with your hammer

They’ll break my hand he grumbled Or worse

Not if you run off with me

Run and they’ll catch you and kill you

They’ll do you worse Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers he told me so

Gendry pushed black hair out of his eyes So

She looked right at him fearless So when Vargo Hoat’s the lord he’s going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away The smiths too

That’s only a story he said scornfully

No it’s true I heard Lord Vargo say so she lied He’s going to cut one foot off everyone The left one Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie he’ll do what you say We’ll need bread or oatcakes or something You get the swords and I’ll do the horses We’ll meet near the postern in the east wall behind the Tower of Ghosts No one ever comes there

I know that gate It’s guarded same as the rest

So You won’t forget the swords

I never said I’d come

No But if you do you won’t forget the swords

He frowned No he said at last I guess I won’t

Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls In her cell she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully in two layers of smallclothes warm stockings and her cleanest tunic It was Lord Bolton’s livery On the breast was sewn his sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort She tied her shoes threw a wool cloak over her skinny shoulders and knotted it under her throat Quiet as a shadow she moved back down the stairs Outside the lord’s solar she paused to listen at the door easing it open slowly when she heard only silence

The sheepskin map was on the table beside the remains of Lord Bolton’s supper She rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt He’d left his dagger on the table as well so she took that too just in case Gendry lost his courage

A horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables The grooms were all asleep She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said Eh Whas

Lord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled

The boy got to his feet pushing straw from his hair Wha at this hour Horses you say He blinked at the sigil on her tunic Whas he want horses for in the dark

Lord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants She crossed her arms

The stableboy was still looking at the flayed man He knew what it meant Three you say

One two three Hunting horses Fast and surefoot Arya helped him with the bridles and saddles so he would not need to wake any of the others She hoped they would not hurt him afterward but she knew they probably would

Leading the horses across the castle was the worst part She stayed in the shadow of the curtain wall whenever she could so the sentries walking their rounds on the ramparts above would have needed to look almost straight down to see her And if they do what of it I’m my lord’s own cupbearer It was a chill dank autumn night Clouds were blowing in from the west hiding the stars and the Wailing Tower screamed mournfully at every gust of wind It smells like rain Arya did not know whether that would be good or bad for their escape

No one saw her and she saw no one only a grey and white cat creeping along atop the godswood wall It stopped and spit at her waking memories of the Red Keep and her father and Syrio Forel I could catch you if I wanted she called to it softly but I have to go cat The cat hissed again and ran off

The Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal’s five immense towers It stood dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for near three hundred years It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come It seemed as though she waited a long time The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars Arya took out the dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy Long smooth strokes the way Syrio had taught her The sound calmed her

She heard them coming long before she saw them Hot Pie was breathing heavily and once he stumbled in the dark barked his shin and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal Gendry was quieter but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved Here I am She stood Be quiet or they’ll hear you

The boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones Gendry was wearing oiled chainmail under his cloak she saw and he had his blacksmith’s hammer slung across his back Hot Pie’s red round face peered out from under a hood He had a sack of bread dangling from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm There’s a guard on that postern said Gendry quietly I told you there would be

You stay here with the horses said Arya I’ll get rid of him Come quick when I call

Gendry nodded Hot Pie said Hoot like an owl when you want us to come

I’m not an owl said Arya I’m a wolf I’ll howl

Alone she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts She walked fast to keep ahead of her fear and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her and Yoren and Jaqen H’ghar and Jon Snow She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her not yet For this the dagger would be better It was good and sharp This postern was the least of Harrenhal’s gates a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails set in an angle of the wall beneath a defensive tower Only one man was set to guard it but she knew there would be sentries up in that tower as well and others nearby walking the walls Whatever happened she must be quiet as a shadow He must not call out A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall She felt one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose

She made no effort to hide but approached the guard openly as if Lord Bolton himself had sent her He watched her come curious as to what might bring a page here at this black hour When she got closer she saw that he was a northman very tall and thin huddled in a ragged fur cloak That was bad She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life and they knew him better than she did If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside… No she dare not He was a northman but not a Winterfell man He belonged to Roose Bolton
