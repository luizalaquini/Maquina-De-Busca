Robb kissed his wife gently promised to see her in their chambers and went off with his lady mother His steps led them toward the godswood Lothar seemed amiable that’s a hopeful sign We need the Freys

That does not mean we shall have them

He nodded and there was glumness to his face and a slope to his shoulders that made her heart go out to him The crown is crushing him she thought He wants so much to be a good king to be brave and honorable and clever but the weight is too much for a boy to bear Robb was doing all he could yet still the blows kept falling one after the other relentless When they brought him word of the battle at Duskendale where Lord Randyll Tarly had shattered Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart he might have been expected to rage Instead he’d stared in dumb disbelief and said Duskendale on the narrow sea Why would they go to Duskendale He’d shook his head bewildered A third of my foot lost for Duskendale

The ironmen have my castle and now the Lannisters hold my brother Galbart Glover said in a voice thick with despair Robett Glover had survived the battle but had been captured near the kingsroad not long after

Not for long her son promised I will offer them Martyn Lannister in exchange Lord Tywin will have to accept for his brother’s sake Martyn was Ser Kevan’s son a twin to the Willem that Lord Karstark had butchered Those murders still haunted her son Catelyn knew He had tripled the guard around Martyn but still feared for his safety

I should have traded the Kingslayer for Sansa when you first urged it Robb said as they walked the gallery If I’d offered to wed her to the Knight of Flowers the Tyrells might be ours instead of Joffrey’s I should have thought of that

Your mind was on your battles and rightly so Even a king cannot think of everything

Battles muttered Robb as he led her out beneath the trees I have won every battle yet somehow I’m losing the war He looked up as if the answer might be written on the sky The ironmen hold Winterfell and Moat Cailin too Father’s dead and Bran and Rickon maybe Arya And now your father too

She could not let him despair She knew the taste of that draught too well herself My father has been dying for a long time You could not have changed that You have made mistakes Robb but what king has not Ned would have been proud of you

Mother there is something you must know

Catelyn’s heart skipped a beat This is something he hates Something he dreads to tell me All she could think of was Brienne and her mission Is it the Kingslayer

No It’s Sansa

She’s dead Catelyn thought at once Brienne failed Jaime is dead and Cersei has killed my sweet girl in retribution For a moment she could barely speak Is    is she gone Robb

Gone He looked startled Dead Oh Mother no not that they haven’t harmed her not that way only    a bird came last night but I couldn’t bring myself to tell you not until your father was sent to his rest Robb took her hand They married her to Tyrion Lannister

Catelyn’s fingers clutched at his The Imp

Yes

He swore to trade her for his brother she said numbly Sansa and Arya both We would have them back if we returned his precious Jaime he swore it before the whole court How could he marry her after saying that in sight of gods and men

He’s the Kingslayer’s brother Oathbreaking runs in their blood Robb’s fingers brushed the pommel of his sword If I could I’d take his ugly head off Sansa would be a widow then and free There’s no other way that I can see They made her speak the vows before a septon and don a crimson cloak

Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door My poor sweet Sansa    why would anyone do this to her

For Winterfell Robb said at once With Bran and Rickon dead Sansa is my heir If anything should happen to me   

She clutched tight at his hand Nothing will happen to you Nothing I could not stand it They took Ned and your sweet brothers Sansa is married Arya is lost my father’s dead    if anything befell you I would go mad Robb You are all I have left You are all the north has left

I am not dead yet Mother

Suddenly Catelyn was full of dread Wars need not be fought until the last drop of blood Even she could hear the desperation in her voice You would not be the first king to bend the knee nor even the first Stark

His mouth tightened No Never

There is no shame in it Balon Greyjoy bent the knee to Robert when his rebellion failed Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires

Did Aegon kill King Torrhen’s father He pulled his hand from hers Never I said

He is playing the boy now not the king The Lannisters do not need the north They will require homage and hostages no more    and the Imp will keep Sansa no matter what we do so they have their hostage The ironmen will prove a more implacable enemy I promise you To have any hope of holding the north the Greyjoys must leave no single sprig of House Stark alive to dispute their right Theon’s murdered Bran and Rickon so now all they need do is kill you    and Jeyne yes Do you think Lord Balon can afford to let her live to bear you heirs

Robb’s face was cold Is that why you freed the Kingslayer To make a peace with the Lannisters

I freed Jaime for Sansa’s sake    and Arya’s if she still lives You know that But if I nurtured some hope of buying peace as well was that so ill

Yes he said The Lannisters killed my father

Do you think I have forgotten that

I don’t know Have you

Catelyn had never struck her children in anger but she almost struck Robb then It was an effort to remind herself how frightened and alone he must feel You are King in the North the choice is yours I only ask that you think on what I’ve said The singers make much of kings who die valiantly in battle but your life is worth more than a song To me at least who gave it to you She lowered her head Do I have your leave to go

Yes He turned away and drew his sword What he meant to do with it she could not say There was no enemy there no one to fight Only her and him amongst tall trees and fallen leaves There are fights no sword can win Catelyn wanted to tell him but she feared the king was deaf to such words

Hours later she was sewing in her bedchamber when young Rollam Westerling came running with the summons to supper Good Catelyn thought relieved She had not been certain that her son would want her there after their quarrel A dutiful squire she said to Rollam gravely Bran would have been the same

If Robb seemed cool at table and Edmure surly Lame Lothar made up for them both He was the model of courtesy reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill and thanking Robb for the swift sure justice he had meted out to Rickard Karstark Lothar’s bastard brother Walder Rivers was another matter a harsh sour man with old Lord Walder’s suspicious face he spoke but seldom and devoted most of his attention to the meat and mead that was set before him

When all the empty words were said the queen and the other Westerlings excused themselves the remains of the meal were cleared away and Lothar Frey cleared his throat Before we turn to the business that brings us here there is another matter he said solemnly A grave matter I fear I had hoped it would not fall to me to bring you these tidings but it seems I must My lord father has had a letter from his grandsons

Catelyn had been so lost in grief for her own that she had almost forgotten the two Freys she had agreed to foster No more she thought Mother have mercy how many more blows can we bear Somehow she knew the next words she heard would plunge yet another blade into her heart The grandsons at Winterfell she made herself ask My wards

Walder and Walder yes But they are presently at the Dreadfort my lady I grieve to tell you this but there has been a battle Winterfell is burned

Burned Robb’s voice was incredulous

Your northern lords tried to retake it from the ironmen When Theon Greyjoy saw that his prize was lost he put the castle to the torch

We have heard naught of any battle said Ser Brynden

My nephews are young I grant you but they were there Big Walder wrote the letter though his cousin signed as well It was a bloody bit of business by their account Your castellan was slain Ser Rodrik was that his name

Ser Rodrik Cassel said Catelyn numbly That dear brave loyal old soul She could almost see him tugging on his fierce white whiskers What of our other people

The ironmen put many of them to the sword I fear

Wordless with rage Robb slammed a fist down on the table and turned his face away so the Freys would not see his tears

But his mother saw them The world grows a little darker every day Catelyn’s thoughts went to Ser Rodrik’s little daughter Beth to tireless Maester Luwin and cheerful Septon Chayle Mikken at the forge Farlen and Palla in the kennels Old Nan and simple Hodor Her heart was sick Please not all

No said Lame Lothar The women and children hid my nephews Walder and Walder among them With Winterfell in ruins the survivors were carried back to the Dreadfort by this son of Lord Bolton’s

Bolton’s son Robb’s voice was strained

Walder Rivers spoke up A bastard son I believe
