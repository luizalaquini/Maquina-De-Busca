No doubt As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves

Lions she whispered without thinking She glanced about nervously but there was no one close enough to hear

Lannister reached out and took her hand and gave it a squeeze I am only a little lion child and I vow I shall not savage you Bowing he said But now you must excuse me I have urgent business with queen and council

Sansa watched him walk off his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step like something from a grotesquerie He speaks more gently than Joffrey she thought but the queen spoke to me gently too He’s still a Lannister her brother and Joff’s uncle and no friend Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart and admired and trusted his mother the queen They had repaid that love and trust with her father’s head Sansa would never make that mistake again





TYRION

In the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in a shroud Her Grace left orders the council in session is not to be disturbed

I would be only a small disturbance ser Tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve I bear a letter from my father Lord Tywin Lannister the Hand of the King There is his seal

Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed Ser Mandon repeated slowly as if Tyrion were a dullard who had not heard him the first time

Jaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard—excepting himself always—because his face gave no hint as what he might do next Tyrion would have welcomed a hint Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of Joffrey’s protectors Yet if he let the man turn him away where was his authority He made himself smile Ser Mandon you have not met my companions This is Timett son of Timett a red hand of the Burned Men And this is Bronn Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen who was captain of Lord Arryn’s household guard

I know the man Ser Mandon’s eyes were pale grey oddly flat and lifeless

Knew Bronn corrected with a thin smile

Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that

Be that as it may Tyrion said lightly I truly must see my sister and present my letter ser If you would be so kind as to open the door for us

The white knight did not respond Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his way past when Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside You may enter They may not

A small victory he thought but sweet He had passed his first test Tyrion Lannister shouldered through the door feeling almost tall Five members of the king’s small council broke off their discussion suddenly You his sister Cersei said in a tone that was equal parts disbelief and distaste

I can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies Tyrion paused to admire the pair of Valyrian sphinxes that guarded the door affecting an air of casual confidence Cersei could smell weakness the way a dog smells fear

What are you doing here His sister’s lovely green eyes studied him without the least hint of affection

Delivering a letter from our lord father He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled parchment between them

The eunuch Varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands How kind of Lord Tywin And his sealing wax is such a lovely shade of gold Varys gave the seal a close inspection It gives every appearance of being genuine

Of course it’s genuine Cersei snatched it out of his hands She broke the wax and unrolled the parchment

Tyrion watched her read His sister had taken the king’s seat for herself—he gathered Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings no more than Robert had—so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand’s chair It seemed only appropriate

This is absurd the queen said at last My lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this council He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King until such time as he himself can join us

Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously It would seem that a welcome is in order

Indeed Jowly balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself We have sore need of you my lord Rebellion everywhere this grim omen in the sky rioting in the city streets   

And whose fault is that Lord Janos Cersei lashed out Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order As to you Tyrion you could better serve us on the field of battle

He laughed No I’m done with fields of battle thank you I sit a chair better than a horse and I’d sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe All that about the thunder of the drums sunlight flashing on armor magnificent destriers snorting and prancing Well the drums gave me headaches the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere Not that I am complaining Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn drums horseshit and fly bites are my favorite things

Littlefinger laughed Well said Lannister A man after my own heart

Tyrion smiled at him remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade We must have a talk about that and soon He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as well Please he told them do let me be of service in whatever small way I can

Cersei read the letter again How many men have you brought with you

A few hundred My own men chiefly Father was loath to part with any of his He is fighting a war after all

What use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city or Stannis sails from Dragonstone I ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf The king names the Hand with the consent of council Joffrey named our lord father

And our lord father named me

He cannot do that Not without Joff’s consent

Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host if you’d care to take it up with him Tyrion said politely My lords perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister

Varys slithered to his feet smiling in that unctuous way he had How you must have yearned for the sound of your sweet sister’s voice My lords please let us give them a few moments together The woes of our troubled realm shall keep

Janos Slynt rose hesitantly and Grand Maester Pycelle ponderously yet they rose Littlefinger was the last Shall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegor’s Holdfast

My thanks Lord Petyr but I will be taking Lord Stark’s former quarters in the Tower of the Hand

Littlefinger laughed You’re a braver man than me Lannister You do know the fate of our last two Hands

Two If you mean to frighten me why not say four

Four Littlefinger raised an eyebrow Did the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some dire end in the Tower I’m afraid I was too young to pay them much mind

Aerys Targaryen’s last Hand was killed during the Sack of King’s Landing though I doubt he’d had time to settle into the Tower He was only Hand for a fortnight The one before him was burned to death And before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile and counted themselves lucky I believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart King’s Landing with his name properties and parts all intact

Fascinating said Littlefinger And all the more reason I’d sooner bed down in the dungeon

Perhaps you’ll get that wish Tyrion thought but he said Courage and folly are cousins or so I’ve heard Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand I pray I’m small enough to escape its notice

Janos Slynt laughed Littlefinger smiled and Grand Maester Pycelle followed them both out bowing gravely

I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons his sister said when they were alone

How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice Tyrion sighed to her

How I have yearned to have that eunuch’s tongue pulled out with hot pincers Cersei replied Has father lost his senses Or did you forge this letter She read it once more with mounting annoyance Why would he inflict you on me I wanted him to come himself She crushed Lord Tywin’s letter in her fingers I am Joffrey’s regent and I sent him a royal command

And he ignored you Tyrion pointed out He has quite a large army he can do that Nor is he the first Is he
