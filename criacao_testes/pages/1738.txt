Oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron
dipped it into the pot and imprintcd on the buttocks
of the infant sheep the initials of her he delighted to
muse on -- B E which signified to all the region
round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer
Bathsheba Everdene and to no one else
 Now Cainy shoulder your two and off Good
morning Mr Boldwood The shepherd lifted the
sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had himself
brought and vanished with them in the direction of
the lambing field hard by -- their frames being now in a
sleek and hopeful state pleasantly contrasting with their
deaths-door plight of hialf an hour before
Boldwood followed him a little way up the field
hesitated and turned back He followed him again
with a last resolve annihilating return On approaching
the nook in which the fold was constructed the farmer
drew out-his pocket-book unfastened-it and allowed it
to lie open on his hand A letter was revealed -- Bath+
shebas
I was going to ask you Oak he said with unreal
carelessness if you know whose writing this is 
Oak glanced into the book and replied instantly
with a flushed face  Miss Everdenes
Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of
sounding her name He now felt a strangely distressing
qualm from a new thought  The letter could of course
be no other than anonymous or the inquiry would not
have been necessary
Boldwood mistook his confusion  sensitive persons
are always ready with their Is it I   in prefercnce to
objective reasoning
 The question was perfectly fair he returned -- and
there was something incongruous in the serious eamest+
ness with which he applied himself to an argument on
a valentine  You know it is always expected that
privy inquiries will be made  thats where the -- fun
lies If the word fun had been torture it could
not have been uttered with a more constrained and
restless countenance than was Boldwoods then
Soon parting from Gabriel the lonely and reserved
man returned to his house to breakfast -- feeling twinges
of shame and regret at having so far exposed his mood
by those fevered

questions to a stranger He again
placed the letter on the mantelpiece and sat down to
think of the circumstances attending it by the light of
Gabriels information

ALL SAINTS AND ALL SOULS
ON a week-day morning a small congregation con+
sisting mainly of women and girls rose from its knees
in the mouldy nave of a church called All Saints in
the distant barrack-town before mentioned at the end
of a service without a sermon They were about to
disperse when a smart footstep entering the porch and
coming up the central passage arrested their attention
The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church it
was the clink of spurs Everybody looked A young
cavalry soldier in a red uniform with the three chevrons
of a sergeant upon his sleeve strode up the aisle with
an embarrassment which was only the more marked
by the intense vigour of his step and by the deter+
mination upon his face to show none A slight flush
had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the
gauntlet between these women  but passing on through
the chancel arch he never paused till he came close
to the altar railing Here for a moment he stood
alone
The officiating curate who had not yet doffed his
surplice perceived the new-comer and followed him
to the communion-space He whispered to the soldier
and then beckoned to the clerk who in his turn
whispered to an elderly woman apparently his wife and
they also went up the chancel steps
Tis a wedding murmured some of the women
brightening  Lets wait
The majority again sat down
There was a creaking of machinery behind and
some of the young ones turned their heads From the
interior face of the west wall of the tower projected a
little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bcll beneath
it the automaton being driven by the same clock
machinery that struck the large bell in the tower Be+
tween the tower and the church was a close sereen the
door of which was kept shut during services hiding
this
P 165
grotesque clockwork from sight At present how+
ever the door was open and the egress of the jack the
blows on the bell and the mannikins retreat intcthe
nook again were visible to many and audible through+
out the church
