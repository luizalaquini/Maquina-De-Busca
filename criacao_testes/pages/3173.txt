99 And as Jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named
Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him
Follow me And he arose and followed him

910 And it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in the house behold
many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his
disciples

911 And when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples Why
eateth your Master with publicans and sinners  912 But when Jesus
heard that he said unto them They that be whole need not a
physician but they that are sick

913 But go ye and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not
sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance

914 Then came to him the disciples of John saying Why do we and the
Pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not  915 And Jesus said
unto them Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the
bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom
shall be taken from them and then shall they fast

916 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is
made worse

917 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles
break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put
new wine into new bottles and both are preserved

918 While he spake these things unto them behold there came a
certain ruler and worshipped him saying My daughter is even now
dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live

919 And Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples

920 And behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood
twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment
921 For she said within herself If I may but touch his garment I
shall be whole

922 But Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said
Daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole And the
woman was made whole from that hour

923 And when Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels
and the people making a noise 924 He said unto them Give place for
the maid is not dead but sleepeth And they laughed him to scorn

925 But when the people were put forth he went in and took her by
the hand and the maid arose

926 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land

927 And when Jesus departed thence two blind men followed him
crying and saying Thou son of David have mercy on us

928 And when he was come into the house the blind men came to him
and Jesus saith unto them Believe ye that I am able to do this They
said unto him Yea Lord

929 Then touched he their eyes saying According to your faith be it
unto you

930 And their eyes were opened and Jesus straitly charged them
saying See that no man know it

931 But they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all
that country

932 As they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man
possessed with a devil

933 And when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the
multitudes marvelled saying It was never so seen in Israel

934 But the Pharisees said He casteth out devils through the prince
of the devils

935 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in
their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing
every sickness and every disease among the people

936 But when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on
them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having
no shepherd

937 Then saith he unto his disciples The harvest truly is plenteous
but the labourers are few 938 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the
harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest

101 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave
them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all
manner of sickness and all manner of disease

102 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these The first Simon
who is called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee
and John his brother 103 Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and
Matthew the publican James the son of Alphaeus and Lebbaeus whose
