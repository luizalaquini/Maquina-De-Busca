He is Drogo’s son and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world It was prophesied Better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood

The child kicked inside her as if he had heard Dany remembered the story Viserys had told her of what the Usurper’s dogs had done to Rhaegar’s children His son had been a babe as well yet they had ripped him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall That was the way of men They must not hurt my son she cried I will order my khas to keep him safe and Drogo’s bloodriders will—

Ser Jorah held her by the shoulders A bloodrider dies with his khal You know that child They will take you to Vaes Dothrak to the crones that is the last duty they owe him in life… when it is done they will join Drogo in the night lands

Dany did not want to go back to Vaes Dothrak and live the rest of her life among those terrible old women yet she knew that the knight spoke the truth Drogo had been more than her sun-and-stars he had been the shield that kept her safe I will not leave him she said stubbornly miserably She took his hand again I will not

A stirring at the tent flap made Dany turn her head Mirri Maz Duur entered bowing low Days on the march trailing behind the khalasar had left her limping and haggard with blistered and bleeding feet and hollows under her eyes Behind her came Qotho and Haggo carrying the godswife’s chest between them When the bloodriders caught sight of Drogo’s wound the chest slipped from Haggo’s fingers and crashed to the floor of the tent and Qotho swore an oath so foul it seared the air

Mirri Maz Duur studied Drogo her face still and dead The wound has festered

This is your work maegi Qotho said Haggo laid his fist across Mirri’s cheek with a meaty smack that drove her to the ground Then he kicked her where she lay

Stop it Dany screamed

Qotho pulled Haggo away saying Kicks are too merciful for a maegi Take her outside We will stake her to the earth to be the mount of every passing man And when they are done with her the dogs will use her as well Weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes The flies off the river shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts… He dug iron-hard fingers into the soft wobbly flesh under the godswife’s arm and hauled her to her feet

No Dany said I will not have her harmed

Qotho’s lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile No You say me no Better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi You did this as much as the other

Ser Jorah stepped between them loosening his longsword in its scabbard Rein in your tongue bloodrider The princess is still your khaleesi 

Only while the blood-of-my-blood still lives Qotho told the knight When he dies she is nothing

Dany felt a tightness inside her Before I was khaleesi I was the blood of the dragon Ser Jorah summon my khas

No said Qotho We will go For now… Khaleesi Haggo followed him from the tent scowling

That one means you no good Princess Mormont said The Dothraki say a man and his bloodriders share one life and Qotho sees it ending A dead man is beyond fear

No one has died Dany said Ser Jorah I may have need of your blade Best go don your armor She was more frightened than she dared admit even to herself

The knight bowed As you say He strode from the tent

Dany turned back to Mirri Maz Duur The woman’s eyes were wary So you have saved me once more

And now you must save him Dany said Please…

You do not ask a slave Mirri replied sharply you tell her She went to Drogo burning on his mat and gazed long at his wound Ask or tell it makes no matter He is beyond a healer’s skills The khal’s eyes were closed She opened one with her fingers He has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy

Yes Dany admitted

I made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and bound it in a lambskin

It burned he said He tore it off The herbwomen made him a new one wet and soothing

It burned yes There is great healing magic in fire even your hairless men know that

Make him another poultice Dany begged This time I will make certain he wears it

The time for that is past my lady Mirri said All I can do now is ease the dark road before him so he might ride painless to the night lands He will be gone by morning
