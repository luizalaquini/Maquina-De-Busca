him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto
thee to go So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward and let him go

406 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land

407 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields
even they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed
unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of
them that were not carried away captive to Babylon 408 Then they
came to Gedaliah to Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and
Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah the
son of a Maachathite they and their men

409 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them
and to their men saying Fear not to serve the Chaldeans dwell in
the land and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with
you

4010 As for me behold I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the
Chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer
fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your
cities that ye have taken

4011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab and among the
Ammonites and in Edom and that were in all the countries heard that
the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah and that he had set
over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan 4012 Even
all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and
came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah unto Mizpah and gathered wine
and summer fruits very much

4013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah to Mizpah 4014 And
said unto him Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the
Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee But
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not

4015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
secretly saying Let me go I pray thee and I will slay Ishmael the
son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay
thee that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be
scattered and the remnant in Judah perish  4016 But Gedaliah the
son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah Thou shalt not do
this thing for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael

411 Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the seed royal and the princes of
the king even ten men with him came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
to Mizpah and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah

412 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men that
were with him and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made
governor over the land

413 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him even with
Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Chaldeans that were found there and the
men of war

414 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah
and no man knew it 415 That there came certain from Shechem from
Shiloh and from Samaria even fourscore men having their beards
shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with
offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the
LORD

416 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet
them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met
them he said unto them Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam

417 And it was so when they came into the midst of the city that
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst
of the pit he and the men that were with him

418 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael Slay us
not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and
of oil and of honey So he forbare and slew them not among their
brethren

419 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
men whom he had slain because of Gedaliah was it which Asa the king
had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel and Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain

4110 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
that were in Mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people
that remained in Mizpah whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the
Ammonites

4111 But when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah had done 4112 Then they took all the men and went to
fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and found him by the great
waters that are in Gibeon
