Red eyes Jon realized but not like Melisandre’s He had a weirwood’s eyes Red eyes red mouth white fur Blood and bone like a heart tree He belongs to the old gods this one And he alone of all the direwolves was white Six pups they’d found in the late summer snows him and Robb five that were grey and black and brown for the five Starks and one white as white as Snow

He had his answer then

Beneath the Wall the queen’s men were kindling their nightfire He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away Come Ghost Jon told the wolf With me You’re hungry I know I could feel it They ran together for the gate circling wide around the nightfire where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night

The king’s men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black They stopped as Jon went by and gaped at him None of them had ever seen a direwolf before he realized and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods As he walked toward the armory Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window I’m sorry he thought I’m not the man to steal you out of there

In the practice yard he came upon a dozen king’s men with torches and long spears in their hands Their sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled and a couple of his men lowered their spears until the knight who led them said Move aside and let them pass To Jon he said You’re late for your supper

Then get out of my way ser Jon replied and he did

He could hear the noise even before he reached the bottom of the steps raised voices curses someone pounding on a table Jon stepped into the vault all but unnoticed His brothers crowded the benches and the tables but more were standing and shouting than were sitting and no one was eating There was no food What’s happening here Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about turncloaks and treason Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower… some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again demanding quiet but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling

Pyp was the first to see Jon He grinned at the sight of Ghost put two fingers in his mouth and whistled as only a mummer’s boy could whistle The shrill sound cut through the clamor like a sword As Jon walked toward the tables more of the brothers took note and fell quiet A hush spread across the cellar until the only sounds were Jon’s heels clicking on the stone floor and the soft crackle of the logs in the hearth

Ser Alliser Thorne shattered the silence The turncloak graces us with his presence at last

Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering The beast he gasped Look The beast that tore the life from Halfhand A warg walks among us brothers A WARG This… this creature is not fit to lead us This beastling is not fit to live

Ghost bared his teeth but Jon put a hand on his head My lord he said will you tell me what’s happened here

Maester Aemon answered from the far end of the hall Your name has been put forth as Lord Commander Jon

That was so absurd Jon had to smile By who he said looking for his friends This had to be one of Pyp’s japes surely But Pyp shrugged at him and Grenn shook his head It was Dolorous Edd Tollett who stood By me Aye it’s a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend but better you than me

Lord Janos started sputtering again This this is an outrage We ought to hang this boy Yes Hang him I say hang him for a turncloak and a warg along with his friend Mance Rayder Lord Commander I will not have it I will not suffer it

Cotter Pyke stood up You won’t suffer it Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your bloody arse but you’re wearing a black cloak now

Any brother may offer any name for our consideration so long as the man has said his vows Ser Denys Mallister said Tollett is well within his rights my lord

A dozen men started to talk at once each trying to drown out the others and before long half the hall was shouting once more This time it was Ser Alliser Thorne who leapt up on the table and raised his hands for quiet Brothers he cried this gains us naught I say we vote This king who has taken the King’s Tower has posted men at all the doors to see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice So be it We will choose and choose again all night if need be until we have our lord… but before we cast our tokens I believe our First Builder has something to say to us

Othell Yarwyck stood up slowly frowning The big builder rubbed his long lantern jaw and said Well I’m pulling my name out If you wanted me you had ten chances to choose me and you didn’t Not enough of you anyway I was going to say that those who were casting a token for me ought to choose Lord Janos…

Ser Alliser nodded Lord Slynt is the best possible—

I wasn’t done Alliser Yarwyck complained Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King’s Landing we all know and he was Lord of Harrenhal…

He’s never seen Harrenhal Cotter Pyke shouted out

Well that’s so said Yarwyck Anyway now that I’m standing here I don’t recall why I thought Slynt would be such a good choice That would be sort of kicking King Stannis in the mouth and I don’t see how that serves us Might be Snow would be better He’s been longer on the Wall he’s Ben Stark’s nephew and he served the Old Bear as squire Yarwyck shrugged Pick who you want just so it’s not me He sat down

Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple Jon saw but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale The Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again but now he was shouting for the kettle Some of his friends took up the cry Kettle they roared as one Kettle kettle KETTLE

The kettle was in the corner by the hearth a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot With a raucous scream and a clap of wings a huge raven burst out of the kettle It flapped upward seeking the rafters perhaps or a window to make its escape but there were no rafters in the vault nor windows either The raven was trapped Cawing loudly it circled the hall once twice three times And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout I know that bird That’s Lord Mormont’s raven

The raven landed on the table nearest Jon Snow it cawed It was an old bird dirty and bedraggled Snow it said again Snow snow snow It walked to the end of the table spread its wings again and flew to Jon’s shoulder

Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter Ser Piggy thinks we’re all fools brothers he said He’s taught the bird this little trick They all say snow go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves Mormont’s bird had more words than that

The raven cocked its head and looked at Jon Corn it said hopefully When it got neither corn nor answer it quorked and muttered Kettle Kettle Kettle
