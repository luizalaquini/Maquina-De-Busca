Are you skilled in the use of those handsome blades Dany asked him

Prendahl and Sallor would tell you so if dead men could talk I count no day as lived unless I have loved a woman slain a foeman and eaten a fine meal… and the days that I have lived are as numberless as the stars in the sky I make of slaughter a thing of beauty and many a tumbler and fire dancer has wept to the gods that they might be half so quick a quarter so graceful I would tell you the names of all the men I have slain but before I could finish your dragons would grow large as castles the walls of Yunkai would crumble into yellow dust and winter would come and go and come again

Dany laughed She liked the swagger she saw in this Daario Naharis Draw your sword and swear it to my service

In a blink Daario’s arakh was free of its sheath His submission was as outrageous as the rest of him a great swoop that brought his face down to her toes My sword is yours My life is yours My love is yours My blood my body my songs you own them all I live and die at your command fair queen

Then live Dany said and fight for me tonight

That would not be wise my queen Ser Jorah gave Daario a cold hard stare Keep this one here under guard until the battle’s fought and won

She considered a moment then shook her head If he can give us the Stormcrows surprise is certain

And if he betrays you surprise is lost

Dany looked down at the sellsword again He gave her such a smile that she flushed and turned away He won’t

How can you know that

She pointed to the lumps of blackened flesh the dragons were consuming bite by bloody bite I would call that proof of his sincerity Daario Naharis have your Stormcrows ready to strike the Yunkish rear when my attack begins Can you get back safely

If they stop me I will say I have been scouting and saw nothing The Tyroshi rose to his feet bowed and swept out

Ser Jorah Mormont lingered Your Grace he said too bluntly that was a mistake We know nothing of this man—

We know that he is a great fighter

A great talker you mean

He brings us the Stormcrows And he has blue eyes

Five hundred sellswords of uncertain loyalty

All loyalties are uncertain in such times as these Dany reminded him And I shall be betrayed twice more once for gold and once for love

Daenerys I am thrice your age Ser Jorah said I have seen how false men are Very few are worthy of trust and Daario Naharis is not one of them Even his beard wears false colors

That angered her Whilst you have an honest beard is that what you are telling me You are the only man I should ever trust

He stiffened I did not say that

You say it every day Pyat Pree’s a liar Xaro’s a schemer Belwas a braggart Arstan an assassin… do you think I’m still some virgin girl that I cannot hear the words behind the words

Your Grace—

She bulled over him You have been a better friend to me than any I have known a better brother than Viserys ever was You are the first of my Queensguard the commander of my army my most valued counselor my good right hand I honor and respect and cherish you—but I do not desire you Jorah Mormont and I am weary of your trying to push every other man in the world away from me so I must needs rely on you and you alone It will not serve and it will not make me love you any better

Mormont had flushed red when she first began but by the time Dany was done his face was pale again He stood still as stone If my queen commands he said curt and cold

Dany was warm enough for both of them She does she said She commands Now go see to your Unsullied ser You have a battle to fight and win

When he was gone Dany threw herself down on her pillows beside her dragons She had not meant to be so sharp with Ser Jorah but his endless suspicion had finally woken her dragon
