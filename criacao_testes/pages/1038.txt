Oh very good said Littlefinger closing the door You recognized her

I feared you’d never come my lord she whispered against his chest Petyr has been bringing me reports He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince How are my girls

Both in mourning and full of anger he told her Cat I do not understand What are you doing in King’s Landing What’s happened Ned asked his wife Is it Bran Is he…Dead was the word that came to his lips but he could not say it

It is Bran but not as you think Catelyn said

Ned was lost Then how Why are you here my love What is this place

Just what it appears Littlefinger said easing himself onto a window seat A brothel Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully He smiled As it chances I own this particular establishment so arrangements were easily made I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King’s Landing

Why Ned asked He saw her hands then the awkward way she held them the raw red scars the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left You’ve been hurt He took her hands in his own turned them over Gods Those are deep cuts… a gash from a sword or… how did this happen my lady

Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand This blade was sent to open Bran’s throat and spill his life’s blood

Ned’s head jerked up But… who… why would…

She put a finger to his lips Let me tell it all my love It will go faster that way Listen

So he listened and she told it all from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger And when she was done Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table the dagger in his hand Bran’s wolf had saved the boy’s life he thought dully What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow Your children were meant to have these pups my lord And he had killed Sansa’s and for what Was it guilt he was feeling Or fear If the gods had sent these wolves what folly had he done

Painfully Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant The Imp’s dagger he repeated It made no sense His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt and he slammed the blade into the table felt it bite into the wood It stood mocking him Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead The boy has never done him harm

Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears Littlefinger asked The Imp would never have acted alone

Ned rose and paced the length of the room If the queen had a role in this or gods forbid the king himself… no I will not believe that Yet even as he said the words he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands and Robert’s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess He remembered Rhaegar’s infant son the red ruin of his skull and the way the king had turned away as he had turned away in Darry’s audience hall not so long ago He could still hear Sansa pleading as Lyanna had pleaded once

Most likely the king did not know Littlefinger said It would not be the first time Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see

Ned had no reply for that The face of the butcher’s boy swam up before his eyes cloven almost in two and afterward the king had said not a word His head was pounding

Littlefinger sauntered over to the table wrenched the knife from the wood The accusation is treason either way Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth The queen… if you can find proof and if you can make Robert listen then perhaps…

We have proof Ned said We have the dagger

This Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end A sweet piece of steel but it cuts two ways my lord The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell and with his hireling dead who is there to give him the lie He tossed the knife lightly to Ned My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged

Ned regarded him coldly Lord Baelish I am a Stark of Winterfell My son lies crippled perhaps dying He would be dead and Catelyn with him but for a wolf pup we found in the snow If you truly believe I could forget that you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother

A fool I may be Stark… yet I’m still here while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now If you are so eager to molder beside him far be it from me to dissuade you but I would rather not be included in the party thank you very much

You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party Lord Baelish

You wound me deeply Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart For my part I always found you Starks a tiresome lot but Cat seems to have become attached to you for reasons I cannot comprehend I shall try to keep you alive for her sake A fool’s task admittedly but I could never refuse your wife anything

I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn’s death Catelyn said He has promised to help you find the truth

That was not news that Eddard Stark welcomed but it was true enough that they needed help and Littlefinger had been almost a brother to Cat once It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised Very well he said thrusting the dagger into his belt You spoke of Varys Does the eunuch know all of it

Not from my lips Catelyn said You did not wed a fool Eddard Stark But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know He has some dark art Ned I swear it

He has spies that is well known Ned said dismissive

It is more than that Catelyn insisted Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation I fear that man

Littlefinger smiled Leave Lord Varys to me sweet lady If you will permit me a small obscenity—and where better for it—I hold the man’s balls in the palm of my hand He cupped his fingers smiling Or would if he were a man or had any balls You see if the pie is opened the birds begin to sing and Varys would not like that Were I you I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch

Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found to the look on the queen’s face when she said We have a wolf so soft and quiet He was thinking of the boy Mycah of Jon Arryn’s sudden death of Bran’s fall of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life’s blood dried on a golden blade My lady he said turning to Catelyn there is nothing more you can do here I want you to return to Winterfell at once If there was one assassin there could be others Whoever ordered Bran’s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives

I had hoped to see the girls… Catelyn said

That would be most unwise Littlefinger put in The Red Keep is full of curious eyes and children talk

He speaks truly my love Ned told her He embraced her Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell I will watch over the girls Go home to our sons and keep them safe

As you say my lord Catelyn lifted her face and Ned kissed her Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms

Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber asked Littlefinger I should warn you Stark we usually charge for that sort of thing around here

A moment alone that’s all I ask Catelyn said

Very well Littlefinger strolled to the door Don’t be too long It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle before our absence is noted

Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own I will not forget the help you gave me Petyr When your men came for me I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy I have found you more than a friend I have found a brother I’d thought lost

Petyr Baelish smiled I am desperately sentimental sweet lady Best not tell anyone I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught

Ned believed not a word of that but he kept his voice polite as he said You have my thanks as well Lord Baelish

Oh now there’s a treasure Littlefinger said exiting

When the door had closed behind him Ned turned back to his wife Once you are home send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor and see that they are well manned And from this day on I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy If there is war we shall have sore need of his father’s fleet

War The fear was plain on Catelyn’s face

It will not come to that Ned promised her praying it was true He took her in his arms again The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them and that they shall not have I must play out this fool’s masquerade as if nothing is amiss Remember why I came here my love If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn…

He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms Her scarred hands clung to him If she said what then my love

That was the most dangerous part Ned knew All justice flows from the king he told her When I know the truth I must go to Robert And pray that he is the man I think he is he finished silently and not the man I fear he has become





TYRION

Are you certain that you must leave us so soon the Lord Commander asked him
