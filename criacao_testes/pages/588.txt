2818 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your
agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge
shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it

2819 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning
by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a
vexation only to understand the report

2820 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it

2821 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim he shall be
wroth as in the valley of Gibeon that he may do his work his strange
work and bring to pass his act his strange act

2822 Now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong
for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption even
determined upon the whole earth

2823 Give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech

2824 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the
clods of his ground  2825 When he hath made plain the face thereof
doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast
in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
place  2826 For his God doth instruct him to discretion and doth
teach him

2827 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument
neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches
are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod

2828 Bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it
nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his
horsemen

2829 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts which is
wonderful in counsel and excellent in working

291 Woe to Ariel to Ariel the city where David dwelt add ye year
to year let them kill sacrifices

292 Yet I will distress Ariel and there shall be heaviness and
sorrow and it shall be unto me as Ariel

293 And I will camp against thee round about and will lay siege
against thee with a mount and I will raise forts against thee

294 And thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the
ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice
shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground
and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust

295 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust
and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth
away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly

296 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder and with
earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of
devouring fire

297 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel
even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress
her shall be as a dream of a night vision

298 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he
eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty
man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold
he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all
the nations be that fight against mount Zion

299 Stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are
drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink

2910 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep
and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers
hath he covered

2911 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying Read
this I pray thee and he saith I cannot for it is sealed 2912 And
the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying Read this I
pray thee and he saith I am not learned

2913 Wherefore the Lord said Forasmuch as this people draw near me
with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed
their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the
precept of men 2914 Therefore behold I will proceed to do a
marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a
wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the
understanding of their prudent men shall be hid

2915 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
LORD and their works are in the dark and they say Who seeth us and
who knoweth us  2916 Surely your turning of things upside down shall
be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him that
made it He made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that
framed it He had no understanding  2917 Is it not yet a very little
while and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the
fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest  2918 And in that day
