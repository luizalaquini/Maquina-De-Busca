It was half an hour before he felt strong enough to stand After the dim wet warmth of the bathhouse the air outside was a slap across the face M’lord will be looking for him by now a guard told Qyburn Her too Do I need to carry him

I can still walk Brienne give me your arm

Clutching her Jaime let them herd him across the yard to a vast draughty hall larger even than the throne room in King’s Landing Huge hearths lined the walls one every ten feet or so more than he could count but no fires had been lit so the chill between the walls went bone-deep A dozen spearmen in fur cloaks guarded the doors and the steps that led up to the two galleries above And in the center of that immense emptiness at a trestle table surrounded by what seemed like acres of smooth slate floor the Lord of the Dreadfort waited attended only by a cupbearer

My lord said Brienne when they stood before him

Roose Bolton’s eyes were paler than stone darker than milk and his voice was spider soft I am pleased that you are strong enough to attend me ser My lady do be seated He gestured at the spread of cheese bread cold meat and fruit that covered the table Will you drink red or white Of indifferent vintage I fear Ser Amory drained Lady Whent’s cellars nearly dry

I trust you killed him for it Jaime slid into the offered seat quickly so Bolton could not see how weak he was White is for Starks I’ll drink red like a good Lannister

I would prefer water said Brienne

Elmar the red for Ser Jaime water for the Lady Brienne and hippocras for myself Bolton waved a hand at their escort dismissing them and the men beat a silent retreat

Habit made Jaime reach for his wine with his right hand His stump rocked the goblet spattering his clean linen bandages with bright red spots and forcing him to catch the cup with his left hand before it fell but Bolton pretended not to notice his clumsiness The northman helped himself to a prune and ate it with small sharp bites Do try these Ser Jaime They are most sweet and help move the bowels as well Lord Vargo took them from an inn before he burnt it

My bowels move fine that goat’s no lord and your prunes don’t interest me half so much as your intentions

Regarding you A faint smile touched Roose Bolton’s lips You are a perilous prize ser You sow dissension wherever you go Even here in my happy house of Harrenhal His voice was a whisker above a whisper And in Riverrun as well it seems Do you know Edmure Tully has offered a thousand golden dragons for your recapture

Is that all My sister will pay ten times as much

Will she That smile again there for an instant gone as quick Ten thousand dragons is a formidable sum Of course there is Lord Karstark’s offer to consider as well He promises the hand of his daughter to the man who brings him your head

Leave it to your goat to get it backward said Jaime

Bolton gave a soft chuckle Harrion Karstark was captive here when we took the castle did you know I gave him all the Karhold men still with me and sent him off with Glover I do hope nothing ill befell him at Duskendale… else Alys Karstark would be all that remains of Lord Rickard’s progeny He chose another prune Fortunately for you I have no need of a wife I wed the Lady Walda Frey whilst I was at the Twins

Fair Walda Awkwardly Jaime tried to hold the bread with his stump while tearing it with his left hand

Fat Walda My lord of Frey offered me my bride’s weight in silver for a dowry so I chose accordingly Elmar break off some bread for Ser Jaime

The boy tore a fist-sized chunk off one end of the loaf and handed it to Jaime Brienne tore her own bread Lord Bolton she asked it’s said you mean to give Harrenhal to Vargo Hoat

That was his price Lord Bolton said The Lannisters are not the only men who pay their debts I must take my leave soon in any case Edmure Tully is to wed the Lady Roslin Frey at the Twins and my king commands my attendance

Edmure weds said Jaime Not Robb Stark

His Grace King Robb is wed Bolton spit a prune pit into his hand and put it aside To a Westerling of the Crag I am told her name is Jeyne No doubt you know her ser Her father is your father’s bannerman

My father has a good many bannermen and most of them have daughters Jaime groped one-handed for his goblet trying to recall this Jeyne The Westerlings were an old house with more pride than power

This cannot be true Brienne said stubbornly King Robb was sworn to wed a Frey He would never break faith he—

His Grace is a boy of sixteen said Roose Bolton mildly And I would thank you not to question my word my lady

Jaime felt almost sorry for Robb Stark He won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber poor fool How does Lord Walder relish dining on trout in place of wolf he asked

Oh trout makes for a tasty supper Bolton lifted a pale finger toward his cupbearer Though my poor Elmar is bereft He was to wed Arya Stark but my good father of Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when King Robb betrayed him

Is there word of Arya Stark Brienne leaned forward Lady Catelyn had feared that… is the girl still alive

Oh yes said the Lord of the Dreadfort

You have certain knowledge of that my lord

Roose Bolton shrugged Arya Stark was lost for a time it was true but now she has been found I mean to see her returned safely to the north

Her and her sister both said Brienne Tyrion Lannister has promised us both girls for his brother

That seemed to amuse the Lord of the Dreadfort My lady has no one told you Lannisters lie

Is that a slight on the honor of my House Jaime picked up the cheese knife with his good hand A rounded point and dull he said sliding his thumb along the edge of the blade but it will go through your eye all the same Sweat beaded his brow He could only hope he did not look as feeble as he felt

Lord Bolton’s little smile paid another visit to his lips You speak boldly for a man who needs help to break his bread My guards are all around us I remind you

All around us and half a league away Jaime glanced down the vast length of the hall By the time they reach us you’ll be as dead as Aerys

’Tis scarcely chivalrous to threaten your host over his own cheese and olives the Lord of the Dreadfort scolded In the north we hold the laws of hospitality sacred still

I’m a captive here not a guest Your goat cut off my hand If you think some prunes will make me overlook that you’re bloody well mistaken

That took Roose Bolton aback Perhaps I am Perhaps I ought to make a wedding gift of you to Edmure Tully… or strike your head off as your sister did for Eddard Stark

I would not advise it Casterly Rock has a long memory

A thousand leagues of mountain sea and bog lie between my walls and your rock Lannister enmity means little to Bolton

Lannister friendship could mean much Jaime thought he knew the game they were playing now But does the wench know as well He dare not look to see

I am not certain you are the sort of friends a wise man would want Roose Bolton beckoned to the boy Elmar carve our guests a slice off the roast

Brienne was served first but made no move to eat My lord she said Ser Jaime is to be exchanged for Lady Catelyn’s daughters You must free us to continue on our way

The raven that came from Riverrun told of an escape not an exchange And if you helped this captive slip his bonds you are guilty of treason my lady

The big wench rose to her feet I serve Lady Stark

And I the King in the North Or the King Who Lost the North as some now call him Who never wished to trade Ser Jaime back to the Lannisters

Sit down and eat Brienne Jaime urged as Elmar placed a slice of roast before him dark and bloody If Bolton meant to kill us he wouldn’t be wasting his precious prunes on us at such peril to his bowels He stared at the meat and realized there was no way to cut it one-handed I am worth less than a girl now he thought The goat’s evened the trade though I doubt Lady Catelyn will thank him when Cersei returns her whelps in like condition The thought made him grimace I will get the blame for that as well I’ll wager

Roose Bolton cut his meat methodically the blood running across his plate Lady Brienne will you sit if I tell you that I hope to send Ser Jaime on just as you and Lady Stark desire

I… you’d send us on The wench sounded wary but she sat That is good my lord

It is However Lord Vargo has created me one small… difficulty He turned his pale eyes on Jaime Do you know why Hoat cut off your hand
