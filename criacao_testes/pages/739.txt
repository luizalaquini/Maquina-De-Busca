the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes 27 That
pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn
aside the way of the meek and a man and his father will go in unto
the same maid to profane my holy name 28 And they lay themselves
down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the
wine of the condemned in the house of their god

29 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them whose height was like the
height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet I destroyed
his fruit from above and his roots from beneath

210 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty
years through the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite

211 And I raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men
for Nazarites Is it not even thus O ye children of Israel saith the
LORD

212 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink and commanded the
prophets saying Prophesy not

213 Behold I am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full
of sheaves

214 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift and the strong
shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver
himself 215 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he
that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself neither shall he that
rideth the horse deliver himself

216 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked
in that day saith the LORD

31 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you O children
of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land
of Egypt saying 32 You only have I known of all the families of the
earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities

33 Can two walk together except they be agreed  34 Will a lion
roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of
his den if he have taken nothing  35 Can a bird fall in a snare
upon the earth where no gin is for him  shall one take up a snare
from the earth and have taken nothing at all  36 Shall a trumpet be
blown in the city and the people not be afraid  shall there be evil
in a city and the LORD hath not done it  37 Surely the Lord GOD
will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
prophets

38 The lion hath roared who will not fear the Lord GOD hath spoken
who can but prophesy  39 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod and in
the palaces in the land of Egypt and say Assemble yourselves upon
the mountains of Samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst
thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof

310 For they know not to do right saith the LORD who store up
violence and robbery in their palaces

311 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD An adversary there shall be
even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from
thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled

312 Thus saith the LORD As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of
the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of
Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed and
in Damascus in a couch

313 Hear ye and testify in the house of Jacob saith the Lord GOD
the God of hosts 314 That in the day that I shall visit the
transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of
Bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the
ground

315 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house and the
houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end
saith the LORD

41 Hear this word ye kine of Bashan that are in the mountain of
Samaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say to
their masters Bring and let us drink

42 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall
come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your
posterity with fishhooks

43 And ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is
before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the LORD

44 Come to Bethel and transgress at Gilgal multiply transgression
and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three
years 45 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven and
proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you O ye
children of Israel saith the Lord GOD

46 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities
and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto
me saith the LORD

47 And also I have withholden the rain from you when there were yet
three months to the harvest and I caused it to rain upon one city
and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained
