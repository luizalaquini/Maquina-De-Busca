righteousness to grow up unto David and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the land

3316 In those days shall Judah be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell
safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called The LORD
our righteousness

3317 For thus saith the LORD David shall never want a man to sit
upon the throne of the house of Israel 3318 Neither shall the
priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and
to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually

3319 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah saying 3320 Thus
saith the LORD If ye can break my covenant of the day and my
covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in
their season 3321 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my
servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and
with the Levites the priests my ministers

3322 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of
the sea measured so will I multiply the seed of David my servant and
the Levites that minister unto me

3323 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah saying 3324
Considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying The two
families which the LORD hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus
they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation
before them

3325 Thus saith the LORD If my covenant be not with day and night
and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth 3326
Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant so that
I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham
Isaac and Jacob for I will cause their captivity to return and have
mercy on them

341 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD when
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms
of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against
Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying 342 Thus saith
the LORD the God of Israel Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah
and tell him Thus saith the LORD Behold I will give this city into
the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall burn it with fire 343
And thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken
and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of
the king of Babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and
thou shalt go to Babylon

344 Yet hear the word of the LORD O Zedekiah king of Judah Thus
saith the LORD of thee Thou shalt not die by the sword 345 But thou
shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former
kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and
they will lament thee saying Ah lord for I have pronounced the
word saith the LORD

346 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
king of Judah in Jerusalem 347 When the king of Babylons army
fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that
were left against Lachish and against Azekah for these defenced
cities remained of the cities of Judah

348 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD after
that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which
were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them 349 That every man
should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an
Hebrew or an Hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of
them to wit of a Jew his brother

3410 Now when all the princes and all the people which had entered
into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and
every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves
of them any more then they obeyed and let them go

3411 But afterward they turned and caused the servants and the
handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into
subjection for servants and for handmaids

3412 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD
saying 3413 Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel I made a
covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of
the land of Egypt out of the house of bondmen saying 3414 At the
end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew which
hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou
shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto
me neither inclined their ear

3415 And ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name 3416 But
ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and
every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure
to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for
servants and for handmaids

3417 Therefore thus saith the LORD Ye have not hearkened unto me in
proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his
neighbour behold I proclaim a liberty for you saith the LORD to
the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and I will make you
to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
