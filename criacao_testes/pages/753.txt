You will his father promised and while you are about it see if you can find your wife’s bed as well

So the talk has reached even him I have thank you It’s that piece of furniture between the window and the hearth with the velvet canopy and the mattress stuffed with goose down

I am pleased you know of it Now perhaps you ought to try and know the woman who shares it with you

Woman Child you mean Has a spider been whispering in your ear or do I have my sweet sister to thank Considering the things that went on beneath Cersei’s blankets you would think she’d have the decency to keep her nose out of his Tell me why is it that all of Sansa’s maids arc women in Cersei’s service I am sick of being spied upon in my own chambers

If you mislike your wife’s servants dismiss them and hire ones more to your liking That is your right It is your wife’s maidenhood that concerns me not her maids This… delicacy puzzles me You seem to have no difficulty bedding whores Is the Stark girl made differently

Why do you take so much bloody interest in where I put my cock Tyrion demanded Sansa is too young

She is old enough to be Lady of Winterfell once her brother is dead Claim her maidenhood and you will be one step closer to claiming the north Get her with child and the prize is all but won Do I need to remind you that a marriage that has not been consummated can be set aside

By the High Septon or a Council of Faith Our present High Septon is a trained seal who barks prettily on command Moon Boy is more like to annul my marriage than he is

Perhaps I should have married Sansa Stark to Moon Boy He might have known what to do with her

Tyrion’s hands clenched on the arms of his chair I have heard all I mean to hear on the subject of my wife’s maidenhead But so long as we are discussing marriage why is it that I hear nothing of my sister’s impending nuptials As I recall—

Lord Tywin cut him off Mace Tyrell has refused my offer to marry Cersei to his heir Willas

Refused our sweet Cersei That put Tyrion in a much better mood

When I first broached the match to him Lord Tyrell seemed well enough disposed his father said A day later all was changed The old woman’s work She hectors her son unmercifully Varys claims she told him that your sister was too old and too used for this precious one-legged grandson of hers

Cersei must have loved that He laughed

Lord Tywin gave him a chilly look She does not know Nor will she It is better for all of us if the offer was never made See that you remember that Tyrion The offer was never made

What offer Tyrion rather suspected that Lord Tyrell might come to regret this rebuff

Your sister will be wed The question is to whom I have several thoughts— Before he could get to them there was a rap at the door and a guardsman stuck in his head to announce Grand Maester Pycelle He may enter said Lord Tywin

Pycelle tottered in on a cane and stopped long enough to give Tyrion a look that would curdle milk His once-magnificent white beard which someone had unaccountably shaved off was growing back sparse and wispy leaving him with unsightly pink wattles to dangle beneath his neck My lord Hand the old man said bowing as deeply as he could without falling there has been another bird from Castle Black Mayhaps we could consult privily

There’s no need for that Lord Tywin waved Grand Maester Pycelle to a seat Tyrion may stay

Oooooh may I He rubbed his nose and waited

Pycelle cleared his throat which involved a deal of coughing and hawking The letter is from the same Bowen Marsh who sent the last The castellan He writes that Lord Mormont has sent word of wildlings moving south in vast numbers

The lands beyond the Wall cannot support vast numbers said Lord Tywin firmly This warning is not new

This last is my lord Mormont sent a bird from the haunted forest to report that he was under attack More ravens have returned since but none with letters This Bowen Marsh fears Lord Mormont slain with all his strength

Tyrion had rather liked old Jeor Mormont with his gruff manner and talking bird Is this certain he asked

It is not Pycelle admitted but none of Mormont’s men have returned as yet Marsh fears the wildlings have killed them and that the Wall itself may be attacked next He fumbled in his robe and found the paper Here is his letter my lord a plea to all five kings He wants men as many men as we can send him

Five kings His father was annoyed There is one king in Westeros Those fools in black might try and remember that if they wish His Grace to heed them When you reply tell him that Renly is dead and the others are traitors and pretenders

No doubt they will be glad to learn it The Wall is a world apart and news oft reaches them late Pycelle bobbed his head up and down What shall I tell Marsh concerning the men he begs for Shall we convene the council…
