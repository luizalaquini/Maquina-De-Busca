message
P 97
 Where is your master the farmer  asked Gabriel
kindling with the idea of getting employment that
seemed to strike him now
 Tisnt a master  tis a mistress shepherd
 A woman farmer  
Ay a blieve and a rich one too  said a by
stander  Lately a came here from a distance Took
on her uncles farm who died suddenly Used to
measure his money in half-pint cups They say now
that sheve business in every bank in Casterbridge and
thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than
you and I do pitch-halfpenny -- not a bit in the world
shepherd
Thats she back there upon the pony said Mary+
ann wiher face a-covered up in that black cloth with
holes in it
Oak his features smudged grimy and undiscoverable
from the smoke and heat his smock-frock burnt-into
holes and dripping with water the ash stem of his sheep+
crook charred six inches shorter advansed with the
humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to
the slight female form in the saddle He lifted his
hat with respect and not without galantry stepping
close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice --
 Do you happen to want a shepherd maam  
She lifted the wool veil tied round her face and
looked all astonishment Gabriel and his cold-hearted
darling Bathsheba Everdene were face to face
Bathsheba did not speak and he mechanically
repeated in an abashed and sad voice --
 Do you want a shepherd maam

RECOGNITION -- A TIMID GIRL
BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade She scarcely
knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of
the meeting or to be concerned at its awkwardness
There was room for a little pity also for a very little
exultation  the former at his position the latter at her
own Embarrassed she was not and she remembered
Gabriels declaration of love to her at Norcombe only
to think she had nearly forgotten it
 Yes she murmured putting on an air of dignity
and turning again to him with a little warmth of cheek 
 I do want a shepherd But --  -- 
 Hes the very man maam said one of the villagers
quietly
Conviction breeds conviction  Ay that a is said
a second decisively
The man truly   said a third with heartiness
 Hes all there   said number four fervidly
Then will you tell him to speak to the bailiff said
Bathsheba
All was practical again now A summer eve and
loneliness would have been necessary to give the
meeting its proper fulness of romance
the palpitation within his breast at discovering that this
Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of
Venus the well-known and admired retired with him to
talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring
The fire before them wasted away Men said
Bathsheba  you shall take a little refreshment after this
extra work Will you come to the house 
We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal
freer Miss

if so be yed send it to Warrens Malthouse
replied the spokesman
Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness and the
men straggled on to the village in twos and threes -- Oak
and the bailiff being left by the rick alone
And now said the bailiff finally all is settled I
think about your coming and I am going home-along
Good-night to ye shepherd
 Can you get me a lodging   inquired Gabriel
That I cant indeed he said moving past Oak as
a Christian edges past an offertory-plate when he does
not mean to contribute If you follow on the road till
you come to Warrens Malthouse where they are all
gone to have their snap of victuals I daresay some of
em will tell you of a place Good-night to ye shepherd
The bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving
his neighbour as himself went up the hill and Oak
walked on to the village still astonished at the ren+
counter with Bathsheba glad of his nearness to her and
perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl
of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool
woman here But some women only require an emerg+
ency to make them fit for one
Obligcd to some extent to forgo dreaming in order
to find the way he reachcd the churchyard and passed
round it under the wall where several ancient trees grew
There was a wide margin of grass along here and
Gabriels footsteps were deadened by its softness even
at this indurating period of the year When abreast of
a trunk which appeared to be the oldest of the old he
became aware that a figure was standing behind it
