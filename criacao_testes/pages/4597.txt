Feared that I might keep it you mean Doubtless that’s why she’s never once left my bedside

Don’t be impertinent Cersei has a royal wedding to plan I am waging a war and you have been out of danger for at least a fortnight Lord Tywin studied his son’s disfigured face his pale green eyes unflinching Though the wound is ghastly enough I’ll grant you What madness possessed you

The foe was at the gates with a battering ram If Jaime had led the sortie you’d call it valor

Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle I trust you killed the man who cut you

Oh the wretch is dead enough Though it had been Podrick Payne who’d killed Ser Mandon shoving him into the river to drown beneath the weight of his armor A dead enemy is a joy forever Tyrion said blithely though Ser Mandon was not his true enemy The man had no reason to want him dead He was only a catspaw and I believe I know the cat She told him to make certain I did not survive the battle But without proof Lord Tywin would never listen to such a charge Why are you here in the city Father he asked Shouldn’t you be off fighting Lord Stannis or Robb Stark or someone And the sooner the better

Until Lord Redwyne brings his fleet up we lack the ships to assail Dragonstone It makes no matter Stannis Baratheon’s sun set on the Blackwater As for Stark the boy is still in the west but a large force of northmen under Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are descending toward Duskendale I’ve sent Lord Tarly to meet them while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off their retreat Tallhart and Glover will be caught between them with a third of Stark’s strength

Duskendale There was nothing at Duskendale worth such a risk Had the Young Wolf finally blundered

It’s nothing you need trouble yourself with Your face is pale as death and there’s blood seeping through your dressings Say what you want and take yourself back to bed

What I want    His throat felt raw and tight What did he want More than you can ever give me Father Pod tells me that Littlefinger’s been made Lord of Harrenhal

An empty title so long as Roose Bolton holds the castle for Robb Stark yet Lord Baelish was desirous of the honor He did us good service in the matter of the Tyrell marriage A Lannister pays his debts

The Tyrell marriage had been Tyrion’s notion in point of fact but it would seem churlish to try to claim that now That title may not be as empty as you think he warned Littlefinger does nothing without good reason But be that as it may You said something about paying debts I believe

And you want your own reward is that it Very well What is it you would have of me Lands castle some office

A little bloody gratitude would make a nice start

Lord Tywin stared at him unblinking Mummers and monkeys require applause So did Aerys for that matter You did as you were commanded and I am sure it was to the best of your ability No one denies the part you played

That part I played What nostrils Tyrion had left must surely have flared I saved your bloody city it seems to me

Most people seem to feel that it was my attack on Lord Stannis’s flank that turned the tide of battle Lords Tyrell Rowan Redwyne and Tarly fought nobly as well and I’m told it was your sister Cersei who set the pyromancers to making the wildfire that destroyed the Baratheon fleet

While all I did was get my nosehairs trimmed is that it Tyrion could not keep the bitterness out of his voice

Your chain was a clever stroke and crucial to our victory Is that what you wanted to hear I am told we have you to thank for our Dornish alliance as well You may be pleased to learn that Myrcella has arrived safely at Sunspear Ser Arys Oakheart writes that she has taken a great liking to Princess Arianne and that Prince Trystane is enchanted with her I mislike giving House Martell a hostage but I suppose that could not be helped

We’ll have our own hostage Tyrion said A council seat was also part of the bargain Unless Prince Doran brings an army when he comes to claim it he’ll be putting himself in our power

Would that a council seat were all Martell came to claim Lord Tywin said You promised him vengeance as well

I promised him justice

Call it what you will It still comes down to blood

Not an item in short supply surely I splashed through lakes of it during the battle Tyrion saw no reason not to cut to the heart of the matter Or have you grown so fond of Gregor Clegane that you cannot bear to part with him

Ser Gregor has his uses as did his brother Every lord has need of a beast from time to time    a lesson you seem to have learned judging from Ser Bronn and those clansmen of yours

Tyrion thought of Timett’s burned eye Shagga with his axe Chella in her necklace of dried ears And Bronn Bronn most of all The woods are full of beasts he reminded his father The alleyways as well

True Perhaps other dogs would hunt as well I shall think on it If there is nothing else   

You have important letters yes Tyrion rose on unsteady legs closed his eyes for an instant as a wave of dizziness washed over him and took a shaky step toward the door Later he would reflect that he should have taken a second and then a third Instead he turned What do I want you ask I’ll tell you what I want I want what is mine by rights I want Casterly Rock

His father’s mouth grew hard Your brother’s birthright

The knights of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry to father children and to hold land you know that as well as I The day Jaime put on that white cloak he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock but never once have you acknowledged it It’s past time I want you to stand up before the realm and proclaim that I am your son and your lawful heir

Lord Tywin’s eyes were a pale green flecked with gold as luminous as they were merciless Casterly Rock he declared in a flat cold dead tone And then Never

The word hung between them huge sharp poisoned

I knew the answer before I asked Tyrion said Eighteen years since Jaime joined the Kingsguard and I never once raised the issue I must have known I must always have known Why he made himself ask though he knew he would rue the question

You ask that You who killed your mother to come into the world You are an ill-made devious disobedient spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine To teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him But neither gods nor men shall ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse

My whorehouse The dawn broke Tyrion understood all at once where this bile had come from He ground his teeth together and said Cersei told you about Alayaya

Is that her name I confess I cannot remember the names of all your whores Who was the one you married as a boy

Tysha He spat out the answer defiant

And that camp follower on the Green Fork

Why do you care he asked unwilling even to speak Shae’s name in his presence

I don’t No more than I care if they live or die

It was you who had Yaya whipped It was not a question

Your sister told me of your threats against my grandsons Lord Tywin’s voice was colder than ice Did she lie

Tyrion would not deny it I made threats yes To keep Alayaya safe So the Kettleblacks would not misuse her

To save a whore’s virtue you threatened your own House your own kin Is that the way of it

You were the one who taught me that a good threat is often more telling than a blow Not that Joffrey hasn’t tempted me sore a few hundred times If you’re so anxious to whip people start with him But Tommen    why would I harm Tommen He’s a good lad and mine own blood

As was your mother Lord Tywin rose abruptly to tower over his dwarf son Go back to your bed Tyrion and speak to me no more of your rights to Casterly Rock You shall have your reward but it shall be one I deem appropriate to your service and station And make no mistake—this was the last time I will suffer you to bring shame onto House Lannister You are done with whores The next one I find in your bed I’ll hang





DAVOS

He watched the sail grow for a long time trying to decide whether he would sooner live or die

Dying would be easier he knew All he had to do was crawl inside his cave and let the ship pass by and death would find him For days now the fever had been burning through him turning his bowels to brown water and making him shiver in his restless sleep Each morning found him weaker It will not be much longer he had taken to telling himself
