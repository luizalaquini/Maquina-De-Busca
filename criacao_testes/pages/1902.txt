Lets write this in terms of z-transforms  The two-sided z-transform of yn
is
LB
EQ
Yz =  sum from n=- infinity to infinity ynz sup -n  =
 sum from n  sum from k xkhn-k z sup -n

Writing z sup -n as  z sup -n-k z sup -k  and interchanging the order
of summation this becomes

Yz mark =  sum from k  sum from n  hn-kz sup -n-k xkz sup -k

Thus convolution in the time domain is the same as multiplication in the
z-transform domain a very important result  Applied to the linear system of
Figure 410 this means that the output z-transform is the input z-transform
multiplied by the z-transform of the systems impulse response
pp
What we really want to do is to relate the frequency spectrum of
the output to the response of the system and the spectrum of the
input
In fact frequency spectra are very closely connected with z-transforms  A
periodic signal xn which repeats every N samples has DFT

and its z-transform is

EQ
sum from n=- infinity to infinity xn z sup -n

Hence the DFT is the same as the z-transform of a single cycle of the signal
evaluated at the points  z= e sup j2 pi rN  for r=0 1   N-1
In other
words the frequency components are samples of the z-transform at N
equally-spaced points around the unit circle
Hence the frequency spectrum at the output of a linear system is the product of
the
input spectrum and the frequency response of the system itself that is the
transform of its impulse response function
It should be admitted that this statement is somewhat questionable
because to get from z-transforms to DFTs we have assumed that
a single cycle only is transformed em and the impulse response function of
a system is not necessarily periodic  The real action of the system is
to multiply z-transforms not DFTs  However it is useful in imagining
the behaviour of the system to think in terms of products of DFTs and in
practice it is always these rather than z-transforms which are computed
because of the existence of the FFT algorithm

Figure 411 shows the frequency spectrum of a typical voiced speech signal
FC Figure 411
The overall shape shows humps at the formant positions like those in the
idealized Figure 22  However superimposed on this is an oscillation
in the frequency domain at the pitch frequency  This occurs because the
transform of the vocal tract filter has been multiplied by that of the
pitch pulse the latter having components at harmonics of the pitch frequency
The oscillation must be suppressed before the formants
can be estimated to any degree of accuracy
pp
One way of eliminating the oscillation is to perform pitch-synchronous
analysis
This removes the influence of pitch from the frequency domain by dealing with
it in the time domain  The snag is of course that it is not easy to estimate
the pitch frequency  some techniques for doing so are discussed in the next
main section
Another way is to use linear predictive analysis which really does get rid
of pitch information without having to estimate the pitch period first  A
smooth
frequency spectrum can be produced using the analysis techniques described in
Chapter 6 which provides
a suitable starting-point for formant frequency estimation
The third method is to remove the pitch ripple from the frequency spectrum
directly  This will be discussed in an intuitive rather than a
theoretical way because linear predictive methods are becoming dominant
in speech processing
rh Cepstral processing of speech
Suppose the frequency spectrum of Figure 411 were actually a time waveform
To remove the high-frequency pitch ripple is easy  just filter it out
However
filtering removes

additive
ripples whereas this is a
ul
multiplicative
ripple  To turn multiplication into addition take logarithms  Then the
procedure would be
