He’s going to wet his pants Hot Pie suggested

Leave him be said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them Lommy had named him the Bull on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore Lommy didn’t dare mock the Bull He was older and big for his age with a broad chest and strong-looking arms

You better give Hot Pie the sword Arry Lommy said Hot Pie wants it bad He kicked a boy to death He’ll do the same to you I bet

I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him there until he was dead Hot Pie boasted I kicked him all to pieces His balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black You better gimme the sword

Arya slid her practice sword from her belt You can have this one she told Hot Pie not wanting to fight

That’s just some stick He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle’s hilt

Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey’s hindquarters The animal hawed and bucked dumping Hot Pie on the ground She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking Blood dribbled from his nostrils When Hot Pie began to wail Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed You want some sword too she yelled but he didn’t He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away

The Bull shouted Behind you and Arya spun Hot Pie was on his knees his fist closing around a big jagged rock She let him throw it ducking her head as it sailed past Then she flew at him He raised a hand and she hit it and then his cheek and then his knee He grabbed for her and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head He fell down and got up and stumbled after her his red face all smeared with dirt and blood Arya slid into a water dancer’s stance and waited When he came close enough she lunged right between his legs so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks

By the time Yoren pulled her off him Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over Enough the black brother roared prying the stick sword from her fingers you want to kill the fool When Lommy and some others started to squeal the old man turned on them too Shut your mouths or I’ll be shutting them for you Any more o’ this I’ll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall He spat And that goes twice for you Arry You come with me boy Now

They were all looking at her even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed but Arya ignored him

The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees cursing and muttering all the while If I had a thimble o’ sense I would’ve left you in King’s Landing You hear me boy He always snarled that word putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear Unlace your breeches and pull ‘em down Go on there’s no one here to see Do it

Sullenly Arya did as he said Over there against the oak Yes like that She wrapped her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood You scream now You scream loud

I won’t Arya thought stubbornly but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs the shriek burst out of her anyway Think that hurt he said Try this one The stick came whistling Arya shrieked again clutching the tree to keep from falling One more She held on tight chewing her lip flinching when she heard it coming The stroke made her jump and howl I won’t cry she thought I won’t do that I’m a Stark of Winterfell our sigil is the direwolf direwolves don’t cry She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain Might be I got your attention now Yoren said Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers you’ll get twice what you give you hear me Now cover yourself

They’re not my brothers Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches but she knew better than to say so Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces

Yoren was looking at her You hurt

Calm as still water she told herself the way Syrio Forel had taught her Some

He spat That pie boy’s hurting worse It wasn’t him as killed your father girl nor that thieving Lommy neither Hitting them won’t bring him back

I know Arya muttered sullenly

Here’s something you don’t know It wasn’t supposed to happen like it did I was set to leave wagons bought and loaded and a man comes with a boy for me and a purse of coin and a message never mind who it’s from Lord Eddard’s to take the black he says to me wait he’ll be going with you Why d’you think I was there Only something went queer

Joffrey Arya breathed Someone should kill him

Someone will but it won’t be me nor you neither Yoren tossed back her stick sword Got sourleaf back at the wagons he said as they made their way back to the road You’ll chew some it’ll help with the sting

It did help some though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood Even so she walked for the rest of that day and the day after and the day after that too raw to sit a donkey Hot Pie was worse off Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock Lommy Greenhands wasn’t even hurt yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get Every time you look at him he twitches the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey She did not answer It seemed safer not to talk to anyone

That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground staring up at the great red comet The comet was splendid and scary all at once The Red Sword the Bull named it he claimed it looked like a sword the blade still red-hot from the forge When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too only it wasn’t a new sword it was Ice her father’s greatsword all ripply Valyrian steel and the red was Lord Eddard’s blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King’s Justice had cut off his head Yoren had made her look away when it happened yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have after

When at last she slept she dreamed of home The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall and Yoren had promised he’d leave her there with no one any wiser about who she’d been She yearned to see her mother again and Robb and Bran and Rickon… but it was Jon Snow she thought of most She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell so Jon might muss up her hair and call her little sister She’d tell him I missed you and he’d say it too at the very same moment the way they always used to say things together She would have liked that She would have liked that better than anything
