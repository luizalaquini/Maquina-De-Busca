But we must stick with one language for phonological classification  Hence
it follows that there is no pair of words which is distinguished
by the difference between
ul
h
and
ul
ng
Technically
they belong to the same phoneme  However technical considerations
in this case must take second place to common sense
pp
The
ul
j
in jig is another interesting case  It can be considered
to belong to a
ul
j
phoneme or to be a sequence of two
phonemes
ul
d
followed by
ul
zh
the sound in vision  There is
disagreement on this point in phonetics textbooks and we do not
have the time nor probably the inclination to consider the
pros and cons of this moot point
I have resolved the matter arbitrarily by writing it as a separate
phoneme  The
ul
ch
in choose is a similar case
c
ul
t
followed by the
ul
sh
in shoes
pp
Another difficulty this time where Table 21 does not show how to
distinguish between two sounds which
ul
do
discriminate words in many peoples English is the
ul
w
in witch
and that in which  The latter is conventionally transcribed
as a sequence of two phonemes
ul
h w
pp
The last few difficulties are all to do with deciding whether a
sound belongs to a single phoneme class or comprises a sequence
of sounds each of which belongs to a phoneme
Are the
ul
j
in jug the
ul
ch
in chug and the
ul
w
in which
single phonemes or not  The definition above of a phoneme
as a set of sounds whose members do not discriminate any words
in the language does not help us to answer this question
As far as this definition is concerned we could go so far as
to call each and every word of the language an individual phoneme
It is clear that some acoustic evidence and quite a lot of judgement
is being used when phonemes such as those of Table 21 are defined
pp
So much for the consonants  This same problem occurs in vowel sounds
particularly in diphthongs which are sequences of two vowel-like sounds
Do the vowels of main and man belong to different phonemes
Clearly so if they are both transcribed as single units for they
distinguish the two words
Notwithstanding the fact that they are sequences of separate sounds
a logically consistent system could be constructed which gave separate
unitary symbols to each diphthong
However it is usual to employ a compound symbol which indicates explicitly
the character of the two vowel-like sounds involved
We will transcribe the diphthong of main as a sequence of two
vowels
ul
e
as in head and
ul
i
as in hid not I
This is done primarily for economy of symbols choosing the constituent
sounds on the basis of the closest match to existing vowel sounds
Note that this again violates purely
