Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan’s fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater—Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone more than half of them Florents—to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar’s defection Claw Isle was but lightly garrisoned its castle reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets Volantene glass gold and silver plate jeweled cups magnificent hawks an axe of Valyrian steel a horn that could summon monsters from the deep chests of rubies and more wines than a man could drink in a hundred years Though Celtigar had shown the world a niggardly face he had never stinted on his own comforts Put his castle to the torch and his people to the sword I say Ser Axell concluded Leave Claw Isle a desolation of ash and bone fit only for carrion crows so the realm might see the fate of those who bed with Lannisters

Stannis listened to Ser Axell’s recitation in silence grinding his jaw slowly from side to side When it was done he said It could be done I believe The risk is small Joffrey has no strength at sea until Lord Redwyne sets sail from the Arbor The plunder might serve to keep that Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan loyal for a time By itself Claw Isle is worthless but its fall would serve notice to Lord Tywin that my cause is not yet done The king turned back to Davos Speak truly ser What do you make of Ser Axell’s proposal

Speak truly ser Davos remembered the dark cell he had shared with Lord Alester remembered Lamprey and Porridge He thought of the promises that Ser Axell had made on the bridge above the yard A ship or a shove what shall it be But this was Stannis asking Your Grace he said slowly I make it folly… aye and cowardice

Cowardice Ser Axell all but shouted No man calls me craven before my king

Silence Stannis commanded Ser Davos speak on I would hear your reasons

Davos turned to face Ser Axell You say we ought show the realm we are not done Strike a blow Make war aye… but on what enemy You will find no Lannisters on Claw Isle

We will find traitors said Ser Axell though it may be I could find some closer to home Even in this very room

Davos ignored the jibe I don’t doubt Lord Celtigar bent the knee to the boy Joffrey He is an old done man who wants no more than to end his days in his castle drinking his fine wine out of his jeweled cups He turned back to Stannis Yet he came when you called sire Came with his ships and swords He stood by you at Storm’s End when Lord Renly came down on us and his ships sailed up the Blackwater His men fought for you killed for you burned for you Claw Isle is weakly held yes Held by women and children and old men And why is that Because their husbands and sons and fathers died on the Blackwater that’s why Died at their oars or with swords in their hands fighting beneath our banners Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind to rape their widows and put their children to the sword These smallfolk are no traitors…

They are insisted Ser Axell Not all of Celtigar’s men were slain on the Blackwater Hundreds were taken with their lord and bent the knee when he did

When he did Davos repeated They were his men His sworn men What choice were they given

Every man has choices They might have refused to kneel Some did and died for it Yet they died true men and loyal

Some men are stronger than others It was a feeble answer and Davos knew it Stannis Baratheon was a man of iron will who neither understood nor forgave weakness in others I am losing he thought despairing

It is every man’s duty to remain loyal to his rightful king even if the lord he serves proves false Stannis declared in a tone that brooked no argument

A desperate folly took hold of Davos a recklessness akin to madness As you remained loyal to King Aerys when your brother raised his banners he blurted

Shocked silence followed until Ser Axell cried Treason and snatched his dagger from its sheath Your Grace he speaks his infamy to your face

Davos could hear Stannis grinding his teeth A vein bulged blue and swollen in the king’s brow Their eyes met Put up your knife Ser Axell And leave us

As it please Your Grace—

It would please me for you to leave said Stannis Take yourself from my presence and send me Melisandre

As you command Ser Axell slid the knife away bowed and hurried toward the door His boots rang against the floor angry

You have always presumed on my forbearance Stannis warned Davos when they were alone I can shorten your tongue as easy as I did your fingers smuggler

I am your man Your Grace So it is your tongue to do with as you please

It is he said calmer And I would have it speak the truth Though the truth is a bitter draught at times Aerys If you only knew… that was a hard choosing My blood or my liege My brother or my king He grimaced Have you ever seen the Iron Throne The barbs along the back the ribbons of twisted steel the jagged ends of swords and knives all tangled up and melted It is not a comfortable seat ser Aerys cut himself so often men took to calling him King Scab and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair By that chair to hear some tell it It is not a seat where a man can rest at ease Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted it so desperately

Why would you want it then Davos asked him

It is not a question of wanting The throne is mine as Robert’s heir That is law After me it must pass to my daughter unless Selyse should finally give me a son He ran three fingers lightly down the table over the layers of smooth hard varnish dark with age I am king Wants do not enter into it I have a duty to my daughter To the realm Even to Robert He loved me but little I know yet he was my brother The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him She may have murdered him as well as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark For such crimes there must be justice Starting with Cersei and her abominations But only starting I mean to scour that court clean As Robert should have done after the Trident Ser Barristan once told me that the rot in King Aerys’s reign began with Varys The eunuch should never have been pardoned No more than the Kingslayer At the least Robert should have stripped the white cloak from Jaime and sent him to the Wall as Lord Stark urged He listened to Jon Arryn instead I was still at Storm’s End under siege and unconsulted He turned abruptly to give Davos a hard shrewd look The truth now Why did you wish to murder Lady Melisandre

So he does know Davos could not lie to him Four of my sons burned on the Blackwater She gave them to the flames

You wrong her Those fires were no work of hers Curse the Imp curse the pyromancers curse that fool of Florent who sailed my fleet into the jaws of a trap Or curse me for my stubborn pride for sending her away when I needed her most But not Melisandre She remains my faithful servant

Maester Cressen was your faithful servant She slew him as she killed Ser Cortnay Penrose and your brother Renly
