THE SHEEP FAIR -- TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFES HAND
GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South
Wessex and the busiest merriest noisiest day of the
whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair
This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill
which retained in good preservation the remains of an
ancient earthwork consisting of a huge rampart and
entrenchnaent of an oval form encircling the top of
the hill though somewhat broken down here and there
To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a
winding road ascended and the level green space of
ten or fifteen acres enclosed by the bank was the
site of the fair A few permanent erections dotted the
spot but the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone
for resting and feeding under during the time of their
sojourn here
Shepherds who attended with their flocks from long
distances started from home two or three days or even
a week before the fair driving their charges a few miles
each day -- not more than ten or twelve -- and resting
them at night in hired fields by the wayside at pre+
viously chosen points where they fed having fasted since
morning The shepherd of each flock marched behind
a bundle containing his kit for the week strapped upon
his shoulders and in his hand his crook which he used
as the staff of his pilgrimage Several of the sheep
would get worn and lame and occasionally a lambing
occurred on the road To meet these contingencies
there was frequently provided to accompany the flocks
from the remoter points a pony and waggon into which
the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the
journey
The Weatherbury Farms however were no such
long distance from the hill and those arrangements
were not necessary in their case But the large united
flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a
valuable and imposing multitude which
P 397
demanded much
attention and on this account Gabriel in addition to
Boldwoods shepherd and Cain Ball accompanied them
along the way through the decayed old town of Kings
bere and upward to the plateau -- old George the dog
of course behind them
When the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this
morning and lighted the dewy flat upon its crest nebu+
lous clouds of dust were to be seen floating between
the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect
around in all directions These gradually converged
upon the base of the hill and the flocks became
individually visible climbing the serpentine ways which
led to the top Thus in a slow procession they entered
the opening to which the roads tended multitude after
multitude horned and hornless -- blue flocks and red
flocks buff flocks and brown flocks even green and
salmon-tinted flocks according to the fancy of the
colourist and custom of the farm Men were shouting
dogs were barking with greatest animation but the
thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown
nearly indifferent to such terrors though they still
bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi+
ences a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst
of them like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate
devotees
The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of
South Downs and the old Wessex horned breeds to
the latter class Bathshebas and Farmer Boldwoods
mainly belonged These filed in about nine oclock
their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side
of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals a small
pink and white ear nestling under each horn Before
and behind came other varieties perfect leopards as to
the full rich substance of their coats and only lacking the
spots There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breeed
whose wool was beginning to curl like a childs flaxen
hair though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate
Leicesters which were in turn less curly than the Cots+
wolds But the most picturesque by far was a small
flock of Exmoors which chanced to be there this year
Their pied faces and legs dark and heavy horns tresses
of wool hanging round their swarthy

foreheads quite
relieved the monotony of the flocks in that quarter
All these bleating panting and weary thousands had
entered and were penned before the morning had far
advanced the dog belonging to each flock being tied to
the corner of the pen containing it Alleys for pedes+
trians intersected the pens which soon became crowded
with buyers and sellers from far and near
In another part of the hill an altogether different
scene began to force itself upon the eye towards mid+
day A circular tent of exceptional newness and size
was in course of erection here As the day drew on
