grace and truth

115 John bare witness of him and cried saying This was he of whom
I spake He that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was
before me

116 And of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace

117 For the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ

118 No man hath seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is
in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him

119 And this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him Who art thou  120 And he
confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ

121 And they asked him What then Art thou Elias And he saith I am
not Art thou that prophet And he answered No

122 Then said they unto him Who art thou that we may give an answer
to them that sent us What sayest thou of thyself  123 He said I am
the voice of one crying in the wilderness Make straight the way of
the Lord as said the prophet Esaias

124 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees

125 And they asked him and said unto him Why baptizest thou then
if thou be not that Christ nor Elias neither that prophet  126
John answered them saying I baptize with water but there standeth
one among you whom ye know not 127 He it is who coming after me is
preferred before me whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose

128 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was
baptizing

129 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold
the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world

130 This is he of whom I said After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me for he was before me

131 And I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to
Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water

132 And John bare record saying I saw the Spirit descending from
heaven like a dove and it abode upon him

133 And I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water
the same said unto me Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost

134 And I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God

135 Again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples
136 And looking upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of
God  137 And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed
Jesus

138 Then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them
What seek ye They said unto him Rabbi which is to say being
interpreted Master where dwellest thou  139 He saith unto them
Come and see They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him
that day for it was about the tenth hour

140 One of the two which heard John speak and followed him was
Andrew Simon Peters brother

141 He first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him We
have found the Messias which is being interpreted the Christ

142 And he brought him to Jesus And when Jesus beheld him he said
Thou art Simon the son of Jona thou shalt be called Cephas which is
by interpretation A stone

143 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth
Philip and saith unto him Follow me

144 Now Philip was of Bethsaida the city of Andrew and Peter

145 Philip findeth Nathanael and saith unto him We have found him
of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of
Nazareth the son of Joseph

146 And Nathanael said unto him Can there any good thing come out of
Nazareth Philip saith unto him Come and see

147 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and saith of him Behold an
Israelite indeed in whom is no guile  148 Nathanael saith unto him
Whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him Before that
Philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree I saw thee

149 Nathanael answered and saith unto him Rabbi thou art the Son of
God thou art the King of Israel

150 Jesus answered and said unto him Because I said unto thee I saw
thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things
than these
