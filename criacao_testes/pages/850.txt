He found the maester seated at his long wooden table covered with books and scrolls across from the three children Princess Shireen sat between the two boys Even now Davos could take great pleasure in the sight of his own blood keeping company with a princess and a king’s bastard Devan will be a lord now not merely a knight The Lord of the Rainwood Davos took more pride in that than in wearing the title himself He reads too He reads and he writes as if he had been born to it Pylos had naught but praise for his diligence and the master-at-arms said Devan was showing promise with sword and lance as well And he is a godly lad too My brothers have ascended to the Hall of Light to sit beside the Lord Devan had said when his father told him how his four elder brothers had died I will pray for them at the nightfires and for you as well Father so you might walk in the Light of the Lord till the end of your days

Good morrow to you Father the boy greeted him He looks so much like Dale did at his age Davos thought His eldest had never dressed so fine as Devan in his squire’s raiment to be sure but they shared the same square plain face the same forthright brown eyes the same thin brown flyaway hair Devan’s cheeks and chin were dusted with blond hair a fuzz that would have shamed a proper peach though the boy was fiercely proud of his beard Just as Dale was proud of his once Devan was the oldest of the three children at the table

Yet Edric Storm was three inches taller and broader in the chest and shoulders He was his father’s son in that nor did he ever miss a morning’s work with sword and shield Those old enough to have known Robert and Renly as children said that the bastard boy had more of their look than Stannis had ever shared the coal-black hair the deep blue eyes the mouth the jaw the cheekbones Only his ears reminded you that his mother had been a Florent

Yes good morrow my lord Edric echoed The boy could be fierce and proud but the maesters and castellans and masters-at-arms who’d raised him had schooled him well in courtesy Do you come from my uncle How fares His Grace

Well Davos lied If truth be told the king had a haggard haunted look about him but he saw no need to burden the boy with his fears I hope I have not disturbed your lesson

We had just finished my lord Maester Pylos said

We were reading about King Daeron the First Princess Shireen was a sad sweet gentle child far from pretty Stannis had given her his square jaw and Selyse her Florent ears and the gods in their cruel wisdom had seen fit to compound her homeliness by afflicting her with greyscale in the cradle The disease had left one cheek and half her neck grey and cracked and hard though it had spared both her life and her sight He went to war and conquered Dorne The Young Dragon they called him

He worshiped false gods said Devan but he was a great king otherwise and very brave in battle

He was agreed Edric Storm but my father was braver The Young Dragon never won three battles in a day

The princess looked at him wide-eyed Did Uncle Robert win three battles in a day

The bastard nodded It was when he’d first come home to call his banners Lords Grandison Cafferen and Fell planned to join their strength at Summerhall and march on Storm’s End but he learned their plans from an informer and rode at once with all his knights and squires As the plotters came up on Summerhall one by one he defeated each of them in turn before they could join up with the others He slew Lord Fell in single combat and captured his son Silveraxe

Devan looked to Pylos Is that how it happened

I said so didn’t I Edric Storm said before the maester could reply He smashed all three of them and fought so bravely that Lord Grandison and Lord Cafferen became his men afterward and Silveraxe too No one ever beat my father

Edric you ought not boast Maester Pylos said King Robert suffered defeats like any other man Lord Tyrell bested him at Ashford and he lost many a tourney tilt as well

He won more than he lost though And he killed Prince Rhaegar on the Trident

That he did the maester agreed But now I must give my attention to Lord Davos who has waited so patiently We will read more of King Daeron’s Conquest of Dorne on the morrow

Princess Shireen and the boys said their farewells courteously When they had taken their leaves Maester Pylos moved closer to Davos My lord perhaps you would like to try a bit of Conquest of Dorne as well He slid the slender leather-bound book across the table King Daeron wrote with an elegant simplicity and his history is rich with blood battle and bravery Your son is quite engrossed

My son is not quite twelve I am the King’s Hand Give me another letter if you would

As you wish my lord Maester Pylos rummaged about his table unrolling and then discarding various scraps of parchment There are no new letters Perhaps an old one…

Davos enjoyed a good story as well as any man but Stannis had not named him Hand for his enjoyment he felt His first duty was to help his king rule and for that he must needs understand the words the ravens brought The best way to learn a thing was to do it he had found sails or scrolls it made no matter

This might serve our purpose Pylos passed him a letter

Davos flattened down the little square of crinkled parchment and squinted at the tiny crabbed letters Reading was hard on the eyes that much he had learned early Sometimes he wondered if the Citadel offered a champion’s purse to the maester who wrote the smallest hand Pylos had laughed at the notion but…

To the… five kings read Davos hesitating briefly over five which he did not often see written out The king… be… the king… beware

Beyond the maester corrected

Davos grimaced The King beyond the Wall comes… comes south He leads a… a… fast…

Vast

…a vast host of wil… wild… wildlings Lord M… Mmmor… Mormont sent a… raven from the… ha… ha…
