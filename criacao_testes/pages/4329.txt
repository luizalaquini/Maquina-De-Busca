Now  Q sub jk sup h = Q sub kj sup h  so the equation has
a diagonally symmetric matrix and in fact the matrix Q sup h can
be shown to be positive semidefinite em and is almost always positive
definite in practice  Advantage can be taken of these facts
to provide a computationally efficient method for solving the
equation  According to a result called Choleskys theorem a
positive definite symmetric matrix Q can be factored into the form
Q  =  LL sup T where L is a lower triangular matrix
This leads to an efficient
solution algorithm

This method of computing prediction coefficients has become known
as the
ul
covariance method
It does not use windowing of the speech signal and can give accurate
estimates of the prediction coefficients with a smaller analysis
frame than the autocorrelation method  Typically 50 to 100 speech samples
might be used to estimate the coefficients and they are re-calculated
every 100 to 250 samples
rh Algorithm for the covariance method
An algorithm for the covariance method is given in Procedure 62
