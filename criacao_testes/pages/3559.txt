Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them Tyrion agreed This business with Eddard Stark… Joffrey’s work

The queen grimaced He was instructed to pardon Stark to allow him to take the black The man would have been out of our way forever and we might have made peace with that son of his but Joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show What was I to do He called for Lord Eddard’s head in front of half the city And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me Her hand tightened into a fist The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor’s Sept with blood after lying to him about our intent

It would seem he has a point said Tyrion So this Lord Slynt he was part of it was he Tell me whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council

Littlefinger made the arrangements We needed Slynt’s gold cloaks Eddard Stark was plotting with Renly and he’d written to Lord Stannis offering him the throne We might have lost all Even so it was a close thing If Sansa hadn’t come to me and told me all her father’s plans…

Tyrion was surprised Truly His own daughter Sansa had always seemed such a sweet child tender and courteous

The girl was wet with love She would have done anything for Joffrey until he cut off her father’s head and called it mercy That put an end to that

His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects Tyrion said with a crooked smile Was it Joffrey’s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too

Cersei sighed Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert’s death Varys suggested Ser Barristan Why not It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog He is very fond of Sandor Clegane We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse more than the useless old fool deserved

I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt’s gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud Gate

His sister looked very unhappy Janos should have sent more men He is not as competent as might be wished

Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon’s Kingsguard Tyrion reminded her pointedly He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen’s seven The smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight What do you imagine they’ll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon

Cersei glanced away I had not considered that

Father did said Tyrion That is why he sent me To put an end to these follies and bring your son to heel

Joff will be no more tractable for you than for me

He might

Why should he

He knows you would never hurt him

Cersei’s eyes narrowed If you believe I’d ever allow you to harm my son you’re sick with fever

Tyrion sighed She’d missed the point as she did so often Joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you he assured her but so long as the boy feels threatened he’ll be more inclined to listen He took her hand I am your brother you know You need me whether you care to admit it or no Your son needs me if he’s to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair

His sister seemed shocked that he would touch her You have always been cunning

In my own small way He grinned

It may be worth the trying… but make no mistake Tyrion If I accept you you shall be the King’s Hand in name but my Hand in truth You will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act and you will do nothing without my consent Do you understand

Oh yes

Do you agree

Certainly he lied I am yours sister For as long as I need to be So now that we are of one purpose we ought have no more secrets between us You say Joffrey had Lord Eddard killed Varys dismissed Ser Barristan and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt Who murdered Jon Arryn 

Cersei yanked her hand back How should I know

The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me Where did she come by that notion I wonder

I’m sure I don’t know That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing He hinted that Lord Arryn suspected or… well believed…

That you were fucking our sweet Jaime

She slapped him

Did you think I was as blind as Father Tyrion rubbed his cheek Who you lie with is no matter to me… although it doesn’t seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other

She slapped him

Be gentle Cersei I’m only jesting with you If truth be told I’d sooner have a nice whore I never understood what Jaime saw in you apart from his own reflection

She slapped him

His cheeks were red and burning yet he smiled If you keep doing that I may get angry

That stayed her hand Why should I care if you do

I have some new friends Tyrion confessed You won’t like them at all How did you kill Robert

He did that himself All we did was help When Lancel saw that Robert was going after boar he gave him strongwine His favorite sour red but fortified three times as potent as he was used to The great stinking fool loved it He could have stopped swilling it down anytime he cared to but no he drained one skin and told Lancel to fetch another The boar did the rest You should have been at the feast Tyrion There has never been a boar so delicious They cooked it with mushrooms and apples and it tasted like triumph

Truly sister you were born to be a widow Tyrion had rather liked Robert Baratheon great blustering oaf that he was… doubtless in part because his sister loathed him so Now if you are done slapping me I will be off He twisted his legs around and clambered down awkwardly from the chair

Cersei frowned I haven’t given you leave to depart I want to know how you intend to free Jaime

I’ll tell you when I know Schemes are like fruit they require a certain ripening Right now I have a mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city Tyrion rested his hand on the head of the sphinx beside the door One parting request Kindly make certain no harm comes to Sansa Stark It would not do to lose both the daughters

Outside the council chamber Tyrion nodded to Ser Mandon and made his way down the long vaulted hall Bronn fell in beside him Of Timett son of Timett there was no sign Where’s our red hand Tyrion asked

He felt an urge to explore His kind was not made for waiting about in halls

I hope he doesn’t kill anyone important The clansmen Tyrion had brought down from their fastnesses in the Mountains of the Moon were loyal in their own fierce way but they were proud and quarrelsome as well prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel Try to find him And while you are at it see that the rest have been quartered and fed I want them in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand but don’t let the steward put the Stone Crows near the Moon Brothers and tell him the Burned Men must have a hall all to themselves

Where will you be

I’m riding back to the Broken Anvil

Bronn grinned insolently Need an escort The talk is the streets are dangerous

I’ll call upon the captain of my sister’s household guard and remind him that I am no less a Lannister than she is He needs to recall that his oath is to Casterly Rock not to Cersei or Joffrey

An hour later Tyrion rode from the Red Keep accompanied by a dozen Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms As they passed beneath the portcullis he noted the heads mounted atop the walls Black with rot and old tar they had long since become unrecognizable Captain Vylarr he called I want those taken down on the morrow Give them to the silent sisters for cleaning It would be hell to match them with the bodies he supposed yet it must be done Even in the midst of war certain decencies needed to be observed

Vylarr grew hesitant His Grace has told us he wishes the traitors’ heads to remain on the walls until he fills those last three empty spikes there on the end
