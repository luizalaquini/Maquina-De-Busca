102 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not
according to knowledge

103 For they being ignorant of Gods righteousness and going about
to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of God

104 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth

105 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law That
the man which doeth those things shall live by them

106 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise
Say not in thine heart Who shall ascend into heaven that is to
bring Christ down from above 107 Or Who shall descend into the
deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead  108 But
what saith it The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy
heart that is the word of faith which we preach 109 That if thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in
thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be
saved

1010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation

1011 For the scripture saith Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
ashamed

1012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for
the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him

1013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved

1014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how
shall they hear without a preacher  1015 And how shall they preach
except they be sent as it is written How beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good
things  1016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel For Esaias
saith Lord who hath believed our report  1017 So then faith cometh
by hearing and hearing by the word of God

1018 But I say Have they not heard Yes verily their sound went
into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world

1019 But I say Did not Israel know First Moses saith I will
provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish
nation I will anger you

1020 But Esaias is very bold and saith I was found of them that
sought me not I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me

1021 But to Israel he saith All day long I have stretched forth my
hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people

111 I say then Hath God cast away his people God forbid For I also
am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin

112 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew Wot ye not
what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God
against Israel saying 113 Lord they have killed thy prophets and
digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life

114 But what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to
myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of
Baal

115 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
according to the election of grace

116 And if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is
no more grace But if it be of works then it is no more grace
otherwise work is no more work

117 What then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for
but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded

118 According as it is written God hath given them the spirit of
slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not
hear unto this day

119 And David saith Let their table be made a snare and a trap and
a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them 1110 Let their eyes be
darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway

1111 I say then Have they stumbled that they should fall God
forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy

1112 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their
fulness  1113 For I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office 1114 If by any means
I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save
some of them

1115 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world
