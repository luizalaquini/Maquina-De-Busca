Ned smiled Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn

Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine The Hand did call upon me with Lord Stannis the king’s brother I regret to say they did not honor me with their patronage

Ned looked at the man evenly saying nothing waiting He had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions And so it was this time

They asked to see the boy the armorer said so I took them back to the forge

The boy Ned echoed He had no notion who the boy might be I should like to see the boy as well

Tobho Mott gave him a cool careful look As you wish my lord he said with no trace of his former friendliness He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done When the armorer opened the door the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon’s mouth Inside a forge blazed in each corner and the air stank of smoke and sulfur Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows

The master called over a tall lad about Robb’s age his arms and chest corded with muscle This is Lord Stark the new Hand of the King he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers Thick hair shaggy and unkempt and black as ink The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw This is Gendry Strong for his age and he works hard Show the Hand that helmet you made lad Almost shyly the boy led them to his bench and a steel helm shaped like a bull’s head with two great curving horns

Ned turned the helm over in his hands It was raw steel unpolished but expertly shaped This is fine work I would be pleased if you would let me buy it

The boy snatched it out of his hands It’s not for sale

Tobho Mott looked horror-struck Boy this is the King’s Hand If his lordship wants this helm make him a gift of it He honors you by asking

I made it for me the boy said stubbornly

A hundred pardons my lord his master said hurriedly to Ned The boy is crude as new steel and like new steel would profit from some beating That helm is journeyman’s work at best Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen

He’s done nothing that requires my forgiveness Gendry when Lord Arryn came to see you what did you talk about

He asked me questions is all m’lord

What sort of questions

The boy shrugged How was I and was I well treated and if I liked the work and stuff about my mother Who she was and what she looked like and all

What did you tell him Ned asked

The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead She died when I was little She had yellow hair and sometimes she used to sing to me I remember She worked in an alehouse

Did Lord Stannis question you as well

The bald one No not him He never said no word just glared at me like I was some raper who done for his daughter

Mind your filthy tongue the master said This is the King’s own Hand The boy lowered his eyes A smart boy but stubborn That helm… the others call him bullheaded so he threw it in their teeth

Ned touched the boy’s head fingering the thick black hair Look at me Gendry The apprentice lifted his face Ned studied the shape of his jaw the eyes like blue ice Yes he thought I see it Go back to your work lad I’m sorry to have bothered you He walked back to the house with the master Who paid the boy’s apprentice fee he asked lightly

Mott looked fretful You saw the boy Such a strong boy Those hands of his those hands were made for hammers He had such promise I took him on without a fee

The truth now Ned urged The streets are full of strong boys The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down Who paid for him

A lord the master said reluctantly He gave no name and wore no sigil on his coat He paid in gold twice the customary sum and said he was paying once for the boy and once for my silence

Describe him

He was stout round of shoulder not so tall as you Brown beard but there was a bit of red in it I’ll swear He wore a rich cloak that I do remember heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear He hesitated a moment My lord I want no trouble
