which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow

together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last

hearken unto Israel your father

493 Reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my
strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power 494
Unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to
thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch

495 Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their
habitations

496 O my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly
mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall

497 Cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it
was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel

498 Judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall
be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down
before thee

he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall
rouse him up  4910 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a

choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the
blood of grapes 4912 His eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth
white with milk

4913 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for
an haven of ships and his border shall be unto Zidon

4914 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
4915 And he saw that rest was good and the land that it was
pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto
tribute

4916 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel

4917 Dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that
biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward

4918 I have waited for thy salvation O LORD

last

4920 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal

whose branches run over the wall 4923 The archers have sorely
