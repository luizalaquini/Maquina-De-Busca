Dogs said Arya

Aye Harwin grinned One of our lads keeps the meanest dogs you’d ever want to see

I wish I had a good mean dog said Arya wistfully A lion-killing dog She’d had a direwolf once Nymeria but she’d thrown rocks at her until she fled to keep the queen from killing her Could a direwolf kill a lion she wondered

It rained again that afternoon and long into the evening Thankfully the outlaws had secret friends all over so they did not need to camp out in the open or seek shelter beneath some leaky bower as she and Hot Pie and Gendry had done so often

That night they sheltered in a burned abandoned village At least it seemed to be abandoned until Jack-Be-Lucky blew two short blasts and two long ones on his hunting horn Then all sorts of people came crawling out of the ruins and up from secret cellars They had ale and dried apples and some stale barley bread and the outlaws had a goose that Anguy had brought down on the ride so supper that night was almost a feast

Arya was sucking the last bit of meat off a wing when one of the villagers turned to Lem Lemoncloak and said There were men through here not two days past looking for the Kingslayer

Lem snorted They’d do better looking in Riverrun Down in the deepest dungeons where it’s nice and damp His nose looked like a squashed apple red and raw and swollen and his mood was foul

No another villager said He’s escaped

The Kingslayer Arya could feel the hair on the back of her neck prickling She held her breath to listen

Could that be true Tom o’ Sevens said

I’ll not believe it said the one-eyed man in the rusty pothelm The other outlaws called him Jack-Be-Lucky though losing an eye didn’t seem very lucky to Arya I’ve had me a taste o’ them dungeons How could he escape

The villagers could only shrug at that Greenbeard stroked his thick grey-and-green whiskers and said The wolves will drown in blood if the Kingslayer’s loose again Thoros must be told The Lord of Light will show him Lannister in the flames

There’s a fine fire burning here said Anguy smiling

Greenbeard laughed and cuffed the archer’s ear Do I look a priest to you Archer When Pello of Tyrosh peers into the fire the cinders singe his beard

Lem cracked his knuckles and said Wouldn’t Lord Beric love to capture Jaime Lannister though…

Would he hang him Lem one of the village women asked It’d be half a shame to hang a man as pretty as that one

A trial first said Anguy Lord Beric always gives them a trial you know that He smiled Then he hangs them

There was laughter all around Then Tom drew his fingers across the strings of his woodharp and broke into soft song





The brothers of the Kingswood

they were an outlaw band

The forest was their castle

but they roamed across the land

No man’s gold was safe from them

nor any maiden’s hand

Oh the brothers of the Kingswood

that fearsome outlaw band…





Warm and dry in a corner between Gendry and Harwin Arya listened to the singing for a time then closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep She dreamt of home not Riverrun but Winterfell It was not a good dream though She was alone outside the castle up to her knees in mud She could see the grey walls ahead of her but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before and the castle faded before her until it looked more like smoke than granite And there were wolves as well gaunt grey shapes stalking through the trees all around her their eyes shining Whenever she looked at them she remembered the taste of blood

The next morning they left the road to cut across the fields The wind was gusting sending dry brown leaves swirling around the hooves of their horses but for once it did not rain When the sun came out from behind a cloud it was so bright Arya had to pull her hood forward to keep it out of her eyes

She reined up very suddenly We are going the wrong way

Gendry groaned What is it moss again

Look at the sun she said We’re going south Arya rummaged in her saddlebag for the map so she could show them We should never have left the Trident See She unrolled the map on her leg All of them were looking at her now See there’s Riverrun between the rivers

As it happens said Jack-Be-Lucky we know where Riverrun is Every man o’ us

You’re not going to Riverrun Lem told her bluntly

I was almost there Arya thought I should have let them take our horses I could have walked the rest of the way She remembered her dream then and bit her lip

Ah don’t look so hurt child said Tom Sevenstrings No harm will come to you you have my word on that

The word of a liar

No one lied said Lem We made no promises It’s not for us to say what’s to be done with you

Lem was not the leader though no more than Tom that was Greenbeard the Tyroshi Arya turned to face him Take me to Riverrun and you’ll be rewarded she said desperately

Little one Greenbeard answered a peasant may skin a common squirrel for his pot but if he finds a gold squirrel in his tree he takes it to his lord or he will wish he did

I’m not a squirrel Arya insisted

You are Greenbeard laughed A little gold squirrel who’s off to see the lightning lord whether she wills it or not He’ll know what’s to be done with you I’ll wager he sends you back to your lady mother just as you wish

Tom Sevenstrings nodded Aye that’s like Lord Beric He’ll do right by you see if he don’t

Lord Beric Dondarrion Arya remembered all she’d heard at Harrenhal from the Lannisters and the Bloody Mummers alike Lord Beric the wisp o’ the wood Lord Beric who’d been killed by Vargo Hoat and before that by Ser Amory Lorch and twice by the Mountain That Rides If he won’t send me home maybe I’ll kill him too Why do I have to see Lord Beric she asked quietly

We bring him all our highborn captives said Anguy

Captive Arya took a breath to still her soul Calm as still water She glanced at the outlaws on their horses and turned her horse’s head Now quick as a snake she thought as she slammed her heels into the courser’s flank Right between Greenbeard and Jack-Be-Lucky she flew and caught one glimpse of Gendry’s startled face as his mare moved out of her way And then she was in the open field and running

North or south east or west that made no matter now She could find the way to Riverrun later once she’d lost them Arya leaned forward in the saddle and urged the horse to a gallop Behind her the outlaws were cursing and shouting at her to come back She shut her ears to the calls but when she glanced back over her shoulder four of them were coming after her Anguy and Harwin and Greenbeard racing side by side with Lem farther back his big yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode Swift as a deer she told her mount Run now run
