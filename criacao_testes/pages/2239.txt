   until breathless he stepped back and let the point of the sword fall to the ground giving her a moment of respite Not half bad he acknowledged For a wench

She took a slow deep breath her eyes watching him warily I would not hurt you Kingslayer

As if you could He whirled the blade back up above his head and flew at her again chains rattling

Jaime could not have said how long he pressed the attack It might have been minutes or it might have been hours time slept when swords woke He drove her away from his cousin’s corpse drove her across the road drove her into the trees She stumbled once on a root she never saw and for a moment he thought she was done but she went to one knee instead of falling and never lost a beat Her sword leapt up to block a downcut that would have opened her from shoulder to groin and then she cut at him again and again fighting her way back to her feet stroke by stroke

The dance went on He pinned her against an oak cursed as she slipped away followed her through a shallow brook half-choked with fallen leaves Steel rang steel sang steel screamed and sparked and scraped and the woman started grunting like a sow at every crash yet somehow he could not reach her It was as if she had an iron cage around her that stopped every blow

Not bad at all he said when he paused for a second to catch his breath circling to her right

For a wench

For a squire say A green one He laughed a ragged breathless laugh Come on come on my sweetling the music’s still playing Might I have this dance my lady

Grunting she came at him blade whirling and suddenly it was Jaime struggling to keep steel from skin One of her slashes raked across his brow and blood ran down into his right eye The Others take her and Riverrun as well His skills had gone to rust and rot in that bloody dungeon and the chains were no great help either His eye closed his shoulders were going numb from the jarring they’d taken and his wrists ached from the weight of chains manacles and sword His longsword grew heavier with every blow and Jaime knew he was not swinging it as quickly as he’d done earlier nor raising it as high

She is stronger than I am

The realization chilled him Robert had been stronger than him to be sure The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well in his heyday and Ser Arthur Dayne Amongst the living Greatjon Umber was stronger Strongboar of Crakehall most likely both Cleganes for a certainty The Mountain’s strength was like nothing human It did not matter With speed and skill Jaime could beat them all But this was a woman A huge cow of a woman to be sure but even so    by rights she should be the one wearing down

Instead she forced him back into the brook again shouting Yield Throw down the sword

A slick stone turned under Jaime’s foot As he felt himself falling he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge His point scraped past her parry and bit into her upper thigh A red flower blossomed and Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood before his knee slammed into a rock The pain was blinding Brienne splashed into him and kicked away his sword YIELD

Jaime drove his shoulder into her legs bringing her down on top of him They rolled kicking and punching until finally she was sitting astride him He managed to jerk her dagger from its sheath but before he could plunge it into her belly she caught his wrist and slammed his hands back on a rock so hard he thought she’d wrenched an arm from its socket Her other hand spread across his face Yield She shoved his head down held it under pulled it up Yield Jaime spit water into her face A shove a splash and he was under again kicking uselessly fighting to breathe Up again Yield or I’ll drown you

And break your oath he snarled Like me

She let him go and he went down with a splash

And the woods rang with coarse laughter

Brienne lurched to her feet She was all mud and blood below the waist her clothing askew her face red She looks as if they caught us fucking instead of fighting Jaime crawled over the rocks to shallow water wiping the blood from his eye with his chained hands Armed men lined both sides of the brook Small wonder we were making enough noise to wake a dragon Well met friends he called to them amiably My pardons if I disturbed you You caught me chastising my wife

Seemed to me she was doing the chastising The man who spoke was thick and powerful and the nasal bar of his iron halfhelm did not wholly conceal his lack of a nose

These were not the outlaws who had killed Ser Cleos Jaime realized suddenly The scum of the earth surrounded them swarthy Dornishmen and blond Lyseni Dothraki with bells in their braids hairy Ibbenese coal-black Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks He knew them The Brave Companions

Brienne found her voice I have a hundred stags—

A cadaverous man in a tattered leather cloak said We’ll take that for a start m’lady

Then we’ll have your cunt said the noseless man It can’t be as ugly as the rest of you

Turn her over and rape her arse Rorge urged a Dornish spearman with a red silk scarf wound about his helm That way you won’t need to look at her

And rob her o’ the pleasure o’ looking at me Noseless said and the others laughed

Ugly and stubborn though she might be the wench deserved better than to be gang raped by such refuse as these Who commands here Jaime demanded loudly

I have that honor Ser Jaime The cadaver’s eyes were rimmed in red his hair thin and dry Dark blue veins could be seen through the pallid skin of his hands and face Urswyck I am Called Urswyck the Faithful

You know who I am

The sellsword inclined his head It takes more than a beard and a shaved head to deceive the Brave Companions

The Bloody Mummers you mean Jaime had no more use for these than he did for Gregor Clegane or Amory Lorch Dogs his father called them all and he used them like dogs to hound his prey and put fear in their hearts If you know me Urswyck you know you’ll have your reward A Lannister always pays his debts As for the wench she’s highborn and worth a good ransom

The other cocked his head Is it so How fortunate

There was something sly about the way Urswyck was smiling that Jaime did not like You heard me Where’s the goat

A few hours distant He will be pleased to see you I have no doubt but I would not call him a goat to his face Lord Vargo grows prickly about his dignity

Since when has that slobbering savage had dignity I’ll be sure and remember that when I see him Lord of what pray

Harrenhal It has been promised

Harrenhal Has my father taken leave of his senses Jaime raised his hands I’ll have these chains off

Urswyck’s chuckle was papery dry

Something is very wrong here Jaime gave no sign of his discomfiture but only smiled Did I say something amusing

Noseless grinned You’re the funniest thing I seen since Biter chewed that septa’s teats off

You and your father lost too many battles offered the Dornishman We had to trade our lion pelts for wolfskins

Urswyck spread his hands What Timeon means to say is that the Brave Companions are no longer in the hire of House Lannister We now serve Lord Bolton and the King in the North

Jaime gave him a cold contemptuous smile And men say I have shit for honor

Urswyck was unhappy with that comment At his signal two of the Mummers grasped Jaime by the arms and Rorge drove a mailed fist into his stomach As he doubled over grunting he heard the wench protesting Stop he’s not to be harmed Lady Catelyn sent us an exchange of captives he’s under my protection    Rorge hit him again driving the air from his lungs Brienne dove for her sword beneath the waters of the brook but the Mummers were on her before she could lay hands on it Strong as she was it took four of them to beat her into submission

By the end the wench’s face was as swollen and bloody as Jaime’s must have been and they had knocked out two of her teeth It did nothing to improve her appearance Stumbling and bleeding the two captives were dragged back through the woods to the horses Brienne limping from the thigh wound he’d given her in the brook Jaime felt sorry for her She would lose her maidenhood tonight he had no doubt That noseless bastard would have her for a certainty and some of the others would likely take a turn

The Dornishman bound them back to back atop Brienne’s plow horse while the other Mummers were stripping Cleos Frey to his skin to divvy up his possessions Rorge won the bloodstained surcoat with its proud Lannister and Frey quarterings The arrows had punched holes through lions and towers alike

I hope you’re pleased wench Jaime whispered at Brienne He coughed and spat out a mouthful of blood If you’d armed me we’d never have been taken She made no answer There’s a pig-stubborn bitch he thought But brave yes He could not take that from her When we make camp for the night you’ll be raped and more than once he warned her You’d be wise not to resist If you fight them you’ll lose more than a few teeth

He felt Brienne’s back stiffen against his Is that what you would do if you were a woman

If I were a woman I’d be Cersei If I were a woman I’d make them kill me But I’m not Jaime kicked their horse to a trot Urswyck A word

The cadaverous sellsword in the ragged leather cloak reined up a moment then fell in beside him What would you have of me ser And mind your tongue or I’ll chastise you again

Gold said Jaime You do like gold
