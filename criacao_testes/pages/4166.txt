they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees
spoken of A process somewhat analogous to that of
alleged formations of the universe time and times ago
was observable The bustling swarm had swept the sky
in a scattered and uniform haze which now thickened to
a nebulous centre this glided on to a bough and grew
still denser till it formed a solid black spot upon the
light
The men and women being all busily engaged in
saving the hay -- even Liddy had left the house for the
purpose of lending a hand -- Bathsheba resolved to hive
the bees herself if possible She had dressed the hive
with herbs and honey fetched a ladder brush and
crook made herself impregnable with armour of leather
gloves straw hat and large gauze veil -- once green but
now faded to snuff colour -- and ascended a dozen rungs
of the ladder At once she heard not ten yards off
a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in
agitating her
P 234
Miss Everdene let me assist you  you should not
attempt such a thing alone
Troy was just opening the garden gate
Bathsheba flung down the brush crook and empty
hive pulled the skirt of her dress tightly round her
ankles in a tremendous flurry and as well as she could
slid down the ladder By the time she reached the
bottom Troy was there also and he stooped to pick
up the hive
How fortunate I am to have dropped in at this
moment exclaimed the sergeant
She found her voice in a minute What and will
you shake them in for me she asked in what for a
defiant girl was a faltering way though for a timid
girl it would have seemed a brave way enough
 Will I   said Troy  Why of course I will How
blooming you are to-day   Troy flung down his cane
and put his foot on the ladder to ascend
But you must have on the veil and gloves or youll
be stung fearfully
Ah yes I must put on the veil and gloves Will
you kindly show me how to fix them properly
And you must have the broad-brimmed hat too  for
your cap has no brim to keep the veil off and theyd
reach your face
 The broad-brimmed hat too by all means
So a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be
taken off -- veil and all attached -- and placed upon his
head Troy tossing his own into a gooseberry bush
Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round
his collar and the gloves put on him
He looked such an extraordinary object in this guise
that flurried as she was she could not avoid laughing
outright It was the removal of yet another stake from
the palisade of cold manners which had kept him off
Bathsheba looked on from the g-ound whilst he was
busy sweeping and shaking the bees from the tree
holding up the hive with the other hand for them to
fall into She made use of an unobserved minute
whilst his attention was absorbed in the
P 235
operation to
arrange her plumes a little He came down holding
the hive at arms length behind which trailed a cloud
of bees
 Upon my life said Troy through the veil  holding
up this hive makes ones arm ache worse than a week
of sword-exercise When the manoeuvre was complete
he approached her Would you be good enough to
untie me and let me out I am nearly stifled inside
this silk cage
To hide her embarrassment during the unwonted
process of untying the string about his neck she said  --
I have never seen that you spoke of
What 
The sword-exercise
Ah  would you like to  said Troy
Bathsheba hesitated She had heard wondrous
reports from time to time by dwellers in Weatherbury
who had by chance sojourned awhile in Casterbridge
near the barracks of this strange and glorious perform+
ance tlie sword-exercise Men and boys who had
peeped through chinks or over walls into the barrack+
yard returned with accounts of its being the most
flashing affair conceivable  accoutrements and weapons
glistening like stars-heretherearound-yet all by rule
and compass So she said mildly what she felt strongly
Yes  I should like to see it very much
And so you shall you shall see me go through it
No How
Let me consider
Not with a walking-stick -- I dont care to see that
lt must be a real sword
Yes I know and I have no sword here but I
think I could get one by the evening Now will you
do this
O no indeed  said Bathsheba blushing  Thank
you very much but I couldnt on any account
Surely you might Nobody would know
She shook her head but with a weakened negation
