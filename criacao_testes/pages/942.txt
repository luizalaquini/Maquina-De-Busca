I know this inn There hadn’t been a gibbet outside the door when she had slept here with her sister Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane though We don’t want to go in Arya decided suddenly there might be ghosts

You know how long it’s been since I had a cup of wine Sandor swung down from the saddle Besides we need to learn who holds the ruby ford Stay with the horses if you want it’s no hair off my arse

What if they know you Sandor no longer troubled to hide his face He no longer seemed to care who knew him They might want to take you captive

Let them try He loosened his longsword in its scabbard and pushed through the door

Arya would never have a better chance to escape She could ride off on Craven and take Stranger too She chewed her lip Then she led the horses to the stables and went in after him

They know him The silence told her that But that wasn’t the worst thing She knew them too Not the skinny innkeep nor the women nor the fieldhands by the hearth But the others The soldiers She knew the soldiers

Looking for your brother Sandor Polliver’s hand was down the bodice of the girl on his lap but now he slid it out

Looking for a cup of wine Innkeep a flagon of red Clegane threw a handful of coppers on the floor

I don’t want no trouble ser the innkeep said

Then don’t call me ser His mouth twitched Are you deaf fool I ordered wine As the man ran off Clegane shouted after him Two cups The girl’s thirsty too

There are only three Arya thought Polliver gave her a fleeting glance and the boy beside him never looked at her at all but the third one gazed long and hard He was a man of middling height and build with a face so ordinary that it was hard to say how old he was The Tickler The Tickler and Polliver both The boy was a squire judging by his age and dress He had a big white pimple on one side of his nose and some red ones on his forehead Is this the lost puppy Ser Gregor spoke of he asked the Tickler The one who piddled in the rushes and ran off

The Tickler put a warning hand on the boy’s arm and gave a short sharp shake of his head Arya read that plain enough

The squire didn’t or else he didn’t care Ser said his puppy brother tucked his tail between his legs when the battle got too warm at King’s Landing He said he ran off whimpering He gave the Hound a stupid mocking grin

Clegane studied the boy and never said a word Polliver shoved the girl off his lap and got to his feet The lad’s drunk he said The man-at-arms was almost as tall as the Hound though not so heavily muscled A spade-shaped beard covered his jaws and jowls thick and black and neatly trimmed but his head was more bald than not He can’t hold his wine is all

Then he shouldn’t drink

The puppy doesn’t scare… the boy began till the Tickler casually twisted his ear between thumb and forefinger The words became a squeal of pain

The innkeep came scurrying back with two stone cups and a flagon on a pewter platter Sandor lifted the flagon to his mouth Arya could see the muscles in his neck working as he gulped When he slammed it back down on the table half the wine was gone Now you can pour Best pick up those coppers too it’s the only coin you’re like to see today

We’ll pay when we’re done drinking said Polliver

When you’re done drinking you’ll tickle the innkeep to see where he keeps his gold The way you always do

The innkeep suddenly remembered something in the kitchen The locals were leaving too and the girls were gone The only sound in the common room was the faint crackling of the fire in the hearth We should go too Arya knew

If you’re looking for Ser you come too late Polliver said He was at Harrenhal but now he’s not The queen sent for him He wore three blades on his belt Arya saw a longsword on his left hip and on his right a dagger and a slimmer blade too long to be a dirk and too short to be a sword King Joffrey’s dead you know he added Poisoned at his own wedding feast

Arya edged farther into the room Joffrey’s dead She could almost see him with his blond curls and his mean smile and his fat soft lips Joffrey’s dead She knew it ought to make her happy but somehow she still felt empty inside Joffrey was dead but if Robb was dead too what did it matter

So much for my brave brothers of the Kingsguard The Hound gave a snort of contempt Who killed him

The Imp it’s thought Him and his little wife

What wife

I forgot you’ve been hiding under a rock The northern girl Winterfell’s daughter We heard she killed the king with a spell and afterward changed into a wolf with big leather wings like a bat and flew out a tower window But she left the dwarf behind and Cersei means to have his head

That’s stupid Arya thought Sansa only knows songs not spells and she’d never marry the Imp
