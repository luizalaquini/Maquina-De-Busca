But while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
and went his way

1326 But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then
appeared the tares also

1327 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him Sir
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it
tares  1328 He said unto them An enemy hath done this The servants
said unto him Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up  1329
But he said Nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also
the wheat with them

1330 Let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of
harvest I will say to the reapers Gather ye together first the tares
and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my
barn

1331 Another parable put he forth unto them saying The kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed
in his field 1332 Which indeed is the least of all seeds but when
it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so
that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof

1333 Another parable spake he unto them The kingdom of heaven is
like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of
meal till the whole was leavened

1334 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables and
without a parable spake he not unto them 1335 That it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my
mouth in parables I will utter things which have been kept secret
from the foundation of the world

1336 Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and
his disciples came unto him saying Declare unto us the parable of
the tares of the field

1337 He answered and said unto them He that soweth the good seed is
the Son of man 1338 The field is the world the good seed are the
children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked
one 1339 The enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the
end of the world and the reapers are the angels

1340 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so
shall it be in the end of this world

1341 The Son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do
iniquity 1342 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth

1343 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of their Father Who hath ears to hear let him hear

1344 Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field

1345 Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man
seeking goodly pearls 1346 Who when he had found one pearl of great
price went and sold all that he had and bought it

1347 Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast
into the sea and gathered of every kind 1348 Which when it was
full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into
vessels but cast the bad away

1349 So shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come
forth and sever the wicked from among the just 1350 And shall cast
them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth

1351 Jesus saith unto them Have ye understood all these things They
say unto him Yea Lord

1352 Then said he unto them Therefore every scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old

1353 And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these
parables he departed thence

1354 And when he was come into his own country he taught them in
their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said Whence
hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works  1355 Is not this
the carpenters son is not his mother called Mary and his brethren
James and Joses and Simon and Judas  1356 And his sisters are
they not all with us Whence then hath this man all these things
1357 And they were offended in him But Jesus said unto them A
prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own
house

1358 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
unbelief

141 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus 142
And said unto his servants This is John the Baptist he is risen from
the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
