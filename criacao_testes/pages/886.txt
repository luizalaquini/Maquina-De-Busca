of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
1040 Him God raised up the third day and shewed him openly 1041
Not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before God even to
us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead

1042 And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify
that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and
dead

1043 To him give all the prophets witness that through his name
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins

1044 While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all
them which heard the word

1045 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as
many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured
out the gift of the Holy Ghost

1046 For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God Then
answered Peter 1047 Can any man forbid water that these should not
be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we  1048
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Then
prayed they him to tarry certain days

111 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
Gentiles had also received the word of God

112 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem they that were of the
circumcision contended with him 113 Saying Thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised and didst eat with them

114 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded
it by order unto them saying 115 I was in the city of Joppa
praying and in a trance I saw a vision A certain vessel descend as
it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and
it came even to me 116 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes
I considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts
and creeping things and fowls of the air

117 And I heard a voice saying unto me Arise Peter slay and eat

118 But I said Not so Lord for nothing common or unclean hath at
any time entered into my mouth

119 But the voice answered me again from heaven What God hath
cleansed that call not thou common

1110 And this was done three times and all were drawn up again into
heaven

1111 And behold immediately there were three men already come unto
the house where I was sent from Caesarea unto me

1112 And the Spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting Moreover
these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans
house 1113 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house
which stood and said unto him Send men to Joppa and call for Simon
whose surname is Peter 1114 Who shall tell thee words whereby thou
and all thy house shall be saved

1115 And as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us
at the beginning

1116 Then remembered I the word of the Lord how that he said John
indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost

1117 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us
who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could
withstand God  1118 When they heard these things they held their
peace and glorified God saying Then hath God also to the Gentiles
granted repentance unto life

1119 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and
Antioch preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only

1120 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene which when they
were come to Antioch spake unto the Grecians preaching the LORD
Jesus

1121 And the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number
believed and turned unto the Lord

1122 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should
go as far as Antioch

1123 Who when he came and had seen the grace of God was glad and
exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
the Lord

1124 For he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith
and much people was added unto the Lord

1125 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek Saul 1126 And
when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch And it came to
pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and
taught much people And the disciples were called Christians first in
