The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to
the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus 12 To Timothy
my dearly beloved son Grace mercy and peace from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord

13 I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my
prayers night and day 14 Greatly desiring to see thee being mindful
of thy tears that I may be filled with joy 15 When I call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in
thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that
in thee also

16 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands

17 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of
love and of a sound mind

18 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of
me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
according to the power of God 19 Who hath saved us and called us
with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his
own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began 110 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our
Saviour Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life
and immortality to light through the gospel 111 Whereunto I am
appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles

112 For the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am
not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he
is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day

113 Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus

114 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
Ghost which dwelleth in us

115 This thou knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away
from me of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes

116 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus for he oft
refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain 117 But when he was
in Rome he sought me out very diligently and found me

118 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus
thou knowest very well

21 Thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ
Jesus

22 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses
the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach
others also

23 Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ

24 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier

25 And if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned
except he strive lawfully

26 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
fruits

27 Consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all
things

28 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
the dead according to my gospel 29 Wherein I suffer trouble as an
evil doer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound

210 Therefore I endure all things for the elects sakes that they
may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal
glory

211 It is a faithful saying For if we be dead with him we shall
also live with him 212 If we suffer we shall also reign with him
if we deny him he also will deny us 213 If we believe not yet he
abideth faithful he cannot deny himself

214 Of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the
Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the
subverting of the hearers

215 Study to shew thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth

216 But shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto
more ungodliness
