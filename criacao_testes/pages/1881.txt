That this is not so in English sometimes tempts us to assume
incorrectly that nasalization does not occur in vowels
It does typically when the vowel is followed by a nasal consonant and it is
important for synthesis that nasalized vowel allophones are recognized and
treated accordingly
pp
Coarticulation can be predicted by phonological rules which show
how a phonemic sequence will be realized by allophones
Such rules have been studied extensively by linguists
pp
The reason for coarticulation and for the existence of allophones
lies in the physical constraints imposed by the motion
of the articulatory organs em particularly their acceleration and deceleration
An immensely crude model is that the brain decides what phonemes to
say for it is concerned with semantic things and the definition
of a phoneme is a semantic one
It then takes this sequence and translates it into neural commands
which actually move the articulators into target positions
However other commands may be issued and executed before these targets
are reached and this accounts for coarticulation effects
Phonological rules for converting a phonemic sequence to an
allophonic one are a sort of discrete model of the process
Particularly for work involving computers it is possible that this
rule-based approach will be overtaken by potentially more accurate
methods which attempt to model the continuous articulatory phenomena
directly
sh 23  Prosody
pp
The phonetic classification introduced above divides speech into
segments and classifies these into phonemes or allophones
Riding on top of this stream of segments are other more global
attributes that dictate the overall prosody of the utterance
Prosody is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as the
science of versification laws of metre
which emphasizes the aspects of stress and rhythm that are central
to classical verse
There are however many other features which are more or less
global
These are collectively called prosodic or equivalently suprasegmental
features for they lie above the level of phoneme or syllable segments
pp
Prosodic features can be split into two basic categories  features
of voice quality and features of voice dynamics
Variations in voice quality which are sometimes called
paralinguistic phenomena are accounted for by anatomical
differences and long-term muscular idiosyncrasies like a sore
throat and have little part to play in the kind of applications
for speech output that have been sketched in Chapter 1
Variations in voice dynamics occur in three dimensions  pitch
or fundamental frequency of the voice time and amplitude
Within the first the pattern of pitch variation or
ul
intonation
can be distinguished from the overall range within which that variation
occurs
The time dimension encompasses the rhythm of the speech pauses and the
overall tempo em whether it is uttered quickly or slowly
The third dimension amplitude is of relatively minor importance
Intonation and rhythm work together to produce an effect commonly called
stress and we will elaborate further on the nature of stress and discuss
algorithms for synthesizing intonation and rhythm in Chapter 8
pp
These features have a very important role to play in communicating meaning
They are not fancy optional components
It is their neglect which is largely responsible for the laymans
stereotype of computer speech
a caricature of living speech em abrupt arhythmic and in a grating
monotone em
which was well characterized by Isaac Asimov when he wrote of speaking
all in capital letters
pp
Timing has a syntactic function in that it sometimes helps to
distinguish nouns from
verbs
c
ul
exc
tract versus exc
ul
tractc

and adjectives from verbs appc
ul
roxc
imate versus approxic
ul
matec
 em although segmental aspects play a part here too for the vowel
qualities differ in each pair of words
Nevertheless if you make a mistake when assigning stress to words
like these in conversation you are very likely to be queried as
to what you actually said
pp
Intonation has a big effect on meaning too
Pitch often em but by no means always em rises on a question
the extent and abruptness of the rise depending on features like whether
a genuine information-bearing reply or merely confirmation is expected
A distinctive pitch pattern accompanies the introduction of a new topic
In conjunction with rhythm intonation can be used to bring out contrasts
