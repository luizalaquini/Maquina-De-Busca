He was ever a fighter she said A sweet stubborn man

Yes the maester said but this battle he cannot win It is time he lay down his sword and shield Time to yield

To yield she thought to make a peace Was it her father the maester was speaking of or her son

At evenfall Jeyne Westerling came to see her The young queen entered the solar timidly Lady Catelyn I do not mean to disturb you…

You are most welcome here Your Grace Catelyn had been sewing but she put the needle aside now

Please Call me Jeyne I don’t feel like a Grace

You are one nonetheless Please come sit Your Grace

Jeyne She sat by the hearth and smoothed her skirt out anxiously

As you wish How might I serve you Jeyne

It’s Robb the girl said He’s so miserable so… so angry and disconsolate I don’t know what to do

It is a hard thing to take a man’s life

I know I told him he should use a headsman When Lord Tywin sends a man to die all he does is give the command It’s easier that way don’t you think

Yes said Catelyn but my lord husband taught his sons that killing should never be easy

Oh Queen Jeyne wet her lips Robb has not eaten all day I had Rollam bring him a nice supper boar’s ribs and stewed onions and ale but he never touched a bite of it He spent all morning writing a letter and told me not to disturb him but when the letter was done he burned it Now he is sitting and looking at maps I asked him what he was looking for but he never answered I don’t think he ever heard me He wouldn’t even change out of his clothes They were damp all day and bloody I want to be a good wife to him I do but I don’t know how to help To cheer him or comfort him I don’t know what he needs Please my lady you’re his mother tell me what I should do

Tell me what I should do Catelyn might have asked the same if her father had been well enough to ask But Lord Hoster was gone or near enough Her Ned as well Bran and Rickon too and Mother and Brandon so long ago Only Robb remained to her Robb and the fading hope of her daughters

Sometimes Catelyn said slowly the best thing you can do is nothing When I first came to Winterfell I was hurt whenever Ned went to the godswood to sit beneath his heart tree Part of his soul was in that tree I knew a part I would never share Yet without that part I soon realized he would not have been Ned Jeyne child you have wed the north as I did… and in the north the winters will come She tried to smile Be patient Be understanding He loves you and he needs you and he will come back to you soon enough This very night perhaps Be there when he does That is all I can tell you

The young queen listened raptly I will she said when Catelyn was done I’ll be there She got to her feet I should go back He might have missed me I’ll see But if he’s still at his maps I’ll be patient

Do said Catelyn but when the girl was at the door she thought of something else Jeyne she called after there’s one more thing Robb needs from you though he may not know it yet himself A king must have an heir

The girl smiled at that My mother says the same She makes a posset for me herbs and milk and ale to help make me fertile I drink it every morning I told Robb I’m sure to give him twins An Eddard and a Brandon He liked that I think We… we try most every day my lady Sometimes twice or more The girl blushed very prettily I’ll be with child soon I promise I pray to our Mother Above every night

Very good I will add my prayers as well To the old gods and the new

When the girl had gone Catelyn turned back to her father and smoothed the thin white hair across his brow An Eddard and a Brandon she sighed softly And perhaps in time a Hoster Would you like that He did not answer but she had never expected that he would As the sound of the rain on the roof mingled with her father’s breathing she thought about Jeyne The girl did seem to have a good heart just as Robb had said And good hips which might be more important





Jaime


Two days’ ride to either side of the kingsroad they passed through a wide swath of destruction miles of blackened fields and orchards where the trunks of dead trees jutted into the air like archers’ stakes The bridges were burnt as well and the streams swollen by autumn rains so they had to range along the banks in search of fords The nights were alive with howling of wolves but they saw no people

At Maidenpool Lord Mooton’s red salmon still flew above the castle on its hill but the town walls were deserted the gates smashed half the homes and shops burned or plundered They saw nothing living but a few feral dogs that went slinking away at the sound of their approach The pool from which the town took its name where legend said that Florian the Fool had first glimpsed Jonquil bathing with her sisters was so choked with rotting corpses that the water had turned into a murky grey-green soup
