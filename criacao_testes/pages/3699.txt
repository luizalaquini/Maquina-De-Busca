Next came four of lesser birth who had distinguished themselves in the fighting the one-eyed knight Ser Philip Foote who had slain Lord Bryce Caron in single combat the freerider Lothor Brune who’d cut his way through half a hundred Fossoway men-at-arms to capture Ser Jon of the green apple and kill Ser Bryan and Ser Edwyd of the red thereby winning himself the name Lothor Apple-Eater Willit a grizzled man-atarms in the service of Ser Harys Swyft who’d pulled his master from beneath his dying horse and defended him against a dozen attackers and a downy-cheeked squire named Josmyn Peckledon who had killed two knights wounded a third and captured two more though he could not have been more than fourteen Willit was borne in on a litter so grievous were his wounds

Ser Kevan had taken a seat beside his brother Lord Tywin When the heralds had finished telling of each hero’s deeds he rose It is His Grace’s wish that these good men be rewarded for their valor By his decree Ser Philip shall henceforth be Lord Philip of House Foote and to him shall go all the lands rights and incomes of House Caron Lothor Brune to be raised to the estate of knighthood and granted land and keep in the riverlands at war’s end To Josmyn Peckledon a sword and suit of plate his choice of any warhorse in the royal stables and knighthood as soon as he shall come of age And lastly for Goodman Willit a spear with a silver-banded haft a hauberk of new-forged ringmail and a full helm with visor Further the goodman’s sons shall be taken into the service of House Lannister at Casterly Rock the elder as a squire and the younger as a page with the chance to advance to knighthood if they serve loyally and well To all this the King’s Hand and the small council consent

The captains of the king’s warships Wildwind Prince Aemon and River Arrow were honored next along with some under officers from Godsgrace Lance Lady of Silk and Ramshead As near as Sansa could tell their chief accomplishment had been surviving the battle on the river a feat that few enough could boast Hallyne the Pyromancer and the masters of the Alchemists’ Guild received the king’s thanks as well and Hallyne was raised to the style of lord though Sansa noted that neither lands nor castle accompanied the title which made the alchemist no more a true lord than Varys was A more significant lordship by far was granted to Ser Lancel Lannister Joffrey awarded him the lands castle and rights of House Darry whose last child lord had perished during the fighting in the riverlands leaving no trueborn heirs of lawful Darry blood but only a bastard cousin

Ser Lancel did not appear to accept the title the talk was his wound might cost him his arm or even his life The Imp was said to be dying as well from a terrible cut to the head

When the herald called Lord Petyr Baelish he came forth dressed all in shades of rose and plum his cloak patterned with mockingbirds She could see him smiling as he knelt before the Iron Throne He looks so pleased Sansa had not heard of Littlefinger doing anything especially heroic during the battle but it seemed he was to be rewarded all the same

Ser Kevan got back to his feet It is the wish of the King’s Grace that his loyal councillor Petyr Baelish be rewarded for faithful service to crown and realm Be it known that Lord Baelish is granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes there to make his seat and rule henceforth as Lord Paramount of the Trident Petyr Baelish and his sons and grandsons shall hold and enjoy these honors until the end of time and all the lords of the Trident shall do him homage as their rightful liege The King’s Hand and the small council consent

On his knees Littlefinger raised his eyes to King Joffrey I thank you humbly Your Grace I suppose this means I’ll need to see about getting some sons and grandsons

Joffrey laughed and the court with him Lord Paramount of the Trident Sansa thought and Lord of Harrenhal as well She did not understand why that should make him so happy the honors were as empty as the title granted to Hallyne the Pyromancer Harrenhal was cursed everyone knew that and the Lannisters did not even hold it at present Besides the lords of the Trident were sworn to Riverrun and House Tully and to the King in the North they would never accept Littlefinger as their liege Unless they are made to Unless my brother and my uncle and my grandfather are all cast down and killed The thought made Sansa anxious but she told herself she was being silly Robb has beaten them every time He’ll beat Lord Baelish too if he must

More than six hundred new knights were made that day They had held their vigil in the Great Sept of Baelor all through the night and crossed the city barefoot that morning to prove their humble hearts Now they came forward dressed in shifts of undyed wool to receive their knighthoods from the Kingsguard It took a long time since only three of the Brothers of the White Sword were on hand to dub them Mandon Moore had perished in the battle the Hound had vanished Aerys Oakheart was in Dorne with Princess Myrcella and Jaime Lannister was Robb’s captive so the Kingsguard had been reduced to Balon Swann Meryn Trant and Osmund Kettleblack Once knighted each man rose buckled on his swordbelt and stood beneath the windows Some had bloody feet from their walk through the city but they stood tall and proud all the same it seemed to Sansa

By the time all the new knights had been given their sers the hall was growing restive and none more so than Joffrey Some of those in the gallery had begun to slip quietly away but the notables on the floor were trapped unable to depart without the king’s leave Judging by the way he was fidgeting atop the Iron Throne Joff would willingly have granted it but the day’s work was far from done For now the coin was turned over and the captives were ushered in

There were great lords and noble knights in that company too sour old Lord Celtigar the Red Crab Ser Bonifer the Good Lord Estermont more ancient even than Celtigar Lord Varner who hobbled the length of the hall on a shattered knee but would accept no help Ser Mark Mullendore grey-faced his left arm gone to the elbow fierce Red Ronnet of Griffin Roost Ser Dermot of the Rainwood Lord Willurn and his sons Josua and Elyas Ser Jon Fossoway Ser Timon the Scrapesword Aurane the bastard of Driftmark Lord Staedmon called Pennylover hundreds of others

Those who had changed their allegiance during the battle needed only to swear fealty to Joffrey but the ones who had fought for Stannis until the bitter end were compelled to speak Their words decided their fate If they begged forgiveness for their treasons and promised to serve loyally henceforth Joffrey welcomed them back into the king’s peace and restored them to all their lands and rights A handful remained defiant however Do not imagine this is done boy warned one the bastard son of some Florent or other The Lord of Light protects King Stannis now and always All your swords and all your scheming shall not save you when his hour comes

Your hour is come right now Joffrey beckoned to Ser Ilyn Payne to take the man out and strike his head off But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery heart on his surcoat shouted out Stannis is the true king A monster sits the Iron Throne an abomination born of incest

Be silent Ser Kevan Lannister bellowed

The knight raised his voice instead Joffrey is the black worm eating the heart of the realm Darkness was his father and death his mother Destroy him before he corrupts you all Destroy them all queen whore and king worm vile dwarf and whispering spider the false flowers Save yourselves One of the gold cloaks knocked the man off his feet but he continued to shout The scouring fire will come King Stannis will return 

Joffrey lurched to his feet I’m king Kill him Kill him now I command it He chopped down with his hand a furious angry gesture… and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him The bright crimson samite of his sleeve turned a darker shade of red as his blood soaked through it Mother he wailed

With every eye on the king somehow the man on the floor wrested a spear away from one of the gold cloaks and used it to push himself back to his feet The throne denies him he cried He is no king

Cersei was running toward the throne but Lord Tywin remained still as stone He had only to raise a finger and Ser Meryn Trant moved forward with drawn sword The end was quick and brutal The gold cloaks seized the knight by the arms No king he cried again as Ser Meryn drove the point of his longsword through his chest

Joff fell into his mother’s arms Three maesters came hurrying forward to bundle him out through the king’s door Then everyone began talking at once When the gold cloaks dragged off the dead man he left a trail of bright blood across the stone floor Lord Baelish stroked his beard while Varys whispered in his ear Will they dismiss us now Sansa wondered A score of captives still waited though whether to pledge fealty or shout curses who could say

Lord Tywin rose to his feet We continue he said in a clear strong voice that silenced the murmurs Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so We will have no more follies He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step a mere three feet off the floor

The light outside the windows was fading by the time the session drew to a close Sansa felt limp with exhaustion as she made her way down from the gallery She wondered how badly Joffrey had cut himself They say the Iron Throne can be perilous cruel to those who were not meant to sit it

Back in the safety of her own chambers she hugged a pillow to her face to muffle a squeal of joy Oh gods be good he did it he put me aside in front of everyone When a serving girl brought her supper she almost kissed her There was hot bread and fresh-churned butter a thick beef soup capon and carrots and peaches in honey Even the food tastes sweeter she thought

Come dark she slipped into a cloak and left for the godswood Ser Osmund Kettleblack was guarding the drawbridge in his white armor Sansa tried her best to sound miserable as she bid him a good evening From the way he leered at her she was not sure she had been wholly convincing

Dontos waited in the leafy moonlight Why so sadface Sansa asked him gaily You were there you heard Joff put me aside he’s done with me he’s…

He took her hand Oh Jonquil my poor Jonquil you do not understand Done with you They’ve scarcely begun

Her heart sank What do you mean

The queen will never let you go never You are too valuable a hostage And Joffrey… sweetling he is still king If he wants you in his bed he will have you only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb instead of trueborn sons

No Sansa said shocked He let me go he…

Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear Be brave I swore to see you home and now I can The day has been chosen

When Sansa asked When will we go

The night of Joffrey’s wedding After the feast All the necessary arrangements have been made The Red Keep will be full of strangers Half the court will be drunk and the other half will be helping Joffrey bed his bride For a little while you will be forgotten and the confusion will be our friend

The wedding won’t be for a moon’s turn yet Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden they’ve only now sent for her

You’ve waited so long be patient awhile longer Here I have something for you Ser Dontos fumbled in his pouch and drew out a silvery spiderweb dangling it between his thick fingers It was a hair net of fine-spun silver the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took it in her fingers Small gems were set wherever two strands crossed so dark they drank the moonlight What stones are these

Black amethysts from Asshai The rarest kind a deep true purple by daylight

It’s very lovely Sansa said thinking It is a ship I need not a net for my hair

Lovelier than you know sweet child It’s magic you see It’s justice you hold It’s vengeance for your father Dontos leaned close and kissed her again It’s home





THEON

Maester Luwin came to him when the first scouts were seen outside the walls My lord prince he said you must yield

Theon stared at the platter of oakcakes honey and blood sausage they’d brought him to break his fast Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw and the very sight of food sickened him There has been no reply from my uncle

None the maester said Nor from your father on Pyke

Send more birds

It will not serve By the time the birds reach—

Send them Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm he pushed off the blankets and rose from Ned Stark’s bed naked and angry Or do you want me dead Is that it Luwin The truth now

The small grey man was unafraid My order serves

Yes but whom

The realm Maester Luwin said and Winterfell Theon once I taught you sums and letters history and warcraft And might have taught you more had you wished to learn I will not claim to bear you any great love no but I cannot hate you either Even if I did so long as you hold Winterfell I am bound by oath to give you counsel So now I counsel you to yield

Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor shook off the rushes and draped it over his shoulders A fire I’ll have a fire and clean garb Where’s Wex I’ll not go to my grave in dirty clothes

You have no hope of holding here the maester went on If your lord father meant to send you aid he would have done so by now It is the Neck that concerns him The battle for the north will be fought amidst the ruins of Moat Cailin
