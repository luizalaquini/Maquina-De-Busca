confirmed bachelor I had never any views of myself
as a husband in my earlier days nor have I made any
calculation on the subject since I have been older
But we all change and my change in this matter
P 178
came
with seeing you I have felt lately more and more
that my present way of living is bad in every respect
Beyond all things I want you as my wife
I feel Mr Boldwood that though I respect you
much I do not feel -- what would justify me to -- in
accepting your offer she stammered
This giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to
open the sluices of feeling that Boldwood had as yet
kept closed
 My life is a burden without you he exclaimed in
a low voice I want you -- I want you to let me say
I love you again and again
Bathsheba answered nothing and the mare upon
her arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping
the herbage she looked up
I think and hope you care enough for me to listen
to what I have to tell
   Bathshebas momentary impulse at hearing this was
to ask why he thought that till she remembered that
far from being a conceited assumption on Boldwoods
part it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec+
tion based on deceptive premises of her own offering
I wish I could say courteous flatteries to you the
farmer continued in an easier tone  and put my rugged
feeling into a graceful shape but I have neither power
nor patience to learn such things I want you for my
wife -- so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me
but I should not have spoken out had I not been led
to hope
The valentine again O that valentine she
said to herself but not a word to him
  If you can love me say so Miss Everdene If not
 -- dont say no
  Mr Boldwood it is painful to have to say I am
surprised so that I dont know how to answer you with
propriety and respect -- but am only just able to speak
out my feeling -- I mean my meaning that I am afraid
I cant marry you much as I respect you You are too
dignified for me to suit you sir
  But Miss Everdene
I -- I didnt -- I know I ought never to have dreamt
of sending
P 179
that valentine -- forgive me sir -- it was a
wanton thing which no woman with any self-respect
should have done If you will only pardon my thought+
lessness I promise never to --  -- 
 No no no Dont say thoughtlessness Make me
think it was something more -- that it was a sort of
prophetic instinct -- the beginning of a feeling that you
would like me You torture me to say it was done in
thoughtlessness -- I never thought of it in that light and
I cant endure it Ah  I wish I knew how to win you
but that I cant do -- I can only ask if I have already got
you If I have not and it is not true that you have
come unwittingly to me as I have to you I can say no
more
  I have not fallen in love with you Mr Boldwood --
certainly I must say that She allowed a very small
smile to creep for the first time over her serious face in
saying this and the white row of upper teeth and keenly+
cut lips already noticed suggested an idea of heartless+
ness which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant
eyes
But you will just think -- in kindness and conde+
scension think -- if you cannot bear with me as a husband
I fear I am too old for you but believe me I will take
more care of you than would many a man of your own
age I will protect and cherish you with all my strength
 -- I will indeed You shall have no cares -- be worried
by no household affairs and live quite at ease Miss
Everdene The dairy superintendence shall be done by
a man -- I can afford it will -- you shall never have so
much as to look out of doors at haymaking time or to
think of weather in the harvest I rather cling to the
chaise because it is he same my poor father and mother
drove but if you dont like it I will sell it and you shall
have a pony-carriage of your own I cannot say how
far above every other idea and object on earth you seem
to me -- nobody knows -- God only knows -- how much
you are to me
Bathshebas heart was young and it swelled with
sympathy for the deep-natured man who spoke so
simply
  Dont say it dont I cannot bear you to feel so
much and me to feel nothing And I am afraid they
will notice us Mr Boldwood Will you let the matter
rest now I cannot think
P 180
collectedly I did not know
you were going to say this to me 0 I am wicked to
have made you suffer so She was frightened as well
as agitated at his vehemence
  Say then that you dont absolutely refuse Do not
