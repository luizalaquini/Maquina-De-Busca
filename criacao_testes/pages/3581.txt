Each evenfall as the khalasar set out she would choose a dragon to ride upon her shoulder Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their mounts and rode close behind her so Dany was never out of their sight It was the only way to keep them quiescent

Aegon’s dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria she told her bloodriders one morning after a long night’s journey Visenya’s dragon was Vhagar Rhaenys had Meraxes and Aegon rode Balerion the Black Dread It was said that Vhagar’s breath was so hot that it could melt a knight’s armor and cook the man inside that Meraxes swallowed horses whole and Balerion… his fire was as black as his scales his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead

The Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily The largest of her three was shiny black his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns Khaleesi Aggo murmured there sits Balerion come again

It may be as you say blood of my blood Dany replied gravely but he shall have a new name for this new life I would name them all for those the gods have taken The green one shall be Rhaegal for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the Trident The cream-and-gold I call Viserion Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened yet he was my brother still His dragon will do what he could not

And the black beast asked Ser Jorah Mormont

The black she said is Drogon

Yet even as her dragons prospered her khalasar withered and died Around them the land turned ever more desolate Even devilgrass grew scant horses dropped in their tracks leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot Doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters her hair came out in clumps and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more She gave Doreah water from her own skin cooled her brow with a damp cloth and held her hand until she died shivering Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on

They saw no sign of other travelers The Dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the comet had led them to some hell Dany went to Ser Jorah one morning as they made camp amidst a jumble of black windscoured stones Are we lost she asked him Does this waste have no end to it

It has an end he answered wearily I have seen the maps the traders draw my queen Few caravans come this way that is so yet there are great kingdoms to the east and cities full of wonders Yi Ti Qarth Asshai by the Shadow…

Will we live to see them

I will not lie to you The way is harder than I dared think The knight’s face was grey and exhausted The wound he had taken to his hip the night he fought Khal Drogo’s bloodriders had never fully healed she could see how he grimaced when he mounted his horse and he seemed to slump in his saddle as they rode Perhaps we are doomed if we press on… but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back

Dany kissed him lightly on the cheek It heartened her to see him smile I must be strong for him as well she thought grimly A knight he may be but I am the blood of the dragon

The next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone but their skins were almost empty The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid The taste was no less foul but water was water and all of them thirsted Dany looked at the horizon with despair They had lost a third of their number and still the waste stretched before them bleak and red and endless The comet mocks my hopes she thought lifting her eyes to where it scored the sky Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with them in this hard hot desert She would not believe it

The next day dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop A city Khaleesi they cried A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid An hour’s ride no more

Show me she said

When the city appeared before her its walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil of heat it looked so beautiful that Dany was certain it must be a mirage Do you know what place this might be Ser Jorah

The exile knight gave a weary shake of the head No my queen I have never traveled this far east

The distant white walls promised rest and safety a chance to heal and grow strong and Dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward them Instead she turned to her bloodriders Blood of my blood go ahead of us and learn the name of this city and what manner of welcome we should expect

Ai Khaleesi said Aggo

Her riders were not long in returning Rakharo swung down from his saddle From his medallion belt hung the great curving arakh that Dany had bestowed on him when she named him bloodrider This city is dead Khaleesi Nameless and godless we found it the gates broken only wind and flies moving through the streets

Jhiqui shuddered When the gods are gone the evil ghosts feast by night Such places are best shunned It is known

It is known Irri agreed

Not to me Dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way trotting beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street Ser Jorah and her bloodriders followed and then more slowly the rest of the Dothraki

How long the city had been deserted she could not know but the white walls so beautiful from afar were cracked and crumbling when seen up close Inside was a maze of narrow crooked alleys The buildings pressed close their facades blank chalky windowless Everything was white as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color They rode past heaps of sun-washed rubble where houses had fallen in and elsewhere saw the faded scars of fire At a place where six alleys came together Dany passed an empty marble plinth Dothraki had visited this place before it would seem Perhaps even now the missing statue stood among the other stolen gods in Vaes Dothrak She might have ridden past it a hundred times never knowing On her shoulder Viserion hissed

They made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace on a windswept plaza where devilgrass grew between the paving stones Dany sent out men to search the ruins Some went reluctantly yet they went… and one scarred old man returned a brief time later hopping and grinning his hands overflowing with figs They were small withered things yet her people grabbed for them greedily jostling and pushing at each other stuffing the fruit into their cheeks and chewing blissfully

Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees hidden behind closed doors in secret gardens Aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold Yet they found bones too the skulls of the unburied dead bleached and broken Ghosts Irri muttered Terrible ghosts We must not stay here Khaleesi this is their place

I fear no ghosts Dragons are more powerful than ghosts And figs are more important Go with Jhiqui and find me some clean sand for a bath and trouble me no more with silly talk

In the coolness of her tent Dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her choices There was food and water here to sustain them and enough grass for the horses to regain their strength How pleasant it would be to wake every day in the same place to linger among shady gardens eat figs and drink cool water as much as she might desire

When Irri and Jhiqui returned with pots of white sand Dany stripped and let them scrub her clean Your hair is coming back Khaleesi Jhiqui said as she scraped sand off her back Dany ran a hand over the top of her head feeling the new growth Dothraki men wore their hair in long oiled braids and cut them only when defeated Perhaps I should do the same she thought to remind them that Drogo’s strength lives within me now Khal Drogo had died with his hair uncut a boast few men could make

Across the tent Rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half foot before thumping to the carpet When he landed his tail lashed back and forth in fury and he raised his head and screamed If I had wings I would want to fly too Dany thought The Targaryens of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war She tried to imagine what it would feel like to straddle a dragon’s neck and soar high into the air It would be like standing on a mountaintop only better The whole world would be spread out below If I flew high enough I could even see the Seven Kingdoms and reach up and touch the comet

Irri broke her reverie to tell her that Ser Jorah Mormont was outside awaiting her pleasure Send him in Dany commanded sand-scrubbed skin tingling She wrapped herself in the lionskin The hrakkar had been much bigger than Dany so the pelt covered everything that wanted covering

I’ve brought you a peach Ser Jorah said kneeling It was so small she could almost hide it in her palm and overripe too but when she took the first bite the flesh was so sweet she almost cried She ate it slowly savoring every mouthful while Ser Jorah told her of the tree it had been plucked from in a garden near the western wall

Fruit and water and shade Dany said her cheeks sticky with peach juice The gods were good to bring us to this place

We should rest here until we are stronger the knight urged The red lands are not kind to the weak

My handmaids say there are ghosts here

There are ghosts everywhere Ser Jorah said softly We carry them with us wherever we go

Yes she thought Viserys Khal Drogo my son Rhaego they are with me always Tell me the name of your ghost Jorah You know all of mine

His face grew very still Her name was Lynesse

Your wife

My second wife

It pains him to speak of her Dany saw but she wanted to know the truth Is that all you would say of her The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place Was she beautiful

Very beautiful Ser Jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face The first time I beheld her I thought she was a goddess come to earth the Maid herself made flesh Her birth was far above my own She was the youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower of Oldtown The White Bull who commanded your father’s Kingsguard was her great-uncle The Hightowers are an ancient family very rich and very proud

And loyal Dany said I remember Viserys said the Hightowers were among those who stayed true to my father

That’s so he admitted

Did your fathers make the match

No he said Our marriage… that makes a long tale and a dull one Your Grace I would not trouble you with it

I have nowhere to go she said Please

As my queen commands Ser Jorah frowned My home… you must understand that to understand the rest Bear Island is beautiful but remote Imagine old gnarled oaks and tall pines flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss little creeks running icy down steep hillsides The hall of the Mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen palisade Aside from a few crofters my people live along the coasts and fish the seas The island lies far to the north and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine Khaleesi

Still the island suited me well enough and I never lacked for women I had my share of fishwives and crofter’s daughters before and after I was wed I married young to a bride of my father’s choosing a Glover of Deepwood Motte Ten years we were wed or near enough as makes no matter She was a plain-faced woman but not unkind I suppose I came to love her after a fashion though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate Three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir The last time she never recovered She died not long after

Dany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze I am sorry for you truly
