The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table Well enough for a man of my years my lord he replied yet I do tire easily I fear Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face His maester’s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast The links were forged of every metal known to man black iron and red gold bright copper and dull lead steel and tin and pale silver brass and bronze and platinum Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork and here and there an emerald or ruby Perhaps we might begin soon the Grand Maester said hands knitting together atop his broad stomach I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer

As you will The king’s seat sat empty at the head of the table the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows Ned took the chair beside it as the right hand of his king My lords he said formally I am sorry to have kept you waiting

You are the King’s Hand Varys said We serve at your pleasure Lord Stark

As the others took their accustomed seats it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here in this room with these men He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell I am surrounded by flatterers and fools the king had insisted Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools He thought he knew already We are but five he pointed out

Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north Varys said and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us Ned suggested

Renly Baratheon laughed aloud If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence it could be a long sit

Our good King Robert has many cares Varys said He entrusts some small matters to us to lighten his load

What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears Lord Renly said so it falls to us to govern the realm He does send us a command from time to time He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once He has an urgent task for us

Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned It bore the royal seal Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king’s urgent command reading the words with mounting disbelief Was there no end to Robert’s folly And to do this in his name that was salt in the wound Gods be good he swore

What Lord Eddard means to say Lord Renly announced is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King

How much asked Littlefinger mildly

Ned read the answer off the letter Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion Twenty thousand to the man who comes second another twenty to the winner of the melee and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition

Ninety thousand gold pieces Littlefinger sighed And we must not neglect the other costs Robert will want a prodigious feast That means cooks carpenters serving girls singers jugglers fools…

Fools we have in plenty Lord Renly said

Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked Will the treasury bear the expense

What treasury is that Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth Spare me the foolishness Maester You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years I shall have to borrow the money No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present what matter another hundred thousand

Ned was stunned Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt

The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt Lord Stark The Lannisters are the biggest part of it but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell the Iron Bank of Braavos and several Tyroshi trading cartels Of late I’ve had to turn to the Faith The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger

Ned was aghast Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold How could you let this happen

Littlefinger gave a shrug The master of coin finds the money The king and the Hand spend it

I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm Ned said hotly

Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head his chains clinking softly Lord Arryn was a prudent man but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel

My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts Renly Baratheon said and he loathes what he calls ‘counting coppers’

I will speak with His Grace Ned said This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford

Speak to him as you will Lord Renly said we had still best make our plans

Another day Ned said Perhaps too sharply from the looks they gave him He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell where only the king stood higher here he was but first among equals Forgive me my lords he said in a softer tone I am tired Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher He did not ask for their consent but stood abruptly nodded at them all and made for the door

Outside wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men The king had not yet arrived he was told Since the ugliness on the Trident the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column the better to separate themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension Robert had hardly been seen the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse drunk as often as not If so he might be hours behind but he would still be here too soon for Ned’s liking He had only to look at Sansa’s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it should have been Nymeria who died And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher’s boy Sansa cried herself to sleep Arya brooded silently all day long and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell

He crossed the outer yard passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey and was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him You’re going the wrong way Stark Come with me

Hesitantly Ned followed Littlefinger led him into a tower down a stair across a small sunken courtyard and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls They were relics of the Targaryens black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms now dusty and forgotten This is not the way to my chambers Ned said

Did I say it was I’m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall Littlefinger replied his voice dripping with sarcasm We have no time for this Stark Your wife awaits

What game are you playing Littlefinger Catelyn is at Winterfell hundreds of leagues from here

Oh Littlefinger’s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation For the last time come Or don’t come and I’ll keep her for myself He hurried down the steps

Ned followed him warily wondering if this day would ever end He had no taste for these intrigues but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger

At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk on a rocky bluff high above the river We’re outside the castle Ned said

You are a hard man to fool Stark Littlefinger said with a smirk Was it the sun that gave it away or the sky Follow me There are niches cut in the rock Try not to fall to your death Catelyn would never understand With that he was over the side of the cliff descending as quick as a monkey

Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment then followed more slowly The niches were there as Littlefinger had promised shallow cuts that would be invisible from below unless you knew just where to look for them The river was a long dizzying distance below Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to

When at last he reached the bottom a narrow muddy trail along the water’s edge Littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple He was almost down to the core You are growing old and slow Stark he said flipping the apple casually into the rushing water No matter we ride the rest of the way He had two horses waiting Ned mounted up and trotted behind him down the trail and into the city

Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building three stories timbered its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain with a globe of leaded red glass

Ned Stark dismounted in a fury A brothel he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around You’ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel

Your wife is inside Littlefinger said

It was the final insult Brandon was too kind to you Ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard

My lord no an urgent voice called out He speaks the truth There were footsteps behind him

Ned spun knife in hand as an old white-haired man hurried toward them He was dressed in brown roughspun and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran This is no business of yours Ned began then suddenly the recognition came He lowered the dagger astonished Ser Rodrik

Rodrik Cassel nodded Your lady awaits you upstairs

Ned was lost Catelyn is truly here This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger’s He sheathed his blade

Would that it were Stark Littlefinger said Follow me and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King’s Hand It would not do to have you recognized Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two just in passing

They went inside through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps No one paid Ned the least bit of attention Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor along a corridor and through a door

Inside Catelyn was waiting She cried out when she saw him ran to him and embraced him fiercely

My lady Ned whispered in wonderment
