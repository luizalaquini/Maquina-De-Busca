Is that the only word you know she asked him

Drogo did not reply His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair one by one After a moment Dany leaned forward to help When they were done Drogo gestured She understood Slowly carefully she began to undo his braid

It took a long time All the while he sat there silently watching her When she was done he shook his head and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness oiled and gleaming She had never seen hair so long so black so thick

Then it was his turn He began to undress her

His fingers were deft and strangely tender He removed her silks one by one carefully while Dany sat unmoving silent looking at his eyes When he bared her small breasts she could not help herself She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands No Drogo said He pulled her hands away from her breasts gently but firmly then lifted her face again to make her look at him No he repeated

No she echoed back at him

He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks The night air was chilly on her bare skin She shivered and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs She was afraid of what would come next but for a while nothing happened Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed looking at her drinking in her body with his eyes

After a while he began to touch her Lightly at first then harder She could sense the fierce strength in his hands but he never hurt her He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers one by one He ran a hand gently down her leg He stroked her face tracing the curve of her ears running a finger gently around her mouth He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers He turned her around massaged her shoulders slid a knuckle down the path of her spine

It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled He circled her nipples with his thumbs pinched them between thumb and forefinger then began to pull at her very lightly at first then more insistently until her nipples stiffened and began to ache

He stopped then and drew her down onto his lap Dany was flushed and breathless her heart fluttering in her chest He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes No he said and she knew it was a question

She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs Yes she whispered as she put his finger inside her





EDDARD

The summons came in the hour before the dawn when the world was still and grey

Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill groggy from sleep to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse Up Stark he roared Up up We have matters of state to discuss

By all means Ned said Come inside Your Grace Alyn lifted the flap of the tent

No no no Robert said His breath steamed with every word The camp is full of ears Besides I want to ride out and taste this country of yours Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen Ned saw There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes dress and mount up

Robert set the pace driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him trying to keep up He called out a question as they rode but the wind blew his words away and the king did not hear him After that Ned rode in silence They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist By then the guard had fallen back a small distance safely out of earshot but still Robert would not slow

Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge and finally the king pulled up By then they were miles south of the main party Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him Gods he swore laughing it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride I swear Ned this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad He had never been a patient man Robert Baratheon That damnable wheelhouse the way it creaks and groans climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain… I promise you if that wretched thing breaks another axle I’m going to burn it and Cersei can walk

Ned laughed I will gladly light the torch for you

Good man The king clapped him on the shoulder I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going

A smile touched Ned’s lips I do believe you mean it

I do I do the king said What do you say Ned Just you and me two vagabond knights on the kingsroad our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight

Would that we could Ned said but we have duties now my liege… to the realm to our children I to my lady wife and you to your queen We are not the boys we were

You were never the boy you were Robert grumbled More’s the pity And yet there was that one time… what was her name that common girl of yours Becca No she was one of mine gods love her black hair and these sweet big eyes you could drown in them Yours was… Aleena No You told me once Was it Merryl You know the one I mean your bastard’s mother

Her name was Wylla Ned replied with cool courtesy and I would sooner not speak of her
