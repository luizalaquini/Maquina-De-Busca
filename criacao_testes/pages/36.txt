3919 And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his
wife which she spake unto him saying After this manner did thy
servant to me that his wrath was kindled

3920 And Josephs master took him and put him into the prison a
place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the
prison

3921 But the LORD was with Joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison

3922 And the keeper of the prison committed to Josephs hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he
was the doer of it

3923 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
his hand because the LORD was with him and that which he did the
LORD made it to prosper

401 And it came to pass after these things that the butler of the
king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt

402 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the
chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers

403 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard
into the prison the place where Joseph was bound

404 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them and he
served them and they continued a season in ward

405 And they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one
night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the
butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were bound in the
prison

406 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon
them and behold they were sad

407 And he asked Pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of
his lords house saying Wherefore look ye so sadly to day  408 And
they said unto him We have dreamed a dream and there is no
interpreter of it And Joseph said unto them Do not interpretations
belong to God tell me them I pray you

409 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him
In my dream behold a vine was before me 4010 And in the vine were
three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot
forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes 4011 And
Pharaohs cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and pressed them
into Pharaohs cup and I gave the cup into Pharaohs hand

4012 And Joseph said unto him This is the interpretation of it The
three branches are three days 4013 Yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou
shalt deliver Pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner
when thou wast his butler

4014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew
kindness I pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto Pharaoh
and bring me out of this house 4015 For indeed I was stolen away out
of the land of the Hebrews and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon

4016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he
said unto Joseph I also was in my dream and behold I had three
white baskets on my head 4017 And in the uppermost basket there was
of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh and the birds did eat them out
of the basket upon my head

4018 And Joseph answered and said This is the interpretation
thereof The three baskets are three days 4019 Yet within three days
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a
tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee

4020 And it came to pass the third day which was Pharaohs birthday
that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants

4021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and
he gave the cup into Pharaohs hand 4022 But he hanged the chief
baker as Joseph had interpreted to them

4023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph but forgat him

411 And it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh
dreamed and behold he stood by the river

412 And behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow

413 And behold seven other kine came up after them out of the
river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon
the brink of the river

414 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine So Pharaoh awoke

415 And he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears
