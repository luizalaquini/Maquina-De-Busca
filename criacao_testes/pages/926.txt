The queen commands these ones obey

Best bring sacks as well as shovels Worm Brown Ben counseled Well past ripe those ones Falling off those poles in bits and pieces and crawling with…

He knows So do I Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen the Plaza of Punishment in Astapor I made a horror just as great but surely they deserved it Harsh justice is still justice

Your Grace said Missandei Ghiscari inter their honored dead in crypts below their manses If you would boil the bones clean and return them to their kin it would be a kindness

The widows will curse me all the same Let it be done Dany beckoned to Daario How many seek audience this morning

Two have presented themselves to bask in your radiance

Daario had plundered himself a whole new wardrobe in Meereen and to match it he had redyed his trident beard and curly hair a deep rich purple It made his eyes look almost purple too as if he were some lost Valyrian They arrived in the night on the Indigo Star a trading galley out of Qarth

A slaver you mean Dany frowned Who are they

The Star’s master and one who claims to speak for Astapor

I will see the envoy first

He proved to be a pale ferret-faced man with ropes of pearls and spun gold hanging heavy about his neck Your Worship he cried My name is Ghael I bring greetings to the Mother of Dragons from King Cleon of Astapor Cleon the Great

Dany stiffened I left a council to rule Astapor A healer a scholar and a priest

Your Worship those sly rogues betrayed your trust It was revealed that they were scheming to restore the Good Masters to power and the people to chains Great Cleon exposed their plots and hacked their heads off with a cleaver and the grateful folk of Astapor have crowned him for his valor

Noble Ghael said Missandei in the dialect of Astapor is this the same Cleon once owned by Grazdan mo Ullhor

Her voice was guileless yet the question plainly made the envoy anxious The same he admitted A great man

Missandei leaned close to Dany He was a butcher in Grazdan’s kitchen the girl whispered in her ear It was said he could slaughter a pig faster than any man in Astapor

I have given Astapor a butcher king Dany felt ill but she knew she must not let the envoy see it I will pray that King Cleon rules well and wisely What would he have of me

Ghael rubbed his mouth Perhaps we should speak more privily Your Grace

I have no secrets from my captains and commanders

As you wish Great Cleon bids me declare his devotion to the Mother of Dragons Your enemies are his enemies he says and chief among them are the Wise Masters of Yunkai He proposes a pact between Astapor and Meereen against the Yunkai’i

I swore no harm would come to Yunkai if they released their slaves said Dany

These Yunkish dogs cannot be trusted Your Worship Even now they plot against you New levies have been raised and can be seen drilling outside the city walls warships are being built envoys have been sent to New Ghis and Volantis in the west to make alliances and hire sellswords They have even dispatched riders to Vaes Dothrak to bring a khalasar down upon you Great Cleon bid me tell you not to be afraid Astapor remembers Astapor will not forsake you To prove his faith Great Cleon offers to seal your alliance with a marriage

A marriage To me

Ghael smiled His teeth were brown and rotten Great Cleon will give you many strong sons

Dany found herself bereft of words but little Missandei came to her rescue Did his first wife give him sons

The envoy looked at her unhappily Great Cleon has three daughters by his first wife Two of his newer wives are with child But he means to put all of them aside if the Mother of Dragons will consent to wed him

How noble of him said Dany I will consider all you’ve said my lord She gave orders that Ghael be given chambers for the night somewhere lower in the pyramid
