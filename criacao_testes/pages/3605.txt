We ought to reach the upper Mander today my lady Ser Wendel announced while Shadd spooned out the porridge Lord Renly will not be far if the talk be true

And what do I tell him when I find him That my son holds him no true king She did not relish this meeting They needed friends not more enemies yet Robb would never bend the knee in homage to a man he felt had no claim to the throne

Her bowl was empty though she could scarce remember tasting the porridge She laid it aside It is time we were away The sooner she spoke to Renly the sooner she could turn for home She was the first one mounted and she set the pace for the column Hal Mollen rode beside her bearing the banner of House Stark the grey direwolf on an ice-white field

They were still a half day’s ride from Renly’s camp when they were taken Robin Flint had ranged ahead to scout and he came galloping back with word of a far-eyes watching from the roof of a distant windmill By the time Catelyn’s party reached the mill the man was long gone They pressed on covering not quite a mile before Renly’s outriders came swooping down on them twenty men mailed and mounted led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with bluejays on his surcoat

When he saw her banners he trotted up to her alone My lady he called I am Ser Colen of Greenpools as it please you These are dangerous lands you cross

Our business is urgent she answered him I come as envoy from my son Robb Stark the King in the North to treat with Renly Baratheon the King in the South

King Renly is the crowned and anointed lord of all the Seven Kingdoms my lady Ser Colen answered though courteously enough His Grace is encamped with his host near Bitterbridge where the roseroad crosses the Mander It shall be my great honor to escort you to him The knight raised a mailed hand and his men formed a double column flanking Catelyn and her guard Escort or captor she wondered There was nothing to be done but trust in Ser Colen’s honor and Lord Renly’s

They saw the smoke of the camp’s fires when they were still an hour from the river Then the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain indistinct as the murmur of some distant sea but swelling as they rode closer By the time they caught sight of the Mander’s muddy waters glinting in the sun they could make out the voices of men the clatter of steel the whinny of horses Yet neither sound nor smoke prepared them for the host itself

Thousands of cookfires filled the air with a pale smoky haze The horse lines alone stretched out over leagues A forest had surely been felled to make the tall staffs that held the banners Great siege engines lined the grassy verge of the roseroad mangonels and trebuchets and rolling rams mounted on wheels taller than a man on horseback The steel points of pikes flamed red with sunlight as if already blooded while the pavilions of the knights and high lords sprouted from the grass like silken mushrooms She saw men with spears and men with swords men in steel caps and mail shirts camp followers strutting their charms archers fletching arrows teamsters driving wagons swineherds driving pigs pages running messages squires honing swords knights riding palfreys grooms leading ill-tempered destriers This is a fearsome lot of men Ser Wendel Manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span from which Bitterbridge took its name

That it is Catelyn agreed

Near all the chivalry of the south had come to Renly’s call it seemed The golden rose of Highgarden was seen everywhere sewn on the right breast of armsmen and servants flapping and fluttering from the green silk banners that adorned lance and pike painted upon the shields hung outside the pavilions of the sons and brothers and cousins and uncles of House Tyrell As well Catelyn spied the fox-and-flowers of House Florent Fossoway apples red and green Lord Tarly’s striding huntsman oak leaves for Oakheart cranes for Crane a cloud of black-and-orange butterflies for the Mullendores

Across the Mander the storm lords had raised their standards—Renly’s own bannermen sworn to House Baratheon and Storm’s End Catelyn recognized Bryce Caron’s nightingales the Penrose quills and Lord Estermont’s sea turtle green on green Yet for every shield she knew there were a dozen strange to her borne by the small lords sworn to the bannermen and by hedge knights and freeriders who had come swarming to make Renly Baratheon a king in fact as well as name

Renly’s own standard flew high over all From the top of his tallest siege tower a wheeled oaken immensity covered with rawhides streamed the largest war banner that Catelyn had ever seen—a cloth big enough to carpet many a hall shimmering gold with the crowned stag of Baratheon black upon it prancing proud and tall

My lady do you hear that noise asked Hallis Mollen trotting close What is that

She listened Shouts and horses screaming and the clash of steel and…Cheering she said They had been riding up a gentle slope toward a line of brightly colored pavilions on the height As they passed between them the press of men grew thicker the sounds louder And then she saw

Below beneath the stone-and-timber battlements of a small castle a melee was in progress

A field had been cleared off fences and galleries and tilting barriers thrown up Hundreds were gathered to watch perhaps thousands From the looks of the grounds torn and muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances they had been at it for a day or more but now the end was near Fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse charging and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered them on She saw two destriers collide in full armor going down in a tangle of steel and horseflesh A tourney Hal Mollen declared He had a penchant for loudly announcing the obvious

Oh splendid Ser Wendel Manderly said as a knight in a rainbow-striped cloak wheeled to deliver a backhand blow with a long-handled axe that shattered the shield of the man pursuing him and sent him reeling in his stirrups

The press in front of them made further progress difficult Lady Stark Ser Colen said if your men would be so good as to wait here I’ll present you to the king

As you say She gave the command though she had to raise her voice to be heard above the tourney din Ser Colen walked his horse slowly through the throngs with Catelyn riding in his wake A roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless red-bearded man with a griffin on his shield went down before a big knight in blue armor His steel was a deep cobalt even the blunt morningstar he wielded with such deadly effect his mount barded in the quartered sun-and-moon heraldry of House Tarth

Red Ronnet’s down gods be damned a man cursed

Loras’ll do for that blue— a companion answered before a roar drowned out the rest of his words

Another man was fallen trapped beneath his injured horse both of them screaming in pain Squires rushed out to aid them

This is madness Catelyn thought Real enemies on every side and half the realm in flames and Renly sits here playing at war like a boy with his first wooden sword

The lords and ladies in the gallery were as engrossed in the melee as the men on the ground Catelyn marked them well Her father had oft treated with the southron lords and not a few had been guests at Riverrun She recognized Lord Mathis Rowan stouter and more florid than ever the golden tree of his House spread across his white doublet Below him sat Lady Oakheart tiny and delicate and to her left Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill his greatsword Heartsbane propped up against the back of his seat Others she knew only by their sigils and some not at all

In their midst watching and laughing with his young queen by his side sat a ghost in a golden crown

Small wonder the lords gather around him with such fervor she thought he is Robert come again Renly was handsome as Robert had been handsome long of limb and broad of shoulder with the same coal-black hair fine and straight the same deep blue eyes the same easy smile The slender circlet around his brows seemed to suit him well It was soft gold a ring of roses exquisitely wrought at the front lifted a stag’s head of dark green jade adorned with golden eyes and golden antlers

The crowned stag decorated the king’s green velvet tunic as well worked in gold thread upon his chest the Baratheon sigil in the colors of Highgarden The girl who shared the high seat with him was also of Highgarden his young queen Margaery daughter to Lord Mace Tyrell Their marriage was the mortar that held the great southron alliance together Catelyn knew Renly was one-and-twenty the girl no older than Robb very pretty with a doe’s soft eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about her shoulders in lazy ringlets Her smile was shy and sweet

Out in the field another man lost his seat to the knight in the rainbow-striped cloak and the king shouted approval with the rest Loras she heard him call Loras Highgarden The queen clapped her hands together in excitement

Catelyn turned to see the end of it Only four men were left in the fight now and there was small doubt whom king and commons favored She had never met Ser Loras Tyrell but even in the distant north one heard tales of the prowess of the young Knight of Flowers Ser Loras rode a tall white stallion in silver mail and fought with a long-handled axe A crest of golden roses ran down the center of his helm

Two of the other survivors had made common cause They spurred their mounts toward the knight in the cobalt armor As they closed to either side the blue knight reined hard smashing one man full in the face with his splintered shield while his black destrier lashed out with a steel-shod hoof at the other In a blink one combatant was unhorsed the other reeling The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his left arm and then the Knight of Flowers was on him The weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser Loras moved his rainbow cloak swirling about him

The white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest dance the riders throwing steel in place of kisses Longaxe flashed and morningstar whirled Both weapons were blunted yet still they raised an awful clangor Shieldless the blue knight was getting much the worse of it Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and shoulders to shouts of Highgarden from the throng The other gave answer with his morningstar but whenever the ball came crashing in Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield emblazoned with three golden roses When the longaxe caught the blue knight’s hand on the backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp the crowd screamed like a rutting beast The Knight of Flowers raised his axe for the final blow

The blue knight charged into it The stallions slammed together the blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate… but somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steel-gauntleted fingers He wrenched it from Ser Loras’s hand and suddenly the two were grappling mount-to-mount and an instant later they were falling As their horses pulled apart they crashed to the ground with bone-jarring force Loras Tyrell on the bottom took the brunt of the impact The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open Tyrell’s visor The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear what Ser Loras said but she saw the word form on his split bloody lips Yield

The blue knight climbed unsteady to his feet and raised his dirk in the direction of Renly Baratheon the salute of a champion to his king Squires dashed onto the field to help the vanquished knight to his feet When they got his helm off Catelyn was startled to see how young he was He could not have had more than two years on Robb The boy might have been as comely as his sister but the broken lip unfocused eyes and blood trickling through his matted hair made it hard to be certain

Approach King Renly called to the champion

He limped toward the gallery At close hand the brilliant blue armor looked rather less splendid everywhere it showed scars the dents of mace and warhammer the long gouges left by swords chips in the enameled breastplate and helm His cloak hung in rags From the way he moved the man within was no less battered A few voices hailed him with cries of Tarth and oddly A Beauty A Beauty but most were silent The blue knight knelt before the king Grace he said his voice muffled by his dented greathelm

You are all your lord father claimed you were Renly’s voice carried over the field I’ve seen Ser Loras unhorsed once or twice… but never quite in that fashion

That were no proper unhorsing complained a drunken archer nearby a Tyrell rose sewn on his jerkin A vile trick pulling the lad down

The press had begun to open up Ser Colen Catelyn said to her escort who is this man and why do they mislike him so

Ser Colen frowned Because he is no man my lady That’s Brienne of Tarth daughter to Lord Selwyn the Evenstar

Daughter Catelyn was horrified

Brienne the Beauty they name her… though not to her face lest they be called upon to defend those words with their bodies

She heard King Renly declare the Lady Brienne of Tarth the victor of the great melee at Bitterbridge last mounted of one hundred sixteen knights As champion you may ask of me any boon that you desire If it lies in my power it is yours

Your Grace Brienne answered I ask the honor of a place among your Rainbow Guard I would be one of your seven and pledge my life to yours to go where you go ride at your side and keep you safe from all hurt and harm

Done he said Rise and remove your helm

She did as he bid her And when the greathelm was lifted Catelyn understood Ser Colen’s words

Beauty they called her… mocking The hair beneath the visor was a squirrel’s nest of dirty straw and her face… Brienne’s eyes were large and very blue a young girl’s eyes trusting and guileless but the rest… her features were broad and coarse her teeth prominent and crooked her mouth too wide her lips so plump they seemed swollen A thousand freckles speckled her cheeks and brow and her nose had been broken more than once Pity filled Catelyn’s heart Is there any creature on earth as unfortunate as an ugly woman

And yet when Renly cut away her torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in its place Brienne of Tarth did not look unfortunate Her smile lit up her face and her voice was strong and proud as she said My life for yours Your Grace From this day on I am your shield I swear it by the old gods and the new The way she looked at the king—looked down at him she was a good hand higher though Renly was near as tall as his brother had been—was painful to see

Your Grace Ser Colen of Greenpools swung down off his horse to approach the gallery I beg your leave He went to one knee I have the honor to bring you the Lady Catelyn Stark sent as envoy by her son Robb Lord of Winterfell

Lord of Winterfell and King in the North ser Catelyn corrected him She dismounted and moved to Ser Colen’s side
