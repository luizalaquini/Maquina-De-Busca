And who are you old man One of Lord Beric’s cravens called the knight in the spiked helm If that fat fool Thoros is in there ask him how he likes these fires

Got no such man here Yoren shouted back Only some lads for the Watch Got no part o’ your war He hoisted up the staff so they could all see the color of his cloak Have a look That’s black for the Night’s Watch

Or black for House Dondarrion called the man who bore the enemy banner Arya could see its colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town a golden lion on red Lord Beric’s sigil is a purple lightning bolt on a black field

Suddenly Arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in Sansa’s face and gotten juice all over her stupid ivory silk gown There had been some southron lordling at the tourney her sister’s stupid friend Jeyne was in love with him He had a lightning bolt on his shield and her father had sent him out to behead the Hound’s brother It seemed a thousand years ago now something that had happened to a different person in a different life… to Arya Stark the Hand’s daughter not Arry the orphan boy How would Arry know lords and such

Are you blind man Yoren waved his staff back and forth making the cloak ripple You see a bloody lightning bolt

By night all banners look black the knight in the spiked helm observed Open or we’ll know you for outlaws in league with the king’s enemies

Yoren spat Who’s got your command

I do The reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse as the others parted to let him pass He was a stout man with a manticore on his shield and ornate scrollwork crawling across his steel breastplate Through the open visor of his helm a face pale and piggy peered up Ser Amory Lorch bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock the Hand of the King The true king Joffrey He had a high thin voice In his name I command you to open these gates

All around them the town burned The night air was full of smoke and the drifting red embers outnumbered the stars Yoren scowled Don’t see the need Do what you want to the town it’s naught to me but leave us be We’re no foes to you

Look with your eyes Arya wanted to shout at the men below Can’t they see we’re no lords or knights she whispered

I don’t think they care Arry Gendry whispered back

And she looked at Ser Amory’s face the way Syrio had taught her to look and she saw that he was right

If you are no traitors open your gates Ser Amory called We’ll make certain you’re telling it true and be on our way

Yoren was chewing sourleaf Told you no one here but us You got my word on that

The knight in the spiked helm laughed The crow gives us his word

You lost old man mocked one of the spearmen The Wall’s a long way north o’ here

I command you once more in King Joffrey’s name to prove the loyalty you profess and open these gates said Ser Amory

For a long moment Yoren considered chewing Then he spat Don’t think I will

So be it You defy the king’s command and so proclaim yourselves rebels black cloaks or no

Got me young boys in here Yoren shouted down

Young boys and old men die the same Ser Amory raised a lanquid fist and a spear came hurtling from the fire-bright shadows behind Yoren must have been the target but it was Woth beside him who was hit The spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the back of his neck dark and wet Woth grabbed at the shaft and fell boneless from the walk

Storm the walls and kill them all Ser Amory said in a bored voice More spears flew Arya yanked down Hot Pie by the back of his tunic From outside came the rattle of armor the scrape of swords on scabbards the banging of spears on shields mingled with curses and the hoofbeats of racing horses A torch sailed spinning above their heads trailing fingers of fire as it thumped down in the dirt of the yard

Blades Yoren shouted Spread apart defend the wall wherever they hit Koss Urreg hold the postern Lommy pull that spear out of Woth and get up where he was

Hot Pie dropped his shortsword when he tried to unsheath it Arya shoved the blade back into his hand I don’t know how to swordfight he said white-eyed

It’s easy Arya said but the lie died in her throat as a hand grasped the top of the parapet She saw it by the light of the burning town so clear that it was as if time had stopped The fingers were blunt callused wiry black hairs grew between the knuckles there was dirt under the nail of the thumb Fear cuts deeper than swords she remembered as the top of a pothelm loomed up behind the hand

She slashed down hard and Needle’s castle-forged steel bit into the grasping fingers between the knuckles Winterfell she screamed Blood spurted fingers flew and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared Behind Hot Pie yelled Arya whirled The second man was bearded and helmetless his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing As he swung his leg over the parapet she drove her point at his eyes Needle never touched him he reeled backward and fell I hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue Watch them not me she screamed at Hot Pie The next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall the boy hacked at his hands with his swordshort until the man dropped away

Ser Amory had no ladders but the holdfast walls were rough-cut and unmortared easy to climb and there seemed to be no end to the foes For each one Arya cut or stabbed or shoved back another was coming over the wall The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart but Yoren tangled his black banner around his spike and forced the point of his dirk through his armor while the man was fighting the cloth Every time Arya looked up more torches were flying trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes She saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of Joffrey wishing he was here so she could drive Needle through his sneery face When four men assaulted the gate with axes Koss shot them down with arrows one by one Dobber wrestled a man off the walk and Lommy smashed his head with a rock before he could rise and hooted until he saw the knife in Dobber’s belly and realized he wouldn’t be getting up either Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon lying with his arm cut off She didn’t think she’d done it but she wasn’t sure She heard Qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked mace Everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss but after a time it seemed like that was only one smell She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall but when he did she fell on him with Gendry and Hot Pie Gendry’s sword shattered on the man’s helm tearing it off his head Underneath he was bald and scared-looking with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him shouting Winterfell Winterfell while Hot Pie screamed Hot Pie beside her as he hacked at the man’s scrawny neck
