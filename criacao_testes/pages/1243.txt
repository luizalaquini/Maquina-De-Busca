I am not afraid of his guards I am as good as any of them I should never have fled

Is that what troubles you that some fool might call you craven She sighed Renly’s death was no fault of youts You served him valiantly but when you seek to follow him into the earth you serve no one She stretched out a hand to give what comfort a touch could give I know how hard it is—

Brienne shook off her hand No one knows

You’re wrong Catelyn said sharply Every morning when I wake I remember that Ned is gone I have no skill with swords but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to King’s Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister’s white throat and squeezing until her face turns black

The Beauty raised her eyes the only part of her that was truly beautiful If you dream that why would you seek to hold me back Is it because of what Stannis said at the parley

Was it Catelyn glanced across the camp Two men were walking sentry spears in hand I was taught that good men must fight evil in this world and Renly’s death was evil beyond all doubt Yet I was also taught that the gods make kings not the swords of men If Stannis is our rightful king—

He’s not Robert was never the rightful king either even Renly said as much Jaime Lannister murdered the rightful king after Robert killed his lawful heir on the Trident Where were the gods then The gods don’t care about men no more than kings care about peasants

A good king does care

Lord Renly… His Grace he… he would have been the best king my lady he was so good he…

He is gone Brienne she said as gently as she could Stannis and Joffrey remain… and so does my son

He wouldn’t… you’d never make a peace with Stannis would you Bend the knee You wouldn’t…

I will tell you true Brienne I do not know My son may be a king but I am no queen… only a mother who would keep her children safe however she could

I am not made to be a mother I need to fight

Then fight… but for the living not the dead Renly’s enemies are Robb’s enemies as well

Brienne stared at the ground and shuffled her feet I do not know your son my lady She looked up I could serve you If you would have me

Catelyn was startled Why me

The question seemed to trouble Brienne You helped me In the pavilion… when they thought that I had… that I had…

You were innocent

Even so you did not have to do that You could have let them kill me I was nothing to you

Perhaps I did not want to be the only one who knew the dark truth of what had happened there Catelyn thought Brienne I have taken many wellborn ladies into my service over the years but never one like you I am no battle commander

No but you have courage Not battle courage perhaps but… I don’t know… a kind of woman’s courage And I think when the time comes you will not try and hold me back Promise me that That you will not hold me back from Stannis

Catelyn could still hear Stannis saying that Robb’s turn too would come in time It was like a cold breath on the back of her neck When the time comes I will not hold you back

The tall girl knelt awkwardly unsheathed Renly’s longsword and laid it at her feet Then I am yours my lady Your liege man or… whatever you would have me be I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new

And I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and meat and mead at my table and pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you into dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise As she clasped the other woman’s hands between her own Catelyn could not help but smile How many times did I watch Ned accept a man’s oath of service She wondered what he would think if he could see her now

They forded the Red Fork late the next day upstream of Riverrun where the river made a wide loop and the waters grew muddy and shallow The crossing was guarded by a mixed force of archers and pikemen wearing the eagle badge of the Mallisters When they saw Catelyn’s banners they emerged from behind their sharpened stakes and sent a man over from the far bank to lead her party across Slow and careful like milady he warned as he took the bridle of her horse We’ve planted iron spikes under the water y’see and there’s caltrops scattered among them rocks there It’s the same on all the fords by your brother’s command

Edmure thinks to fight here The realization gave her a queasy feeling in the bowels but she held her tongue

Between the Red Fork and the Tumblestone they joined a stream of smallfolk making for the safety of Riverrun Some were driving animals before them others pulling wayns but they made way as Catelyn rode past and cheered her with cries of Tully or Stark Half a mile from the castle she passed through a large encampment where the scarlet banner of the Blackwoods waved above the lord’s tent Lucas took his leave of her there to seek out his father Lord Tytos The rest rode on

Catelyn spied a second camp strung out along the bank north of the Tumblestone familiar standards flapping in the wind—Marq Piper’s dancing maiden Darry’s plowman the twining red-and-white snakes of the Paeges They were all her father’s bannermen lords of the Trident Most had left Riverrun before she had to defend their own lands If they were here again it could only mean that Edmure had called them back Gods save us it’s true he means to offer battle to Lord Tywin

Something dark was dangling against the walls of Riverrun Catelyn saw from a distance When she rode close she saw dead men hanging from the battlements slumped at the ends of long ropes with hempen nooses tight around their necks their faces swollen and black The crows had been at them but their crimson cloaks still showed bright against the sandstone walls

They have hanged some Lannisters Hal Mollen observed

A pretty sight Ser Wendel Manderly said cheerfully

Our friends have begun without us Perwyn Frey jested The others laughed all but Brienne who gazed up at the row of bodies unblinking and neither spoke nor smiled

If they have slain the Kingslayer then my daughters are dead as well Catelyn spurred her horse to a canter Hal Mollen and Robin Flint raced past at a gallop halooing to the gatehouse The guards on the walls had doubtless spied her banners some time ago for the portcullis was up as they approached

Edmure rode out from the castle to meet her surrounded by three of her father’s sworn men—great-bellied Ser Desmond Grell the master-at-arms Utherydes Wayn the steward and Ser Robin Ryger Riverrun’s big bald captain of guards They were all three of an age with Lord Hoster men who had spent their lives in her father’s service Old men Catelyn realized

Edmure wore a blue-and-red cloak over a tunic embroidered with silver fish From the look of him he had not shaved since she rode south his beard was a fiery bush Cat it is good to have you safely back When we heard of Renly’s death we feared for your life And Lord Tywin is on the march as well

So I am told How fares our father

One day he seems stronger the next… He shook his head He’s asked for you I did not know what to tell him

I will go to him soon she vowed Has there been word from Storm’s End since Renly died Or from Bitterbridge No ravens came to men on the road and Catelyn was anxious to know what had happened behind her

Nothing from Bitterbridge From Storm’s End three birds from the castellan Ser Cortnay Penrose all carrying the same plea Stannis has him surrounded by land and sea He offers his allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege He fears for the boy he says What boy would that be do you know

Edric Storm Brienne told them Robert’s bastard son

Edmure looked at her curiously Stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free unharmed provided they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his hands but Ser Cortnay will not consent

He risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even his own Catelyn thought Did you send him an answer

Edmure shook his head Why when we have neither help nor hope to offer And Stannis is no enemy of ours

Ser Robin Ryger spoke My lady can you tell us the manner of Lord Renly’s death The tales we’ve heard have been queer

Cat her brother said some say you killed Renly Others claim it was some southron woman His glance lingered on Brienne

My king was murdered the girl said quietly and not by Lady Catelyn I swear it on my sword by the gods old and new

This is Brienne of Tarth the daughter of Lord Selwyn the Evenstar who served in Renly’s Rainbow Guard Catelyn told them Brienne I am honored to acquaint you with my brother Ser Edmure Tully heir to Riverrun His steward Utherydes Wayn Ser Robin Ryger and Ser Desmond Grell

Honored said Ser Desmond The others echoed him The girl flushed embarrassed even at this commonplace courtesy If Edmure thought her a curious sort of lady at least he had the grace not to say so

Brienne was with Renly when he was killed as was I said Catelyn but we had no part in his death She did not care to speak of the shadow here in the open with men all around so she waved a hand at the bodies Who are these men you’ve hanged

Edmure glanced up uncomfortably They came with Ser Cleos when he brought the queen’s answer to our peace offer
