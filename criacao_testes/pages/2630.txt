the city certain sons of Belial beset the house round about and
beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man
saying Bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may
know him

1923 And the man the master of the house went out unto them and
said unto them Nay my brethren nay I pray you do not so wickedly
seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly

1924 Behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them I
will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth
good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing

1925 But the men would not hearken to him so the man took his
concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and
abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to
spring they let her go

1926 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at
the door of the mans house where her lord was till it was light

1927 And her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the
house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were
upon the threshold

1928 And he said unto her Up and let us be going But none
answered

Then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him
unto his place

1929 And when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid
hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into
twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of Israel

1930 And it was so that all that saw it said There was no such deed
done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of
the land of Egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and
speak your minds

201 Then all the children of Israel went out and the congregation
was gathered together as one man from Dan even to Beersheba with the
land of Gilead unto the LORD in Mizpeh

202 And the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of
Israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God
four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword

203 Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
were gone up to Mizpeh Then said the children of Israel Tell us
how was this wickedness  204 And the Levite the husband of the
woman that was slain answered and said I came into Gibeah that
belongeth to Benjamin I and my concubine to lodge

205 And the men of Gibeah rose against me and beset the house round
about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine
have they forced that she is dead

206 And I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her
throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel for they have
committed lewdness and folly in Israel

207 Behold ye are all children of Israel give here your advice and
counsel

208 And all the people arose as one man saying We will not any of
us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house

209 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah we
will go up by lot against it 2010 And we will take ten men of an
hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel and an hundred of a
thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the
people that they may do when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin
according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel

2011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city knit
together as one man

2012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
Benjamin saying What wickedness is this that is done among you
2013 Now therefore deliver us the men the children of Belial which
are in Gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from
Israel But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of
their brethren the children of Israel

2014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of
the cities unto Gibeah to go out to battle against the children of
Israel

2015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the
inhabitants of Gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men

2016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not
miss

2017 And the men of Israel beside Benjamin were numbered four
hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war
