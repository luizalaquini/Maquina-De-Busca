Still Slynt said I will not have it said that Janos Slynt hanged a man unjustly I will not I have decided to give you one last chance to prove you are as loyal as you claim Lord Snow One last chance to do your duty yes He stood Mance Rayder wants to parley with us He knows he has no chance now that Janos Slynt has come so he wants to talk this King-beyond-the-Wall But the man is craven and will not come to us No doubt he knows I’d hang him Hang him by his feet from the top of the Wall on a rope two hundred feet long But he will not come He asks that we send an envoy to him

We’re sending you Lord Snow Ser Alliser smiled

Me Jon’s voice was flat Why me

You rode with these wildlings said Thorne Mance Rayder knows you He will be more inclined to trust you

That was so wrong Jon might have laughed You’ve got it backward Mance suspected me from the first If I show up in his camp wearing a black cloak again and speaking for the Night’s Watch he’ll know that I betrayed him

He asked for an envoy we are sending one said Slynt If you are too craven to face this turncloak king we can return you to your ice cell This time without the furs I think Yes

No need for that my lord said Ser Alliser Lord Snow will do as we ask He wants to show us that he is no turncloak He wants to prove himself a loyal man of the Night’s Watch

Thorne was much the more clever of the two Jon realized this had his stink all over it He was trapped I’ll go he said in a clipped curt voice

M’lord Janos Slynt reminded him You’ll address me—

I’ll go my lord But you are making a mistake my lord You are sending the wrong man my lord Just the sight of me is going to anger Mance My lord would have a better chance of reaching terms if he sent—

Terms Ser Alliser chuckled

Janos Slynt does not make terms with lawless savages Lord Snow No he does not

We’re not sending you to talk with Mance Rayder Ser Alliser said We’re sending you to kill him

The wind whistled through the bars and Jon Snow shivered His leg was throbbing and his head He was not fit to kill a kitten yet here he was The trap had teeth With Maester Aemon insisting on Jon’s innocence Lord Janos had not dared to leave him in the ice to die This was better Our honor means no more than our lives so long as the realm is safe Qhorin Halfhand had said in the Frostfangs He must remember that Whether he slew Mance or only tried and failed the free folk would kill him Even desertion was impossible if he’d been so inclined to Mance he was a proven liar and betrayer

When the cage jerked to a halt Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw’s hilt to loosen the bastard blade in its scabbard The gate was a few yards to his left still blocked by the splintered ruins of the turtle the carcass of a mammoth ripening within There were other corpses too strewn amidst broken barrels hardened pitch and patches of burnt grass all shadowed by the Wall Jon had no wish to linger here He started walking toward the wildling camp past the body of a dead giant whose head had been crushed by a stone A raven was pulling out bits of brain from the giant’s shattered skull It looked up as he walked by Snow it screamed at him Snow snow Then it opened its wings and flew away

No sooner had he started out than a lone rider emerged from the wildling camp and came toward him He wondered if Mance was coming out to parley in no-man’s-land That might make it easier though nothing will make it easy But as the distance between them diminished Jon saw that the horseman was short and broad with gold rings glinting on thick arms and a white beard spreading out across his massive chest

Har Tormund boomed when they came together Jon Snow the crow I feared we’d seen the last o’ you

I never knew you feared anything Tormund

That made the wildling grin Well said lad I see your cloak is black Mance won’t like that If you’ve come to change sides again best climb back on that Wall o’ yours

They’ve sent me to treat with the King-beyond-the-Wall

Treat Tormund laughed Now there’s a word Har Mance wants to talk that’s true enough Can’t say he’d want to talk with you though

I’m the one they’ve sent

I see that Best come along then You want to ride

I can walk

You fought us hard here Tormund turned his garron back toward the wildling camp You and your brothers I give you that Two hundred dead and a dozen giants Mag himself went in that gate o’ yours and never did come out

He died on the sword of a brave man named Donal Noye

Aye Some great lord was he this Donal Noye One of your shiny knights in their steel smallclothes
