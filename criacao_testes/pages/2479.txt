3215 And Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two
tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on
both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written

3216 And the tables were the work of God and the writing was the
writing of God graven upon the tables

3217 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted
he said unto Moses There is a noise of war in the camp

3218 And he said It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the
noise of them that sing do I hear

3219 And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that
he saw the calf and the dancing and Moses anger waxed hot and he
cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount

3220 And he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the
fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made
the children of Israel drink of it

3221 And Moses said unto Aaron What did this people unto thee that
thou hast brought so great a sin upon them  3222 And Aaron said Let
not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they
are set on mischief

3223 For they said unto me Make us gods which shall go before us
for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of
Egypt we wot not what is become of him

3224 And I said unto them Whosoever hath any gold let them break it
off So they gave it me then I cast it into the fire and there came
out this calf

3225 And when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had
made them naked unto their shame among their enemies 3226 Then
Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said Who is on the LORDs
side let him come unto me And all the sons of Levi gathered
themselves together unto him

3227 And he said unto them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Put
every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his
companion and every man his neighbour

3228 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men

3229 For Moses had said Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD
even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow
upon you a blessing this day

3230 And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the
people Ye have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the
LORD peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin

3231 And Moses returned unto the LORD and said Oh this people have
sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold

3232 Yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin-- and if not blot me
I pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written

3233 And the LORD said unto Moses Whosoever hath sinned against me
him will I blot out of my book

3234 Therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which I have
spoken unto thee behold mine Angel shall go before thee
nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them

3235 And the LORD plagued the people because they made the calf
which Aaron made

331 And the LORD said unto Moses Depart and go up hence thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt unto
the land which I sware unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying
Unto thy seed will I give it 332 And I will send an angel before
thee and I will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite and the
Hittite and the Perizzite the Hivite and the Jebusite 333 Unto a
land flowing with milk and honey for I will not go up in the midst of
thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest I consume thee in the
way

334 And when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and
no man did put on him his ornaments

335 For the LORD had said unto Moses Say unto the children of
Israel Ye are a stiffnecked people I will come up into the midst of
thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy
ornaments from thee that I may know what to do unto thee

336 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount Horeb

337 And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp
afar off from the camp and called it the Tabernacle of the
congregation And it came to pass that every one which sought the
LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was
without the camp
