Jarl laughed and even Harma Dogshead smirked Is that the way of it Jon Snow asked Mance Rayder mildly Her and you

It was easy to lose your way beyond the Wall Jon did not know that he could tell honor from shame anymore or right from wrong Father forgive me Yes he said

Mance nodded Good You’ll go with Jarl and Styr on the morrow then Both of you Far be it from me to separate two hearts that beat as one

Go where said Jon

Over the Wall It’s past time you proved your faith with something more than words Jon Snow

The Magnar was not pleased What do I want with a crow

He knows the Watch and he knows the Wall said Mance and he knows Castle Black better than any raider ever could You’ll find a use for him or you’re a fool

Styr scowled His heart may still be black

Then cut it out Mance turned to Rattleshirt My Lord of Bones keep the column moving at all costs If we reach the Wall before Mormont we’ve won

They’ll move Rattleshirt’s voice was thick and angry

Mance nodded and walked away Harma and Sixskins beside him

Varamyr’s wolves and shadowcat followed behind Jon and Ygritte were left with Jarl Rattleshirt and the Magnar The two older wildlings looked at Jon with ill-concealed rancor as Jarl said You heard we ride at daybreak Bring all the food you can there’ll be no time to hunt And have your face seen to crow You look a bloody mess

I will said Jon

You best not be lying girl Rattleshirt said to Ygritte his eyes shiny behind the giant’s skull

Jon drew Longclaw Get away from us unless you want what Qhorin got

You got no wolf to help you here boy Rattleshirt reached for his own sword

Sure o’ that are you Ygritte laughed

Atop the stones of the ringwall Ghost hunched with white fur bristling He made no sound but his dark red eyes spoke blood The Lord of Bones moved his hand slowly away from his sword backed off a step and left them with a curse

Ghost padded beside their garrons as Jon and Ygritte descended the Fist It was not until they were halfway across the Milkwater that Jon felt safe enough to say I never asked you to lie for me

I never did she said I left out part is all

You said—

—that we fuck beneath your cloak many a night I never said when we started though The smile she gave him was almost shy Find another place for Ghost to sleep tonight Jon Snow It’s like Mance said Deeds is truer than words





Sansa


A new gown she said as wary as she was astonished

More lovely than any you have worn my lady the old woman promised She measured Sansa’s hips with a length of knotted string All silk and Myrish lace with satin linings You will be very beautiful The queen herself has commanded it
