If you think your whores want you in their bed you are an even greater fool than I suspected said Lord Tywin You disappoint me Tyrion I had hoped this match would please you

Yes we all know how important my pleasure is to you Father But there’s more to this The key to the north you say The Greyjoys hold the north now and King Balon has a daughter Why Sansa Stark and not her He looked into his father’s cool green eyes with their bright flecks of gold

Lord Tywin steepled his fingers beneath his chin Balon Greyjoy thinks in terms of plunder not rule Let him enjoy an autumn crown and suffer a northern winter He will give his subjects no cause to love him Come spring the northmen will have had a bellyful of krakens When you bring Eddard Stark’s grandson home to claim his birthright lords and little folk alike will rise as one to place him on the high seat of his ancestors You are capable of getting a woman with child I hope

I believe I am he said bristling I confess I cannot prove it Though no one can say I have not tried Why I plant my little seeds just as often as I can…

In the gutters and the ditches finished Lord Tywin and in common ground where only bastard weeds take root It is past time you kept your own garden He rose to his feet You shall never have Casterly Rock I promise you But wed Sansa Stark and it is just possible that you might win Winterfell

Tyrion Lannister Lord Protector of Winterfell The prospect gave him a queer chill Very good Father he said slowly but there’s a big ugly roach in your rushes Robb Stark is as capable as I am presumably and sworn to marry one of those fertile Freys And once the Young Wolf sires a litter any pups that Sansa births are heirs to nothing

Lord Tywin was unconcerned Robb Stark will father no children on his fertile Frey you have my word There is a bit of news I have not yet seen fit to share with the council though no doubt the good lords will hear it soon enough The Young Wolf has taken Gawen Westerling’s eldest daughter to wife

For a moment Tyrion could not believe he’d heard his father right He broke his sworn word he said incredulous He threw away the Freys for… Words failed him

A maid of sixteen years named Jeyne said Ser Kevan Lord Gawen once suggested her to me for Willem or Martyn but I had to refuse him Gawen is a good man but his wife is Sybell Spicer He should never have wed her The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense Lady Sybell’s grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps And the grandmother was some woman he’d brought back from the east A frightening old crone supposed to be a priestess Maegi they called her No one could pronounce her real name Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the like He shrugged She’s long dead to be sure And Jeyne seemed a sweet child I’ll grant you though I only saw her once But with such doubtful blood…

Having once married a whore Tyrion could not entirely share his uncle’s horror at the thought of wedding a girl whose great grandfather sold cloves Even so… A sweet child Ser Kevan had said but many a poison was sweet as well The Westerlings were old blood but they had more pride than power It would not surprise him to learn that Lady Sybell had brought more wealth to the marriage than her highborn husband The Westerling mines had failed years ago their best lands had been sold off or lost and the Crag was more ruin than stronghold A romantic ruin though jutting up so brave above the sea I am surprised Tyrion had to confess I thought Robb Stark had better sense

He is a boy of sixteen said Lord Tywin At that age sense weighs for little against lust and love and honor

He forswore himself shamed an ally betrayed a solemn promise Where is the honor in that

Ser Kevan answered He chose the girl’s honor over his own Once he had deflowered her he had no other course

It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly said Tyrion bluntly The Westerlings stood to lose everything here their lands their castle their very lives A Lannister always pays his debts

Jeyne Westerling is her mother’s daughter said Lord Tywin and Robb Stark is his father’s son

This Westerling betrayal did not seem to have enraged his father as much as Tyrion would have expected Lord Tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals He had extinguished the proud Reynes of Castamere and the ancient Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall root and branch when he was still half a boy The singers had even made a rather gloomy song of it Some years later when Lord Farman of Faircastle grew truculent Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter But once he’d heard The Rains of Castamere echoing through his hall Lord Farman gave no further trouble And if the song were not enough the shattered castles of the Reynes and Tarbecks still stood as mute testimony to the fate that awaited those who chose to scorn the power of Casterly Rock The Crag is not so far from Tarbeck Hall and Castamere Tyrion pointed out You’d think the Westerlings might have ridden past and seen the lesson there

Mayhaps they have Lord Tywin said They are well aware of Castamere I promise you

Could the Westerlings and Spicers be such great fools as to believe the wolf can defeat the lion

Every once in a very long while Lord Tywin Lannister would actually threaten to smile he never did but the threat alone was terrible to behold The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them he said and then You will marry Sansa Stark Tyrion And soon





Catelyn


They carried the corpses in upon their shoulders and laid them beneath the dais A silence fell across the torchlit hall and in the quiet Catelyn could hear Grey Wind howling half a castle away He smells the blood she thought through stone walls and wooden doors through night and rain he still knows the scent of death and ruin

She stood at Robb’s left hand beside the high seat and for a moment felt almost as if she were looking down at her own dead at Bran and Rickon These boys had been much older but death had shrunken them Naked and wet they seemed such little things so still it was hard to remember them living

The blond boy had been trying to grow a beard Pale yellow peach fuzz covered his cheeks and jaw above the red ruin the knife had made of his throat His long golden hair was still wet as if he had been pulled from a bath By the look of him he had died peacefully perhaps in sleep but his brown-haired cousin had fought for life His arms bore slashes where he’d tried to block the blades and red still trickled slowly from the stab wounds that covered his chest and belly and back like so many tongueless mouths though the rain had washed him almost clean

Robb had donned his crown before coming to the hall and the bronze shone darkly in the torchlight Shadows hid his eyes as he looked upon the dead Does he see Bran and Rickon as well She might have wept but there were no tears left in her The dead boys were pale from long imprisonment and both had been fair against their smooth white skin the blood was shockingly red unbearable to look upon Will they lay Sansa down naked beneath the Iron Throne after they have killed her Will her skin seem as white her blood as red From outside came the steady wash of rain and the restless howling of a wolf

Her brother Edmure stood to Robb’s right one hand upon the back of his father’s seat his face still puffy from sleep They had woken him as they had her pounding on his door in the black of night to yank him rudely from his dreams Were they good dreams brother Do you dream of sunlight and laughter and a maiden’s kisses I pray you do Her own dreams were dark and laced with terrors
