from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof

502 Out of Zion the perfection of beauty God hath shined

503 Our God shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall
devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him

504 He shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that
he may judge his people

505 Gather my saints together unto me those that have made a
covenant with me by sacrifice

506 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness for God is judge
himself Selah

507 Hear O my people and I will speak O Israel and I will testify
against thee I am God even thy God

508 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
offerings to have been continually before me

509 I will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy
folds

5010 For every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a
thousand hills

5011 I know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of
the field are mine

5012 If I were hungry I would not tell thee for the world is mine
and the fulness thereof

5013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats

5014 Offer unto God thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most
High

5015 And call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me

5016 But unto the wicked God saith What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth

5017 Seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind
thee

5018 When thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and
hast been partaker with adulterers

5019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit

5020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest
thine own mothers son

5021 These things hast thou done and I kept silence thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such an one as thyself but I will reprove thee
and set them in order before thine eyes

5022 Now consider this ye that forget God lest I tear you in
pieces and there be none to deliver

5023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth
his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God



511 Have mercy upon me O God according to thy lovingkindness
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions

512 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin

513 For I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before
me

514 Against thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy
sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be
clear when thou judgest

515 Behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother
conceive me

516 Behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom

517 Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall
be whiter than snow

518 Make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice

519 Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities

5110 Create in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit
within me

5111 Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit
from me
