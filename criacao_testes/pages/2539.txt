1915 And every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is
unclean

1916 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be
unclean seven days

1917 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put
thereto in a vessel 1918 And a clean person shall take hyssop and
dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the
vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that
touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave 1919 And the
clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on
the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at
even

1920 But the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself
that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he
hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD the water of separation hath
not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean

1921 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that
sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that
toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even

1922 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even

201 Then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation
into the desert of Zin in the first month and the people abode in
Kadesh and Miriam died there and was buried there

202 And there was no water for the congregation and they gathered
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron

203 And the people chode with Moses and spake saying Would God
that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD  204 And why
have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness
that we and our cattle should die there  205 And wherefore have ye
made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place
it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates
neither is there any water to drink

206 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon
their faces and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them

207 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 208 Take the rod and
gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and
speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his
water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so
thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink

209 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD as he commanded him

2010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
the rock and he said unto them Hear now ye rebels must we fetch
you water out of this rock  2011 And Moses lifted up his hand and
with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out
abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also

2012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron Because ye believed me
not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore
ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given
them

2013 This is the water of Meribah because the children of Israel
strove with the LORD and he was sanctified in them

2014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom
Thus saith thy brother Israel Thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us 2015 How our fathers went down into Egypt and we have
dwelt in Egypt a long time and the Egyptians vexed us and our
fathers 2016 And when we cried unto the LORD he heard our voice
and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of Egypt and
behold we are in Kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border 2017
Let us pass I pray thee through thy country we will not pass
through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of
the water of the wells we will go by the kings high way we will not
turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy
borders

2018 And Edom said unto him Thou shalt not pass by me lest I come
out against thee with the sword

2019 And the children of Israel said unto him We will go by the high
way and if I and my cattle drink of thy water then I will pay for
it I will only without doing anything else go through on my feet

2020 And he said Thou shalt not go through And Edom came out
against him with much people and with a strong hand

2021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border
wherefore Israel turned away from him

2022 And the children of Israel even the whole congregation
journeyed from Kadesh and came unto mount Hor
