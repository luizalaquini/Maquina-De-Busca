Just so but why Other men were stronger faster younger why was Syrio Forel the best I will tell you now He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid The seeing the true seeing that is the heart of it

Hear me The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow to lands strange and wonderful and when they return their captains fetch queer animals to the Sealord’s menagerie Such animals as you have never seen striped horses great spotted things with necks as long as stilts hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows stinging manticores tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws Syrio Forel has seen these things

On the day I am speaking of the first sword was newly dead and the Sealord sent for me Many bravos had come to him and as many had been sent away none could say why When I came into his presence he was seated and in his lap was a fat yellow cat He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him from an island beyond the sunrise ‘Have you ever seen her like’ he asked of me

And to him I said ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him’ and the Sealord laughed and that day I was named the first sword

Arya screwed up her face I don’t understand

Syrio clicked his teeth together The cat was an ordinary cat no more The others expected a fabulous beast so that is what they saw How large it was they said It was no larger than any other cat only fat from indolence for the Sealord fed it from his own table What curious small ears they said Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights And it was plainly a tomcat yet the Sealord said ‘her’ and that is what the others saw Are you hearing

Arya thought about it You saw what was there

Just so Opening your eyes is all that is needing The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us but the eyes see true Look with your eyes Hear with your ears Taste with your mouth Smell with your nose Feel with your skin Then comes the thinking afterward and in that way knowing the truth

Just so said Arya grinning

Syrio Forel allowed himself a smile I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell of yours it will be time to put this needle in your hand

Yes Arya said eagerly Wait till I show Jon—

Behind her the great wooden doors of the Small Hall flew open with a resounding crash Arya whirled

A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him He was in full armor but his visor was up Arya remembered his droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when he had come to Winterfell with the king Ser Meryn Trant The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests Arya Stark the knight said come with us child

Arya chewed her lip uncertainly What do you want

Your father wants to see you

Arya took a step forward but Syrio Forel held her by the arm And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own I am wondering

Mind your place dancing master Ser Meryn said This is no concern of yours

My father wouldn’t send you Arya said She snatched up her stick sword The Lannisters laughed

Put down the stick girl Ser Meryn told her I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard the White Swords

So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king Arya said I don’t have to go with you if I don’t want

Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience Take her he said to his men He lowered the visor of his helm

Three of them started forward chainmail clinking softly with each step Arya was suddenly afraid Fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself to slow the racing of her heart

Syrio Forel stepped between them tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot You will be stopping there Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child

Out of the way old man one of the red cloaks said

Syrio’s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm I am Syrio Forel and you will now be speaking to me with more respect

Bald bastard The man yanked free his longsword The stick moved again blindingly fast Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor My hand the guardsman yelped cradling his broken fingers

You are quick for a dancing master said Ser Meryn
