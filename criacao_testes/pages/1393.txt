…a horror Davos retreated from her I want no part of you my lady Or your god May the Seven protect me

Melisandre sighed They did not protect Guncer Sunglass He prayed thrice each day and bore seven seven-pointed stars upon his shield but when R’hllor reached out his hand his prayers turned to screams and he burned Why cling to these false gods

I have worshiped them all my life

All your life Davos Seaworth As well say it was so yesterday She shook her head sadly You have never feared to speak the truth to kings why do you lie to yourself Open your eyes ser knight

What is it you would have me see

The way the world is made The truth is all around you plain to behold The night is dark and full of terrors the day bright and beautiful and full of hope One is black the other white There is ice and there is fire Hate and love Bitter and sweet Male and female Pain and pleasure Winter and summer Evil and good She took a step toward him Death and life Everywhere opposites Everywhere the war

The war asked Davos

The war she affirmed There are two Onion Knight Not seven not one not a hundred or a thousand Two Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne The war has been waged since time began and before it is done all men must choose where they will stand On one side is R’hllor the Lord of Light the Heart of Fire the God of Flame and Shadow Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken the Lord of Darkness the Soul of Ice the God of Night and Terror Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister between Greyjoy and Stark It is death we choose or life Darkness or light She clasped the bars of his cell with her slender white hands The great ruby at her throat seemed to pulse with its own radiance So tell me Ser Davos Seaworth and tell me truly—does your heart burn with the shining light of R’hllor Or is it black and cold and full of worms She reached through the bars and laid three fingers upon his breast as if to feel the truth of him through flesh and wool and leather

My heart Davos said slowly is full of doubts

Melisandre sighed Ahhhh Davos The good knight is honest to the last even in his day of darkness It is well you did not lie to me I would have known The Other’s servants oft hide black hearts in gaudy light so R’hllor gives his priests the power to see through falsehoods She stepped lightly away from the cell Why did you mean to kill me

I will tell you said Davos if you will tell me who betrayed me it could only have been Salladhor Saan and yet even now he prayed it was not so

The red woman laughed No one betrayed you onion knight I saw your purpose in my flames

The flames If you can see the future in these flames how is it that we burned upon the Blackwater You gave my sons to the fire… my sons my ship my men all burning…

Melisandre shook her head You wrong me onion knight Those were no fires of mine Had I been with you your battle would have had a different ending But His Grace was surrounded by unbelievers and his pride proved stronger than his faith His punishment was grievous but he has learned from his mistake

Were my sons no more than a lesson for a king then Davos felt his mouth tighten

It is night in your Seven Kingdoms now the red woman went on but soon the sun will rise again The war continues Davos Seaworth and some will soon learn that even an ember in the ashes can still ignite a great blaze The old maester looked at Stannis and saw only a man You see a king You are both wrong He is the Lord’s chosen the warrior of fire I have seen him leading the fight against the dark I have seen it in the flames The flames do not lie else you would not be here It is written in prophecy as well When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone The bleeding star has come and gone and Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn Her red eyes blazed like twin fires and seemed to stare deep into his soul You do not believe me You doubt the truth of R’hllor even now… yet have served him all the same and will serve him again I shall leave you here to think on all that I have told you And because R’hllor is the source of all good I shall leave the torch as well

With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts she was gone Only her scent lingered after That and the torch Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees The shifting torchlight washed over him Once Melisandre’s footsteps faded away the only sound was the scrabbling of rats Ice and fire he thought Black and white Dark and light Davos could not deny the power of her god He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre’s womb and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing She saw my purpose in her flames It was good to learn that Salla had not sold him but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again He did not like that either

He lifted his eyes to stare up at the torch He looked for a long time never blinking watching the flames shift and shimmer He tried to see beyond them to peer through the fiery curtain and glimpse whatever lived back there… but there was nothing only fire and after a time his eyes began to water

God-blind and tired Davos curled up on the straw and gave himself to sleep

Three days later—well Porridge had come thrice and Lamprey twice—Davos heard voices outside his cell He sat up at once his back to the stone wall listening to the sounds of struggle This was new a change in his unchanging world The noise was coming from the left where the steps led up to daylight He could hear a man’s voice pleading and shouting

…Madness the man was saying as he came into view dragged along between two guardsmen with fiery hearts on their breasts Porridge went before them jangling a ring of keys and Ser Axell Florent walked behind Axell the prisoner said desperately for the love you bear me unhand me You cannot do this I’m no traitor He was an older man tall and slender with silvery grey hair a pointed beard and a long elegant face twisted in fear Where is Selyse where is the queen I demand to see her The Others take you all Release me

The guards paid no mind to his outcries Here Porridge asked in front of the cell Davos got to his feet For an instant he considered trying to rush them when the door was opened but that was madness There were too many the guards wore swords and Porridge was strong as a bull

Ser Axell gave the gaoler a curt nod Let the traitors enjoy each other’s company

I am no traitor screeched the prisoner as Porridge was unlocking the door Though he was plainly dressed in grey wool doublet and black breeches his speech marked him as highborn His birth will not serve him here thought Davos

Porridge swung the bars wide Ser Axell gave a nod and the guards flung their charge in headlong The man stumbled and might have fallen but Davos caught him At once he wrenched away and staggered back toward the door only to have it slammed in his pale pampered face No he shouted Nooooo All the strength suddenly left his legs and he slid slowly to the floor clutching at the iron bars Ser Axell Porridge and the guards had already turned to leave You cannot do this the prisoner shouted at their retreating backs I am the King’s Hand

It was then that Davos knew him You are Alester Florent

The man turned his head Who…

Ser Davos Seaworth

Lord Alester blinked Seaworth… the onion knight You tried to murder Melisandre

Davos did not deny it At Storm’s End you wore red-gold armor with inlaid lapis flowers on your breastplate He reached down a hand to help the other man to his feet

Lord Alester brushed the filthy straw from his clothing I… I must apologize for my appearance ser My chests were lost when the Lannisters overran our camp I escaped with no more than the mail on my back and the rings on my fingers

He still wears those rings noted Davos who had lacked even all of his fingers

No doubt some cook’s boy or groom is prancing around King’s Landing just now in my slashed velvet doublet and jeweled cloak Lord Alester went on oblivious But war has its horrors as all men know No doubt you suffered your own losses

My ship said Davos All my men Four of my sons

May the… may the Lord of Light lead them through the darkness to a better world the other man said

May the Father judge them justly and the Mother grant them mercy Davos thought but he kept his prayer to himself The Seven had no place on Dragonstone now

My own son is safe at Brightwater the lord went on but I lost a nephew on the Fury Ser Imry my brother Ryam’s son

It had been Ser Imry Florent who led them blindly up the Blackwater Rush with all oars pulling paying no heed to the small stone towers at the mouth of the river Davos was not like to forget him My son Maric was your nephew’s oarmaster He remembered his last sight of Fury engulfed in wildfire Has there been any word of survivors

The Fury burned and sank with all hands his lordship said Your son and my nephew were lost with countless other good men The war itself was lost that day ser

This man is defeated Davos remembered Melisandre’s talk of embers in the ashes igniting great blazes Small wonder he ended here His Grace will never yield my lord

Folly that’s folly Lord Alester sat on the floor again as if the effort of standing for a moment had been too much for him Stannis Baratheon will never sit the Iron Throne Is it treason to say the truth A bitter truth but no less true for that His fleet is gone save for the Lyseni and Salladhor Saan will flee at the first sight of a Lannister sail Most of the lords who supported Stannis have gone over to Joffrey or died…

Even the lords of the narrow sea The lords sworn to Dragonstone

Lord Alester waved his hand feebly Lord Celtigar was captured and bent the knee Monford Velaryon died with his ship the red woman burned Sunglass and Lord Bar Emmon is fifteen fat and feeble Those are your lords of the narrow sea Only the strength of House Florent is left to Stannis against all the might of Highgarden Sunspear and Casterly Rock and now most of the storm lords as well The best hope that remains is to try and salvage something with a peace That is all I meant to do Gods be good how can they call it treason

Davos stood frowning My lord what did you do

Not treason Never treason I love His Grace as much as any man My own niece is his queen and I remained loyal to him when wiser men fled I am his Hand the Hand of the King how can I be a traitor I only meant to save our lives and… honor… yes He licked his lips I penned a letter Salladhor Saan swore that he had a man who could get it to King’s Landing to Lord Tywin His lordship is a… a man of reason and my terms… the terms were fair… more than fair

What terms were these my lord

It is filthy here Lord Alester said suddenly And that odor… what is that odor

The pail said Davos gesturing We have no privy here What terms

His lordship stared at the pail in horror That Lord Stannis give up his claim to the Iron Throne and retract all he said of Joffrey’s bastardy on the condition that he be accepted back into the king’s peace and confirmed as Lord of Dragonstone and Storm’s End I vowed to do the same for the return of Brightwater Keep and all our lands I thought… Lord Tywin would see the sense in my proposal He still has the Starks to deal with and the ironmen as well I offered to seal the bargain by wedding Shireen to Joffrey’s brother Tommen He shook his head The terms… they are as good as we are ever like to get Even you can see that surely

Yes said Davos even me Unless Stannis should father a son such a marriage would mean that Dragonstone and Storm’s End would one day pass to Tommen which would doubtless please Lord Tywin Meanwhile the Lannisters would have Shireen as hostage to make certain Stannis raised no new rebellions And what did His Grace say when you proposed these terms to him
