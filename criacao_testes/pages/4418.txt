The boy is weak and sickly Lord Stannis objected Even his father saw how it was when he asked me to foster him on Dragonstone Service as a page might have done him good but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie She’ll never part with the boy I promise you that

Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie the maester urged Dragonstone is a grim home for a child Let her fool go with her so she will have a familiar face about her

Familiar and hideous Stannis furrowed his brow in thought Still    perhaps it is worth the trying   

Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers a woman’s voice asked sharply

Maester Cressen turned and bowed his head My lady he said chagrined that he had not heard her enter

Lord Stannis scowled I do not beg Of anyone Mind you remember that woman

I am pleased to hear it my lord Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband thin of body and thin of face with prominent ears a sharp nose and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly yet it never failed to return Her eyes were pale her mouth stern her voice a whip She cracked it now Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance as do the Starks your brother Renly and all the rest You are their one true king It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god

God she said not gods The red woman had won her heart and soul turning her from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms both old and new to worship the one they called the Lord of Light

Your god can keep his grace said Lord Stannis who did not share his wife’s fervent new faith It’s swords I need not blessings Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you’ve not told me of There was no affection in his tone Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women even his own wife When he had gone to King’s Landing to sit on Robert’s council he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter His letters had been few his visits fewer he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year but took no joy in it and the sons he had once hoped for had never come

My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies she told him House Florent will rally to your banner

House Florent can field two thousand swords at best It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I do my lady The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell’s wrath

There is another way Lady Selyse moved closer Look out your windows my lord There is the sign you have waited for blazoned on the sky Red it is the red of flame red for the fiery heart of the true god It is his banner—and yours See how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragon’s hot breath and you the Lord of Dragonstone It means your time has come Your Grace Nothing is more certain You are meant to sail from this desolate rock as Aegon the Conqueror once sailed to sweep all before you as he did Only say the word and embrace the power of the Lord of Light

How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand Stannis demanded again

All you need his wife promised The swords of Storm’s End and Highgarden for a start and all their lords bannermen

Davos would tell you different Stannis said Those swords are sworn to Renly They love my charming young brother as they once loved Robert    and as they have never loved me

Yes she answered but if Renly should die   

Stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes until Cressen could not hold his tongue It is not to be thought Your Grace whatever follies Renly has committed—

Follies I call them treasons Stannis turned back to his wife My brother is young and strong and he has a vast host around him and these rainbow knights of his

Melisandre has gazed into the flames and seen him dead

Cressen was horrorstruck Fratricide    my lord this is evil unthinkable    please listen to me

Lady Selyse gave him a measured look And what will you tell him Maester How he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn

I have heard your counsel Cressen Lord Stannis said Now I will hear hers You are dismissed

Maester Cressen bent a stiff knee He could feel Lady Selyse’s eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly across the room By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect Help me he said to Pylos

When he was safe back in his own rooms Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his balcony once more to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea One of Salladhor Saan’s warships was sweeping past the castle her gaily striped hull slicing through the grey-green waters as her oars rose and fell He watched until she vanished behind a headland Would that my fears could vanish so easily Had he lived so long for this

When a maester donned his collar he put aside the hope of children yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless Robert Stannis Renly    three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other He could not allow it would not allow it

The woman was the heart of it Not the Lady Selyse the other one The red woman the servants had named her afraid to speak her name I will speak her name Cressen told his stone hellhound Melisandre Her Melisandre of Asshai sorceress shadowbinder and priestess to R’hllor the Lord of Light the Heart of Fire the God of Flame and Shadow Melisandre whose madness must not be allowed to spread beyond Dragonstone

His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning With fumbling hands the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair where his ointments potions and medicines stood neatly on their shelves On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass no larger than his little finger It rattled when he shook it Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table Collapsing into his chair he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial’s contents A dozen crystals no larger than seeds rattled across the parchment he’d been reading They shone like jewels in the candlelight so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before

The chain around his throat felt very heavy He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea half a world away The leaves had to be aged and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles Afterward they could be discarded but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize The process was slow and difficult the necessaries costly and hard to acquire The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it though and the Faceless Men of Braavos    and the maesters of his order as well though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the Citadel All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of healing—but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill

Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshai’i gave the leaf or the Lysene poisoners the crystal In the Citadel it was simply called the strangler Dissolved in wine it would make the muscles of a man’s throat clench tighter than any fist shutting off his windpipe They said a victim’s face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food

And this very night Lord Stannis would feast his bannermen his lady wife    and the red woman Melisandre of Asshai

I must rest Maester Cressen told himself I must have all my strength come dark My hands must not shake nor my courage flag It is a dreadful thing I do yet it must be done If there are gods surely they will forgive me He had slept so poorly of late A nap would refresh him for the ordeal ahead Wearily he tottered off to his bed Yet when he closed his eyes he could still see the light of the comet red and fiery and vividly alive amidst the darkness of his dreams Perhaps it is my comet he thought drowsily at the last just before sleep took him An omen of blood foretelling murder    yes   

When he woke it was full dark his bedchamber was black and every joint in his body ached Cressen pushed himself up his head throbbing Clutching for his cane he rose unsteady to his feet So late he thought They did not summon me He was always summoned for feasts seated near the salt close to Lord Stannis His lord’s face swam up before him not the man he was but the boy he had been standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on his elder brother Whatever he did Robert had done first and better Poor boy    he must hurry for his sake

The maester found the crystals where he had left them and scooped them off the parchment Cressen owned no hollow rings such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe He secreted the strangler seeds in one of them threw open his door and called Pylos Where are you When he heard no reply he called again louder Pylos I need help Still there came no answer That was queer the young maester had his cell only a half turn down the stair within easy earshot

In the end Cressen had to shout for the servants Make haste he told them I have slept too long They will be feasting by now    drinking    I should have been woken What had happened to Maester Pylos Truly he did not understand

Again he had to cross the long gallery A night wind whispered through the great windows sharp with the smell of the sea Torches flickered along the walls of Dragonstone and in the camp beyond he could see hundreds of cookfires burning as if a field of stars had fallen to the earth Above the comet blazed red and malevolent I am too old and wise to fear such things the maester told himself

The doors to the Great Hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon He told the servants to leave him outside It would be better to enter alone he must not appear feeble Leaning heavily on his cane Cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway teeth A pair of guardsmen opened the heavy red doors before him unleashing a sudden blast of noise and light Cressen stepped down into the dragon’s maw

Over the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk he heard Patchface singing    dance my lord dance my lord to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells The same dreadful song he’d sung this morning The shadows come to stay my lord stay my lord stay my lord The lower tables were crowded with knights archers and sellsword captains tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak in their fish stew Here there was no loud laughter no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of other men’s feasts Lord Stannis did not permit such

Cressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king He had to step wide around Patchface Dancing his bells ringing the fool neither saw nor heard his approach As he hopped from one leg to the other Patchface lurched into Cressen knocking his cane out from under him They went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs while a sudden gale of laughter went up around them No doubt it was a comical sight

Patchface sprawled half on top of him motley fool’s face pressed close to his own He had lost his tin helm with its antlers and bells Under the sea you fall up he declared I know I know oh oh oh Giggling the fool rolled off bounded to his feet and did a little dance

Trying to make the best of it the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise but his hip was in such pain that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again He felt strong hands grasp him under the arms and lift him back to his feet Thank you ser he murmured turning to see which knight had come to his aid   

Maester said Lady Melisandre her deep voice flavored with the music of the Jade Sea You ought take more care As ever she wore red head to heel a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric beneath Around her throat was a red gold choker tighter than any maester’s chain ornamented with a single great ruby Her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men but a deep burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches Even her eyes were red    but her skin was smooth and white unblemished pale as cream Slender she was graceful taller than most knights with full breasts and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face Men’s eyes that once found her did not quickly look away not even a maester’s eyes Many called her beautiful She was not beautiful She was red and terrible and red

I    thank you my lady

A man your age must look to where he steps Melisandre said courteously The night is dark and full of terrors

He knew the phrase some prayer of her faith It makes no matter I have a faith of my own Only children fear the dark he told her Yet even as he said the words he heard Patchface take up his song again The shadows come to dance my lord dance my lord dance my lord

Now here is a riddle Melisandre said A clever fool and a foolish wise man Bending she picked up Patchface’s helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen’s head The cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket slid down over his ears A crown to match your chain Lord Maester she announced All around them men were laughing

Cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage She thought he was feeble and helpless but she would learn otherwise before the night was done Old he might be yet he was still a maester of the Citadel I need no crown but truth he told her removing the fool’s helm from his head

There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown Melisandre turned from him in a swirl of red silk and made her way back to the high table where King Stannis and his queen were seated Cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to Patchface and made to follow

Maester Pylos sat in his place

The old man could only stop and stare Maester Pylos he said at last You    you did not wake me

His Grace commanded me to let you rest Pylos had at least the grace to blush He told me you were not needed here
