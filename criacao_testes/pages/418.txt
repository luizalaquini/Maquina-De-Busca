Five more castles he built each larger and stronger than the last only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay driving great walls of water before them His lords pleaded with him to build inland his priests told him he must placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea even his smallfolk begged him to relent Durran would have none of it A seventh castle he raised most massive of all Some said the children of the forest helped him build it shaping the stones with magic others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder No matter how the tale was told the end was the same Though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it the seventh castle stood defiant and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there together until the end of their days

Gods do not forget and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea Yet Storm’s End endured through centuries and tens of centuries a castle like no other Its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high unbroken by arrow slit or postern everywhere rounded curving smooth its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter That wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest and near eighty on the seaward face a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble Within that mighty bulwark the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and wave Of towers there was but one a colossal drum tower windowless where it faced the sea so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord’s dwelling all in one crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm

My lady Hal Mollen called Two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath the castle and were coming toward them at a slow walk That will be King Stannis

No doubt Catelyn watched them come Stannis it must be yet that is not the Baratheon banner It was a bright yellow not the rich gold of Renly’s standards and the device it bore was red though she could not make out its shape

Renly would be last to arrive He had told her as much when she set out He did not propose to mount his horse until he saw his brother well on his way The first to arrive must wait on the other and Renly would do no waiting It is a sort of game kings play she told herself Well she was no king so she need not play it Catelyn was practiced at waiting

As he neared she saw that Stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the shape of flames His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz and a great square-cut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore Otherwise his dress was plain studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet worn boots breeches of brown roughspun The device on his sun-yellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire The crowned stag was there yes… shrunken and enclosed within the heart Even more curious was his standard bearer—a woman garbed all in reds face shadowed within the deep hood of her scarlet cloak A red priestess Catelyn thought wondering The sect was numerous and powerful in the Free Cities and the distant east but there were few in the Seven Kingdoms

Lady Stark Stannis Baratheon said with chill courtesy as he reined up He inclined his head balder than she remembered

Lord Stannis she returned

Beneath the tight-trimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard yet he did not hector her about titles For that she was duly grateful I had not thought to find you at Storm’s End

I had not thought to be here

His deepset eyes regarded her uncomfortably This was not a man made for easy courtesies I am sorry for your lord’s death he said though Eddard Stark was no friend to me

He was never your enemy my lord When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you prisoned in that castle starving it was Eddard Stark who broke the siege

At my brother’s command not for love of me Stannis answered Lord Eddard did his duty I will not deny it Did I ever do less I should have been Robert’s Hand

That was your brother’s will Ned never wanted it

Yet he took it That which should have been mine Still I give you my word you shall have justice for his murder

How they loved to promise heads these men who would be king Your brother promised me the same But if truth be told I would sooner have my daughters back and leave justice to the gods Cersei still holds my Sansa and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert’s death

If your children are found when I take the city they shall be sent to you Alive or dead his tone implied

And when shall that be Lord Stannis King’s Landing is close to your Dragonstone but I find you here instead

You are frank Lady Stark Very well I’ll answer you frankly To take the city I need the power of these southron lords I see across the field My brother has them I must needs take them from him

Men give their allegiance where they will my lord These lords swore fealty to Robert and House Baratheon If you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel—

I have no quarrel with Renly should he prove dutiful I am his elder and his king I want only what is mine by rights Renly owes me loyalty and obedience I mean to have it From him and from these other lords Stannis studied her face And what cause brings you to this field my lady Has House Stark cast its lot with my brother is that the way of it

This one will never bend she thought yet she must try nonetheless Too much was at stake My son reigns as King in the North by the will of our lords and people He bends the knee to no man but holds out the hand of friendship to all

Kings have no friends Stannis said bluntly only subjects and enemies

And brothers a cheerful voice called out behind her Catelyn glanced over her shoulder as Lord Renly’s palfrey picked her way through the stumps The younger Baratheon was splendid in his green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair The crown of golden roses girded his temples jade stag’s head rising over his forehead long black hair spilling out beneath jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck

Renly had chosen a woman to carry his banner as well though Brienne hid face and form behind plate armor that gave no hint of her sex Atop her twelve-foot lance the crowned stag pranced black-on-gold as the wind off the sea rippled the cloth

His brother’s greeting was curt Lord Renly

King Renly Can that truly be you Stannis
