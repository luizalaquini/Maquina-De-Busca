overthrow it and encourage thou him

1126 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
dead she mourned for her husband

1127 And when the mourning was past David sent and fetched her to
his house and she became his wife and bare him a son But the thing
that David had done displeased the LORD

121 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David And he came unto him and
said unto him There were two men in one city the one rich and the
other poor

122 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds 123 But the
poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought
and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his
children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and
lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter

124 And there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to
take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed
it for the man that was come to him

125 And Davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he
said to Nathan As the LORD liveth the man that hath done this thing
shall surely die 126 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold because
he did this thing and because he had no pity

127 And Nathan said to David Thou art the man Thus saith the LORD
God of Israel I anointed thee king over Israel and I delivered thee
out of the hand of Saul 128 And I gave thee thy masters house and
thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of Israel
and of Judah and if that had been too little I would moreover have
given unto thee such and such things

129 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD to do
evil in his sight thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of Ammon

1210 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house
because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
Hittite to be thy wife

1211 Thus saith the LORD Behold I will raise up evil against thee
out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes
and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in
the sight of this sun

1212 For thou didst it secretly but I will do this thing before all
Israel and before the sun

1213 And David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the LORD And
Nathan said unto David The LORD also hath put away thy sin thou
shalt not die

1214 Howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme the child also that is born unto
thee shall surely die

1215 And Nathan departed unto his house And the LORD struck the
child that Uriahs wife bare unto David and it was very sick

1216 David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted
and went in and lay all night upon the earth

1217 And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him
up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with
them

1218 And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died And
the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for
they said Behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him
and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself
if we tell him that the child is dead  1219 But when David saw that
his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead
therefore David said unto his servants Is the child dead And they
said He is dead

1220 Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed
himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the LORD
and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required
they set bread before him and he did eat

1221 Then said his servants unto him What thing is this that thou
hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive
but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread

1222 And he said While the child was yet alive I fasted and wept
for I said Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me that the
child may live  1223 But now he is dead wherefore should I fast
can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return
to me

1224 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife and went in unto her
and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name Solomon
and the LORD loved him

1225 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his
