Walk with me Varys said Tyrion They left through the king’s door behind the throne the eunuch’s slippers whisking lightly over the stone

Lord Baelish has the truth of it you know The queen will never permit you to send away her guard

She will You’ll see to that

A smile flickered across Varys’s plump lips Will I

Oh for a certainty You’ll tell her it is part of my scheme to free Jaime

Varys stroked a powdered cheek This would doubtless involve the four men your man Bronn searched for so diligently in all the low places of King’s Landing A thief a poisoner a mummer and a murderer

Put them in crimson cloaks and lion helms they’ll look no different from any other guardsmen I searched for some time for a ruse that might get them into Riverrun before I thought to hide them in plain sight They’ll ride in by the main gate flying Lannister banners and escorting Lord Eddard’s bones He smiled crookedly Four men alone would be watched vigilantly Four among a hundred can lose themselves So I must send the true guardsmen as well as the false    as you’ll tell my sister

And for the sake of her beloved brother she will consent despite her misgivings They made their way down a deserted colonnade Still the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy

I like her uneasy said Tyrion

Ser Cleos Frey left that very afternoon escorted by Vylarr and a hundred red-cloaked Lannister guardsmen The men Robb Stark had sent joined them at the King’s Gate for the long ride west

Tyrion found Timett dicing with his Burned Men in the barracks Come to my solar at midnight Timett gave him a hard one-eyed stare a curt nod He was not one for long speeches

That night he feasted with the Stone Crows and Moon Brothers in the Small Hall though he shunned the wine for once He wanted all his wits about him Shagga what moon is this

Shagga’s frown was a fierce thing Black I think

In the west they call that a traitor’s moon Try not to get too drunk tonight and see that your axe is sharp

A Stone Crow’s axe is always sharp and Shagga’s axes are sharpest of all Once I cut off a man’s head but he did not know it until he tried to brush his hair Then it fell off

Is that why you never brush yours The Stone Crows roared and stamped their feet Shagga hooting loudest of all

By midnight the castle was silent and dark Doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls spied them leaving the Tower of the Hand but no one raised a voice He was the Hand of the King and where he went was his own affair

The thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of Shagga’s boot Pieces went flying inward and Tyrion heard a woman’s gasp of fear Shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins Timett followed and then Tyrion stepping gingerly over the splinters The fire had burned down to a few glowing embers and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber When Timett ripped the heavy curtains off the bed the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes Please my lords she pleaded don’t hurt me She cringed away from Shagga flushed and fearful trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short

Go Tyrion told her It’s not you we want

Shagga wants this woman

Shagga wants every whore in this city of whores complained Timett son of Timett

Yes Shagga said unabashed Shagga would give her a strong child

If she wants a strong child she’ll know whom to seek Tyrion said Timett see her out    gently if you would

The Burned Man pulled the girl from the bed and half marched half dragged her across the chamber Shagga watched them go mournful as a puppy The girl stumbled over the shattered door and out into the hall helped along by a firm shove from Timett Above their heads the ravens were screeching

Tyrion dragged the soft blanket off the bed uncovering Grand Maester Pycelle beneath Tell me does the Citadel approve of you bedding the serving wenches Maester

The old man was as naked as the girl though he made a markedly less attractive sight For once his heavy-lidded eyes were open wide W-what is the meaning of this I am an old man your loyal servant   

Tyrion hoisted himself onto the bed So loyal that you sent only one of my letters to Doran Martell The other you gave to my sister

N-no squealed Pycelle No a falsehood I swear it it was not me Varys it was Varys the Spider I warned you—

Do all maesters lie so poorly I told Varys that I was giving Prince Doran my nephew Tommen to foster I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed Myrcella to Lord Robert of the Eyrie I told no one that I had offered Myrcella to the Dornish    that truth was only in the letter I entrusted to you

Pycelle clutched for a corner of the blanket Birds are lost messages stolen or sold    it was Varys there are things I might tell you of that eunuch that would chill your blood   

My lady prefers my blood hot

Make no mistake for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear he holds seven back And Littlefinger that one   

I know all about Lord Petyr He’s almost as untrustworthy as you Shagga cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats

Shagga hefted the huge double-bladed axe There are no goats Halfman

Make do

Roaring Shagga leapt forward Pycelle shrieked and wet the bed urine spraying in all directions as he tried to scramble back out of reach The wildling caught him by the end of his billowy white beard and hacked off three-quarters of it with a single slash of the axe

Timett do you suppose our friend will be more forthcoming without those whiskers to hide behind Tyrion used a bit of the sheet to wipe the piss off his boots

He will tell the truth soon Darkness pooled in the empty pit of Timett’s burned eye I can smell the stink of his fear

Shagga tossed a handful of hair down to the rushes and seized what beard was left Hold still Maester urged Tyrion When Shagga gets angry his hands shake

Shagga’s hands never shake the huge man said indignantly pressing the great crescent blade under Pycelle’s quivering chin and sawing through another tangle of beard

How long have you been spying for my sister Tyrion asked

Pycelle’s breathing was rapid and shallow All I did I did for House Lannister A sheen of sweat covered the broad dome of the old man’s brow and wisps of white hair clung to his wrinkled skin Always    for years    your lord father ask him I was ever his true servant    ’twas I who bid Aerys open his gates   

That took Tyrion by surprise He had been no more than an ugly boy at Casterly Rock when the city fell So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well

For the realm Once Rhaegar died the war was done Aerys was mad Viserys too young Prince Aegon a babe at the breast but the realm needed a king    I prayed it should be your good father but Robert was too strong and Lord Stark moved too swiftly   

How many have you betrayed I wonder Aerys Eddard Stark me    King Robert as well Lord Arryn Prince Rhaegar Where does it begin Pycelle He knew where it ended

The axe scratched at the apple of Pycelle’s throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under his jaw scraping away the last hairs You    were not here he gasped when the blade moved upward to his cheeks Robert    his wounds    if you had seen them smelled them you would have no doubt   

Oh I know the boar did your work for you    but if he’d left the job half done doubtless you would have finished it

He was a wretched king    vain drunken lecherous    he would have set your sister aside his own queen    please    Renly was plotting to bring the Highgarden maid to court to entice his brother    it is the gods’ own truth   

And what was Lord Arryn plotting

He knew Pycelle said About    about
