Shae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of her breasts a chain of linked golden hands each clasping the next

Tyrion had not expected her What are you doing here

Laughing she stroked the chain I wanted some hands on my titties… but these little gold ones are cold

For a moment he did know what to say How could he tell her that another woman had taken the beating meant for her and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey He wiped Alayaya’s blood from his brow with the heel of his hand The Lady Lollys—

She’s asleep Sleep’s all she ever wants to do the great cow She sleeps and she eats Sometimes she falls asleep while she’s eating The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it and I have to clean her She made a disgusted face All they did was fuck her

Her mother says she’s sick

She has a baby in her belly that’s all

Tyrion gazed around the room Everything seemed much as he left it How did you enter Show me the hidden door

She gave a shrug Lord Varys made me wear a hood I couldn’t see except… there was one place I got a peep at the floor out the bottom of the hood It was all tiles you know the kind that make a picture

A mosaic

Shae nodded They were colored red and black I think the picture was a dragon Otherwise everything was dark We went down a ladder and walked a long ways until I was all twisted around Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate I brushed against it when we went through The dragon was past the gate Then we went up another ladder with a tunnel at the top I had to stoop and I think Lord Varys was crawling

Tyrion made a round of the bedchamber One of the sconces looked loose He stood on his toes and tried to turn it It revolved slowly scraping against the stone wall When it was upside down the stub of the candle fell out The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance Doesn’t m’lord want to bed me asked Shae

In a moment Tyrion threw open his wardrobe shoved the clothing aside and pushed against the rear panel What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well… but no the wood was solid unyielding A stone beside the window seat drew his eye but all his tugging and prodding went for naught He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed

Shae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck Your shoulders feel as hard as rocks she murmured Hurry I want to feel you inside me Yet as her legs locked around his waist his manhood left him When she felt him go soft Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in her mouth but even that could not rouse him

After a few moments he stopped her What’s wrong she asked All the sweet innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face

Innocence Fool she’s a whore Cersei was right you think with your cock fool fool

Just go to sleep sweetling he urged stroking her hair Yet long after Shae had taken his advice Tyrion himself still lay awake his fingers cupped over one small breast as he listened to her breathing





CATELYN

The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper Deep shadows draped the walls One of the torches had guttered out leaving only three Catelyn sat staring into her wine goblet The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue Brienne was across from her Between them her father’s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall Even the servants were gone She had given them leave to join the celebration

The walls of the keep were thick yet even so they could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars and the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure’s imminent return and Robb’s conquest of the Crag by hoisting horns of nut-brown ale

I cannot blame them Catelyn thought They do not know And if they did why should they care They never knew my sons Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats pride and terror so mingled they seemed as one never heard him laugh never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers She stared at the supper set before her trout wrapped in bacon salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass pease and onions and hot bread Brienne was eating methodically as if supper were another chore to be accomplished I am become a sour woman Catelyn thought I take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me I am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings There is an empty place within me where my heart was once

The sound of the other woman’s eating had become intolerable to her Brienne I am no fit company Go join the revels if you would Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund’s harping

I am not made for revels my lady Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were If you command it I…

Catelyn could sense her discomfort I only thought you might enjoy happier company than mine

I’m well content The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout had been fried in
