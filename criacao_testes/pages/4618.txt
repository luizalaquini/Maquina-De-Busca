I’ll make her my love and we’ll rest in the shade heigh-ho heigh-ho The song swelled louder with every word

Hot Pie opened his arms The cabbages fell to the ground with soft thumps We have to hide

Where The burned cottage and its overgrown garden stood hard beside the banks of the Trident There were a few willows growing along the river’s edge and reed beds in the muddy shallows beyond but most of the ground hereabouts was painfully open I knew we should never have left the woods she thought They’d been so hungry though and the garden had been too much a temptation The bread and cheese they had stolen from Harrenhal had given out six days ago back in the thick of the woods Take Gendry and the horses behind the cottage she decided There was part of one wall still standing big enough maybe to conceal two boys and three horses If the horses don’t whinny and that singer doesn’t come poking around the garden

What about you

I’ll hide by the tree He’s probably alone If he bothers me I’ll kill him Go

Hot Pie went and Arya dropped her carrots and drew the stolen sword from over her shoulder She had strapped the sheath across her back the longsword was made for a man grown and it bumped against the ground when she wore it on her hip It’s too heavy besides she thought missing Needle the way she did every time she took this clumsy thing in her hand But it was a sword and she could kill with it that was enough

Lightfoot she moved to the big old willow that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud within the veil of trailing branches You old gods she prayed as the singer’s voice grew louder you tree gods hide me and make him go past Then a horse whickered and the song broke off suddenly He’s heard she knew but maybe he’s alone or if he’s not maybe they’ll be as scared of us as we are of them

Did you hear that a man’s voice said There’s something behind that wall I would say

Aye replied a second voice deeper What do you think it might be Archer

Two then Arya bit her lip She could not see them from where she knelt on account of the willow But she could hear

A bear A third voice or the first one again

A lot of meat on a bear the deep voice said A lot of fat as well in fall Good to eat if it’s cooked up right

Could be a wolf Maybe a lion

With four feet you think Or two

Makes no matter Does it

Not so I know Archer what do you mean to do with all them arrows

Drop a few shafts over the wall Whatever’s hiding back there will come out quick enough watch and see

What if it’s some honest man back there though Or some poor woman with a little babe at her breast

An honest man would come out and show us his face Only an outlaw would skulk and hide

Aye that’s so Go on and loose your shafts then

Arya sprang to her feet Don’t She showed them her sword There were three she saw Only three Syrio could fight more than three and she had Hot Pie and Gendry to stand with her maybe But they’re boys and these are men

They were men afoot travel-stained and mud-specked She knew the singer by the woodharp he cradled against his jerkin as a mother might cradle a babe A small man fifty from the look of him he had a big mouth a sharp nose and thinning brown hair His faded greens were mended here and there with old leather patches and he wore a brace of throwing knives on his hip and a woodman’s axe slung across his back

The man beside him stood a good foot taller and had the look of a soldier A longsword and dirk hung from his studded leather belt rows of overlapping steel rings were sewn onto his shirt and his head was covered by a black iron halfhelm shaped like a cone He had bad teeth and a bushy brown beard but it was his hooded yellow cloak that drew the eye Thick and heavy stained here with grass and there with blood frayed along the bottom and patched with deerskin on the right shoulder the greatcloak gave the big man the look of some huge yellow bird

The last of the three was a youth as skinny as his longbow if not quite as tall Red-haired and freckled he wore a studded brigantine high boots fingerless leather gloves and a quiver on his back His arrows were fletched with grey goose feathers and six of them stood in the ground before him like a little fence

The three men looked at her standing there in the road with her blade in hand Then the singer idly plucked a string Boy he said put up that sword now unless you’re wanting to be hurt It’s too big for you lad and besides Anguy here could put three shafts through you before you could hope to reach us

He could not Arya said and I’m a girl

So you are The singer bowed My pardons

You go on down the road Just walk right past here and you keep on singing so we’ll know where you are Go away and leave us be and I won’t kill you

The freckle-faced archer laughed Lem she won’t kill us did you hear

I heard said Lem the big soldier with the deep voice

Child said the singer put up that sword and we’ll take you to a safe place and get some food in that belly There are wolves in these parts and lions and worse things No place for a little girl to be wandering alone

She’s not alone Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall and behind him Hot Pie leading her horse In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand Gendry looked almost a man grown and dangerous Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie Do like she says and leave us be warned Gendry

Two and three the singer counted and is that all of you And horses too lovely horses Where did you steal them

They’re ours Arya watched them carefully The singer kept distracting her with his talk but it was the archer who was the danger If he should pull an arrow from the ground   

Will you give us your names like honest men the singer asked the boys

I’m Hot Pie Hot Pie said at once

Aye and good for you The man smiled It’s not every day I meet a lad with such a tasty name And what would your friends be called Mutton Chop and Squab

Gendry scowled down from his saddle Why should I tell you my name I haven’t heard yours

Well as to that I’m Tom of Sevenstreams but Tom Sevenstrings is what they call me or Tom o’ Sevens This great lout with the brown teeth is Lem short for Lemoncloak It’s yellow you see and Lem’s a sour sort And young fellow me lad over there is Anguy or Archer as we like to call him

Now who are you demanded Lem in the deep voice that Arya had heard through the branches of the willow

She was not about to give up her true name as easy as that Squab if you want she said I don’t care

The big man laughed A squab with a sword he said Now there’s something you don’t often see

I’m the Bull said Gendry taking his lead from Arya She could not blame him for preferring Bull to Mutton Chop

Tom Sevenstrings strummed his harp Hot Pie Squab and the Bull Escaped from Lord Bolton’s kitchen did you

How did you know Arya demanded uneasy

You bear his sigil on your chest little one

She had forgotten that for an instant Beneath her cloak she still wore her fine page’s doublet with the flayed man of the Dreadfort sewn on her breast Don’t call me little one

Why not said Lem You’re little enough

I’m bigger than I was I’m not a child Children didn’t kill people and she had

I can see that Squab You’re none of you children not if you were Bolton’s
