…but Craster stood and his axe was in his hand The big black steel axe that Mormont had given him as a guest gift No he growled You’ll not sit No one who calls me niggard will sleep beneath my roof nor eat at my board Out with you cripple And you and you and you He jabbed the head of the axe toward Dirk and Garth and Garth in turn Go sleep in the cold with empty bellies the lot o’ you or…

Bloody bastard Sam heard one of the Garths curse He never saw which one

Who calls me bastard Craster roared sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with his left hand while lifting the axe with his right

It’s no more than all men know Karl answered

Craster moved quicker than Sam would have believed possible vaulting across the table with axe in hand A woman screamed Garth Greenaway and Orphan Oss drew knives Karl stumbled back and tripped over Ser Byam lying wounded on the floor One instant Craster was coming after him spitting curses The next he was spitting blood Dirk had grabbed him by the hair yanked his head back and opened his throat ear to ear with one long slash Then he gave him a rough shove and the wildling fell forward crashing face first across Ser Byam Byam screamed in agony as Craster drowned in his own blood the axe slipping from his fingers Two of Craster’s wives were wailing a third cursed a fourth flew at Sweet Donnel and tried to scratch his eyes out He knocked her to the floor The Lord Commander stood over Craster’s corpse dark with anger The gods will curse us he cried There is no crime so foul as for a guest to bring murder into a man’s hall By all the laws of the hearth we—

There are no laws beyond the Wall old man Remember Dirk grabbed one of Craster’s wives by the arm and shoved the point of his bloody dirk up under her chin Show us where he keeps the food or you’ll get the same as he did woman

Unhand her Mormont took a step I’ll have your head for this you— Garth of Greenaway blocked his path and Ollo Lophand yanked him back They both had blades in hand Hold your tongue Ollo warned Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for his dagger Ollo had only one hand but that was quick He twisted free of the old man’s grasp shoved the knife into Mormont’s belly and yanked it out again all red And then the world went mad

Later much later Sam found himself sitting crosslegged on the floor with Mormont’s head in his lap He did not remember how they’d gotten there or much of anything else that had happened after the Old Bear was stabbed Garth of Greenaway had killed Garth of Oldtown he recalled but not why Rolley of Sisterton had fallen from the loft and broken his neck after climbing the ladder to have a taste of Craster’s wives Grenn…

Grenn had shouted and slapped him and then he’d run away with Giant and Dolorous Edd and some others Craster still sprawled across Ser Byam but the wounded knight no longer moaned Four men in black sat on the bench eating chunks of burned horsemeat while Ollo coupled with a weeping woman on the table

Tarly When he tried to speak the blood dribbled from the Old Bear’s mouth down into his beard Tarly go Go

Where my lord His voice was flat and lifeless I am not afraid It was a queer feeling There’s no place to go

The Wall Make for the Wall Now

Now squawked the raven Now Now The bird walked up the old man’s arm to his chest and plucked a hair from his beard

You must Must tell them

Tell them what my lord Sam asked politely

All The Fist The wildlings Dragonglass This All His breathing was very shallow now his voice a whisper Tell my son Jorah Tell him take the black My wish Dying wish

Wish The raven cocked its head beady black eyes shining Corn the bird asked

No corn said Mormont feebly Tell Jorah Forgive him My son Please Go

It’s too far said Sam I’ll never reach the Wall my lord He was so very tired All he wanted was to sleep to sleep and sleep and never wake and he knew that if he just stayed here soon enough Dirk or Ollo Lophand or Clubfoot Karl would get angry with him and grant his wish just to see him die I’d sooner stay with you See I’m not frightened anymore Of you or… of anything

You should be said a woman’s voice

Three of Craster’s wives were standing over them Two were haggard old women he did not know but Gilly was between them all bundled up in skins and cradling a bundle of brown and white fur that must have held her baby We’re not supposed to talk to Craster’s wives Sam told them We have orders

That’s done now said the old woman on the right

The blackest crows are down in the cellar gorging said the old woman on the left or up in the loft with the young ones They’ll be back soon though Best you be gone when they do The horses run off but Dyah’s caught two

You said you’d help me Gilly reminded him

I said Jon would help you Jon’s brave and he’s a good fighter but I think he’s dead now I’m a craven And fat Look how fat I am Besides Lord Mormont’s hurt Can’t you see I couldn’t leave the Lord Commander

Child said the other old woman that old crow’s gone before you Look

Mormont’s head was still in his lap but his eyes were open and staring and his lips no longer moved The raven cocked its head and squawked then looked up at Sam Corn
