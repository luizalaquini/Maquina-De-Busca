Her brother Edmure nodded Me as well Do you have an answer to our offer my lord

I do Lothar smiled My lord father bids me tell Your Grace that he will agree to this new marriage alliance between our houses and renew his fealty to the King in the North upon the condition that the King’s Grace apologize for the insult done to House Frey in his royal person face to face

An apology was a small enough price to pay but Catelyn misliked this petty condition of Lord Walder’s at once

I am pleased Robb said cautiously It was never my wish to cause this rift between us Lothar The Freys have fought valiantly for my cause I would have them at my side once more

You are too kind Your Grace As you accept these terms I am then instructed to offer Lord Tully the hand of my sister the Lady Roslin a maid of sixteen years Roslin is my lord father’s youngest daughter by Lady Bethany of House Rosby his sixth wife She has a gentle nature and a gift for music

Edmure shifted in his seat Might not it be better if I first met—

You’ll meet when you’re wed said Walder Rivers curtly Unless Lord Tully feels a need to count her teeth first

Edmure kept his temper I will take your word so far as her teeth are concerned but it would be pleasant if I might gaze upon her face before I espoused her

You must accept her now my lord said Walder Rivers Else my father’s offer is withdrawn

Lame Lothar spread his hands My brother has a soldier’s bluntness but what he says is true It is my lord father’s wish that this marriage take place at once

At once Edmure sounded so unhappy that Catelyn had the unworthy thought that perhaps he had been entertaining notions of breaking the betrothal after the fighting was done

Has Lord Walder forgotten that we are fighting a war Brynden Blackfish asked sharply

Scarcely said Lothar That is why he insists that the marriage take place now ser Men die in war even men who are young and strong What would become of our alliance should Lord Edmure fall before he took Roslin to bride And there is my father’s age to consider as well He is past ninety and not like to see the end of this struggle It would put his noble heart at peace if he could see his dear Roslin safely wed before the gods take him so he might die with the knowledge that the girl had a strong husband to cherish and protect her

We all want Lord Walder to die happy Catelyn was growing less and less comfortable with this arrangement My brother has just lost his own father He needs time to mourn

Roslin is a cheerful girl said Lothar She may be the very thing Lord Edmure needs to help him through his grief

And my grandfather has come to mislike lengthy betrothals the bastard Walder Rivers added I cannot imagine why

Robb gave him a chilly look I take your meaning Rivers Pray excuse us

As Your Grace commands Lame Lothar rose and his bastard brother helped him hobble from the room

Edmure was seething They’re as much as saying that my promise is worthless Why should I let that old weasel choose my bride Lord Walder has other daughters besides this Roslin Granddaughters as well I should be offered the same choice you were I’m his liege lord he should be overjoyed that I’m willing to wed any of them

He is a proud man and we’ve wounded him said Catelyn

The Others take his pride I will not be shamed in my own hall My answer is no

Robb gave him a weary look I will not command you Not in this But if you refuse Lord Frey will take it for another slight and any hope of putting this arights will be gone

You cannot know that Edmure insisted Frey has wanted me for one of his daughters since the day I was born He will not let a chance like this slip between those grasping fingers of his When Lothar brings him our answer he’ll come wheedling back and accept a betrothal… and to a daughter of my choosing

Perhaps in time said Brynden Blackfish But can we wait while Lothar rides back and forth with offers and counters

Robb’s hands curled into fists I must get back to the north My brothers dead Winterfell burned my smallfolk put to the sword… the gods only know what this bastard of Bolton’s is about or whether Theon is still alive and on the loose I can’t sit here waiting for a wedding that might or might not happen

It must happen said Catelyn though not gladly I have no more wish to suffer Walder Frey’s insults and complaints than you do Brother but I see little choice here Without this wedding Robb’s cause is lost Edmure we must accept

We must accept he echoed peevishly I don’t see you offering to become the ninth Lady Frey Cat
