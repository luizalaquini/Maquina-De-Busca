heavens above us Oak
how white your face is you look like a corpse 
Do I said Oak with a faint smile
Lean on the gate Ill wait a bit
All right all right 
They stood by the gate awhile Gabriel listlessly
staring at the ground His mind sped into the future
and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes o
repentance that would ensue from this work of haste
That they were married he had instantly decided Why
had it been so mysteriously managed  It had become
known that she had had a fearful journey to Bath owing
to her miscalculating the distance  that the horse had
broken down and that she had been more than two
days getting there It was not Bathshebas way to do
things furtively With all her faults she was candour
itself Could she have been entrapped  The union
was not only an unutterable grief to him it amazed
him notwithstanding that he had passed the preceding
week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of
Troys meeting her away from home Her quiet return
with liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread
Just as that imperceptible motion which appears like
stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stili
ness itself so had his hope undistinguishable from
despair differed from despair indeed
In a few minutes they moved on again towards the
house The sergeant still looked from the window
Morning comrades   he shouted in a cheery voice
when they came up
Coggan replied to the greeting  Baint ye going to
answer the man  he then said to Gabriel Id say
good morning -- you neednt spend a hapeth of meaning
upon it and yet keep the man civil
Gabriel soon decided too that since the deed was
done to put the best face upon the matter would be the
greatest kindness to her he loved
Good morning Sergeant Troy he returned in a
ghastly voice
A rambling gloomy house this said Troy smiling
P 295
 Why -- they may not be married   suggested Coggan
 Perhaps shes not there
Gabriel shook his head The soldier turned a little
towards the east and the sun kindled his scarlet coat
to an orange glow
But it is a nice old house responded Gabriel
Yes-i suppose so but I feel like new wine in an
old bottle here My notion is that sash-windows should
be put throughout and these old wainscoted walls
brightened up a bit  or the oak cleared quite away and
the walls papered
It would be a pity I think
Well no A philosopher once said in my hearing
that the old builders who worked when art was a living
thing had no respect for the work of builders who went
before them but pulled down and altered as they
thought fit and why shouldnt we  Creation and
preservation dont do well together says he and a
million of antiquarians cant invent a style My mind
exactly I am for niaking this place more modern that
we may be cheerful whilst we can
The military man turned and surveyed the interior
of the room to assist his ideas of improvement in this
direction Gabriel and Coggan began to move on
 Oh Coggan said Troy as if inspired by a recollec+
tion  do you know if insanity has ever appeared in Mr
Boldwoods family  
Jan reflected for a moment
I once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his
head but I dont know the rights ot he said
It is of no importance said Troy lightly Well
I shall be down in the fields with you some time this
week  but I have a few matters to attend to first So
good-day to you We shall of course keep on just as
friendly terms as usual Im not a proud man  nobody
is ever able to say that of Sergeant Troy However
what is must be and heres half-a-crown to drink my
health men
Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot
and over the fence towards Gabriel who shunned it in
its fall his face turning to an angry red Coggan
twirled his eye edged
P 296
forward and caught the money
in its ricochet upon the road
 very weli-you keep it Coggan said Gabriel with
disdain and almost fiercely As for me Ill do with+
out gifts from him 
Dont show it too much said Coggan musingly
For if hes married to her mark my words hell buy
his discharge and be our master here Therefore tis
well to say  Friend  outwardly though you say
Troublehouse  within 
 Weli-perhaps it is best to be silent but I cant
go further than that I cant flatter and if my place
here is only to be kept by smoothing him down my
place must be lost
A horseman whom they had for some time seen in
