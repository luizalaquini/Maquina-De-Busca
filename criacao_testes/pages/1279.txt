Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men Nor would he make a comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr This war has made for some queer bedfellows I agree but those two No

As he carved some slices off the ham she said We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig

A token of her love

A bribe She begs leave to return to her castle Your leave as well as mine I suspect she fears you’ll arrest her on the road as you did Lord Gyles

Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne Tyrion served his sister a cut of ham and took one for himself I’d sooner she remain If she wants to feel safe tell her to bring down her garrison from Stokeworth As many men as she has

If we need men so badly why did you send away your savages A certain testiness crept into Cersei’s voice

It was the best use I could have made of them he told her truthfully They’re fierce warriors but not soldiers In formal battle discipline is more important than courage They’ve already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls

As the swan was being served the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the Antler Men She seemed more annoyed than afraid Why are we plagued with so many treasons What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches

None said Tyrion but they think to be on the winning side… which makes them fools as well as traitors

Are you certain you’ve found them all

Varys says so The swan was too rich for his taste

A line appeared on Cersei’s pale white brow between those lovely eyes You put too much trust in that eunuch

He serves me well

Or so he’d have you believe You think you’re the only one he whispers secrets to He gives each of us just enough to convince us that we’d be helpless without him He played the same game with me when I first wed Robert For years I was convinced I had no truer friend at court but now… She studied his face for a moment He says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey

Damn Varys I need Clegane for more important duties

Nothing is more important than the life of the king

The life of the king is not at risk Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him and Meryn Trant as well They’re good for nothing better I need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater

Jaime would lead the sorties himself

From Riverrun That’s quite a sortie

Joff’s only a boy

A boy who wants to be part of this battle and for once he’s showing some sense I don’t intend to put him in the thick of the fighting but he needs to be seen Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother’s skirts

He’s thirteen Tyrion

Remember Jaime at thirteen If you want the boy to be his father’s son let him play the part Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy and he’ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him at all times If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling I’ll have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once

He had thought that might reassure her but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes Will the city fall

No But if it does pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father to march to our relief

You’ve lied to me before Tyrion

Always with good reason sweet sister I want amity between us as much as you do I’ve decided to release Lord Gyles He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture You can have Ser Boros Blount back as well

The queen’s mouth tightened Ser Boros can rot at Rosby she said but Tommen—

—stays where he is He’s safer under Lord Jacelyn’s protection than he would ever have been with Lord Gyles

Serving men cleared away the swan hardly touched Cersei beckoned for the sweet I hope you like blackberry tarts

I love all sorts of tarts

Oh I’ve known that a long while Do you know why Varys is so dangerous

Are we playing at riddles now No

He doesn’t have a cock

Neither do you And don’t you just hate that Cersei

Perhaps I’m dangerous too You on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man That worm between your legs does half your thinking

Tyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers He did not like his sister’s smile Yes and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave

Are you unwell brother She leaned forward giving him a good look at the top of her breasts Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered

Flustered Tyrion glanced at the door He thought he’d heard something outside He was beginning to regret coming here alone You’ve never shown much interest in my cock before

It’s not your cock that interests me so much as what you stick it in I don’t depend on the eunuch for everything as you do I have my own ways of finding out things… especially things that people don’t want me to know

What are you trying to say

Only this—I have your little whore

Tyrion reached for his wine cup buying a moment to gather his thoughts I thought men were more to your taste

You’re such a droll little fellow Tell me have you married this one yet When he gave her no answer she laughed and said Father will be ever so relieved

His belly felt as if it were full of eels How had she found Shae Had Varys betrayed him Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed

A Lannister always pays his debts she said You’ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King’s Landing You sold Myrcella stole Tommen and now you plot to have Joff killed You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen

Well I can’t say the notion isn’t tempting This is madness Cersei Stannis will be here in days You need me

For what Your great prowess in battle

Bronn’s sellswords will never fight without me he lied

Oh I think they will It’s your gold they love not your impish wit Have no fear though they won’t be without you I won’t say I haven’t thought of slitting your throat from time to time but Jaime would never forgive me if I did
