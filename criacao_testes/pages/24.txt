Jon shrugged Girls get the arms but not the swords Bastards get the swords but not the arms I did not make the rules little sister

There was a shout from the courtyard below Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust trying to get up and failing All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword ready to whack him again once he regained his feet The men began to laugh

Enough Ser Rodrik called out He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet Well fought Lew Donnis help them out of their armor He looked around Prince Joffrey Robb will you go another round

Robb already sweaty from a previous bout moved forward eagerly Gladly

Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik’s summons His hair shone like spun gold He looked bored This is a game for children Ser Rodrik

Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter You are children he said derisively

Robb may be a child Joffrey said I am a prince And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword

You got more swats than you gave Joff Robb said Are you afraid

Prince Joffrey looked at him Oh terrified he said You’re so much older Some of the Lannister men laughed

Jon looked down on the scene with a frown Joffrey is truly a little shit he told Arya

Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers What are you suggesting he asked the prince

Live steel

Done Robb shot back You’ll be sorry

The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb’s shoulder to quiet him Live steel is too dangerous I will permit you tourney swords with blunted edges

Joffrey said nothing but a man strange to Arya a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face pushed forward in front of the prince This is your prince Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword ser

Master-at-arms of Winterfell Clegane and you would do well not to forget it

Are you training women here the burned man wanted to know He was muscled like a bull

I am training knights Ser Rodrik said pointedly They will have steel when they are ready When they are of an age

The burned man looked at Robb How old are you boy

Fourteen Robb said

I killed a man at twelve You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword

Arya could see Robb bristle His pride was wounded He turned on Ser Rodrik Let me do it I can beat him

Beat him with a tourney blade then Ser Rodrik said

Joffrey shrugged Come and see me when you’re older Stark If you’re not too old There was laughter from the Lannister men

Robb’s curses rang through the yard Arya covered her mouth in shock Theon Greyjoy seized Robb’s arm to keep him away from the prince Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay

Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother Come Tommen he said The hour of play is done Leave the children to their frolics

That brought more laughter from the Lannisters more curses from Robb Ser Rodrik’s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away
