quite refuse
I can do nothing I cannot answer
I may speak to you again on the subject
Yes
I may think of you
Yes I suppose you may think of me
And hope to obtain you
No -- do not hope Let us go on
I will call upon you again to-morrow
No -- please not Give me time
Yes -- I will give you any time he said earnestly and
gratefully I am happier now
No -- I beg you Dont be happier if happiness
only comes from my agreeing Be neutral Mr Bold+
wood I must think
I will wait he said
And then she turned away Boldwood dropped his
gaze to the ground and stood long like a man who did not
know where he was Realities then returned upon him
like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
which eclipses it and he too then went on

PERPLEXITy -- GRINDING THE SHEARS -- A QUARREL
HE is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I
can desire Bathsheba mused
Yet Farmer Boldwood whether by nature kind or
the reverse to kind did not exercise kindness here
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self+
indulgence and no generosity at all
Bathsheba not being the least in love with him was
eventually able to look calmly at his offer It was one
which many women of her own station in the neighbour+
hood and not a few of higher rank would have been
wild to accept and proud to publish In every point of
view ranging from politic to passionate it was desirable
that she a lonely girl should marry and marry this
earnest well-to-do and respected man He was close
to her doors his standing was sufficient his qualities
were even supererogatory Had she felt which she did
not any wish whatever for the married state in the
abstract she could not reasonably have rejected him
being a woman who frequently appealed to her under
standing for deliverance from her whims Boldwood as
a means to marriage was unexceptionable she esteemed
and liked him yet she did not want him It appears
that ordinary men take wives because possession is not
possible without marriage and that ordinary women
accept husbands because marriage is not possible with
out possession with totally differing aims the method is
the same on both sides But the understood incentive
on the womans part was wanting here Besides Bath+
shebas position as absolute mistress of a farm and house
was a novel one and the novelty had not yet begun to
wear off
But a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her
credit for it would have affected few Beyond the men+
tioned reasons with which she combated her objections
she had a strong
P 182
feeling that having been the one who
began the game she ought in honesty to accept the conse
quences Still the reluctance remained She said in the
same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry
Boldwood and that she couldnt do it to save her life
Bathshebas was an impulsive nature under a delibera
tive aspect  An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart
in spirit she often performed actions of the greatest
temerity with a manner of extreme discretion Many of
her thoughts were perfect syllogisms unluckily they
always remained thoughts Only a few were irrational
assumptions but unfortunately they were the ones
which most frequently grew into deeds
  The next day to that of the declaration she found
Gabriel Oak at the bottom of her garden grinding his
shears for the sheep-shearing All the surrounding
cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation
the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign
Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara+
tion -- sickles scythes shears and pruning-hooks ranking
with swords bayonets and lances in their common
necessity for point and edge
Cainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriels grinstone
his head performing a melancoly see-saw up and down
with each turn of the wheel Oak stood somewhat as
Eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his
arrows his figure slightly bent the weight of his body
thrown over on the shears and his head balanced side+
ways with a critical compression of the lips and contrac+
tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude
His mistress came up and looked upon them in
silence for a minute or two then she said --
Cain go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare
Ill turn the winch of the grindstone I want to speak
to you Gabriel
Cain departed and Bathsheba took the handle
Gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise quelled its
expression and looked down again Bathsheba turned
the winch and Gabriel applied the shears
