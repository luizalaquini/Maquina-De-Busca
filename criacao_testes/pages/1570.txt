carried me across the square is replaced by despair I
cant Thats the problem isnt it I lower my bow We blew
up your mine You burned my district to the ground Weve
got every reason to kill each other So do it Make the
Capitol happy Im done killing their slaves for them I drop
my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot It
slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees
Im not their slave the man mutters
I am I say Thats why I killed Catoand he killed
Threshand he killed Cloveand she tried to kill me It just
goes around and around and who wins Not us Not the
districts Always the Capitol But Im tired of being a piece
in their Games
Peeta On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger
Games He understood it all before wed even set foot in
the arena I hope hes watching now that he remembers
that night as it happened and maybe forgives me when I
die
Keep talking Tell them about watching the mountain
go down Haymitch insists
When I saw that mountain fall tonight I
thoughttheyve done it again Got me to kill you--the
people in the districts But why did I do it District Twelve
and District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol
gave us The young man blinks at me uncomprehendingly
I sink on my knees before him my voice low and urgent
And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops
With Lyme who was your victor With people who were
your neighbors maybe even your family
I dont know says the man But he doesnt take his
gun off me
I rise and turn slowly in a circle addressing the
machine guns And you up there I come from a mining
town Since when do miners condemn other miners to that
kind of death and then stand by to kill whoever manages to
crawl from the rubble
Who is the enemy whispers Haymitch
These people--I indicate the wounded bodies on the
square--are not your enemy I whip back around to the
train station The rebels are not your enemy We all have
one enemy and its the Capitol This is our chance to put
an end to their power but we need every district person to
do it The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands
to the man to the wounded to the reluctant rebels across
Panem Please Join us
My words hang in the air I look to the screen hoping to
see them recording some wave of reconciliation going
through the crowd
Instead I watch myself get shot on television
16
Always
In the twilight of morphling Peeta whispers the word
and I go searching for him Its a gauzy violet-tinted world
with no hard edges and many places to hide I push
through cloud banks follow faint tracks catch the scent of
cinnamon of dill Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try
to trap it but it dissolves like mist through my fingers
When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital
room in 13 I remember I was under the influence of sleep
syrup My heel had been injured after Id climbed out on a
branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12
Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with
me as I was drifting off He had whispered something I
couldnt quite catch But some part of my brain had trapped
his single word of reply and let it swim up through my
dreams to taunt me now Always
Morphling dulls the extremes of all emotions so
instead of a stab of sorrow I merely feel emptiness A
hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom
Unfortunately theres not enough of the drug left in my veins
for me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body Thats
where the bullet hit My hands fumble over the thick
bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what Im still
doing here
It wasnt him the man kneeling before me on the
square the burned one from the Nut He didnt pull the
trigger It was someone farther back in the crowd There
was less a sense of penetration than the feeling that Id
been struck with a sledgehammer Everything after the
moment of impact is confusion riddled with gunfire I try to
sit up but the only thing I manage is a moan
The white curtain that divides my bed from the next
patients whips back and Johanna Mason stares down at
me At first I feel threatened because she attacked me in
the arena I have to remind myself that she did it to save my
life It was part of the rebel plot But still that doesnt mean
she doesnt despise me Maybe her treatment of me was
all an act for the Capitol
Im alive I say rustily
No kidding brainless Johanna walks over and
plunks down on my bed sending spikes of pain shooting
across my chest When she grins at my discomfort I know
were not in for some warm reunion scene Still a little
sore With an expert hand she quickly detaches the
morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped
into the crook of her own They started cutting back my
supply a few days ago Afraid Im going to turn into one of
those freaks from Six Ive had to borrow from you when the
coast was clear Didnt think youd mind
Mind How can I mind when she was almost tortured
