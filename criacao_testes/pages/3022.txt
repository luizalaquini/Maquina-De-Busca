722 For I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day
that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt
offerings or sacrifices 723 But this thing commanded I them saying
Obey my voice and I will be your God and ye shall be my people and
walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well
unto you

724 But they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the
counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went
backward and not forward

725 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the
prophets daily rising up early and sending them 726 Yet they
hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their
neck they did worse than their fathers

727 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they
will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they
will not answer thee

728 But thou shalt say unto them This is a nation that obeyeth not
the voice of the LORD their God nor receiveth correction truth is
perished and is cut off from their mouth

729 Cut off thine hair O Jerusalem and cast it away and take up a
lamentation on high places for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken
the generation of his wrath

730 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight saith the
LORD they have set their abominations in the house which is called by
my name to pollute it

731 And they have built the high places of Tophet which is in the
valley of the son of Hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in
the fire which I commanded them not neither came it into my heart

732 Therefore behold the days come saith the LORD that it shall
no more be called Tophet nor the valley of the son of Hinnom but the
valley of slaughter for they shall bury in Tophet till there be no
place

733 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them
away

734 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the
streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness
the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land
shall be desolate

81 At that time saith the LORD they shall bring out the bones of
the kings of Judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the
priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves 82 And they shall
spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven
whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they
have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped
they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon
the face of the earth

83 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places
whither I have driven them saith the LORD of hosts

84 Moreover thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD Shall they
fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return  85 Why then
is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding
they hold fast deceit they refuse to return

86 I hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented
him of his wickedness saying What have I done every one turned to
his course as the horse rusheth into the battle

87 Yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the
turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming
but my people know not the judgment of the LORD

88 How do ye say We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us
Lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain

89 The wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they
have rejected the word of the LORD and what wisdom is in them  810
Therefore will I give their wives unto others and their fields to
them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto
the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the
priest every one dealeth falsely

811 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
slightly saying Peace peace when there is no peace

812 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they
were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall
they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they
shall be cast down saith the LORD

813 I will surely consume them saith the LORD there shall be no
grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade
and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them
