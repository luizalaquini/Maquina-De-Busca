1845 And it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black
with clouds and wind and there was a great rain And Ahab rode and
went to Jezreel

1846 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah and he girded up his
loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel

191 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and withal how he
had slain all the prophets with the sword

192 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying So let the
gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of
one of them by to morrow about this time

193 And when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came
to Beersheba which belongeth to Judah and left his servant there

194 But he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came
and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that
he might die and said It is enough now O LORD take away my life
for I am not better than my fathers

195 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an
angel touched him and said unto him Arise and eat

196 And he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals
and a cruse of water at his head And he did eat and drink and laid
him down again

197 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time and touched
him and said Arise and eat because the journey is too great for
thee

198 And he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of
that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God

199 And he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold
the word of the LORD came to him and he said unto him What doest
thou here Elijah  1910 And he said I have been very jealous for
the LORD God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the
sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it
away

1911 And he said Go forth and stand upon the mount before the LORD

And behold the LORD passed by and a great and strong wind rent the
mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD but the LORD
was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the LORD
was not in the earthquake 1912 And after the earthquake a fire but
the LORD was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice

1913 And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in
his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave
And behold there came a voice unto him and said What doest thou
here Elijah  1914 And he said I have been very jealous for the
LORD God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the
sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it
away

1915 And the LORD said unto him Go return on thy way to the
wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint Hazael to be king
over Syria 1916 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
king over Israel and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
thou anoint to be prophet in thy room

1917 And it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of
Hazael shall Jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu
shall Elisha slay

1918 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the knees which
have not bowed unto Baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him

1919 So he departed thence and found Elisha the son of Shaphat who
was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the
twelfth and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him

1920 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said Let me I
pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee
And he said unto him Go back again for what have I done to thee
1921 And he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew
them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and
gave unto the people and they did eat Then he arose and went after
Elijah and ministered unto him

201 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together
and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and
chariots and he went up and besieged Samaria and warred against it

202 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city and
said unto him Thus saith Benhadad 203 Thy silver and thy gold is
mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine

204 And the king of Israel answered and said My lord O king
according to thy saying I am thine and all that I have

205 And the messengers came again and said Thus speaketh Benhadad
saying Although I have sent unto thee saying Thou shalt deliver me
