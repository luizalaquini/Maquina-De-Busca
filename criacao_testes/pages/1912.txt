which is sketched in Figure 54

The pulse is the wrong way round in time
when compared with the desired one but this is not important under most
listening conditions because phase differences are not noticeable this
point is discussed further below
The maximum is reached when t=T and has
height A  The value zero is never actually attained for the decay to it
is asymptotic and if the slight discontinuity between pulses shown in the
Figure is left the asymptotic rate of decay of the frequency spectrum will
be 6 dBoctave rather than 12 dBoctave  However in a real implementation
involving filtering an impulse there will be no such discontinuity for the
next pulse will start off where the last one ended
pp
This seems to be an attractive scheme because of its simplicity
and indeed is sometimes used in speech synthesis  However it does not have
the right properties when the pitch is varied for in real glottal
waveforms the maximum occurs at a fixed
ul
fraction
of the period whereas the filtered impulses maximum is at a fixed time T
If T is chosen to make the system correct at high pitch frequencies say
400 Hz then the pulse will be much too narrow at low pitches and sound rather
harsh  The only solution is to vary the filter parameters with the pitch
leading to complexity again

Holmes 1973 has made an extensive study of the effect of the glottal
waveshape on the naturalness of high-quality synthesized speech

Holmes 1973 Influence of glottal waveform on naturalness

He employed a rather special speech synthesizer which provides far more
comprehensive and sophisticated control than most  It was driven by parameters
which were extracted from natural utterances by hand em but the process of
generating and tuning them took many months of a skilled persons time
By using the pulse shape
extracted from the natural utterance he found that synthetic and natural
versions could actually be made indistinguishable to most people even under high-quality
listening conditions using headphones  Performance dropped quite drastically
when one of Rosenbergs pulse shapes similar to the three-section one given
above was used  Holmes also investigated phase effects and found that whilst
different pulse shapes with identical frequency spectra could easily be
distinguished when listening over headphones there was no perceptible difference
if the listener was placed at a comfortable distance from a loudspeaker in
a room  This is attributable to the fact that the room itself imposes a
complex modification to the phase characteristics of the speech signal
pp
Although a great deal of care must be taken with the glottal pulse shape for very
high-quality synthetic speech for speech synthesized by rule from a written
representation the degradation which stems from incorrect control of the
synthesizer parameters is much greater than that caused by using a slightly
inferior glottal pulse  The triangular pulse illustrated in Figure 53
has been found quite satisfactory for speech synthesis by rule
rh Unvoiced excitation
Speech quality is much less sensitive to the characteristics of the unvoiced
excitation  Broadband white noise will serve admirably  It is quite
acceptable to generate this digitally using a pseudo-random feedback shift
register  This gives a bit sequence whose autocorrelation is zero except at
multiples of the repetition length  The repetition length
can easily be made as long as the number of states in the shift
register less one em in this case the configuration is called
maximal length Gaines 1969

Gaines 1969 Stochastic computing advances in information science

For example an 18-bit maximal-length shift register will repeat
every 2 sup 18 -1 cycles  If the bit-stream is used as a source of analogue
noise the autocorrelation function will have triangular parts whose width is
twice the clock period as shown in Figure 55

According to a well-known
result the Weiner-Kinchine theorem see for example Chirlian 1973
the power density of the frequency
spectrum is the same as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function

Chirlian 1973

Since the feedback shift register gives a periodic autocorrelation function
its transform is a Fourier series  The rth frequency component is

These are very close together em with N=18 and
