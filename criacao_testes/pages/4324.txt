the basic sampling rate  intervals

rate for telephone-quality speech

Now let us bring together some facts from the previous chapter which will
allow the time-domain technique of linear prediction to be interpreted
in terms of the frequency-domain formant model of speech  Recall that speech
can be viewed as an excitation source passing through a vocal tract filter
followed by another filter to model the effect of radiation from the lips
The overall spectral levels can be reassigned as in Figure 51 so that
the excitation source has a 0 dBoctave spectral profile and hence is
essentially impulsive
Considering the vocal tract filter as a series connection
of digital formant filters its transfer function is the product of terms like
LB
EQ
1 over 1-b sub 1 z sup -1 +b sub 2 z sup -2 
EN
LE
where b sub 1 and b sub 2 control the position and bandwidth of the formant resonances
The -6 dBoctave spectral compensation can be modelled by the
first-order digital filter
LB
EQ
1 over 1-bz sup -1 
EN
LE
The product of all these terms when multiplied out will have the
form
LB
EQ
1 over 1-c sub 1 z sup -1 -c sub 2 z sup -2 --
c sub q z sup -q  
EN
LE
where q is twice the number of formants plus one and the cs are calculated
from the positions and bandwidths of the formant resonances and the spectral
compensation parameter  Hence
the z-transform of the speech is
LB
EQ
Xz=1 over 1- sum from k=1 to q c sub k z sup -k Iz 
EN
LE
where Iz is the transform of the impulsive excitation

This is remarkably similar to the linear prediction relation given earlier  If
p and q are the same then the linear predictive coefficients a sub k
form a pth order polynomial which is the same as that obtained by multiplying
together the second-order polynomials representing the individual formants
together with the first-order one for spectral compensation
Furthermore the predictive error Ez can be identified with the
impulsive excitation Iz  This raises the very interesting
possibility of parametrizing the error signal by its frequency and
amplitude em two relatively slowly-varying quantities em instead of
transmitting it sample-by-sample at an 8 kHz rate  This is how
linear prediction separates out the excitation properties of the source
from the vocal tract filter  the source parameters can be derived
from the error signal and the vocal tract filter is represented by
the linear predictive coefficients
Figure 63 shows how this can be used for speech transmission

signals need now be transmitted at the speech sampling rate for the
source parameters vary relatively slowly  This leads to an extremely
low data rate
pp
Practical linear predictive coding schemes operate with a value of p between
10 and 15 corresponding approximately to 4-formant and 7-formant synthesis
respectively  The a sub ks are re-calculated every 10 to 25 msec and
transmitted to the receiver  Also the pitch and amplitude
of the speech are estimated and transmitted at the same rate
If the speech
is unvoiced there is no pitch value  an unvoiced flag is
