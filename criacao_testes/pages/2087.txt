Meera shook her head Does he never grow angry

Not with me Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely but it was all in play Sometimes he tears my garb but he’s never drawn blood

Your blood you mean If he’d gotten past my net   

He wouldn’t hurt you He knows I like you All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran’s constant companions Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him little grandfather but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya She wasn’t scared to get dirty and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy She was older than Arya though almost sixteen a woman grown They were both older than Bran even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone but they never treated him like a child

I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders He began to struggle toward the nearest tree His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch but when Meera moved to lift him he said No don’t help me He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward using the strength of his arms until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash See I told you Summer lay down with his head in Bran’s lap I never knew anyone who fought with a net before he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting

My father taught me We have no knights at Greywater No master-at-arms and no maester

Who keeps your ravens

She smiled Ravens can’t find Greywater Watch no more than our enemies can

Why not

Because it moves she told him

Bran had never heard of a moving castle before He looked at her uncertainly but he couldn’t tell whether she was teasing him or not I wish I could see it Do you think your lord father would let me come visit when the war is over

You would be most welcome my prince Then or now

Now Bran had spent his whole life at Winterfell He yearned to see far places I could ask Ser Rodrik when he returns The old knight was off east trying to set to rights the trouble there Roose Bolton’s bastard had started it by seizing Lady Hornwood as she returned from the harvest feast marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be her son Then Lord Manderly had taken her castle To protect the Hornwood holdings from the Boltons he had written but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the bastard Ser Rodrik might let me go Maester Luwin never would

Sitting cross-legged under the weirwood Jojen Reed regarded him solemnly It would be good if you left Winterfell Bran

It would

Yes And sooner rather than later

My brother has the greensight said Meera He dreams things that haven’t happened but sometimes they do

There is no sometimes Meera A look passed between them him sad her defiant

Tell me what’s going to happen Bran said

I will said Jojen if you’ll tell me about your dreams

The godswood grew quiet Bran could hear leaves rustling and Hodor’s distant splashing from the hot pools He thought of the golden man and the three-eyed crow remembered the crunch of bones between his jaws and the coppery taste of blood I don’t have dreams Maester Luwin gives me sleeping draughts

Do they help

Sometimes

Meera said All of Winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating Bran The women talk of it at the well and the guards in their hall

Tell us what frightens you so much said Jojen

I don’t want to Anyway it’s only dreams Maester Luwin says dreams might mean anything or nothing

My brother dreams as other boys do and those dreams might mean anything Meera said but the green dreams are different

Jojen’s eyes were the color of moss and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else Like now I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains he said It was a green dream so I knew it was true A crow was trying to peck through the chains but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them

Did the crow have three eyes

Jojen nodded

Summer raised his head from Bran’s lap and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden eyes

When I was little I almost died of greywater fever That was when the crow came to me

He came to me after I fell Bran blurted I was asleep for a long time He said I had to fly or die and I woke up only I was broken and I couldn’t fly after all

You can if you want to Picking up her net Meera shook out the last tangles and began arranging it in loose folds

You are the winged wolf Bran said Jojen I wasn’t sure when we first came but now I am The crow sent us here to break your chains

Is the crow at Greywater

No The crow is in the north

At the Wall Bran had always wanted to see the Wall His bastard brother Jon was there now a man of the Night’s Watch

Beyond the Wall Meera Reed hung the net from her belt When Jojen told our lord father what he’d dreamed he sent us to Winterfell

How would I break the chains Jojen Bran asked

Open your eye

They are open Can’t you see

Two are open Jojen pointed One two

I only have two

You have three The crow gave you the third but you will not open it He had a slow soft way of speaking With two eyes you see my face With three you could see my heart With two you can see that oak tree there With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become With two you see no farther than your walls With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall

Summer got to his feet I don’t need to see so far Bran made a nervous smile I’m tired of talking about crows Let’s talk about wolves Or lizard-lions Have you ever hunted one Meera We don’t have them here

Meera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes They live in the water In slow streams and deep swamps—

Her brother interrupted Did you dream of a lizard-lion

No said Bran I told you I don’t want—

Did you dream of a wolf
