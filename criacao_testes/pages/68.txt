It is more than that Catelyn insisted Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation I fear that man

Littlefinger smiled Leave Lord Varys to me sweet lady If you will permit me a small obscenity—and where better for it—I hold the man’s balls in the palm of my hand He cupped his fingers smiling Or would if he were a man or had any balls You see if the pie is opened the birds begin to sing and Varys would not like that Were I you I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch

Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found to the look on the queen’s face when she said We have a wolf so soft and quiet He was thinking of the boy Mycah of Jon Arryn’s sudden death of Bran’s fall of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life’s blood dried on a golden blade My lady he said turning to Catelyn there is nothing more you can do here I want you to return to Winterfell at once If there was one assassin there could be others Whoever ordered Bran’s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives

I had hoped to see the girls… Catelyn said

That would be most unwise Littlefinger put in The Red Keep is full of curious eyes and children talk

He speaks truly my love Ned told her He embraced her Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell I will watch over the girls Go home to our sons and keep them safe

As you say my lord Catelyn lifted her face and Ned kissed her Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms

Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber asked Littlefinger I should warn you Stark we usually charge for that sort of thing around here

A moment alone that’s all I ask Catelyn said

Very well Littlefinger strolled to the door Don’t be too long It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle before our absence is noted

Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own I will not forget the help you gave me Petyr When your men came for me I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy I have found you more than a friend I have found a brother I’d thought lost

Petyr Baelish smiled I am desperately sentimental sweet lady Best not tell anyone I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught

Ned believed not a word of that but he kept his voice polite as he said You have my thanks as well Lord Baelish

Oh now there’s a treasure Littlefinger said exiting

When the door had closed behind him Ned turned back to his wife Once you are home send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor and see that they are well manned And from this day on I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy If there is war we shall have sore need of his father’s fleet

War The fear was plain on Catelyn’s face

It will not come to that Ned promised her praying it was true He took her in his arms again The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them and that they shall not have I must play out this fool’s masquerade as if nothing is amiss Remember why I came here my love If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn…

He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms Her scarred hands clung to him If she said what then my love

That was the most dangerous part Ned knew All justice flows from the king he told her When I know the truth I must go to Robert And pray that he is the man I think he is he finished silently and not the man I fear he has become





TYRION

Are you certain that you must leave us so soon the Lord Commander asked him

Past certain Lord Mormont Tyrion replied My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black

Would that I could Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist Old as he was the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear You’re a cunning man Tyrion We have need of men of your sort on the Wall

Tyrion grinned Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you Lord Mormont As they laughed he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning packed in a barrel of snow and they were succulent

Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile Lannister mocks us
