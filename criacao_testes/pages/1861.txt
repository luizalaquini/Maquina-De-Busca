Lets return now to speech output and take a look at some systems which use it
to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of speech in practical
applications
sh 11  Talking calculator
pp
Figure 11 shows a calculator that speaks
FC Figure 11
Whenever a key is pressed
the device confirms the action by saying the keys name
The result of any computation is also spoken aloud
For most people the addition of speech output to a calculator is simply a
gimmick
Note incidentally that speech
ul
input
is a different matter altogether  The ability to dictate lists of numbers and
commands to a calculator without lifting ones eyes from the page would have
very great advantages over keypad input  Used-car
salesmen find that speech output sometimes helps to clinch a deal  they key in
the basic car price and their bargain-basement deductions and the customer is so
bemused by the resulting price being spoken aloud to him by a machine that he
signs the cheque without thinking  More seriously there may be some small
advantage to be gained when keying a list of figures by touch from having their
values read back for confirmation  For blind people however such devices
are a boon em and there are many other applications like talking elevators
and talking clocks which benefit from even very restricted voice output
Much more sophisticated is a typewriter with audio feedback designed by
IBM for the blind  Although blind typists can remember where the keys on a
typewriter are without difficulty they rely on sighted proof-readers to help
check
their work  This device could make them more useful as office typists and
secretaries  As well as verbalizing the material including punctuation
that has been typed either by attempting to pronounce the words or by spelling
them out as individual letters it prompts the user through the more complex action sequences
that are possible on the typewriter

FG Table 11  Vocabulary of a talking calculator
This represents a total of about 13 seconds of speech  It is stored
electronically in read-only memory ROM and Figure 12 shows the circuitry
of the speech module inside the calculator
FC Figure 12
There are three large integrated circuits
Two of them are ROMs and the other is a special synthesis chip which decodes the
highly compressed stored data into an audio waveform
Although the mechanisms used for storing speech by commercial devices are
not widely advertised by the manufacturers the talking calculator almost
certainly uses linear predictive coding em a technique that we will examine
in Chapter 6
The speech quality is very poor because of the highly compressed storage and
words are spoken in a grating monotone
However because of the very small vocabulary the quality is certainly good
enough for reliable identification
sh 12  Computer-generated wiring instructions
pp
I mentioned earlier that one big advantage of speech over visual output is that
it leaves the eyes free for other tasks
When wiring telephone equipment during manufacture the operator needs to use
his hands as well as eyes to keep his place in the task
For some time tape-recorded instructions have been used for this in certain
manufacturing plants  For example the instruction
LB
NI
Red 25    11A terminal strip    7A tube socket
LE
directs the operator to cut 25 of red wire attach one end to a specified point
on the terminal strip and attach the other to a pin of the tube socket  The
tape recorder is fitted with a pedal switch to allow a sequence of such instructions
to be executed by the operator at his own pace
pp
The usual way of recording the instruction tape is to have a human reader
dictate them from a printed list
The tape is then checked against the list by another listener to ensure that
the instructions are correct  Since wiring lists are usually stored and
maintained in machine-readable form it is natural to consider whether speech
synthesis techniques could be used to generate the acoustic tape directly by
a computer Flanagan
