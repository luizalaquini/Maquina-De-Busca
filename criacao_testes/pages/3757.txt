The man and the boy came out to watch them leave The man wished them luck and told them to come back in better times while the lad stood silent his crossbow under his arm Take up the spear or maul Jaime told him they’ll serve you better The boy stared at him distrustfully So much for friendly advice He shrugged turned his horse and never looked back

Ser Cleos was all complaints as they rode out still in mourning for his lost featherbed They rode east along the bank of the moonlit river The Red Fork was very broad here but shallow its banks all mud and reeds Jaime’s mount plodded along placidly though the poor old thing had a tendency to want to drift off to the side of his good eye It felt good to be mounted once more He had not been on a horse since Robb Stark’s archers had killed his destrier under him in the Whispering Wood

When they reached the burned village a choice of equally unpromising roads confronted them narrow tracks deeply rutted by the carts of farmers hauling their grain to the river One wandered off toward the southeast and soon vanished amidst the trees they could see in the distance while the other straighter and stonier arrowed due south Brienne considered them briefly and then swung her horse onto the southern road Jaime was pleasantly surprised it was the same choice he would have made

But this is the road the innkeep warned us against Ser Cleos objected

He was no innkeep She hunched gracelessly in the saddle but seemed to have a sure seat nonetheless The man took too great an interest in our choice of route and those woods… such places are notorious haunts of outlaws He may have been urging us into a trap

Clever wench Jaime smiled at his cousin Our host has friends down that road I would venture The ones whose mounts gave that stable such a memorable aroma

He may have been lying about the river as well to put us on these horses the wench said but I could not take the risk There will be soldiers at the ruby ford and the crossroads

Well she may be ugly but she’s not entirely stupid Jaime gave her a grudging smile

The ruddy light from the upper windows of the stone towerhouse gave them warning of its presence a long way off and Brienne led them off into the fields Only when the stronghold was well to the rear did they angle back and find the road again

Half the night passed before the wench allowed that it might be safe to stop By then all three of them were drooping in their saddles They sheltered in a small grove of oak and ash beside a sluggish stream The wench would allow no fire so they shared a midnight supper of stale oatcakes and salt fish The night was strangely peaceful The half-moon sat overhead in a black felt sky surrounded by stars Off in the distance some wolves were howling One of their horses whickered nervously There was no other sound The war has not touched this place Jaime thought He was glad to be here glad to be alive glad to be on his way back to Cersei

I’ll take the first watch Brienne told Ser Cleos and Frey was soon snoring softly

Jaime sat against the bole of an oak and wondered what Cersei and Tyrion were doing just now Do you have any siblings my lady he asked

Brienne squinted at him suspiciously No I was my father’s only s—child

Jaime chuckled Son you meant to say Does he think of you as a son You make a queer sort of daughter to be sure

Wordless she turned away from him her knuckles tight on her sword hilt What a wretched creature this one is She reminded him of Tyrion in some queer way though at first blush two people could scarcely be any more dissimilar Perhaps it was that thought of his brother that made him say I did not intend to give offense Brienne Forgive me

Your crimes are past forgiving Kingslayer

That name again Jaime twisted idly at his chains Why do I enrage you so I’ve never done you harm that I know of

You’ve harmed others Those you were sworn to protect The weak the innocent…

…the king It always came back to Aerys Don’t presume to judge what you do not understand wench

My name is—

—Brienne yes Has anyone ever told you that you’re as tedious as you are ugly

You will not provoke me to anger Kingslayer

Oh I might if I cared enough to try

Why did you take the oath she demanded Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all it stood for

Why What could he say that she might possibly understand I was a boy Fifteen It was a great honor for one so young

That is no answer she said scornfully

You would not like the truth He had joined the Kingsguard for love of course

Their father had summoned Cersei to court when she was twelve hoping to make her a royal marriage He refused every offer for her hand preferring to keep her with him in the Tower of the Hand while she grew older and more womanly and ever more beautiful No doubt he was waiting for Prince Viserys to mature or perhaps for Rhaegar’s wife to die in childbed Elia of Dorne was never the healthiest of women

Jaime meantime had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crakehall and earned his spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood But when he made a brief call at King’s Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock chiefly to see his sister Cersei took him aside and whispered that Lord Tywin meant to marry him to Lysa Tully had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower But if Jaime took the white he could be near her always Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in his sleep as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion Aerys would want a young man to take his place so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one

Father will never consent Jaime objected

The king won’t ask him And once it’s done Father can’t object not openly Aerys had Ser Ilyn Payne’s tongue torn out just for boasting that it was the Hand who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms The captain of the Hand’s guard and yet Father dared not try and stop it He won’t stop this either

But Jaime said there’s Casterly Rock…

Is it a rock you want Or me

He remembered that night as if it were yesterday They spent it in an old inn on Eel Alley well away from watchful eyes Cersei had come to him dressed as a simple serving wench which somehow excited him all the more Jaime had never seen her more passionate Every time he went to sleep she woke him again By morning Casterly Rock seemed a small price to pay to be near her always He gave his consent and Cersei promised to do the rest

A moon’s turn later a royal raven arrived at Casterly Rock to inform him that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard He was commanded to present himself to the king during the great tourney at Harrenhal to say his vows and don his cloak

Jaime’s investiture freed him from Lysa Tully Elsewise nothing went as planned His father had never been more furious He could not object openly—Cersei had judged that correctly—but he resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock taking his daughter with him Instead of being together Cersei and Jaime just changed places and he found himself alone at court guarding a mad king while four lesser men took their turns dancing on knives in his father’s ill-fitting shoes So swiftly did the Hands rise and fall that Jaime remembered their heraldry better than their faces The horn-of-plenty Hand and the dancing griffins Hand had both been exiled the mace-and-dagger Hand dipped in wildfire and burned alive Lord Rossart had been the last His sigil had been a burning torch an unfortunate choice given the fate of his predecessor but the alchemist had been elevated largely because he shared the king’s passion for fire I ought to have drowned Rossart instead of gutting him

Brienne was still awaiting his answer Jaime said You are not old enough to have known Aerys Targaryen…

She would not hear it Aerys was mad and cruel no one has ever denied that He was still king crowned and anointed And you had swom to protect him

I know what I swore

And what you did She loomed above him six feet of freckled frowning horse-toothed disapproval

Yes and what you did as well We’re both kingslayers here if what I’ve heard is true

I never harmed Renly I’ll kill the man who says I did

Best start with Cleos then And you’ll have a deal of killing to do after that the way he tells the tale

Lies Lady Catelyn was there when His Grace was murdered she saw There was a shadow The candles guttered and the air grew cold and there was blood—

Oh very good Jaime laughed Your wits are quicker than mine I confess it When they found me standing over my dead king I never thought to say ‘No no it wasn’t me it was a shadow a terrible cold shadow’ He laughed again Tell me true one kingslayer to another—did the Starks pay you to slit his throat or was it Stannis Had Renly spurned you was that the way of it Or perhaps your moon’s blood was on you Never give a wench a sword when she’s bleeding

For a moment Jaime thought Brienne might strike him A step closer and I’ll snatch that dagger from her sheath and bury it up her womb He gathered a leg under him ready to spring but the wench did not move It is a rare and precious gift to be a knight she said and even more so a knight of the Kingsguard It is a gift given to few a gift you scorned and soiled

A gift you want desperately wench and can never have I earned my knighthood Nothing was given to me I won a tourney mêlée at thirteen when I was yet a squire At fifteen I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood and he knighted me on the battlefield It was that white cloak that soiled me not the other way around So spare me your envy It was the gods who neglected to give you a cock not me

The look Brienne gave him then was full of loathing She would gladly hack me to pieces but for her precious vow he reflected Good I’ve had enough of feeble pieties and maidens’ judgments The wench stalked off without saying a word Jaime curled up beneath his cloak hoping to dream of Cersei

But when he closed his eyes it was Aerys Targaryen he saw pacing alone in his throne room picking at his scabbed and bleeding hands The fool was always cutting himself on the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne Jaime had slipped in through the king’s door clad in his golden armor sword in hand The golden armor not the white but no one ever remembers that Would that I had taken off that damned cloak as well

When Aerys saw the blood on his blade he demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin’s I want him dead the traitor I want his head you’ll bring me his head or you’ll burn with all the rest All the traitors Rossart says they are inside the walls He’s gone to make them a warm welcome Whose blood Whose
