Renly laughed Stannis that’s a very pretty sword I’ll grant you but I think the glow off it has ruined your eyes Look across the fields brother Can you see all those banners

Do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king

Tyrell swords will make me king Rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king with axe and mace and warhammer Tarth arrows and Penrose lances Fossoway Cuy Mullendore Estermont Selmy Hightower Oakheart Crane Caswell Blackbar Morrigen Beesbury Shermer Dunn Footly… even House Florent your own wife’s brothers and uncles they will make me king All the chivalry of the south rides with me and that is the least part of my power My foot is coming behind a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes And you will destroy me With what pray That paltry rabble I see there huddled under the castle walls I’ll call them five thousand and be generous codfish lords and onion knights and sellswords Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts You have fewer than four hundred horse my scouts tell me—freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are Stannis that host of yours won’t survive the first charge of my vanguard

We shall see brother Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis slid his sword back into its scabbard Come the dawn we shall see

I hope your new god’s a merciful one brother

Stannis snorted and galloped away disdainful The red priestess lingered a moment behind Look to your own sins Lord Renly she said as she wheeled her horse around

Catelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few waited their return That was amusing if not terribly profitable he commented I wonder where I can get a sword like that Well doubtless Loras will make me a gift of it after the battle it grieves me that it must come to this

You have a cheerful way of grieving said Catelyn whose distress was not feigned

Do I Renly shrugged So be it Stannis was never the most cherished of brothers I confess Do you suppose this tale of his is true If Joffrey is the Kingslayer’s get—

—your brother is the lawful heir

While he lives Renly admitted Though it’s a fool’s law wouldn’t you agree Why the oldest son and not the best-fitted The crown will suit me as it never suited Robert and would not suit Stannis I have it in me to be a great king strong yet generous clever just diligent loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies yet capable of forgiveness patient—

—humble Catelyn supplied

Renly laughed You must allow a king some flaws my lady

Catelyn felt very tired It had all been for nothing The Baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while her son faced the Lannisters alone and nothing she could say or do would stop it It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father’s eyes she thought That much at least I can do I may be a poor envoy but I am a good mourner gods save me

Their camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south It was far more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the Mander though only a quarter as large When he’d learned of his brother’s assault on Storm’s End Renly had split his forces much as Robb had done at the Twins His great mass of foot he had left behind at Bitterbridge with his young queen his wagons carts draft animals and all his cumbersome siege machinery while Renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east

How like his brother Robert he was even in that… only Robert had always had Eddard Stark to temper his boldness with caution Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to bring up his whole force to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers That choice Renly had denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother He had outdistanced his supply lines left food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen He must come to battle soon or starve

Catelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied Renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment Inside the walls of green silk his captains and lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley My brother has not changed their young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the gold-and-jade crown from his brow Castles and courtesies will not appease him he must have blood Well I am of a mind to grant his wish

Your Grace I see no need for battle here Lord Mathis Rowan put in The castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm’s End Let Lord Stannis have his siege He will find no joy in it and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless we will take King’s Landing

And have men say I feared to face Stannis

Only fools will say that Lord Mathis argued

Renly looked to the others What say you all

I say that Stannis is a danger to you Lord Randyll Tarly declared Leave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger while your own power is diminished by battle The Lannisters will not be beaten in a day By the time you are done with them Lord Stannis may be as strong as you… or stronger

Others chorused their agreement The king looked pleased We shall fight then

I have failed Robb as I failed Ned Catelyn thought My lord she announced If you are set on battle my purpose here is done I ask your leave to return to Riverrun

You do not have it Renly seated himself on a camp chair

She stiffened I had hoped to help you make a peace my lord I will not help you make a war

Renly gave a shrug I daresay we’ll prevail without your five-and-twenty my lady I do not mean for you to take part in the battle only to watch it
