1421 The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed good were it for that man
if he had never been born

1422 And as they did eat Jesus took bread and blessed and brake
it and gave to them and said Take eat this is my body

1423 And he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to
them and they all drank of it

1424 And he said unto them This is my blood of the new testament
which is shed for many

1425 Verily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God

1426 And when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
Olives

1427 And Jesus saith unto them All ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written I will smite the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scattered

1428 But after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee

1429 But Peter said unto him Although all shall be offended yet
will not I

1430 And Jesus saith unto him Verily I say unto thee That this day
even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me
thrice

1431 But he spake the more vehemently If I should die with thee I
will not deny thee in any wise Likewise also said they all

1432 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane and he
saith to his disciples Sit ye here while I shall pray

1433 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John and began to be
sore amazed and to be very heavy 1434 And saith unto them My soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch

1435 And he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed
that if it were possible the hour might pass from him

1436 And he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee
take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what
thou wilt

1437 And he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter
Simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour  1438 Watch
ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation The spirit truly is ready
but the flesh is weak

1439 And again he went away and prayed and spake the same words

1440 And when he returned he found them asleep again for their
eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him

1441 And he cometh the third time and saith unto them Sleep on now
and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the Son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners

1442 Rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand

1443 And immediately while he yet spake cometh Judas one of the
twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from
the chief priests and the scribes and the elders

1444 And he that betrayed him had given them a token saying
Whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away
safely

1445 And as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and
saith Master master and kissed him

1446 And they laid their hands on him and took him

1447 And one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant
of the high priest and cut off his ear

1448 And Jesus answered and said unto them Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and with staves to take me  1449 I was
daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the
scriptures must be fulfilled

1450 And they all forsook him and fled

1451 And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth
cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him 1452
And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked

1453 And they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes

1454 And Peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the
high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the
fire
