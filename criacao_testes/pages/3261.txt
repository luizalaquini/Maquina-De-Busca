he was blind said Is not this he that sat and begged  99 Some
said This is he others said He is like him but he said I am he

910 Therefore said they unto him How were thine eyes opened  911
He answered and said A man that is called Jesus made clay and
anointed mine eyes and said unto me Go to the pool of Siloam and
wash and I went and washed and I received sight

912 Then said they unto him Where is he He said I know not

913 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind

914 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened
his eyes

915 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
sight He said unto them He put clay upon mine eyes and I washed
and do see

916 Therefore said some of the Pharisees This man is not of God
because he keepeth not the sabbath day Others said How can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles And there was a division among
them

917 They say unto the blind man again What sayest thou of him that
he hath opened thine eyes He said He is a prophet

918 But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been
blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight

919 And they asked them saying Is this your son who ye say was
born blind how then doth he now see  920 His parents answered them
and said We know that this is our son and that he was born blind
921 But by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened
his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for
himself

922 These words spake his parents because they feared the Jews for
the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was
Christ he should be put out of the synagogue

923 Therefore said his parents He is of age ask him

924 Then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him
Give God the praise we know that this man is a sinner

925 He answered and said Whether he be a sinner or no I know not
one thing I know that whereas I was blind now I see

926 Then said they to him again What did he to thee how opened he
thine eyes  927 He answered them I have told you already and ye
did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his
disciples  928 Then they reviled him and said Thou art his
disciple but we are Moses disciples

929 We know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we know
not from whence he is

930 The man answered and said unto them Why herein is a marvellous
thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine
eyes

931 Now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a
worshipper of God and doeth his will him he heareth

932 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind

933 If this man were not of God he could do nothing

934 They answered and said unto him Thou wast altogether born in
sins and dost thou teach us And they cast him out

935 Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found
him he said unto him Dost thou believe on the Son of God  936 He
answered and said Who is he Lord that I might believe on him  937
And Jesus said unto him Thou hast both seen him and it is he that
talketh with thee

938 And he said Lord I believe And he worshipped him

939 And Jesus said For judgment I am come into this world that they
which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind

940 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words
and said unto him Are we blind also  941 Jesus said unto them If
ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say We see
therefore your sin remaineth

101 Verily verily I say unto you He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a
thief and a robber

102 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep

103 To him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he
calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out

104 And when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them
