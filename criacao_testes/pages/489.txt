A coin of great value

Arya bit it It was so hard it could only be iron Is it worth enough to buy a horse

It is not meant for the buying of horses

Then what good is it

As well ask what good is life what good is death If the day comes when you would find me again give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him—valar morghulis

Valar morghulis Arya repeated It wasn’t hard Her fingers closed tight over the coin Across the yard she could hear men dying Please don’t go Jaqen

Jaqen is as dead as Arry he said sadly and I have promises to keep Valar morghulis Arya Stark Say it again

Valar morghulis she said once more and the stranger in Jaqen’s clothes bowed to her and stalked off through the darkness cloak swirling She was alone with the dead men They deserved to die Arya told herself remembering all those Ser Amory Lorch had killed at the holdfast by the lake

The cellars under Kingspyre were empty when she returned to her bed of straw She whispered her names to her pillow and when she was done she added Valar morghulis in a small soft voice wondering what it meant

Come dawn Pinkeye and the others were back all but one boy who’d been killed in the fighting for no reason that anyone could say Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood by light of day complaining all the while that his old bones could not abide steps When he returned he told them that Harrenhal had been taken Them Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amory’s lot in their beds and the rest at table after they were good and drunk The new lord will be here before the day’s out with his whole host He’s from the wild north up where that Wall is and they say he’s a hard one This lord or that lord there’s still work to be done Any foolery and I’ll whip the skin off your back He looked at Arya when he said that but never said a word to her about where she had been the night before

All morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag the corpses to the Flowstone Yard where a pyre was laid to dispose of them Shagwell the Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging them by the hair and making them talk What did you die of one head asked Hot weasel soup replied the second

Arya was set to mopping up dried blood No one said a word to her beyond the usual but every so often she would notice people looking at her strangely Robett Glover and the other men they’d freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon and then Shagwell and his stupid talking heads started in about the weasel soup She would have told him to shut up but she was scared to The fool was half-mad and she’d heard that he’d once killed a man for not laughing at one of his japes He better shut his mouth or I’ll put him on my list with the rest she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain It was almost evenfall when the new master of Harrenhal arrived He had a plain face beardless and ordinary notable only for his queer pale eyes Neither plump thin nor muscular he wore black ringmail and a spotted pink cloak The sigil on his banner looked like a man dipped in blood On your knees for the Lord of the Dreadfort shouted his squire a boy no older than Arya and Harrenhal knelt

Vargo Hoat came forward My lord Harrenhal ith yourth

The lord gave answer but too softly for Arya to hear Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks came up to join them After some brief talk Ser Aenys led them over to Rorge and Biter Arya was surprised to see them still here somehow she would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did Arya heard the harsh sound of Rorge’s voice but not what he was saying Then Shagwell pounced on her dragging her out across the yard My lord my lord he sang tugging at her wrist here’s the weasel who made the soup

Let go Arya said wriggling out of his grasp

The lord regarded her Only his eyes moved they were very pale the color of ice How old are you child

She had to think for a moment to remember Ten

Ten my lord he reminded her Are you fond of animals

Some kinds My lord

A thin smile twitched across his lips But not lions it would seem Nor manticores

She did not know what to say to that so she said nothing

They tell me you are called Weasel That will not serve What name did your mother give you

She bit her lip groping for another name Lommy had called her Lumpyhead Sansa used Horseface and her father’s men once dubbed her Arya Underfoot but she did not think any of those were the sort of name he wanted

Nymeria she said Only she called me Nan for short

You will call me my lord when you speak to me Nan the lord said mildly You are too young to be a Brave Companion I think and of the wrong sex Are you afraid of leeches child

They’re only leeches My lord

My squire could take a lesson from you it would seem Frequent leechings are the secret of a long life A man must purge himself of bad blood You will do I think For so long as I remain at Harrenhal Nan you shall be my cupbearer and serve me at table and in chambers
