So Blood for his pride a chair for his ambition Gold and land that goes without saying A sweet offer… yet sweets can be poisoned If I were the prince something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb Some token of good faith some sure safeguard against betrayal Varys smiled his slimiest smile Which one will you give him I wonder

Tyrion sighed You know don’t you

Since you put it that way—yes Tommen You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both

Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again You cheat 

Prince Tommen is a good boy

If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he’s still young he may even grow to be a good man

And a good king

Joffrey is king

And Tommen is heir should anything ill befall His Grace Tommen whose nature is so sweet and notably… tractable

You have a suspicious mind Varys

I shall take that as a tribute my lord In any case Prince Doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do him Very deftly done I would say… but for one small flaw

The dwarf laughed Named Cersei

What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb Perhaps for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm the queen might be persuaded to send away Tommen or Myrcella But both of them Surely not

What Cersei does not know will never hurt me

And if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe

Why he said then I would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy And when Varys giggled he thought Three





SANSA

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

The words were the same on the hundredth reading as they’d been on the first when Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow She did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it The note was unsigned unsealed and the hand unfamiliar She crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home she breathed ever so faintly

What could it mean Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good Nervously she rubbed her stomach The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given her had faded to an ugly yellow but still hurt His fist had been mailed when he hit her It was her own fault She must learn to hide her feelings better so as not to anger Joffrey When she heard that the Imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall she had forgotten herself and said I hope the Others get him The king had not been pleased

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

Sansa had prayed so hard Could this be her answer at last a true knight sent to save her Perhaps it was one of the Redwyne twins or bold Ser Balon Swann… or even Beric Dondarrion the young lord her friend Jeyne Poole had loved with his red-gold hair and the spray of stars on his black cloak

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

What if it was some cruel jape of Joffrey’s like the day he had taken her up to the battlements to show her Father’s head Or perhaps it was some subtle snare to prove she was not loyal If she went to the godswood would she find Ser Ilyn Payne waiting for her sitting silent under the heart tree with Ice in his hand his pale eyes watching to see if she’d come

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

When the door opened she hurriedly stuffed the note under her sheet and sat on it It was her bedmaid the mousy one with the limp brown hair What do you want Sansa demanded

Will milady be wanting a bath tonight

A fire I think… I feel a chill She was shivering though the day had been hot

As you wish

Sansa watched the girl suspiciously Had she seen the note Had she put it under the pillow It did not seem likely she seemed a stupid girl not one you’d want delivering secret notes but Sansa did not know her The queen had her servants changed every fortnight to make certain none of them befriended her

When a fire was blazing in the hearth Sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered her out The girl was quick to obey as ever but Sansa decided there was something sly about her eyes Doubtless she was scurrying off to report to the queen or maybe Varys All her maids spied on her she was certain

Once alone she thrust the note in the flames watching the parchment curl and blacken Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home She drifted to her window Below she could see a short knight in moon-pale armor and a heavy white cloak pacing the drawbridge From his height it could only be Ser Preston Greenfield The queen had given her freedom of the castle but even so he would want to know where she was going if she tried to leave Maegor’s Holdfast at this time of night What was she to tell him Suddenly she was glad she had burned the note

She unlaced her gown and crawled into her bed but she did not sleep Was he still there she wondered How long will he wait It was so cruel to send her a note and tell her nothing The thoughts went round and round in her head

If only she had someone to tell her what to do She missed Septa Mordane and even more Jeyne Poole her truest friend The septa had lost her head with the rest for the crime of serving House Stark Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne who had disappeared from her rooms afterward never to be mentioned again She tried not to think of them too often yet sometimes the memories came unbidden and then it was hard to hold back the tears Once in a while Sansa even missed her sister By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell dancing and sewing playing with Bran and baby Rickon even riding through the winter town if she liked Sansa was allowed to go riding too but only in the bailey and it got boring going round in a circle all day

She was wide awake when she heard the shouting Distant at first then growing louder Many voices yelling together She could not make out the words And there were horses as well and pounding feet shouts of command She crept to her window and saw men running on the walls carrying spears and torches Go back to your bed Sansa told herself this is nothing that concerns you just some new trouble out in the city The talk at the wells had all been of troubles in the city of late People were crowding in running from the war and many had no way to live save by robbing and killing each other Go to bed

But when she looked the white knight was gone the bridge across the dry moat down but undefended

Sansa turned away without thinking and ran to her wardrobe Oh what am I doing she asked herself as she dressed This is madness She could see the lights of many torches on the curtain walls Had Stannis and Renly come at last to kill Joffrey and claim their brother’s throne If so the guards would raise the drawbridge cutting off Maegor’s Holdfast from the outer castle Sansa threw a plain grey cloak over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat If it is some trap better that I die than let them hurt me more she told herself She hid the blade under her cloak

A column of red-cloaked swordsmen ran past as she slipped out into the night She waited until they were well past before she darted across the undefended drawbridge In the yard men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of their horses She glimpsed Ser Preston near the stables with three others of the Kingsguard white cloaks bright as the moon as they helped Joffrey into his armor Her breath caught in her throat when she saw the king Thankfully he did not see her He was shouting for his sword and crossbow

The noise receded as she moved deeper into the castle never daring to look back for fear that Joffrey might be watching… or worse following The serpentine steps twisted ahead striped by bars of flickering light from the narrow windows above Sansa was panting by the time she reached the top She ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a wall to catch her breath When something brushed against her leg she almost jumped out of her skin but it was only a cat a ragged black tom with a chewed-off ear The creature spit at her and leapt away

By the time she reached the godswood the noises had faded to a faint rattle of steel and a distant shouting Sansa pulled her cloak tighter The air was rich with the smells of earth and leaf Lady would have liked this place she thought There was something wild about a godswood even here in the heart of the castle at the heart of the city you could feel the old gods watching with a thousand unseen eyes

Sansa had favored her mother’s gods over her father’s She loved the statues the pictures in leaded glass the fragrance of burning incense the septons with their robes and crystals the magical play of the rainbows over altars inlaid with mother-of-pearl and onyx and lapis lazuli Yet she could not deny that the godswood had a certain power too Especially by night Help me she prayed send me a friend a true knight to champion me…

She moved from tree to tree feeling the roughness of the bark beneath her fingers Leaves brushed at her cheeks Had she come too late He would not have left so soon would he Or had he even been here Dare she risk calling out It seemed so hushed and still here…

I feared you would not come child

Sansa whirled A man stepped out of the shadows heavyset thick of neck shambling He wore a dark grey robe with the cowl pulled forward but when a thin sliver of moonlight touched his cheek she knew him at once by the blotchy skin and web of broken veins beneath Ser Dontos she breathed heartbroken Was it you

Yes my lady When he moved closer she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath Me He reached out a hand

Sansa shrank back Don’t She slid her hand under her cloak to her hidden knife What… what do you want with me

Only to help you Dontos said as you helped me

You’re drunk aren’t you
