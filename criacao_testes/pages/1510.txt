Mance donned his helm with its raven wings His men were mounted up as well Arrowhead Mance snapped to me form wedge Yet when he slammed his heels into the mare and flew across the field at the rangers the men who raced to catch him lost all semblance of formation

Jon took a step toward the tent thinking of the Horn of Winter but the shadowcat blocked him tail lashing The beast’s nostrils flared and slaver ran from his curved front teeth He smells my fear He missed Ghost more than ever then The two wolves were behind him growling

Banners he heard Varamyr murmur I see golden banners oh… A mammoth lumbered by trumpeting a half-dozen bowmen in the wooden tower on its back The king… no…

Then the skinchanger threw back his head and screamed

The sound was shocking ear-piercing thick with agony Varamyr fell writhing and the ’cat was screaming too… and high high in the eastern sky against the wall of cloud Jon saw the eagle burning For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star wreathed in red and gold and orange its wings beating wildly at the air as if it could fly from the pain Higher it flew and higher and higher still

The scream brought Val out of the tent white-faced What is it what’s happened Varamyr’s wolves were fighting each other and the shadowcat had raced off into the trees but the man was still twisting on the ground What’s wrong with him Val demanded horrified Where’s Mance

There Jon pointed Gone to fight The king led his ragged wedge into a knot of rangers his sword flashing

Gone He can’t be gone not now It’s started

The battle He watched the rangers scatter before Harma’s bloody dog’s head The raiders screamed and hacked and chased the men in black back into the trees But there were more men coming from the wood a column of horse Knights on heavy horse Jon saw Harma had to regroup and wheel to meet them but half of her men had raced too far ahead

The birth Val was shouting at him

Trumpets were blowing all around loud and brazen The wildlings have no trumpets only warhorns They knew that as well as he did the sound sent free folk running in confusion some toward the fighting others away A mammoth was stomping through a flock of sheep that three men were trying to herd off west The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines but they were too late too disorganized too slow The enemy was emerging from the forest from the east the northeast the north three great columns of heavy horse all dark glinting steel and bright wool surcoats Not the men of Eastwatch those had been no more than a line of scouts An army The king Jon was as confused as the wildlings Could Robb have returned Had the boy on the Iron Throne finally bestirred himself You best get back inside the tent he told Val

Across the field one column had washed over Harma Dogshead Another smashed into the flank of Tormund’s spearmen as he and his sons desperately tried to turn them The giants were climbing onto their mammoths though and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all he could see how the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains But there was fear on the wildling side as well hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle some of them blundering right under the hooves of garrons He saw an old woman’s dog cart veer into the path of three chariots to send them crashing into each other

Gods Val whispered gods why are they doing this

Go inside the tent and stay with Dalla It’s not safe out here It wouldn’t be a great deal safer inside but she didn’t need to hear that

I need to find the midwife Val said

You’re the midwife I’ll stay here until Mance comes back He had lost sight of Mance but now he found him again cutting his way through a knot of mounted men The mammoths had shattered the center column but the other two were closing like pincers On the eastern edge of the camps some archers were loosing fire arrows at the tents He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from his saddle and fling him forty feet with a flick of its trunk Wildlings streamed past women and children running from the battle some with men hurrying them along A few of them gave Jon dark looks but Longclaw was in his hand and no one troubled him Even Varamyr fled crawling off on his hands and knees

More and more men were pouring from the trees not only knights now but freeriders and mounted bowmen and men-at-arms in jacks and kettle helms dozens of men hundreds of men A blaze of banners flew above them The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils but he glimpsed a seahorse a field of birds a ring of flowers And yellow so much yellow yellow banners with a red device whose arms were those

East and north and northeast he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight but the attackers rode right over them The free folk still had the numbers but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses In the thickest part of the fray Jon saw Mance standing tall in his stirrups His red-and-black cloak and raven-winged helm made him easy to pick out He had his sword raised and men were rallying to him when a wedge of knights smashed into them with lance and sword and longaxe Mance’s mare went up on her hind legs kicking and a spear took her through the breast Then the steel tide washed over him

It’s done Jon thought they’re breaking The wildlings were running throwing down their weapons Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and Thenns in bronze scales they were running Mance was gone someone was waving Harma’s head on a pole Tormund’s lines had broken Only the giants on their mammoths were holding hairy islands in a red steel sea The fires were leaping from tent to tent and some of the tall pines were going up as well And through the smoke another wedge of armored riders came on barded horses Floating above them were the largest banners yet royal standards as big as sheets a yellow one with long pointed tongues that showed a flaming heart and another like a sheet of beaten gold with a black stag prancing and rippling in the wind

Robert Jon thought for one mad moment remembering poor Owen but when the trumpets blew again and the knights charged the name they cried was Stannis Stannis STANNIS

Jon turned away and went inside the tent





Arya


Outside the inn on a weathered gibbet a woman’s bones were twisting and rattling at every gust of wind

I know this inn There hadn’t been a gibbet outside the door when she had slept here with her sister Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane though We don’t want to go in Arya decided suddenly there might be ghosts

You know how long it’s been since I had a cup of wine Sandor swung down from the saddle Besides we need to learn who holds the ruby ford Stay with the horses if you want it’s no hair off my arse

What if they know you Sandor no longer troubled to hide his face He no longer seemed to care who knew him They might want to take you captive

Let them try He loosened his longsword in its scabbard and pushed through the door

Arya would never have a better chance to escape She could ride off on Craven and take Stranger too She chewed her lip Then she led the horses to the stables and went in after him

They know him The silence told her that But that wasn’t the worst thing She knew them too Not the skinny innkeep nor the women nor the fieldhands by the hearth But the others The soldiers She knew the soldiers

Looking for your brother Sandor Polliver’s hand was down the bodice of the girl on his lap but now he slid it out

Looking for a cup of wine Innkeep a flagon of red Clegane threw a handful of coppers on the floor

I don’t want no trouble ser the innkeep said

Then don’t call me ser His mouth twitched Are you deaf fool I ordered wine As the man ran off Clegane shouted after him Two cups The girl’s thirsty too

There are only three Arya thought Polliver gave her a fleeting glance and the boy beside him never looked at her at all but the third one gazed long and hard He was a man of middling height and build with a face so ordinary that it was hard to say how old he was The Tickler The Tickler and Polliver both The boy was a squire judging by his age and dress He had a big white pimple on one side of his nose and some red ones on his forehead Is this the lost puppy Ser Gregor spoke of he asked the Tickler The one who piddled in the rushes and ran off

The Tickler put a warning hand on the boy’s arm and gave a short sharp shake of his head Arya read that plain enough

The squire didn’t or else he didn’t care Ser said his puppy brother tucked his tail between his legs when the battle got too warm at King’s Landing He said he ran off whimpering He gave the Hound a stupid mocking grin

Clegane studied the boy and never said a word Polliver shoved the girl off his lap and got to his feet The lad’s drunk he said The man-at-arms was almost as tall as the Hound though not so heavily muscled A spade-shaped beard covered his jaws and jowls thick and black and neatly trimmed but his head was more bald than not He can’t hold his wine is all

Then he shouldn’t drink

The puppy doesn’t scare… the boy began till the Tickler casually twisted his ear between thumb and forefinger The words became a squeal of pain

The innkeep came scurrying back with two stone cups and a flagon on a pewter platter Sandor lifted the flagon to his mouth Arya could see the muscles in his neck working as he gulped When he slammed it back down on the table half the wine was gone Now you can pour Best pick up those coppers too it’s the only coin you’re like to see today

We’ll pay when we’re done drinking said Polliver

When you’re done drinking you’ll tickle the innkeep to see where he keeps his gold The way you always do

The innkeep suddenly remembered something in the kitchen The locals were leaving too and the girls were gone The only sound in the common room was the faint crackling of the fire in the hearth We should go too Arya knew

If you’re looking for Ser you come too late Polliver said He was at Harrenhal but now he’s not The queen sent for him He wore three blades on his belt Arya saw a longsword on his left hip and on his right a dagger and a slimmer blade too long to be a dirk and too short to be a sword King Joffrey’s dead you know he added Poisoned at his own wedding feast

Arya edged farther into the room Joffrey’s dead She could almost see him with his blond curls and his mean smile and his fat soft lips Joffrey’s dead She knew it ought to make her happy but somehow she still felt empty inside Joffrey was dead but if Robb was dead too what did it matter

So much for my brave brothers of the Kingsguard The Hound gave a snort of contempt Who killed him

The Imp it’s thought Him and his little wife

What wife
