Jaime would welcome a good rain The dungeons of Riverrun were not the cleanest place in the Seven Kingdoms By now he must smell like an overripe cheese

Cleos squinted downriver Smoke

A thin grey finger crooked them on It was rising from the south bank several miles on twisting and curling Below Jaime made out the smouldering remains of a large building and a live oak full of dead women

The crows had scarcely started on their corpses The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats and when the wind blew they twisted and swayed This was not chivalrously done said Brienne when they were close enough to see it clearly No true knight would condone such wanton butchery

True knights see worse every time they ride to war wench said Jaime And do worse yes

Brienne turned the rudder toward the shore I’ll leave no innocents to be food for crows

A heartless wench Crows need to eat as well Stay to the river and leave the dead alone woman

They landed upstream of where the great oak leaned out over the water As Brienne lowered the sail Jaime climbed out clumsy in his chains The Red Fork filled his boots and soaked through the ragged breeches Laughing he dropped to his knees plunged his head under the water and came up drenched and dripping His hands were caked with dirt and when he rubbed them clean in the current they seemed thinner and paler than he remembered His legs were stiff as well and unsteady when he put his weight upon them I was too bloody long in Hoster Tully’s dungeon

Brienne and Cleos dragged the skiff onto the bank The corpses hung above their heads ripening in death like foul fruit One of us will need to cut them down the wench said

I’ll climb Jaime waded ashore clanking Just get these chains off

The wench was staring up at one of the dead women Jaime shuffled closer with small stutter steps the only kind the foot-long chain permitted When he saw the crude sign hung about the neck of the highest corpse he smiled They Lay With Lions he read Oh yes woman this was most unchivalrously done    but by your side not mine I wonder who they were these women

Tavern wenches said Ser Cleos Frey This was an inn I remember it now Some men of my escort spent the night here when we last returned to Riverrun Nothing remained of the building but the stone foundation and a tangle of collapsed beams charred black Smoke still rose from the ashes

Jaime left brothels and whores to his brother Tyrion Cersei was the only woman he had ever wanted The girls pleasured some of my lord father’s soldiers it would seem Perhaps served them food and drink That’s how they earned their traitors’ collars with a kiss and a cup of ale He glanced up and down the river to make certain they were quite alone This is Bracken land Lord Jonos might have ordered them killed My father burned his castle I fear he loves us not

It might be Marq Piper’s work said Ser Cleos Or that wisp o’ the wood Beric Dondarrion though I’d heard he kills only soldiers Perhaps a band of Roose Bolton’s northmen

Bolton was defeated by my father on the Green Fork

But not broken said Ser Cleos He came south again when Lord Tywin marched against the fords The word at Riverrun was that he’d taken Harrenhal from Ser Amory Lorch

Jaime liked the sound of that not at all Brienne he said granting her the courtesy of the name in the hopes that she might listen if Lord Bolton holds Harrenhal both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely watched

He thought he saw a touch of uncertainty in her big blue eyes You are under my protection They’d need to kill me

I shouldn’t think that would trouble them

I am as good a fighter as you she said defensively I was one of King Renly’s chosen seven With his own hands he cloaked me with the striped silk of the Rainbow Guard

The Rainbow Guard You and six other girls was it A singer once said that all maids are fair in silk    but he never met you did he

The woman turned red We have graves to dig She went to climb the tree

The lower limbs of the oak were big enough for her to stand upon once she’d gotten up the trunk She walked amongst the leaves dagger in hand cutting down the corpses Flies swarmed around the bodies as they fell and the stench grew worse with each one she dropped This is a deal of trouble to take for whores Ser Cleos complained What are we supposed to dig with We have no spades and I will not use my sword I—

Brienne gave a shout She jumped down rather than climbing To the boat Be quick There’s a sail

They made what haste they could though Jaime could hardly run and had to be pulled back up into the skiff by his cousin Brienne shoved off with an oar and raised sail hurriedly Ser Cleos I’ll need you to row as well

He did as she bid The skiff began to cut the water a bit faster current wind and oars all worked for them Jaime sat chained peering upriver Only the top of the other sail was visible With the way the Red Fork looped it looked to be across the fields moving north behind a screen of trees while they moved south but he knew that was deceptive He lifted both hands to shade his eyes Mud red and watery blue he announced

Brienne’s big mouth worked soundlessly giving her the look of a cow chewing its cud Faster ser

The inn soon vanished behind them and they lost sight of the top of the sail as well but that meant nothing Once the pursuers swung around the loop they would become visible again We can hope the noble Tullys will stop to bury the dead whores I suppose The prospect of returning to his cell did not appeal to Jaime Tyrion could think of something clever now but all that occurs to me is to go at them with a sword

For the good part of an hour they played peek-and-seek with the pursuers sweeping around bends and between small wooded isles Just when they were starting to hope that somehow they might have left behind the pursuit the distant sail became visible again Ser Cleos paused in his stroke The Others take them He wiped sweat from his brow

Row Brienne said

That is a river galley coming after us Jaime announced after he’d watched for a while With every stroke it seemed to grow a little larger Nine oars on each side which means eighteen men More if they crowded on fighters as well as rowers And larger sails than ours We cannot outrun her

Ser Cleos froze at his oars Eighteen you said

Six for each of us I’d want eight but these bracelets hinder me somewhat Jaime held up his wrists Unless the Lady Brienne would be so kind as to unshackle me

She ignored him putting all her effort into her stroke

We had half a night’s start on them Jaime said They’ve been rowing since dawn resting two oars at a time They’ll be exhausted Just now the sight of our sail has given them a burst of strength but that will not last We ought to be able to kill a good many of them

Ser Cleos gaped But    there are eighteen

At the least More likely twenty or twenty-five

His cousin groaned We can’t hope to defeat eighteen

Did I say we could The best we can hope for is to die with swords in our hands He was perfectly sincere Jaime Lannister had never been afraid of death

Brienne broke off rowing Sweat had stuck strands of her flax-colored hair to her forehead and her grimace made her look homelier than ever You are under my protection she said her voice so thick with anger that it was almost a growl

He had to laugh at such fierceness She’s the Hound with teats he thought Or would be if she had any teats to speak of Then protect me wench Or free me to protect myself

The galley was skimming downriver a great wooden dragonfly The water around her was churned white by the furious action of her oars She was gaining visibly the men on her deck crowding forward as she came on Metal glinted in their hands and Jaime could see bows as well Archers He hated archers

At the prow of the onrushing galley stood a stocky man with a bald head bushy grey eyebrows and brawny arms Over his mail he wore a soiled white surcoat with a weeping willow embroidered in pale green but his cloak was fastened with a silver trout Riverrun’s captain of guards In his day Ser Robin Ryger had been a notably tenacious fighter but his day was done he was of an age with Hoster Tully and had grown old with his lord

When the boats were fifty yards apart Jaime cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted back over the water Come to wish me godspeed Ser Robin

Come to take you back Kingslayer Ser Robin Ryger bellowed How is it that you’ve lost your golden hair

I hope to blind my enemies with the sheen off my head It’s worked well enough for you

Ser Robin was unamused The distance between skiff and galley had shrunk to forty yards Throw your oars and your weapons into the river and no one need be harmed

Ser Cleos twisted around Jaime tell him we were freed by Lady Catelyn    an exchange of captives lawful   

Jaime told him for all the good it did Catelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun Ser Robin shouted back Four archers crowded into position on either side of him two standing and two kneeling Cast your swords into the water

I have no sword he returned but if I did I’d stick it through your belly and hack the balls off those four cravens
