who are more to the manner born his special power
morally physically and mentally was static owing
little or nothing to momentum as a rule
A close examination of the ground hereabout even
by the wan starlight only revealed how a portion of
what would have been casually called a wild slope had
been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose
this winter Detached hurdles thatched with straw
were stuck into the ground at various scattered points
amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek
ewes moved and rustled The ring of the sheep-bell
which had been silent during his absence recommenced
in tones that had more mellowness than clearness owing
to an increasing growth of surrounding wool This
continued till Oak withdrew again from the flock He
 --  returned to the hut bringing in his arms a new-born
lamb consisting of four legs large enough for a full+
grown sheep united by a seemingly inconsiderable mem+
brane about half the substance of the legs collectively
which constituted the animals entire body just at present
The little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay
before the small stove where a can of milk was simmer+
ing Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it
and then pinching the snuff the cot being lighted
by a candle suspended by a twisted wire A rather
hard couch formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly
down covered half the floor of this little

habitation and
here the young man stretched himself along loosened
his woollen cravat and closed his eyes In about the
time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have
decided upon which side to lie Farmer Oak was asleep
The inside of the hut as it now presented itself was
cosy and alluring and the scarlet handful of fire in
addition to the candle reflecting its own genial colour
upon whatever it could reach flung associations of
enjoyment even over utensils and tools In the corner
stood the sheep-crook and along a shelf at one side
were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple prepara+
tions pertaining to ovine surgery and physic spirits of
wine turpentine tar magnesia ginger and castor-oil
being the chief On a triangular shelf across the corner
stood bread bacon cheese and a cup for ale or cider
which was supplied from a flagon beneath Beside the
provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been
called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious
hour The house was ventilated by two round holes
like the lights of a ships cabin with wood slides+
The lamb revived by the warmth began to bleat

from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness

hand had shifted again put on his hat took the lamb
in his arms and carried it into the darkness After
placing the little creature with its mother he stood and
carefully examined the sky to ascertain the time of
night from the altitudes of the stars
The Dog-star and Aldebaran pointing to the restless
Pleiades were half-way up the Southern sky and between
them hung Orion which gorgeous constellation never
burnt more vividly than now as it soared forth above
the rim of the landscape Castor and Pollux will

One oclock said Gabriel
Being a man not without a frequent consciousness
that there was some charm in this life he led he stood
still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument and
regarded it in an appreciative spirit as a work of art
superlatively beautiful For a moment he seemed
impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene or
rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass
of the sights and sounds of man Human shapesinterferences
troubles and joys were all as if they were not and there
seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being
save himself he could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side
  Occupied this with eyes stretched afar Oak gradually per+
ceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low
down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no
such thing It was an artificial light almost close at hand
 To find themselves utterly alone at night where company
is desirable and expected makes some people fearful but a
case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some
mysterious companionship when intuition sensation memory
analogy testimony probability induction -- every kind of
evidence in the logicians list -- have united to persuade con+
sciousness that it is quite in isolation
 Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed
through its lower boughs to the windy side A dim mass under
the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here
the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill so that at
its back part the roof was almost level with the ground In
front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with
tar as apreservative Through crevices in the roof and side
spread streaks and spots of light a combination of which made
the radiance that had attracted him Oak stepped up behind
