Oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be
moved back again to the days when they were strangers
Youll think it strange that I have come but -- -
O no not at all
But I thought -- Gabriel I have been uneasy in the
belief that I have offended you and that you are going
away on that account It grieved me very much and
I couldnt help coming
Offended me As if you could do that Bathsheba
Havent I she asked gladly  But what are you
going away for else
I am not going to emigrate you know I wasnt
aware that you would wish me not to when I told ee or I
shouldnt ha thought of doing it he said simply I
have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and shall
have it in my own hands at Lady-day You know Ive
had a share in it for some time Still that wouldnt
prevent my attending to your business as before hadnt
it been that things have been said about us
P 457
What said Bathsheba in surprise Things said
about you and me What are they
I cannot tell you
It would be wiser if you were to I think You have
played the part of mentor to me many times and I dont
see why you should fear to do it now
It is nothing that you have done this time The
top and tail ot is this -- that I am sniffing about here
and waiting for poor Boldwoods farm with a thought
of getting you some day
Getting me What does that mean
Marrying o ee in plain British You asked me to
tell so you mustnt blame me
Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a
cannon had been discharged by her ear which was what
Oak had expected Marrying me I didnt know it
was that you meant she said quietly Such a thing
as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of by far
Yes of course it is too absurd I dont desire any
such thing I should think that was plain enough by
this time Surely surely you be the last person in the
world I think of marrying It is too absurd as you say
Too -- s-s-soon were the words I used
I must beg your pardon for correcting you but you
said too absurd and so do I
I beg your pardon too she returned with tears
in her eyes Too soon was what I said But it
doesnt matter a bit -- not at ali-but I only meant
too soon Indeed I didnt Mr Oak and you must
believe me
Gabriel looked her long in the face but the firelight
being faint there was not much to be seen  Bathsheba
he said tenderly and in surprise and coming closer
if I only knew one thing -- whether you would allow me
to love you and win you and marry you after ali-if I
only knew that
But you never will know she murmured
Why
Because you never ask
Oh -- Oh said Gabriel with a low laugh of joyous+
ness My own dear -- -
P 458
You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter
this morning she interrupted It shows you didnt
care a bit about me and were ready to desert me like
all the rest of them It was very cruel of you consider+
ing I was the first sweetheart that you ever had and
you were the first I ever had and I shall not forget it
Now Bathsheba was ever anybody so provoking
he said laughing  You know it was purely that I as
an unmarried man carrying on a business for you as a
very taking young woman had a proper hard part to
play -- more particular that people knew I had a sort
of feeling foree and I fancied from the way we were
mentioned together that it might injure your good name
Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been caused
by it
And was that all
All
Oh how glad I am I came she exclaimed thank+
fully as she rose from her seat I have thought so
much more of you since I fancied you did not want
even to see me again But I must be going now or I
shall be missed Why Gabriel she said with a slight
laugh as they went to the door it seems exactly as if
I had come courting you -- how dreadful
And quite right too said Oak Ive danced at
your skittish heels my beautiful Bathsheba for many a
long mile and many a long day and it is hard to be+
grudge me this one visit
He accompanied her up the hill explaining to her
the details of his forthcoming tenure of the other farm
They spoke very little of their mutual  feeling pretty
phrases and warm expressions being probably un+
necessary between such tried friends Theirs was that
substantial affection which arises if any arises at all
when the two who are thrown together begin first by
knowing the rougher sides of each others character
and not the best till further on the romance growing
up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality
