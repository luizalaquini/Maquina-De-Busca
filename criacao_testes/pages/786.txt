I am ashamed the old man said It was me When it came my turn to die I told them where our gold was hidden

Brother said Thoros of Myr the only shame was not telling them at once

The outlaws sheltered that night in the brewhouse beside the little river Their hosts had a cache of food hidden beneath the floor of the stables so they shared a simple supper oaten bread onions and a watery cabbage soup tasting faintly of garlic Arya found a slice of carrot floating in her bowl and counted herself lucky The brothers never asked the outlaws for names They know Arya thought How could they not Lord Beric wore the lightning bolt on breastplate shield and cloak and Thoros his red robes or what remained of them One brother a young novice was bold enough to tell the red priest not to pray to his false god so long as he was under their roof Bugger that said Lem Lemoncloak He’s our god too and you owe us for your bloody lives And what’s false about him Might be your Smith can mend a broken sword but can he heal a broken man

Enough Lem Lord Beric commanded Beneath their roof we will honor their rules

The sun will not cease to shine if we miss a prayer or two Thoros agreed mildly I am one who would know

Lord Beric himself did not eat Arya had never seen him eat though from time to time he took a cup of wine He did not seem to sleep either His good eye would often close as if from weariness but when you spoke to him it would flick open again at once The Marcher lord was still clad in his ratty black cloak and dented breastplate with its chipped enamel lightning He even slept in that breastplate The dull black steel hid the terrible wound the Hound had given him the same way his thick woolen scarf concealed the dark ring about his throat But nothing hid his broken head all caved in at the temple or the raw red pit that was his missing eye or the shape of the skull beneath his face

Arya looked at him warily remembering all the tales told of him in Harrenhal Lord Beric seemed to sense her fear He turned his head and beckoned her closer Do I frighten you child

No She chewed her lip Only… well… I thought the Hound had killed you but…

A wound said Lem Lemoncloak A grievous wound aye but Thoros healed it There’s never been no better healer

Lord Beric gazed at Lem with a queer look in his good eye and no look at all in the other only scars and dried blood No better healer he agreed wearily Lem past time to change the watch I’d think See to it if you’d be so good

Aye m’lord Lem’s big yellow cloak swirled behind him as he strode out into the windy night

Even brave men blind themselves sometimes when they are afraid to see Lord Beric said when Lem was gone Thoros how many times have you brought me back now

The red priest bowed his head It is R’hllor who brings you back my lord The Lord of Light I am only his instrument

How many times Lord Beric insisted

Six Thoros said reluctantly And each time is harder You have grown reckless my lord Is death so very sweet

Sweet No my friend Not sweet

Then do not court it so Lord Tywin leads from the rear Lord Stannis as well You would be wise to do the same A seventh death might mean the end of both of us

Lord Beric touched the spot above his left ear where his temple was caved in Here is where Ser Burton Crakehall broke helm and head with a blow of his mace He unwound his scarf exposing the black bruise that encircled his neck Here the mark the manticore made at Rushing Falls He seized a poor beekeeper and his wife thinking they were mine and let it be known far and wide that he would hang them both unless I gave myself up to him When I did he hanged them anyway and me on the gibbet between them He lifted a finger to the raw red pit of his eye Here is where the Mountain thrust his dirk through my visor A weary smile brushed his lips That’s thrice I have died at the hands of House Clegane You would think that I might have learned…

It was a jest Arya knew but Thoros did not laugh He put a hand on Lord Beric’s shoulder Best not to dwell on it

Can I dwell on what I scarce remember I held a castle on the Marches once and there was a woman I was pledged to marry but I could not find that castle today nor tell you the color of that woman’s hair Who knighted me old friend What were my favorite foods It all fades Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest Are you my mother Thoros

Arya stared at the Myrish priest all shaggy hair and pink rags and bits of old armor Grey stubble covered his cheeks and the sagging skin beneath his chin He did not look much like the wizards in Old Nan’s stories but even so…

Could you bring back a man without a head Arya asked Just the once not six times Could you

I have no magic child Only prayers That first time his lordship had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth I knew there was no hope So when his poor torn chest stopped moving I gave him the good god’s own kiss to send him on his way I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him down his throat to lungs and heart and soul The last kiss it is called and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord’s servants as they died I had given it a time or two myself as all priests must But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him nor seen his eyes come open It was not me who raised him my lady It was the Lord R’hllor is not done with him yet Life is warmth and warmth is fire and fire is God’s and God’s alone

Arya felt tears well in her eyes Thoros used a lot of words but all they meant was no that much she understood

Your father was a good man Lord Beric said Harwin has told me much of him For his sake I would gladly forgo your ransom but we need the gold too desperately

She chewed her lip That’s true I guess He had given the Hound’s gold to Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy provisions south of the Mander she knew The last harvest burned this one is drowning and winter will soon be on us she had heard him say when he sent them off The smallfolk need grain and seed and we need blades and horses Too many of my men ride rounseys drays and mules against foes mounted on coursers and destriers

Arya didn’t know how much Robb would pay for her though He was a king now not the boy she’d left at Winterfell with snow melting in his hair And if he knew the things she’d done the stableboy and the guard at Harrenhal and all… What if my brother doesn’t want to ransom me
