3312 And Moses said unto the LORD See thou sayest unto me Bring up
this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with
me Yet thou hast said I know thee by name and thou hast also found
grace in my sight

3313 Now therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy sight
shew me now thy way that I may know thee that I may find grace in
thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people

3314 And he said My presence shall go with thee and I will give
thee rest

3315 And he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us
not up hence

3316 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so
shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are
upon the face of the earth

3317 And the LORD said unto Moses I will do this thing also that
thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and I know
thee by name

3318 And he said I beseech thee shew me thy glory

3319 And he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I
will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee and will be gracious
to whom I will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom I will shew
mercy

3320 And he said Thou canst not see my face for there shall no man
see me and live

3321 And the LORD said Behold there is a place by me and thou
shalt stand upon a rock 3322 And it shall come to pass while my
glory passeth by that I will put thee in a clift of the rock and
will cover thee with my hand while I pass by 3323 And I will take
away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall
not be seen

341 And the LORD said unto Moses Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were
in the first tables which thou brakest

342 And be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto
mount Sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount

343 And no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen
throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before
that mount

344 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and Moses
rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount Sinai as the
LORD had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone

345 And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there
and proclaimed the name of the LORD

346 And the LORD passed by before him and proclaimed The LORD The
LORD God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in
goodness and truth 347 Keeping mercy for thousands forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear
the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
and upon the childrens children unto the third and to the fourth
generation

348 And Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and
worshipped

349 And he said If now I have found grace in thy sight O LORD let
my LORD I pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and
pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance

3410 And he said Behold I make a covenant before all thy people I
will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in
any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work
of the LORD for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee

3411 Observe thou that which I command thee this day behold I drive
out before thee the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and
the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite

3412 Take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in
the midst of thee 3413 But ye shall destroy their altars break
their images and cut down their groves 3414 For thou shalt worship
no other god for the LORD whose name is Jealous is a jealous God
3415 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and
they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods
and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice 3416 And thou take
of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring
after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods

3417 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods

3418 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep Seven days thou
shalt eat unleavened bread as I commanded thee in the time of the
