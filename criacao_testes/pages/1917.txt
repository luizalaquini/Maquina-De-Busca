with each formant instead of providing one comprehensive correction to the
combined spectrum  these are shown in Figure 59
Suitable correction filters
have been determined empirically by Holmes 1972

Holmes 1972 Speech synthesis

They provide a 6 dBoctave
lift above 640 Hz for formant 1 and 6 dBoctave lift above 300 Hz for formant
2  Formants 3 and 4 are uncorrected whilst for formant 5 the correction begins
as a 6 dBoctave decay above 600 Hz and increases to an 18 dBoctave decay
above 55 kHz
pp
The disadvantage of a parallel synthesizer is that the amplitudes of the
formants must be specified as well as their frequencies  Furthermore the
formant bandwidths should all be equal but they are often chosen to be such
in series synthesizers because of the uncertainty as to their exact
values  However the extra amplitude parameters clearly give greater
control over the frequency spectrum of the synthesized speech
pp
A good example of how this extra control can usefully be exploited is the
synthesis of nasal sounds
Nasalization introduces a cavity parallel to the oral tract as illustrated
in Figure 510 and this causes zeros in the transfer function
FC Figure 510
It is as if two different copies of the vocal tract transfer function one for
the oral and the other for the nasal passage were added
together  We have seen the effect of this above when considering parallel
synthesis  The combination

where the subscript o stands for oral and n for nasal
produces zeros in the
numerator unless the amplitudes are carefully adjusted to avoid them
These cannot be modelled by a series synthesizer but they obviously can be
by a parallel one
pp
Although they are certainly needed for accurate imitation of human speech
transfer function zeros to simulate nasal sounds are not essential for
synthesis of intelligible English  It is not difficult to get a sound
like a nasal consonant

Nevertheless it is certainly true that a parallel synthesizer gives better

control over the spectrum than a series one  Whether the added flexibility
can be used properly by a synthesis-by-rule computer program is another matter
rh Implementation of formant filters
Formant filters can be built in either analogue or digital form  A
second-order resonance is needed whose centre frequency can be controlled
but whose bandwidth is fixed  If the control can be arranged as two
tracking resistors then the simple analogue configuration of Figure 511
with two operational amplifiers will suffice
FC Figure 511

The transfer function of this arrangement is

which characterizes it as a low-pass resonator with DC gain
of  - R sub 1 R sub 1   bandwidth of  12 pi C sub 2 R sub 2 Hz  and
centre frequency of  12 pi C sub 1 R sub 1 C sub 2 R sub 2  sup 12 Hz
Tracking R sub 1 with R sub 1 ensures that the DC gain remains constant
and that the centre frequency follows  R sub 1 sup -12  Moreover
neither is especially sensitive to slight departures from exact tracking
of R sub 1 with R sub 1
Such a filter has been used in a simple hand-controlled speech synthesizer
built for demonstration and amusement Witten and Madams 1978

Witten Madams 1978 Chatterbox

However the need for tracking resistors and the inverse square root variation
of the formant frequency with R sub 1 makes it rather unsuitable for serious
applications
pp
A better analogue filter is the ring-of-three configuration
shown in Figure 512
FC Figure 512
Ignore the secondary output for now  Control
is achieved over the centre frequency by two multipliers driven from
the same control input k  These have a high-impedance output producing a
current kx if the input voltage is x
It is not too difficult to show that the transfer function of the circuit is
