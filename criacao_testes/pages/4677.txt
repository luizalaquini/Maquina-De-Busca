And have said Melisandre

The conviction in the king’s voice frightened Davos to the core A hill in a forest    shapes in the snow    I don’t   

It means that the battle is begun said Melisandre The sand is running through the glass more quickly now and man’s hour on earth is almost done We must act boldly or all hope is lost Westeros must unite beneath her one true king the prince that was promised Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of R’hllor

R’hllor chooses queerly then The king grimaced as if he’d tasted something foul Why me and not my brothers Renly and his peach In my dreams I see the juice running from his mouth the blood from his throat If he had done his duty by his brother we would have smashed Lord Tywin A victory even Robert could be proud of Robert    His teeth ground side to side He is in my dreams as well Laughing Drinking Boasting Those were the things he was best at Those and fighting I never bested him at anything The Lord of Light should have made Robert his champion Why me

Because you are a righteous man said Melisandre

A righteous man Stannis touched the covered silver platter with a finger With leeches

Yes said Melisandre but I must tell you once more this is not the way

You swore it would work The king looked angry

It will    and it will not

Which

Both

Speak sense to me woman

When the fires speak more plainly so shall I There is truth in the flames but it is not always easy to see The great ruby at her throat drank fire from the glow of the brazier Give me the boy Your Grace It is the surer way The better way Give me the boy and I shall wake the stone dragon

I have told you no

He is only one baseborn boy against all the boys of Westeros and all the girls as well Against all the children that might ever be born in all the kingdoms of the world

The boy is innocent

The boy defiled your marriage bed else you would surely have sons of your own He shamed you

Robert did that Not the boy My daughter has grown fond of him And he is mine own blood

Your brother’s blood Melisandre said A king’s blood Only a king’s blood can wake the stone dragon

Stannis ground his teeth I’ll hear no more of this The dragons are done The Targaryens tried to bring them back half a dozen times And made fools of themselves or corpses Patchface is the only fool we need on this godsforsaken rock You have the leeches Do your work

Melisandre bowed her head stiffly and said As my king commands Reaching up her left sleeve with her right hand she flung a handful of powder into the brazier The coals roared As pale flames writhed atop them the red woman retrieved the silver dish and brought it to the king Davos watched her lift the lid Beneath were three large black leeches fat with blood

The boy’s blood Davos knew A king’s blood

Stannis stretched forth a hand and his fingers closed around one of the leeches

Say the name Melisandre commanded

The leech was twisting in the king’s grip trying to attach itself to one of his fingers The usurper he said Joffrey Baratheon When he tossed the leech into the fire it curled up like an autumn leaf amidst the coals and burned

Stannis grasped the second The usurper he declared louder this time Balon Greyjoy He flipped it lightly onto the brazier and its flesh split and cracked The blood burst from it hissing and smoking

The last was in the king’s hand This one he studied a moment as it writhed between his fingers The usurper he said at last Robb Stark And he threw it on the flames





JAIME

Harrenhal’s bathhouse was a dim steamy low-ceilinged room filled with great stone tubs When they led Jaime in they found Brienne seated in one of them scrubbing her arm almost angrily

Not so hard wench he called You’ll scrub the skin off She dropped her brush and covered her teats with hands as big as Gregor Clegane’s The pointy little buds she was so intent on hiding would have looked more natural on some ten-year-old than they did on her thick muscular chest

What are you doing here she demanded

Lord Bolton insists I sup with him but he neglected to invite my fleas Jaime tugged at his guard with his left hand Help me out of these stinking rags One-handed he could not so much as unlace his breeches The man obeyed grudgingly but he obeyed Now leave us Jaime said when his clothes lay in a pile on the wet stone floor My lady of Tarth doesn’t want the likes of you scum gaping at her teats He pointed his stump at the hatchet-faced woman attending Brienne You too Wait without There’s only the one door and the wench is too big to try and shinny up a chimney

The habit of obedience went deep The woman followed his guard out leaving the bathhouse to the two of them The tubs were large enough to hold six or seven after the fashion of the Free Cities so Jaime climbed in with the wench awkward and slow Both his eyes were open though the right remained somewhat swollen despite Qyburn’s leeches Jaime felt a hundred and nine years old which was a deal better than he had been feeling when he came to Harrenhal

Brienne shrunk away from him There are other tubs

This one suits me well enough Gingerly he immersed himself up to the chin in the steaming water Have no fear wench Your thighs are purple and green and I’m not interested in what you’ve got between them He had to rest his right arm on the rim since Qyburn had warned him to keep the linen dry He could feel the tension drain from his legs but his head spun If I faint pull me out No Lannister has ever drowned in his bath and I don’t mean to be the first

Why should I care how you die

You swore a solemn vow He smiled as a red flush crept up the thick white column of her neck She turned her back to him Still the shy maiden What is it that you think I haven’t seen He groped for the brush she had dropped caught it with his fingers and began to scrub himself desultorily Even that was difficult awkward My left hand is good for nothing

Still the water darkened as the caked dirt dissolved off his skin The wench kept her back to him the muscles in her great shoulders hunched and hard

Does the sight of my stump distress you so Jaime asked You ought to be pleased I’ve lost the hand I killed the king with The hand that flung the Stark boy from that tower The hand I’d slide between my sister’s thighs to make her wet He thrust his stump at her face No wonder Renly died with you guarding him

She jerked to her feet as if he’d struck her sending a wash of hot water across the tub Jaime caught a glimpse of the thick blonde bush at the juncture of her thighs as she climbed out She was much hairier than his sister Absurdly he felt his cock stir beneath the bathwater Now I know I have been too long away from Cersei He averted his eyes troubled by his body’s response That was unworthy he mumbled I’m a maimed man and bitter Forgive me wench You protected me as well as any man could have and better than most

She wrapped her nakedness in a towel Do you mock me

That pricked him back to anger Are you as thick as a castle wall That was an apology I am tired of fighting with you What say we make a truce

Truces are built on trust Would you have me trust—

The Kingslayer yes The oathbreaker who murdered poor sad Aerys Targaryen Jaime snorted It’s not Aerys I rue it’s Robert ‘I hear they’ve named you Kingslayer’ he said to me at his coronation feast ‘Just don’t think to make it a habit’ And he laughed Why is it that no one names Robert oathbreaker He tore the realm apart yet I am the one with shit for honor

Robert did all he did for love Water ran down Brienne’s legs and pooled beneath her feet

Robert did all he did for pride a cunt and a pretty face He made a fist    or would have if he’d had a hand Pain lanced up his arm cruel as laughter

He rode to save the realm she insisted

To save the realm Did you know that my brother set the Blackwater Rush afire Wildfire will burn on water Aerys would have bathed in it if he’d dared The Targaryens were all mad for fire Jaime felt light-headed It is the heat in here the poison in my blood the last of my fever I am not myself He eased himself down until the water reached his chin Soiled my white cloak    I wore my gold armor that day but
