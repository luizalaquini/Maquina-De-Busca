52 And when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit 53 Who had his
dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with
chains 54 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and
chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the
fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him

55 And always night and day he was in the mountains and in the
tombs crying and cutting himself with stones

56 But when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him 57 And
cried with a loud voice and said What have I to do with thee Jesus
thou Son of the most high God I adjure thee by God that thou torment
me not

58 For he said unto him Come out of the man thou unclean spirit

59 And he asked him What is thy name And he answered saying My
name is Legion for we are many

510 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
the country

511 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding

512 And all the devils besought him saying Send us into the swine
that we may enter into them

513 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave And the unclean spirits went
out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were
choked in the sea

514 And they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in
the country And they went out to see what it was that was done

515 And they come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the
devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right
mind and they were afraid

516 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine

517 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts

518 And when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he might be with him

519 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him Go home to
thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for
thee and hath had compassion on thee

520 And he departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great
things Jesus had done for him and all men did marvel

521 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side
much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea

522 And behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue
Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet 523 And
besought him greatly saying My little daughter lieth at the point of
death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be
healed and she shall live

524 And Jesus went with him and much people followed him and
thronged him

525 And a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years
526 And had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent
all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse
527 When she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and
touched his garment

528 For she said If I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole

529 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she
felt in her body that she was healed of that plague

530 And Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
out of him turned him about in the press and said Who touched my
clothes  531 And his disciples said unto him Thou seest the
multitude thronging thee and sayest thou Who touched me  532 And
he looked round about to see her that had done this thing

533 But the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in
her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth

534 And he said unto her Daughter thy faith hath made thee whole
go in peace and be whole of thy plague

535 While he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues
house certain which said Thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the
Master any further  536 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was
spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not afraid only
believe

537 And he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and
John the brother of James
