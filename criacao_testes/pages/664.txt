The walk back seemed long and lonely Podrick Payne was asleep in his trundle bed at the foot of Tyrion’s but he woke the boy Bronn he said

Ser Bronn Pod rubbed the sleep from his eyes Oh Should I get him My lord

Why no I woke you up so we could have a little chat about the way he dresses said Tyrion but his sarcasm was wasted Pod only gaped at him in confusion until he threw up his hands and said Yes get him Bring him Now

The lad dressed hurriedly and all but ran from the room Am I really so terrifying Tyrion wondered as he changed into a bedrobe and poured himself some wine

He was on his third cup and half the night was gone before Pod finally returned with the sellsword knight in tow I hope the boy had a damn good reason dragging me out of Chataya’s Bronn said as he seated himself

Chataya’s Tyrion said annoyed

It’s good to be a knight No more looking for the cheaper brothels down the street Bronn grinned Now it’s Alayaya and Marei in the same featherbed with Ser Bronn in the middle

Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance Bronn had as much right to bed Alayaya as any other man but still… I never touched her much as I wanted to but Bronn could not know that He should have kept his cock out of her He dare not visit Chataya’s himself If he did Cersei would see that his father heard of it and ’Yaya would suffer more than a whipping He’d sent the girl a necklace of silver and jade and a pair of matching bracelets by way of apology but other than that…

This is fruitless There is a singer who calls himself Symon Silver Tongue Tyrion said wearily pushing his guilt aside He plays for Lady Tanda’s daughter sometimes

What of him

Kill him he might have said but the man had done nothing but sing a few songs And fill Shae’s sweet head with visions of doves and dancing bears Find him he said instead Find him before someone else does





Arya


She was grubbing for vegetables in a dead man’s garden when she heard the singing

Arya stiffened still as stone listening the three stringy carrots in her hand suddenly forgotten She thought of the Bloody Mummers and Roose Bolton’s men and a shiver of fear went down her back It’s not fair not when we finally found the Trident not when we thought we were almost safe

Only why would the Mummers be singing

The song came drifting up the river from somewhere beyond the little rise to the east Off to Gulltown to see the fair maid heigh-ho heigh-ho…

Arya rose carrots dangling from her hand It sounded like the singer was coming up the river road Over among the cabbages Hot Pie had heard it too to judge by the look on his face Gendry had gone to sleep in the shade of the burned cottage and was past hearing anything

I’ll steal a sweet kiss with the point of my blade heigh-ho heigh-ho She thought she heard a woodharp too beneath the soft rush of the river

Do you hear Hot Pie asked in a hoarse whisper as he hugged an armful of cabbages Someone’s coming

Go wake Gendry Arya told him Just shake him by the shoulder don’t make a lot of noise Gendry was easy to wake unlike Hot Pie who needed to be kicked and shouted at

I’ll make her my love and we’ll rest in the shade heigh-ho heigh-ho The song swelled louder with every word

Hot Pie opened his arms The cabbages fell to the ground with soft thumps We have to hide

Where The burned cottage and its overgrown garden stood hard beside the banks of the Trident There were a few willows growing along the river’s edge and reed beds in the muddy shallows beyond but most of the ground hereabouts was painfully open I knew we should never have left the woods she thought They’d been so hungry though and the garden had been too much a temptation The bread and cheese they had stolen from Harrenhal had given out six days ago back in the thick of the woods Take Gendry and the horses behind the cottage she decided There was part of one wall still standing big enough maybe to conceal two boys and three horses If the horses don’t whinny and that singer doesn’t come poking around the garden

What about you
