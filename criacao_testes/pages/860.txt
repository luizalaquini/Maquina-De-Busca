I am not the one you were told to bring Jojen Reed told fat Sam in his stained and baggy blacks He is

Oh Sam looked down at him uncertainly It might have been just then that he realized Bran was crippled I don’t… I’m not strong enough to carry you I…

Hodor can carry me Bran pointed at his basket I ride in that up on his back

Sam was staring at him You’re Jon Snow’s brother The one who fell…

No said Jojen That boy is dead

Don’t tell Bran warned Please

Sam looked confused for a moment but finally he said I… I can keep a secret Gilly too When he looked at her the girl nodded Jon… Jon was my brother too He was the best friend I ever had but he went off with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Frostfangs and never came back We were waiting for him on the Fist when… when…

Jon’s here Bran said Summer saw him He was with some wildlings but they killed a man and Jon took his horse and escaped I bet he went to Castle Black

Sam turned big eyes on Meera You’re certain it was Jon You saw him

I’m Meera Meera said with a smile Summer is…

A shadow detached itself from the broken dome above and leapt down through the moonlight Even with his injured leg the wolf landed as light and quiet as a snowfall The girl Gilly made a frightened sound and clutched her babe so hard against her that it began to cry again

He won’t hurt you Bran said That’s Summer

Jon said you all had wolves Sam pulled off a glove I know Ghost He held out a shaky hand the fingers white and soft and fat as little sausages Summer padded closer sniffed them and gave the hand a lick

That was when Bran made up his mind We’ll go with you

All of you Sam seemed surprised by that

Meera ruffled Bran’s hair He’s our prince

Summer circled the well sniffing He paused by the top step and looked back at Bran He wants to go

Will Gilly be safe if I leave her here till I come back Sam asked them

She should be said Meera She’s welcome to our fire

Jojen said The castle is empty

Gilly looked around Craster used to tell us tales of castles but I never knew they’d be so big

It’s only the kitchens Bran wondered what she’d think when she saw Winterfell if she ever did

It took them a few minutes to gather their things and hoist Bran into his wicker seat on Hodor’s back By the time they were ready to go Gilly sat nursing her babe by the fire You’ll come back for me she said to Sam

As soon as I can he promised then we’ll go somewhere warm When he heard that part of Bran wondered what he was doing Will I ever go someplace warm again

I’ll go first I know the way Sam hesitated at the top There’s just so many steps he sighed before he started down Jojen followed then Summer then Hodor with Bran riding on his back Meera took the rear with her spear and net in hand

It was a long way down The top of the well was bathed in moonlight but it grew smaller and dimmer every time they went around Their footsteps echoed off the damp stones and the water sounds grew louder Should we have brought torches Jojen asked

Your eyes will adjust said Sam Keep one hand on the wall and you won’t fall
