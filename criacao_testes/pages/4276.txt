d
in
pig and dig belong to different phonemes in English
because they discriminate
the two words
ul
b
ul
f
and
ul
j
belong to different phonemes again
ul
i
and
ul
a
in hid and had belong to different phonemes too
Proceeding like this a list of phonemes can be drawn up
pp
Such a list is shown in Table 21 for British English
The layout of the list does have some significance in terms of different
categories of phonemes which will be explained later  In fact
linguists use an
assortment of English letters foreign letters and special
symbols to represent phonemes  In this book we use one- or two-letter
codes partly because they are more mnemonic and partly because
they are more suitable for communication to computers using standard
peripheral devices
They are
a direct transliteration of linguists standard International Phonetic
Association symbols

FG Table 21 The phonemes of British English
pp
We will discuss the sounds which make up each of these phoneme classes
shortly  First however it is worthwhile pointing out some rather
tricky points in the definition of these phonemes
rh Phonological difficulties
There are snags with phonological classification as there are
in any area where attempts are made to make completely logical
statements about human activity
Consider
ul
h
and the
ul
ng
in singing
c
ul
ng
is certainly not an
ul
n
sound followed by a
ul
g
sound although
it is true that in some English accents singing is rendered with
the
ul
ng
followed by a
ul
g
at each of its two occurrences  No words
end with
ul
h
and none begin with
ul
ng
Notice that we are still talking about British English
In Chinese the sound
ul
ng
is a word in its own right and is a common
