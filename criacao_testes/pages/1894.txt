It needs some care to encode the output of 19 filters the excitation type
and the pitch into 48 bits of information  Holmes uses 6 bits for pitch
logarithmically encoded
and one bit for excitation type
This leaves 41 bits to encode the output of the 19 filters and so a differential
technique is used which transmits just the difference between adjacent
channels em for the spectrum does not change abruptly in the frequency domain
Three bits are used for the absolute level in channel 1 and two bits
for each channel-to-channel difference giving a total of 39 bits for the whole
spectrum  The remaining two bits per frame are reserved for signalling or
monitoring purposes

A 2400 bits channel vocoder degrades the speech in a telephone channel quite
perceptibly  It is sufficient for interactive communication where
if you do not understand something you can always ask for it to be repeated
It is probably not good enough for most voice response applications
However the vocoder principle can be used with larger filter banks and much
higher bit rates and still reduce the data rate substantially below that
required by log PCM
sh 42  Pre-emphasis
pp
There is an
overall -6 dBoctave trend in speech radiated from the lips
as frequency increases
We will discuss why this is so in the next chapter
Notice that this trend means that the signal power is reduced
by a factor of 4 or the signal amplitude by a factor of 16 for each
doubling in frequency
For vocoders and indeed for other methods of spectral analysis of speech
it is usually desirable to equalize this by a +6 dBoctave lift prior to
processing so that the channel outputs occupy a similar range of levels
On regeneration the output speech is passed through an inverse filter which
provides 6 dBoctave of attenuation
pp
For a digital system such pre-emphasis
can either be implemented as an analogue circuit which precedes the presampling
filter and digitizer or as a digital operation on the sampled and quantized
signal  In the former case the characteristic is usually flat up to a certain
breakpoint which occurs somewhere between 100 Hz and 1 kHz em the exact
position does not seem to be critical em at which point the +6 dBoctave lift
begins  Although de-emphasis on output ought to have an exactly inverse
characteristic it is sometimes modified or even eliminated altogether in an
attempt to counteract approximately
the  sin pi ff sub s  pi ff sub s   distortion
introduced by the desampling operation which was discussed in an earlier
section  Above half the sampling frequency the characteristic of the
pre-emphasis is irrelevant because any effect will be suppressed by the presampling
filter
pp
The effect of a 6 dBoctave lift can also be achieved digitally by differencing
the input  The operation
LB
EQ
yn =  xn - axn-1
EN
LE
is suitable where the constant parameter a is usually chosen between 09 and 1
The latter value gives straightforward differencing and this amounts to
creating a DPCM signal as input to the spectral analysis  Figure 42 plots
the frequency response of this operation with a sample frequency of 8 kHz
for two values of the parameter together with that of a 6 dBoctave lift
above 100 Hz
FC Figure 42
The vertical positions of the plots have been adjusted to give
the same gain 20 dB at 1 kHz
The difference at 34 kHz the upper end of the telephone spectrum is just
over 2 dB  At frequencies below the breakpoint in this case 100 Hz the
difference between analogue and digital pre-emphasis can be very great  For
a=09 the attenuation at DC zero frequency is 18 dB below that at 1 kHz
which happens to be close to that of the analogue filter for frequencies below the
breakpoint  However if the breakpoint had been at 1 kHz there would have been
20 dB difference between the analogue and a=09 plots at DC  And of course
the a=1 characteristic has infinite attenuation at DC
In practice however the exact form of the pre-emphasis does not seem to be at all
critical
pp
The above remarks apply only to voiced speech  For unvoiced speech there appears
to be no real need for pre-emphasis indeed it may do harm by reinforcing
the already large high-frequency components  There is a case for altering the
parameter a according to the excitation mode of the speech  a=1 for voiced
excitation and a=0 for unvoiced gives pre-emphasis just when it is needed
This can be achieved by expressing the parameter in terms of the autocorrelation
of the incoming signal as
LB
EQ
a  =  R1 over R0  
EN
LE
where R1 is the correlation of the signal with itself delayed by one sample
and R0 is the correlation without delay that is the signal variance
This is reasonable intuitively because high sample-to-sample correlation
is to be expected in voiced speech so that R1 is very nearly as great as
R0 and the ratio becomes 1 whereas little or no sample-to-sample correlation
will be present in unvoiced speech making the ratio close to 0  Such a
scheme is reminiscent of ADPCM with adaptive prediction
pp
However this sophisticated pre-emphasis method does not seem to be worthwhile
in practice  Usually the breakpoint in an analogue pre-emphasis filter is
chosen to be rather greater than 100 Hz to limit the amplification of fricative
energy  In fact the channel vocoder described by Holmes 1980 has the
