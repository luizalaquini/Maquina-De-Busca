FG Table 101  Keying equivalents of some words
As a more extensive example in a dictionary of 24500 words just under 2000
ambiguities 8 of words were discovered
Such ambiguities would have to be resolved interactively by the system explaining
its dilemma and asking the user for a choice
Notice incidentally that although the keyed sequences do not have the same
lexicographic order as the words
no extra cost will be associated with the table-searching
operation if the dictionary is stored in inverted form with each legal
number pointing to its English equivalent or equivalents
pp
A command language syntax is also a powerful way of disambiguating
keystrokes entered

This calculator provides the standard arithmetic operators
ten numeric registers a range of pre-defined mathematical functions
and even the ability for a user to enter his own functions over the
telephone
The number representation is fixed-point with user control through a system
function over the precision
Input of numbers is free format
pp
Despite the power of the calculator language the dialogue is defined
so that each keystroke is unique in context and never has to be disambiguated
explicitly by the user
Table 102 summarizes the command language syntax in an informal and rather
heterogeneous notation
