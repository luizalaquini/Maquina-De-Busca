And you’re quite certain that Father is the lion

Tyrion grinned It’s on all our banners

She ignored the jest If it was Father who’d been taken captive Jaime would not be sitting by idly I promise you

Jaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun and the Others take their chances He never did have any patience no more than you sweet sister Not all of us can be as bold as Jaime but there are other ways to win wars Harrenhal is strong and well situated

And King’s Landing is not as we both know perfectly well While Father plays lion and fawn with the Stark boy Renly marches up the roseroad He could be at our gates any day now

The city will not fall in a day From Harrenhal it is a straight swift march down the kingsroad Renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before Father takes him in the rear His host will be the hammer the city walls the anvil It makes a lovely picture

Cersei’s green eyes bored into him wary yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding her And if Robb Stark marches

Harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose Bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolf’s horse Stark cannot march on King’s Landing without taking Harrenhal first and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do that Tyrion tried his most winning smile Meanwhile Father lives off the fat of the riverlands while our uncle Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock

Cersei regarded him suspiciously How could you know all this Did Father tell you his intentions when he sent you here

No I glanced at a map

Her look turned to disdain You’ve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque head of yours haven’t you Imp

Tyrion tsked Sweet sister I ask you if we weren’t winning would the Starks have sued for peace He drew out the letter that Ser Cleos Frey had brought The Young Wolf has sent us terms you see Unacceptable terms to be sure but still a beginning Would you care to see them

Yes That fast she was all queen again How do you come to have them They should have come to me

What else is a Hand for if not to hand you things Tyrion handed her the letter His cheek still throbbed where Cersei’s hand had left its mark Let her flay half my face it will be a small price to pay for her consent to the Dornish marriage He would have that now he could sense it

And certain knowledge of an informer too    well that was the plum in his pudding





BRAN

Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair Over his heart was his wolf’s-head brooch of silver and polished jet He would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on his breast but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding

The low stone steps balked Dancer only for a moment When Bran urged her on she took them easily Beyond the wide oak-and-iron doors eight long rows of trestle tables filled Winterfell’s Great Hall four on each side of the center aisle Men crowded shoulder to shoulder on the benches Stark they called as Bran trotted past rising to their feet Winterfell Winterfell

He was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted for—it was the harvest they cheered it was Robb and his victories it was his lord father and his grandfather and all the Starks going back eight thousand years Still it made him swell with pride For so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken Yet when he reached the dais with every eye upon him Osha and Hodor undid his straps and buckles lifted him off Dancer’s back and carried him to the high seat of his fathers

Ser Rodrik was seated to Bran’s left his daughter Beth beside him Rickon was to his right his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle He had refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone The last girl to try had been bitten for her efforts I wanted to ride too he said as Hodor led Dancer away I ride better than you

You don’t so hush up he told his brother Ser Rodrik bellowed for quiet Bran raised his voice He bid them welcome in the name of his brother the King in the North and asked them to thank the gods old and new for Robb’s victories and the bounty of the harvest May there be a hundred more he finished raising his father’s silver goblet

A hundred more Pewter tankards clay cups and iron-banded drinking horns clashed together Bran’s wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves but stronger than he was used to He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest as he swallowed By the time he set down the goblet his head was swimming

You did well Bran Ser Rodrik told him Lord Eddard would have been most proud Down the table Maester Luwin nodded his agreement as the servers began to carry in the food

Such food Bran had never seen course after course after course so much that he could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish There were great joints of aurochs roasted with leeks venison pies chunky with carrots bacon and mushrooms mutton chops sauced in honey and cloves savory duck peppered boar goose skewers of pigeon and capon beef-and-barley stew cold fruit soup Lord Wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from White Harbor packed in salt and seaweed whitefish and winkles crabs and mussels clams herring cod salmon lobster and lampreys There was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits there were turnips and pease and beets beans and squash and huge red onions there were baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine Wheels of white cheese were set at every table above and below the salt and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn ale were passed up and down the tables

Lord Wyman’s musicians played bravely and well but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter the clash of cup and plate and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps The singer sang good songs Iron Lances and The Burning of the Ships and The Bear and the Maiden Fair but only Hodor seemed to be listening He stood beside the piper hopping from one foot to the other

The noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar a great heady stew of sound Ser Rodrik talked with Maester Luwin above Beth’s curly head while Rickon screamed happily at the Walders Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table but the maester reminded him that they would soon be kin Robb was to marry one of their aunts and Arya one of their uncles She never will Bran said not Arya but Maester Luwin was unyielding so there they were beside Rickon

The serving men brought every dish to Bran first that he might take the lord’s portion if he chose By the time they reached the ducks he could eat no more After that he nodded approval at each course in turn and waved it away If the dish smelled especially choice he would send it to one of the lords on the dais a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must make He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood the boar to the boisterous Umbers a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn and a huge lobster to Joseth the master of horse who was neither lord nor guest but had seen to Dancer’s training and made it possible for Bran to ride He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well for no reason but he loved them Ser Rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster brothers so he sent Little Walder some boiled beets and Big Walder the buttered turnips

On the benches below Winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town friends from the nearer holdfasts and the escorts of their lordly guests Some faces Bran had never seen before others he knew as well as his own yet they all seemed equally foreign to him He watched them as from a distance as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber looking down on the yard below seeing everything yet a part of nothing

Osha moved among the tables pouring ale One of Leobald Tallhart’s men slid a hand up under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head to roars of laughter Yet Mikken had his hand down some woman’s bodice and she seemed not to mind Bran watched Farlen make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers On the dais Lord Wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they were an enemy host He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had commanded that a special wide chair be built for him to sit in but he laughed loud and often and Bran thought he liked him Poor wan Lady Hornwood sat beside him her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food At the opposite end of the high table Hothen and Mors were playing a drinking game slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust

It is too hot here and too noisy and they are all getting drunk Bran itched under his grey and white woolens and suddenly he wished he were anywhere but here It is cool in the godswood now Steam is rising off the hot pools and the red leaves of the weirwood are rustling The smells are richer than here and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to it

Bran Ser Rodrik said You do not eat

The waking dream had been so vivid for a moment Bran had not known where he was I’ll have more later he said My belly’s full to bursting

The old knight’s white mustache was pink with wine You have done well Bran Here and at the audiences You will be an especial fine lord one day I think

I want to be a knight Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his father’s goblet grateful for something to clutch The lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on the side of the cup He felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm and remembered the last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet

It had been the night of the welcoming feast when King Robert had brought his court to Winterfell Summer still reigned then His parents had shared the dais with Robert and his queen with her brothers beside her Uncle Benjen had been there too all in black Bran and his brothers and sisters sat with the king’s children Joffrey and Tommen and Princess Myrcella who’d spent the whole meal gazing at Robb with adoring eyes Arya made faces across the table when no one was looking Sansa listened raptly while the king’s high harper sang songs of chivalry and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn’t with them Because he’s a bastard Bran finally had to whisper to him

And now they are all gone It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away the girls to captivity Jon to the Wall Robb and Mother to war King Robert and Father to their graves and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well   

Even down on the benches there were new men at the tables Jory was dead and Fat Tom and Porther Alyn Desmond Hullen who had been master of horse Harwin his son    all those who had gone south with his father even Septa Mordane and Vayon Poole The rest had ridden to war with Robb and might soon be dead as well for all Bran knew He liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough but he missed his old friends

He looked up and down the benches at all the faces happy and sad and wondered who would be missing next year and the year after He might have cried then but he couldn’t He was the Stark in Winterfell his father’s son and his brother’s heir and almost a man grown

At the foot of the hall the doors opened and a gust of cold air made the torches flame brighter for an instant Alebelly led two new guests into the feast The Lady Meera of House Reed the rotund guardsman bellowed over the clamor With her brother Jojen of Greywater Watch

Men looked up from their cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers Bran heard Little Walder mutter Frogeaters to Big Walder beside him Ser Rodrik climbed to his feet Be welcome friends and share this harvest with us Serving men hurried to lengthen the table on the dais fetching trestles and chairs

Who are they Rickon asked

Mudmen answered Little Walder disdainfully They’re thieves and cravens and they have green teeth from eating frogs

Maester Luwin crouched beside Bran’s seat to whisper counsel in his ear You must greet these ones warmly I had not thought to see them here but    you know who they are

Bran nodded Crannogmen From the Neck

Howland Reed was a great friend to your father Ser Rodrik told him These two are his it would seem

As the newcomers walked the length of the hall Bran saw that one was indeed a girl though he would never have known it by her dress She wore lambskin breeches soft with long use and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales Though near Robb’s age she was slim as a boy with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of breasts A woven net hung from one slim hip a long bronze knife from the other under her arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back

Her brother was several years younger and bore no weapons All his garb was green even to the leather of his boots and when he came closer Bran saw that his eyes were the color of moss though his teeth looked as white as anyone else’s Both Reeds were slight of build slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself They went to one knee before the dais

My lords of Stark the girl said The years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North My lord father has sent us here to say the words again for all our people
