Table 73 summarizes some of the acoustic phases of voiced and unvoiced
stops  There are many variations that have not been mentioned
Nasal plosion good news occurs at the word boundary in this case
when the nasal formant pervades the
opening phase  Stop bursts are suppressed when the next sound is a stop
too the burst on the

of apt for example
It is difficult to distinguish a voiced stop from an unvoiced one
at the end of a word cab and cap if the speaker is trying to
make himself particularly clear he will put a short neutral vowel
after the voiced stop to emphasize its early onset of voicing
If he is Italian he will probably do this anyway for it is the norm
in his own language

Finally we turn to affricates of which there are only two
in English
ul
ch
chin and
ul
j
djinn
They are very similar to the stops
ul
t
and
ul
d
followed by the fricatives
ul
sh
and
ul
zh
respectively and their acoustic characterization is similar to that
of the phoneme pair
ul
ch
has a closing phase a stopped phase and a long fricative burst
There is no aspiration
for the vocal cords are not involved
ul
j
is the same except that voicing extends further into the stopped
portion and the terminating fricative is also voiced
It may be pronounced with a voice bar if the preceding segment is voiced

sh 75  Speech synthesis by rule
pp
Generation of speech by rules acting upon a phonetic transcription
was first investigated in the early 1960s Kelly and Gerstman 1961

Kelly Gerstman 1961

Most systems employ a hardware resonance synthesizer analogue or digital
series or parallel
to reduce the load on the computer which operates the rules
The speech-by-rule program rather than the
synthesizer inevitably contributes by far the greater part of the
degradation in the resulting speech
Although parallel synthesizers offer greater potential control over
the spectrum it is not clear to what extent a synthesis program can take
advantage of this  Parameter tracks for a series synthesizer can
easily be converted into linear predictive coefficients and systems
which use a linear predictive synthesizer will probably become popular
in the near future
pp
The phrase synthesis by rule which is in common use does not
make it clear just what sort of features the rules are supposed to
accomodate and what information must be included explicitly in the
input transcription
Early systems made no attempt to simulate prosodics
Pitch and rhythm could be controlled but only by inserting
pitch specifiers and duration markers in the input
Some kind of prosodic control was often incorporated later
but usually as a completely separate phase from segmental synthesis
This does not allow interaction effects such as the extra
aspiration for voiceless stops in accented syllables to be taken
into account easily
Even systems which perform prosodic operations invariably need to have
prosodic specifications embedded explicitly in the input

Generating parameter tracks for a synthesizer from a phonetic transcription
is a process of data

expansion
Six bits are ample to specify a phoneme and a speaking rate of 12 phonemessec
leads to an input data rate of 72 bits
The data rate required to control the synthesizer will depend upon the number
of parameters and the rate at which they are sampled
but a typical figure is 6 Kbits Chapter 5
Hence there is something like a hundredfold data expansion
