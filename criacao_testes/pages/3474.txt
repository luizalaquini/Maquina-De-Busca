Making noise Mord growled with blood in his eyes Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap wide and thick doubled over in his fist

Never show them you’re afraid Tyrion reminded himself How would you like to be rich he asked

Mord hit him He swung the strap backhand lazily but the leather caught Tyrion high on the arm The force of it staggered him and the pain made him grit his teeth No mouth dwarf man Mord warned him

Gold Tyrion said miming a smile Casterly Rock is full of gold… ahhhh… This time the blow was a forehand and Mord put more of his arm into the swing making the leather crack and jump It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees wimpering He forced himself to look up at the gaoler As rich as the Lannisters he wheezed That’s what they say Mord—

Mord grunted The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face The pain was so bad he did not remember falling but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell His ear was ringing and his mouth was full of blood He groped for purchase to push himself up and his fingers brushed against… nothing Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded and tried his best to stop breathing He had fallen right on the edge inches from the blue

More to say Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull The snap made Tyrion jump The turnkey laughed

He won’t push me over Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge Catelyn Stark wants me alive he doesn’t dare kill me He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand grinned and said That was a stiff one Mord The gaoler squinted at him trying to decide if he was being mocked I could make good use of a strong man like you The strap flew at him but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away from it He took a glancing blow to the shoulder nothing more Gold he repeated scrambling backward like a crab more gold than you’ll see here in a lifetime Enough to buy land women horses… you could be a lord Lord Mord Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky

Is no gold Mord said

He’s listening Tyrion thought They relieved me of my purse when they captured me but the gold is still mine Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner but she’d never stoop to rob him That wouldn’t be honorable Help me and all the gold is yours Mord’s strap licked out but it was a halfhearted desultory swing slow and contemptuous Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned There will be no risk to you All you need do is deliver a message

The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion’s grasp Message he said as if he had never heard the word before His frown made deep creases in his brow

You heard me my lord Only carry my word to your lady Tell her… What What would possibly make Lysa Anyn relent The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister suddenly …tell her that I wish to confess my crimes

Mord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow but the turnkey hesitated Suspicion and greed warred in his eyes He wanted that gold yet he feared a trick he had the look of a man who had often been tricked Is lie he muttered darkly Dwarf man cheat me

I will put my promise in writing Tyrion vowed

Some illiterates held writing in disdain others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word as if it were some sort of magic Fortunately Mord was one of the latter The turnkey lowered the strap Writing down gold Much gold

Oh much gold Tyrion assured him The purse is just a taste my friend My brother wears armor of solid gold plate In truth Jaime’s armor was gilded steel but this oaf would never know the difference

Mord fingered his strap thoughtfully but in the end he relented and went to fetch paper and ink When the letter was written the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously Now deliver my message Tyrion urged

He was shivering in his sleep when they came for him late that night Mord opened the door but kept his silence Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of his boot On your feet Imp My lady wants to see you

Tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt No doubt she does but what makes you think I wish to see her

Ser Vardis frowned Tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spent at King’s Landing as the captain of the Hand’s household guard A square plain face silver hair a heavy build and no humor whatsoever Your wishes are not my concern On your feet or I’ll have you carried

Tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet A cold night he said casually and the High Hall is so drafty I don’t wish to catch a chill Mord if you would be so good fetch my cloak

The gaoler squinted at him face dull with suspicion

My cloak Tyrion repeated The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping You recall

Get him the damnable cloak Ser Vardis said

Mord did not dare grumble He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution yet he went for the cloak When he draped it around his prisoner’s neck Tyrion smiled My thanks I shall think of you whenever I wear it He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder and felt warm for the first time in days Lead on Ser Vardis

The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches burning in the sconces along the walls The Lady Lysa wore black silk with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls Since she did not look the sort to join the Night’s Watch Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes were appropriate garb for a confession Her long auburn hair woven into an elaborate braid fell across her left shoulder The taller throne beside her was empty no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep Tyrion was thankful for that much at least

He bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall Lady Arryn had summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession as he had hoped He saw Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face and Lord Nestor Royce’s bluff one Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who could only be his heir Ser Albar Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented Tyrion noted Ser Lyn Corbray slender as a sword Lord Hunter with his gouty legs the widowed Lady Waynwood surrounded by her sons Others sported sigils he did not know broken lance green viper burning tower winged chalice

Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road Ser Rodrik Cassel pale from half-healed wounds stood with Ser Willis Wode beside him Marillion the singer had found a new woodharp Tyrion smiled whatever happened here tonight he did not wish it to happen in secret and there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far

In the rear of the hall Bronn lounged beneath a pillar The freerider’s black eyes were fixed on Tyrion and his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword Tyrion gave him a long look wondering…

Catelyn Stark spoke first You wish to confess your crimes we are told

I do my lady Tyrion answered

Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister The sky cells always break them The gods can see them there and there is no darkness to hide in

He does not look broken to me Lady Catelyn said

Lady Lysa paid her no mind Say what you will she commanded Tyrion

And now to roll the dice he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn Where to begin I am a vile little man I confess it My crimes and sins are beyond counting my lords and ladies I have lain with whores not once but hundreds of times I have wished my own lord father dead and my sister our gracious queen as well Behind him someone chuckled I have not always treated my servants with kindness I have gambled I have even cheated I blush to admit I have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court That drew outright laughter Once I—

Silence Lysa Arryn’s pale round face had turned a burning pink What do you imagine you are doing dwarf

Tyrion cocked his head to one side Why confessing my crimes my lady—

Catelyn Stark took a step forward You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn the Hand of the King

Tyrion gave a helpless shrug Those crimes I cannot confess I fear I know nothing of any murders

Lady Lysa rose from her weirwood throne I will not be made mock of You have had your little jape Imp I trust you enjoyed it Ser Vardis take him back to the dungeon… but this time find him a smaller cell with a floor more sharply sloped

Is this how justice is done in the Vale Tyrion roared so loudly that Ser Vardis froze for an instant Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate You accuse me of crimes I deny them so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve He lifted his head to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on his face Where is the king’s justice Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms I stand accused you say Very well I demand a trial Let me speak and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly in the sight of gods and men

A low murmuring filled the High Hall He had her Tyrion knew He was highborn the son of the most powerful lord in the realm the brother of the queen He could not be denied a trial Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion but Ser Vardis bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa

Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused then by the king’s own laws you must pay with your life’s blood We keep no headsman in the Eyrie my lord of Lannister Open the Moon Door

The press of spectators parted A narrow weirwood door stood between two slender marble pillars a crescent moon carved in the white wood Those standing closest edged backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through One man removed the heavy bronze bars the second pulled the door inward Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their shoulders caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky speckled with cold uncaring stars

Behold the king’s justice Lysa Arryn said Torch flames fluttered like pennons along the walls and here and there the odd torch guttered out

Lysa I think this unwise Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall

Her sister ignored her You want a trial my lord of Lannister Very well a trial you shall have My son will listen to whatever you care to say and you shall hear his judgment Then you may leave… by one door or the other

She looked so pleased with herself Tyrion thought and small wonder How could a trial threaten her when her weakling son was the lord judge Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door Mother I want to see him fly the boy had said How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already

I thank you my good lady but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert Tyrion said politely The gods know the truth of my innocence I will have their verdict not the judgment of men I demand trial by combat

A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns Lord Nestor Royce snorted Ser Willis chuckled Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door

Lysa Arryn’s watery blue eyes looked uncertain He had caught her off balance You have that right to be sure
