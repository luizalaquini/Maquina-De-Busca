It’s nothing you need trouble yourself with Your face is pale as death and there’s blood seeping through your dressings Say what you want and take yourself back to bed

What I want    His throat felt raw and tight What did he want More than you can ever give me Father Pod tells me that Littlefinger’s been made Lord of Harrenhal

An empty title so long as Roose Bolton holds the castle for Robb Stark yet Lord Baelish was desirous of the honor He did us good service in the matter of the Tyrell marriage A Lannister pays his debts

The Tyrell marriage had been Tyrion’s notion in point of fact but it would seem churlish to try to claim that now That title may not be as empty as you think he warned Littlefinger does nothing without good reason But be that as it may You said something about paying debts I believe

And you want your own reward is that it Very well What is it you would have of me Lands castle some office

A little bloody gratitude would make a nice start

Lord Tywin stared at him unblinking Mummers and monkeys require applause So did Aerys for that matter You did as you were commanded and I am sure it was to the best of your ability No one denies the part you played

That part I played What nostrils Tyrion had left must surely have flared I saved your bloody city it seems to me

Most people seem to feel that it was my attack on Lord Stannis’s flank that turned the tide of battle Lords Tyrell Rowan Redwyne and Tarly fought nobly as well and I’m told it was your sister Cersei who set the pyromancers to making the wildfire that destroyed the Baratheon fleet

While all I did was get my nosehairs trimmed is that it Tyrion could not keep the bitterness out of his voice

Your chain was a clever stroke and crucial to our victory Is that what you wanted to hear I am told we have you to thank for our Dornish alliance as well You may be pleased to learn that Myrcella has arrived safely at Sunspear Ser Arys Oakheart writes that she has taken a great liking to Princess Arianne and that Prince Trystane is enchanted with her I mislike giving House Martell a hostage but I suppose that could not be helped

We’ll have our own hostage Tyrion said A council seat was also part of the bargain Unless Prince Doran brings an army when he comes to claim it he’ll be putting himself in our power

Would that a council seat were all Martell came to claim Lord Tywin said You promised him vengeance as well

I promised him justice

Call it what you will It still comes down to blood

Not an item in short supply surely I splashed through lakes of it during the battle Tyrion saw no reason not to cut to the heart of the matter Or have you grown so fond of Gregor Clegane that you cannot bear to part with him

Ser Gregor has his uses as did his brother Every lord has need of a beast from time to time    a lesson you seem to have learned judging from Ser Bronn and those clansmen of yours

Tyrion thought of Timett’s burned eye Shagga with his axe Chella in her necklace of dried ears And Bronn Bronn most of all The woods are full of beasts he reminded his father The alleyways as well

True Perhaps other dogs would hunt as well I shall think on it If there is nothing else   

You have important letters yes Tyrion rose on unsteady legs closed his eyes for an instant as a wave of dizziness washed over him and took a shaky step toward the door Later he would reflect that he should have taken a second and then a third Instead he turned What do I want you ask I’ll tell you what I want I want what is mine by rights I want Casterly Rock

His father’s mouth grew hard Your brother’s birthright

The knights of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry to father children and to hold land you know that as well as I The day Jaime put on that white cloak he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock but never once have you acknowledged it It’s past time I want you to stand up before the realm and proclaim that I am your son and your lawful heir

Lord Tywin’s eyes were a pale green flecked with gold as luminous as they were merciless Casterly Rock he declared in a flat cold dead tone And then Never

The word hung between them huge sharp poisoned

I knew the answer before I asked Tyrion said Eighteen years since Jaime joined the Kingsguard and I never once raised the issue I must have known I must always have known Why he made himself ask though he knew he would rue the question

You ask that You who killed your mother to come into the world You are an ill-made devious disobedient spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine To teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him But neither gods nor men shall ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse

My whorehouse The dawn broke Tyrion understood all at once where this bile had come from He ground his teeth together and said Cersei told you about Alayaya

Is that her name I confess I cannot remember the names of all your whores Who was the one you married as a boy

Tysha He spat out the answer defiant

And that camp follower on the Green Fork

Why do you care he asked unwilling even to speak Shae’s name in his presence

I don’t No more than I care if they live or die

It was you who had Yaya whipped It was not a question

Your sister told me of your threats against my grandsons Lord Tywin’s voice was colder than ice Did she lie

Tyrion would not deny it I made threats yes To keep Alayaya safe So the Kettleblacks would not misuse her

To save a whore’s virtue you threatened your own House your own kin Is that the way of it

You were the one who taught me that a good threat is often more telling than a blow Not that Joffrey hasn’t tempted me sore a few hundred times If you’re so anxious to whip people start with him But Tommen    why would I harm Tommen He’s a good lad and mine own blood

As was your mother Lord Tywin rose abruptly to tower over his dwarf son Go back to your bed Tyrion and speak to me no more of your rights to Casterly Rock You shall have your reward but it shall be one I deem appropriate to your service and station And make no mistake—this was the last time I will suffer you to bring shame onto House Lannister You are done with whores The next one I find in your bed I’ll hang





DAVOS

He watched the sail grow for a long time trying to decide whether he would sooner live or die

Dying would be easier he knew All he had to do was crawl inside his cave and let the ship pass by and death would find him For days now the fever had been burning through him turning his bowels to brown water and making him shiver in his restless sleep Each morning found him weaker It will not be much longer he had taken to telling himself

If the fever did not kill him thirst surely would He had no fresh water here but for the occasional rainfall that pooled in hollows on the rock Only three days past or had it been four On his rock it was hard to tell the days apart his pools had been dry as old bone and the sight of the bay rippling green and grey all around him had been almost more than he could bear Once he began to drink seawater the end would come swiftly he knew but all the same he had almost taken that first swallow so parched was his throat A sudden squall had saved him He had grown so feeble by then that it was all he could do to lie in the rain with his eyes closed and his mouth open and let the water splash down on his cracked lips and swollen tongue But afterward he felt a little stronger and the island’s pools and cracks and crevices once more had brimmed with life

But that had been three days ago or maybe four and most of the water was gone now Some had evaporated and he had sucked up the rest By the morrow he would be tasting the mud again and licking the damp cold stones at the bottom of the depressions

And if not thirst or fever starvation would kill him His island was no more than a barren spire jutting up out of the immensity of Blackwater Bay When the tide was low he could sometimes find tiny crabs along the stony strand where he had washed ashore after the battle They nipped his fingers painfully before he smashed them apart on the rocks to suck the meat from their claws and the guts from their shells

But the strand vanished whenever the tide came rushing in and Davos had to scramble up the rock to keep from being swept out into the bay once more The point of the spire was fifteen feet above the water at high tide but when the bay grew rough the spray went even higher so there was no way to keep dry even in his cave which was really no more than a hollow in the rock beneath an overhang Nothing grew on the rock but lichen and even the seabirds shunned the place Now and again some gulls would land atop the spire and Davos would try to catch one but they were too quick for him to get close He took to flinging stones at them but he was too weak to throw with much force so even when his stones hit the gulls would only scream at him in annoyance and then take to the air

There were other rocks visible from his refuge distant stony spires taller than his own The nearest stood a good forty feet above the water he guessed though it was hard to be sure at this distance A cloud of gulls swirled about it constantly and often Davos thought of crossing over to raid their nests But the water was cold here the currents strong and treacherous and he knew he did not have the strength for such a swim That would kill him as sure as drinking seawater

Autumn in the narrow sea could often be wet and rainy he remembered from years past The days were not bad so long as the sun was shining but the nights were growing colder and sometimes the wind would come gusting across the bay driving a line of whitecaps before it and before long Davos would be soaked and shivering Fever and chills assaulted him in turn and of late he had developed a persistent racking cough

His cave was all the shelter he had and that was little enough Driftwood and bits of charred debris would wash up on the strand during low tide but he had no way to strike a spark or start a fire Once in desperation he had tried rubbing two pieces of driftwood against each other but the wood was rotted and his efforts earned him only blisters His clothes were sodden as well and he had lost one of his boots somewhere in the bay before he washed up here
