11974 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me because I
have hoped in thy word

11975 I know O LORD that thy judgments are right and that thou in
faithfulness hast afflicted me

11976 Let I pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort
according to thy word unto thy servant

11977 Let thy tender mercies come unto me that I may live for thy
law is my delight

11978 Let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me
without a cause but I will meditate in thy precepts

11979 Let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have
known thy testimonies

11980 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes that I be not ashamed

11981 My soul fainteth for thy salvation but I hope in thy word

11982 Mine eyes fail for thy word saying When wilt thou comfort me

11983 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke yet do I not forget
thy statutes

11984 How many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me

11985 The proud have digged pits for me which are not after thy law

11986 All thy commandments are faithful they persecute me
wrongfully help thou me

11987 They had almost consumed me upon earth but I forsook not thy
precepts

11988 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness so shall I keep the
testimony of thy mouth

11989 For ever O LORD thy word is settled in heaven

11990 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou hast established
the earth and it abideth

11991 They continue this day according to thine ordinances for all
are thy servants

11992 Unless thy law had been my delights I should then have
perished in mine affliction

11993 I will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast
quickened me

11994 I am thine save me for I have sought thy precepts

11995 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me but I will
consider thy testimonies

11996 I have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is
exceeding broad

11997 O how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day

11998 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
enemies for they are ever with me

11999 I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy
testimonies are my meditation

119100 I understand more than the ancients because I keep thy
precepts

119101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way that I might
keep thy word

119102 I have not departed from thy judgments for thou hast taught
me

119103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey
to my mouth

119104 Through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate
every false way

119105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

119106 I have sworn and I will perform it that I will keep thy
righteous judgments

119107 I am afflicted very much quicken me O LORD according unto
thy word

119108 Accept I beseech thee the freewill offerings of my mouth O
LORD and teach me thy judgments

119109 My soul is continually in my hand yet do I not forget thy
law
