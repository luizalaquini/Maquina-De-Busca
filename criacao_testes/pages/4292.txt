Digital recordings of speech provide a jumping-off point for
further processing of the audio waveform which is usually necessary for
the purpose of speech output
It is difficult to synthesize natural sounds by concatenating
individually-spoken words
Pitch is perhaps the most perceptually significant contextual effect
which must be
taken into account when forming connected speech out of isolated words
The intonation of an utterance which manifests itself as a
continually changing pitch is a holistic property of the utterance
and not the sum of components determined by the individual words alone
Happily and quite coincidentally communications engineers in their quest
for reduced-bandwidth telephony have invented methods of coding speech that
separate the pitch information from that carried by the articulation

Although these analysis techniques which were first introduced in the late
1930s Dudley 1939 were originally implemented by analogue means em and
in many systems still are Blankenship 1978 describes a recent
switched-capacitor realization em there is a continuing trend
towards digital implementations particularly for the more sophisticated coding
schemes

It is hard to see how the technique of linear prediction of speech
which is described in detail in Chapter 6 could be accomplished in the
absence of digital processing
Some groundwork is laid for the theory of digital signal analysis in this
chapter
The ideas are not presented in a formal axiomatic way but are developed as
and when they are needed to examine some of the structures that turn out to be
useful in speech processing

Most speech analysis views speech according to the source-filter model which
was introduced in Chapter 2 and aims to separate the effects of the source from
those of the filter  The frequency spectrum of the vocal tract filter is of
great interest and the technique of discrete Fourier transformation is
discussed in this chapter  For many purposes it is better to extract the formant
frequencies from the spectrum and use these alone or in conjunction with their
bandwidths to characterize it  As far as the signal source in the source-filter
model is concerned its most interesting features are pitch and amplitude em the
latter being easy to estimate  Hence we go on to look at pitch extraction
Related to this is the problem of deciding whether a segment of speech has
voiced or unvoiced excitation or both
pp
Estimating formant and pitch parameters is one of the messiest areas of
speech processing  There is a delightful paper which points this out
Schroeder 1970 entitled Parameter estimation in speech a lesson in unorthodoxy

Schroeder 1970

It emphasizes that the most successful estimation procedures have often relied
on intuition based on knowledge of speech signals and their production in the
human vocal apparatus rather than routine applications of well-established
theoretical methods
Fortunately the emphasis of the present book is on speech
ul
output
which involves parameter estimation only in so far as it is needed to produce
coded speech for storage and to illuminate the acoustic nature of speech
for the development of synthesis by rule from phonetics or text
Hence the many methods of formant and pitch estimation are treated rather
cursorily and qualitatively here  our main interest is in how to
ul
use
such information for speech output
pp
If the incoming speech can be analysed into its formant frequencies amplitude
excitation mode and pitch if voiced it is quite easy to resynthesize
it directly from these parameters  Speech synthesizers are described in the
next chapter  They can be realized in either analogue or digital
hardware the former being predominant in production systems and the latter
in research systems em although as in other areas of electronics the balance
is changing in favour of digital implementations

A direct representation of the frequency spectrum of a signal can be obtained
by a bank of bandpass filters  This is the basis of
