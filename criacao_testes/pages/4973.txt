judge that shall be in those days and enquire and they shall shew
thee the sentence of judgment 1710 And thou shalt do according to
the sentence which they of that place which the LORD shall choose
shall shew thee and thou shalt observe to do according to all that
they inform thee 1711 According to the sentence of the law which
they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall
tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence
which they shall shew thee to the right hand nor to the left

1712 And the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken
unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy
God or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put
away the evil from Israel

1713 And all the people shall hear and fear and do no more
presumptuously

1714 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I
will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me
1715 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the LORD thy
God shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy
brother

1716 But he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the
people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses
forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you Ye shall henceforth return
no more that way

1717 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn
not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and
gold

1718 And it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
is before the priests the Levites 1719 And it shall be with him and
he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to
fear the LORD his God to keep all the words of this law and these
statutes to do them 1720 That his heart be not lifted up above his
brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the
right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in
his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel

181 The priests the Levites and all the tribe of Levi shall have no
part nor inheritance with Israel they shall eat the offerings of the
LORD made by fire and his inheritance

182 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren
the LORD is their inheritance as he hath said unto them

183 And this shall be the priests due from the people from them
that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give
unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw

184 The firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil
and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him

185 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to
stand to minister in the name of the LORD him and his sons for ever

186 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel
where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the
place which the LORD shall choose 187 Then he shall minister in the
name of the LORD his God as all his brethren the Levites do which
stand there before the LORD

188 They shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of
the sale of his patrimony

189 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those
nations

1810 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or
an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch

1811 Or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard
or a necromancer

1812 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD
and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out
from before thee

1813 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God

1814 For these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto
observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the LORD thy
God hath not suffered thee so to do

1815 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall
hearken 1816 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy
God in Horeb in the day of the assembly saying Let me not hear again
the voice of the LORD my God neither let me see this great fire any
more that I die not

1817 And the LORD said unto me They have well spoken that which they
have spoken
