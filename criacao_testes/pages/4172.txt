or manager or something Ill go at once if youll
promise that
I shall have no bailiff I shall continue to be my
own manager she said decisively
Very well then  you should be thankful to me for
biding How would the farm go on with nobody to
mind it but a woman But mind this I dont wish
ee to feel you owe me anything Not I What I do
I do Sometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to
leave the place -- for dont suppose Im content to be a
nobody I was made for better things However I
dont like to see your concerns going to ruin as they
must if you keep in this mind I hate taking my
own measure so plain but upon my life your provok+
ing ways make a man say what he wouldnt dream of
at other times  I own to being rather interfering But
you know well enough how it is and who she is that I
like too well and feel too much like a fool about to be
civil to her  
It is more than probable that she privately and un+
consciously respected him a little for this grim fidelity
which had been shown in his tone even more than in
his words At any rate she murmured something to the
effect that he might stay if he wished She said more
distinctly  Will you leave me alone now I dont
order it as a mistress -- I ask it as a woman and I
expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse
 Certainly I will Miss Everdene said Gabriel gently
He wondered that the request should have come at this
moment for the strife was over and they were on a
most desolate hill far from every human habitation and
the hour was getting late He stood still and allowed
her to get far ahead of him till he could only see her
form upon the sky
A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of
him at that point now ensued A figure apparently rose
from the earth beside her The shape beyond all doubt
was Troys Oak would not be even a possible listener
and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards
were between the lovers and himself

Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard In
passing the tower he thought of what she had said about

perceived at the beginning of service Believing that
the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused he
ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which
it stood and examined it The pale lustre yet hanging
in the north-western heaven was sufficient to show that
a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door
to a length of more than a foot delicately tying the
panel to the stone jamb It was a decisive proof that
the door had not been opened at least since Troy came
back to Weatherbury

HOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES
HALF an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house
There burnt upon her face when she met the light of
the candles the flush and excitement which were little
less than chronic with her now The farewell words of
Troy who had accompanied her to the very door still
lingered in her ears He had bidden her adieu for two
days which were so he stated to be spent at Bath in
visiting some friends He had also kissed her a second
time
It is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little
fact which did not come to light till a long time after+
wards  that Troys presentation of himself so aptly at
the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre+
concerted arrangement He had hinted -- she had
forbidden and it was only on the chance of his still
coming that she had dismissed Oak fearing a meeting
between them just then
She now sank down into a chair wild and perturbed
by all these new and fevering sequences Then she
jumped up with a manner of decision and fetched her
desk from a side tahle
In three minutes without pause or modification she
had written a letter to Boldwood at his address beyond
Casterbridge saying mildly but firmly that she had well

considered the whole subject he had brought before her
and kindly given her time to decide upon that her
final decision was that she could not marry him She
had expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood
came home before communicating to him her conclusive
reply But Bathsheba found that she could not wait
It was impossible to send this letter till the next day
yet to quell her uneasiness by getting it out of her hands
and so as it were setting the act in motion at once she
arose to take it to any one of the women who might be
in the kitchen
P 252
She paused in the passage A dialogue was going
on in the kitchen and Bathsheba and Troy were the
subject of it
If he marry her shell gie up farming
Twill be a gallant life but may bring some trouble
