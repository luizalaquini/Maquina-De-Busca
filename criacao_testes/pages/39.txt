4214 And Joseph said unto them That is it that I spake unto you
saying Ye are spies 4215 Hereby ye shall be proved By the life of
Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come
hither

4216 Send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be
kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any
truth in you or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies

4217 And he put them all together into ward three days

4218 And Joseph said unto them the third day This do and live for
I fear God 4219 If ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound
in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your
houses 4220 But bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your
words be verified and ye shall not die And they did so

4221 And they said one to another We are verily guilty concerning
our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought
us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us

4222 And Reuben answered them saying Spake I not unto you saying
Do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore
behold also his blood is required

4223 And they knew not that Joseph understood them for he spake unto
them by an interpreter

4224 And he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to
them again and communed with them and took from them Simeon and
bound him before their eyes

4225 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to
restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision
for the way and thus did he unto them

4226 And they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence

4227 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth

4228 And he said unto his brethren My money is restored and lo it
is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid
saying one to another What is this that God hath done unto us  4229
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan and
told him all that befell unto them saying 4230 The man who is the
lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the
country

4231 And we said unto him We are true men we are no spies 4232 We
be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest
is this day with our father in the land of Canaan

4233 And the man the lord of the country said unto us Hereby shall
I know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me
and take food for the famine of your households and be gone 4234
And bring your youngest brother unto me then shall I know that ye are
no spies but that ye are true men so will I deliver you your
brother and ye shall traffick in the land

4235 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold
every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and
their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid

4236 And Jacob their father said unto them Me have ye bereaved of my
children Joseph is not and Simeon is not and ye will take Benjamin
away all these things are against me

4237 And Reuben spake unto his father saying Slay my two sons if I
bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and I will bring him
to thee again

4238 And he said My son shall not go down with you for his brother
is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in
the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
the grave

431 And the famine was sore in the land

432 And it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they
had brought out of Egypt their father said unto them Go again buy
us a little food

433 And Judah spake unto him saying The man did solemnly protest
unto us saying Ye shall not see my face except your brother be with
you

434 If thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy
thee food 435 But if thou wilt not send him we will not go down
for the man said unto us Ye shall not see my face except your
brother be with you

436 And Israel said Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell
the man whether ye had yet a brother  437 And they said The man
asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying Is your
father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according
to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would
say Bring your brother down  438 And Judah said unto Israel his
father Send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may
live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
