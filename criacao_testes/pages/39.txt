The Others take your honor Robert swore What did any Targaryen ever know of honor Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon’s honor

You avenged Lyanna at the Trident Ned said halting beside the king Promise me Ned she had whispered

That did not bring her back Robert looked away off into the grey distance The gods be damned It was a hollow victory they gave me A crown… it was the girl I prayed them for Your sister safe… and mine again as she was meant to be I ask you Ned what good is it to wear a crown The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike

I cannot answer for the gods Your Grace… only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day Ned said Aerys was dead on the floor drowned in his own blood His dragon skulls stared down from the walls Lannister’s men were everywhere Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor I can see him still Even his sword was gilded He was seated on the Iron Throne high above his knights wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion’s head How he glittered

This is well known the king complained

I was still mounted I rode the length of the hall in silence between the long rows of dragon skulls It felt as though they were watching me somehow I stopped in front of the throne looking up at him His golden sword was across his legs its edge red with a king’s blood My men were filling the room behind me Lannister’s men drew back I never said a word I looked at him seated there on the throne and I waited At last Jaime laughed and got up He took off his helm and he said to me ‘Have no fear Stark I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert It’s not a very comfortable seat I’m afraid’

The king threw back his head and roared His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass They took to the air in a wild beating of wings You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments He shook with laughter again Jaime was all of seventeen Ned Scarce more than a boy

Boy or man he had no right to that throne

Perhaps he was tired Robert suggested Killing kings is weary work Gods know there’s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room And he spoke truly it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair In more ways than one The king shook his head Well now I know Jaime’s dark sin and the matter can be forgotten I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state Ned It’s all as tedious as counting coppers Come let’s ride you used to know how I want to feel the wind in my hair again He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow raining earth down behind him

For a moment Ned did not follow He had run out of words and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness Not for the first time he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come He was no Jon Arryn to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom Robert would do what he pleased as he always had and nothing Ned could say or do would change that He belonged in Winterfell He belonged with Catelyn in her grief and with Bran

A man could not always be where he belonged though Resigned Eddard Stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king





TYRION

The north went on forever

Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another

They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king amidst all the commotion of the royal departure riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen’s huge wheelhouse as a light snow flurried about them The kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south taking the tumult with them while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew

It had grown colder after that and far more quiet

West of the road were flint hills grey and rugged with tall watchtowers on their stony summits To the east the land was lower the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see Stone bridges spanned swift narrow rivers while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone The road was well trafficked and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found

Three days ride from Winterfell however the farmland gave way to dense wood and the kingsroad grew lonely The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders When the wind blew from the north long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners

With the mountains a wall to the west the road veered north by northeast through the wood a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen The wolfswood Benjen Stark called it and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs and some not so distant Jon Snow’s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling but never raised his own voice in reply There was something very unsettling about that animal Tyrion thought

There were eight in the party by then not counting the wolf Tyrion traveled with two of his own men as befit a Lannister Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night’s Watch but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast and there joined up with another of the black brothers one Yoren Yoren was stooped and sinister his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers Rapers Yoren said with a cold look at his charges Tyrion understood Life on the Wall was said to be hard but no doubt it was preferable to castration

Five men three boys a direwolf twenty horses and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad or any road

Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice his clothing old patched and seldom washed His two young recruits smelled even worse and seemed as stupid as they were cruel

No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night’s Watch was made up of men like his uncle If so Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening Tyrion felt sorry for the boy He had chosen a hard life… or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him

He had rather less sympathy for the uncle Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother’s distaste for Lannisters and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions I warn you Lannister you’ll find no inns at the Wall he had said looking down on him

No doubt you’ll find some place to put me Tyrion had replied As you might have noticed I’m small
