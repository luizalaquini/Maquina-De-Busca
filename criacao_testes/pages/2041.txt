When Davos arrived at the Stone Drum a dozen highborn knights and great bannermen were just leaving Lords Celtigar and Velaryon each gave him a curt nod and walked on while the others ignored him utterly but Ser Axell Florent stopped for a word

Queen Selyse’s uncle was a keg of a man with thick arms and bandy legs He had the prominent ears of a Florent even larger than his niece’s The coarse hair that sprouted from his ears did not stop him hearing most of what went on in the castle For ten years Ser Axell had served as castellan of Dragonstone while Stannis sat on Robert’s council in King’s Landing but of late he had emerged as the foremost of the queen’s men Ser Davos it is good to see you as ever he said

And you my lord

I made note of you this morning as well The false gods burned with a merry light did they not

They burned brightly Davos did not trust this man for all his courtesy House Florent had declared for Renly

The Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes R’hllor permits his faithful servants to glimpse the future in flames It seemed to me as I watched the fire this morning that I was looking at a dozen beautiful dancers maidens garbed in yellow silk spinning and swirling before a great king I think it was a true vision ser A glimpse of the glory that awaits His Grace after we take King’s Landing and the throne that is his by rights

Stannis has no taste for such dancing Davos thought but he dared not offend the queen’s uncle I saw only fire he said but the smoke was making my eyes water You must pardon me ser the king awaits He pushed past wondering why Ser Axell had troubled himself He is a queen’s man and I am the king’s

Stannis sat at his Painted Table with Maester Pylos at his shoulder an untidy pile of papers before them Ser the king said when Davos entered come have a look at this letter

Obediently he selected a paper at random It looks handsome enough Your Grace but I fear I cannot read the words Davos could decipher maps and charts as well as any but letters and other writings were beyond his powers But my Devan has learned his letters and young Steffon and Stannis as well

I’d forgotten A furrow of irritation showed between the king’s brows Pylos read it to him

Your Grace The maester took up one of the parchments and cleared his throat All men know me for the trueborn son of Steffon Baratheon Lord of Storm’s End by his lady wife Cassana of House Estermont I declare upon the honor of my House that my beloved brother Robert our late king left no trueborn issue of his body the boy Joffrey the boy Tommen and the girl Myrcella being abominations born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime the Kingslayer By right of birth and blood I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros Let all true men declare their loyalty Done in the Light of the Lord under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon the First of His Name King of the Andals the Rhoynar and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms The parchment rustled softly as Pylos laid it down

Make it Ser Jaime the Kingslayer henceforth Stannis said frowning Whatever else the man may be he remains a knight I don’t know that we ought to call Robert my beloved brother either He loved me no more than he had to nor I him

A harmless courtesy Your Grace Pylos said

A lie Take it out Stannis turned to Davos The maester tells me that we have one hundred seventeen ravens on hand I mean to use them all One hundred seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm from the Arbor to the Wall Perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow If so a hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and bedchambers    and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire and lips pledged to silence These great lords love Joffrey or Renly or Robb Stark I am their rightful king but they will deny me if they can So I have need of you

I am yours to command my king As ever

Stannis nodded I mean for you to sail Black Betha north to Gulltown the Fingers the Three Sisters even White Harbor Your son Dale will go south in Wraith past Cape Wrath and the Broken Arm all along the coast of Dorne as far as the Arbor Each of you will carry a chest of letters and you will deliver one to every port and holdfast and fishing village Nail them to the doors of septs and inns for every man to read who can

Davos said That will be few enough

Ser Davos speaks truly Your Grace said Maester Pylos It would be better to have the letters read aloud

Better but more dangerous said Stannis These words will not be kindly received

Give me knights to do the reading Davos said That will carry more weight than anything I might say

Stannis seemed well satisfied with that I can give you such men yes I have a hundred knights who would sooner read than fight Be open where you can and stealthy where you must Use every smuggler’s trick you know the black sails the hidden coves whatever it requires If you run short of letters capture a few septons and set them to copying out more I mean to use your second son as well He will take Lady Marya across the narrow sea to Braavos and the other Free Cities to deliver other letters to the men who rule there The world will know of my claim and of Cersei’s infamy

You can tell them Davos thought but will they believe He glanced thoughtfully at Maester Pylos The king caught the look Maester perhaps you ought get to your writing We will need a great many letters and soon

As you will Pylos bowed and took his leave

The king waited until he was gone before he said What is it you would not say in the presence of my maester Davos

My liege Pylos is pleasant enough but I cannot see the chain about his neck without mourning for Maester Cressen

Is it his fault the old man died Stannis glanced into the fire I never wanted Cressen at that feast He’d angered me yes he’d given me bad counsel but I did not want him dead I’d hoped he might be granted a few years of ease and comfort He had earned that much at least but—he ground his teeth together—but he died And Pylos serves me ably

Pylos is the least of it The letter    What did your lords make of it I wonder

Stannis snorted Celtigar pronounced it admirable If I showed him the contents of my privy he would declare that admirable as well The others bobbed their heads up and down like a flock of geese all but Velaryon who said that steel would decide the matter not words on parchment As if I had never suspected The Others take my lords I’ll hear your views

Your words were blunt and strong

And true

And true Yet you have no proof Of this incest No more than you did a year ago

There’s proof of a sort at Storm’s End Robert’s bastard The one he fathered on my wedding night in the very bed they’d made up for me and my bride Delena was a Florent and a maiden when he took her so Robert acknowledged the babe Edric Storm they call him He is said to be the very image of my brother If men were to see him and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen they could not help but wonder I would think

Yet how are men to see him if he is at Storm’s End

Stannis drummed his fingers on the Painted Table It is a difficulty One of many He raised his eyes You have more to say about the letter Well get on with it I did not make you a knight so you could learn to mouth empty courtesies I have my lords for that Say what you would say Davos

Davos bowed his head There was a phrase at the end How did it go Done in the Light of the Lord   

Yes The king’s jaw was clenched

Your people will mislike those words

As you did said Stannis sharply

If you were to say instead Done in the sight of gods and men or By the grace of the gods old and new   

Have you gone devout on me smuggler

That was to be my question for you my liege

Was it now It sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new maester

I do not know this Lord of Light Davos admitted but I knew the gods we burned this morning The Smith has kept my ships safe while the Mother has given me seven strong sons

Your wife has given you seven strong sons Do you pray to her It was wood we burned this morning

That may be so Davos said but when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a copper sometimes the septons would feed me

I feed you now

You have given me an honored place at your table And in return I give you truth Your people will not love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped and give them one whose very name sounds queer on their tongues

Stannis stood abruptly R’hllor Why is that so hard They will not love me you say When have they ever loved me How can I lose something I have never owned He moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship I vowed In King’s Landing the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven but all I ever saw of either was made by men

If you do not believe in gods—

—why trouble with this new one Stannis broke in I have asked myself as well I know little and care less of gods but the red priestess has power
