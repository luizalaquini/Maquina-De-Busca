The FFT provides very worthwhile cost savings over the use of a bank of
bandpass filters for spectral analysis  Take the example of a 256-point
transform with 8 kHz sampling giving 128 frequency components spaced
by 3125 Hz from 0 up to almost 4 kHz  This can be computed on overlapping
32 msec stretches of the time waveform giving a new spectrum every 16 msec
by a single FFT calculation every 32 msec putting successive pairs of
time stretches in the real and imaginary parts of the complex input sequence
as described earlier  The FFT algorithm requires N log sub 2 N operations
which is 2048 when N=256  An additional 512 operations are required
for the windowing calculation  Repeated every 32 msec this gives
a rate of 80000 operations per second  To achieve a much lower frequency
resolution with 20 bandpass filters each of which are fourth-order
will need a great deal more operations  Each filter will need between 4 and 8
multiplications per sample depending on its exact digital implementation  But new
samples appear every 125
ul
microc
seconds and so somewhere around a million
operations will be required every second
If we increased the frequency resolution to that obtained by the FFT 128
filters would be needed requiring between 4 and 8 million operations

Once the frequency spectrum of a speech signal has been calculated it may
seem a simple matter to estimate the positions of the formants  But it is
not  Spectra obtained in practice are not usually like the idealized ones
of Figure 22  One reason for this is that unless the analysis is
pitch-synchronous the frequency spectrum of the excitation source is mixed
in with that of the vocal tract filter  There are other reasons which will
be discussed later in this section  But first let us consider how to
extract the vocal tract filter characteristics from the combined spectrum
of source and filter  To do so we must begin to explore the theory of linear
systems
rh Discrete linear systems
Figure 410 shows an input signal exciting a filter to produce an output
signal
FC Figure 410
For present purposes imagine the input to be a glottal
waveform the filter a vocal tract one and the output a
speech signal which is then subjected to high-frequency de-emphasis
by radiation from the lips
We will consider here
ul
discrete
systems so that the input xn and output yn are sampled signals
defined only when n is integral  The theory is quite similar for continuous
systems
pp
Assume that the system is
ul
linear
that is if input x sub 1 n produces output y sub 1 n and
input x sub 2 n produces output y sub 2 n
then the sum of x sub 1 n and
x sub 2 n will produce the sum of y sub 1 n and y sub 2 n
It is easy to show from this that for any constant multiplier a
the input axn will produce output ayn em it is pretty obvious
when a=2
or indeed any positive integer for then axn can be written as
xn+xn+ 
Assume further that the system is
ul
time-invariant
that is if input xn
produces output yn then a time-shifted version of x
say xn+n sub 0  for
some constant n sub 0 will produce the same output only time-shifted namely
yn+n sub 0
pp
Now consider the discrete delta function delta n which is 0 except at
n=0 when it is 1
If this single impulse is presented as input to the system the output is called
the
ul
impulse response
and will be denoted by hn
The fact that the system is time-invariant guarantees that the response does
not depend upon the particular time at which the impulse occurred so that
for example the impulsive input delta n+n sub 0  will produce output
hn+n sub 0 
A delta-function input and corresponding impulse response are shown in Figure
410
pp
The impulse response of a linear time-invariant system is an extremely useful
thing to
know for it can be used to calculate the output of the system for any input
at all  Specifically an input signal xn can be written
LB
EQ
xn =  sum from k=- infinity to infinity  xk delta n-k 
EN
LE
because delta n-k is non-zero only when k=n and so for any
particular value of n the summation contains only
one non-zero term em that is xn
The action of the system on each term of the sum is to produce an output
xkhn-k because xk is just a constant and
the system is linear
Furthermore the complete input xn is just the sum of such terms and since
the system is linear the output is the sum of xkhn-k
