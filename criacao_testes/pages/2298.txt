It was not until Qyburn and Steelshanks added their voices that a head finally appeared on the battlements above them He goggled down at them then vanished A short time later they heard the portcullis being drawn upward The gates swung open and Jaime Lannister spurred his horse through the walls scarcely glancing at the murder holes as he passed beneath them He had been worried that the goat might not admit them but it seemed as if the Brave Companions still thought of them as allies Fools

The outer ward was deserted only the long slate-roofed stables showed any signs of life and it was not horses that interested Jaime just then He reined up and looked about He could hear sounds from somewhere behind the Tower of Ghosts and men shouting in half a dozen tongues Steelshanks and Qyburn rode up on either side Get what you came back for and we’ll be gone again said Walton I want no trouble with the Mummers

Tell your men to keep their hands on their sword hilts and the Mummers will want no trouble with you Two to one remember Jaime’s head jerked round at the sound of a distant roar faint but ferocious It echoed off the walls of Harrenhal and the laughter swelled up like the sea All of a sudden he knew what was happening Have we come too late His stomach did a lurch and he slammed his spurs into his horse galloping across the outer ward beneath an arched stone bridge around the Wailing Tower and through the Flowstone Yard

They had her in the bear pit

King Harren the Black had wished to do even his bear-baiting in lavish style The pit was ten yards across and five yards deep walled in stone floored with sand and encircled by six tiers of marble benches The Brave Companions filled only a quarter of the seats Jaime saw as he swung down clumsily from his horse The sellswords were so fixed on the spectacle beneath that only those across the pit noticed their arrival

Brienne wore the same ill-fitting gown she’d worn to supper with Roose Bolton No shield no breastplate no chainmail not even boiled leather only pink satin and Myrish lace Maybe the goat thought she was more amusing when dressed as a woman Half her gown was hanging off in tatters and her left arm dripped blood where the bear had raked her

At least they gave her a sword The wench held it one-handed moving sideways trying to put some distance between her and the bear That’s no good the ring’s too small She needed to attack to make a quick end to it Good steel was a match for any bear But the wench seemed afraid to close The Mummers showered her with insults and obscene suggestions

This is none of our concern Steelshanks warned Jaime Lord Bolton said the wench was theirs to do with as they liked

Her name’s Brienne Jaime descended the steps past a dozen startled sellswords Vargo Hoat had taken the lord’s box in the lowest tier Lord Vargo he called over the shouts

The Qohorik almost spilt his wine Kingthlayer The left side of his face was bandaged clumsily the linen over his ear spotted with blood

Pull her out of there

Thay out of thith Kingthlayer unleth you’d like another thump He waved a wine cup Your thee-mooth bit oth my ear Thmall wonder her father will not ranthom thuch a freak

A roar turned Jaime back around The bear was eight feet tall Gregor Clegane with a pelt he thought though likely smarter The beast did not have the reach the Mountain had with that monster greatsword of his though

Bellowing in fury the bear showed a mouth full of great yellow teeth then fell back to all fours and went straight at Brienne There’s your chance Jaime thought Strike Now

Instead she poked out ineffectually with the point of her blade The bear recoiled then came on rumbling Brienne slid to her left and poked again at the bear’s face This time he lifted a paw to swat the sword aside

He’s wary Jaime realized He’s gone up against other men He knows swords and spears can hurt him But that won’t keep him off her long Kill him he shouted but his voice was lost amongst all the other shouts If Brienne heard she gave no sign She moved around the pit keeping the wall at her back Too close If the bear pins her by the wall   

The beast turned clumsily too far and too fast Quick as a cat Brienne changed direction There’s the wench I remember She leapt in to land a cut across the bear’s back Roaring the beast went up on his hind legs again Brienne scrambled back away Where’s the blood Then suddenly he understood Jaime rounded on Hoat You gave her a tourney sword

The goat brayed laughter spraying him with wine and spittle Of courth

I’ll pay her bloody ransom Gold sapphires whatever you want Pull her out of there

You want her Go get her

So he did

He put his good hand on the marble rail and vaulted over rolling as he hit the sand The bear turned at the thump sniffing watching this new intruder warily Jaime scrambled to one knee Well what in seven hells do I do now He filled his fist with sand Kingslayer he heard Brienne say astonished

Jaime He uncoiled flinging the sand at the bear’s face The bear mauled the air and roared like blazes

What are you doing here

Something stupid Get behind me He circled toward her putting himself between Brienne and the bear

You get behind I have the sword

A sword with no point and no edge Get behind me He saw something half-buried in the sand and snatched it up with his good hand It proved to be a human jawbone with some greenish flesh still clinging to it crawling with maggots Charming he thought wondering whose face he held The bear was edging closer so Jaime whipped his arm around and flung bone meat and maggots at the beast’s head He missed by a good yard I ought to lop my left hand off as well for all the good it does me

Brienne tried to dart around but he kicked her legs out from under her She fell in the sand clutching the useless sword Jaime straddled her and the bear came charging

There was a deep twang and a feathered shaft sprouted suddenly beneath the beast’s left eye Blood and slaver ran from his open mouth and another bolt took him in the leg The bear roared reared He saw Jaime and Brienne again and lumbered toward them More crossbows fired the quarrels ripping through fur and flesh At such short range the bowmen could hardly miss The shafts hit as hard as maces but the bear took another step The poor dumb brave brute When the beast swiped at him he danced aside shouting kicking sand The bear turned to follow his tormentor and took another two quarrels in the back He gave one last rumbling growl settled back onto his haunches stretched out on the bloodstained sand and died

Brienne got back to her knees clutching the sword and breathing short ragged breaths Steelshanks’s archers were winding their crossbows and reloading while the Bloody Mummers shouted curses and threats at them Rorge and Three Toes had swords out Jaime saw and Zollo was uncoiling his whip

You thlew my bear Vargo Hoat shrieked

And I’ll serve you the same if you give me trouble Steelshanks threw back We’re taking the wench

Her name is Brienne Jaime said Brienne the maid of Tarth You are still maiden I hope

Her broad homely face turned red Yes

Oh good Jaime said I only rescue maidens To Hoat he said You’ll have your ransom For both of us A Lannister pays his debts Now fetch some ropes and get us out of here

Bugger that Rorge growled Kill them Hoat Or you’ll bloody well wish you had

The Qohorik hesitated Half his men were drunk the northmen stone sober and there were twice as many Some of the crossbowmen had reloaded by now Pull them out Hoat said and then to Jaime I hath chothen to be merthiful Tell your lord father

I will my lord Not that it will do you any good

Not until they were half a league from Harrenhal and out of range of archers on the walls did Steelshanks Walton let his anger show Are you mad Kingslayer Did you mean to die No man can fight a bear with his bare hands

One bare hand and one bare stump Jaime corrected But I hoped you’d kill the beast before the beast killed me Elsewise Lord Bolton would have peeled you like an orange no

Steelshanks cursed him roundly for a fool of Lannister spurred his horse and galloped away up the column

Ser Jaime Even in soiled pink satin and torn lace Brienne looked more like a man in a gown than a proper woman I am grateful but    you were well away Why come back

A dozen quips came to mind each crueler than the one before but Jaime only shrugged I dreamed of you he said





CATELYN

Robb bid farewell to his young queen thrice Once in the godswood before the heart tree in sight of gods and men The second time beneath the portcullis where Jeyne sent him forth with a long embrace and a longer kiss And finally an hour beyond the Tumblestone when the girl came galloping up on a well-lathered horse to plead with her young king to take her along

Robb was touched by that Catelyn saw but abashed as well The day was damp and grey a drizzle had begun to fall and the last thing he wanted was to call a halt to his march so he could stand in the wet and console a tearful young wife in front of half his army He speaks her gently she thought as she watched them together but there is anger underneath

All the time the king and queen were talking Grey Wind prowled around them stopping only to shake the water from his coat and bare his teeth at the rain When at last Robb gave Jeyne one final kiss dispatched a dozen men to take her back to Riverrun and mounted his horse once more the direwolf raced off ahead as swift as an arrow loosed from a longbow

Queen Jeyne has a loving heart I see said Lame Lothar Frey to Catelyn Not unlike my own sisters Why I would wager a guess that even now Roslin in dancing round the Twins chanting ‘Lady Tully Lady Tully Lady Roslin Tully’ By the morrow she’ll be holding swatches of Riverrun red-and-blue to her cheek to picture how she’ll look in her bride’s cloak He turned in the saddle to smile at Edmure But you are strangely quiet Lord Tully How do you feel I wonder
