Filtering is often best done using the DFT  If the rippled waveform of Figure
411 is transformed a strong component could be expected at the ripple
frequency with weaker ones at its harmonics  These components can be
simply removed by setting them to zero and inverse-transforming the result
to give a smoothed version of the original frequency spectrum
A spectrum of the logarithm of a frequency spectrum is often called a
ul
cepstrum
em a sort of backwards spectrum  The horizontal axis of the cepstrum
having the dimension of time is called quefrency  Note that high-frequency
signals have low quefrencies and vice versa  In practice
because the pitch ripple is usually well above the quefrency of interest for
formants the upper end of the cepstrum is often simply cut off from a fixed
quefrency which corresponds to the maximum pitch expected  However identifying
the pitch peaks of the cepstrum has the useful byproduct of giving the pitch
period of the original speech

identify the lowest-quefrency peak in the spectrum as the pitch
confirming it by examining its harmonics which should be
equally spaced at the pitch quefrency
NP
remove pitch effects from the cepstrum by cutting off its high-quefrency
part above either the pitch quefrency or some constant representing the maximum
expected pitch which is the minimum expected pitch quefrency

inverse DFT the resulting cepstrum to give a smoothed spectrum

rh Estimating formant frequencies from smoothed spectra
The difficulties of formant extraction are not over even when a smooth frequency
spectrum has been obtained  A simple peak-picking algorithm which identifies
a peak at the kth frequency component whenever

will quite often identify formants incorrectly
It helps to specify in advance minimum and maximum formant frequencies em say
100 Hz and 3 kHz for three-formant identification and ignore peaks lying
outside these limits  It helps to estimate
the bandwidth of the peaks and reject those with bandwidths greater than
500 Hz em for real formants are never this wide  However if two formants are
very close then they may appear as a single wide peak and be rejected by
this criterion  It is usual to take account of formant positions identified
in previous frames under these conditions

Markel and Gray 1976 describe in detail several estimation algorithms

Markel Gray 1976 Linear prediction of speech

Their simplest uses the number of peaks identified in the raw spectrum
under 3 kHz and with
bandwidths greater than 500 Hz to determine what to do  If exactly three
peaks are found they are used as the formant positions  It is claimed that
this happens about 85 to 90 of the time
If only one peak is found the present frame is ignored and the
previously-identified
formant positions are used this happens less than 1 of the time
The remaining cases are two peaks em corresponding to omission of one formant em
and four peaks em corresponding to an extra formant being included  More
than
four peaks never occurred in their data  Under these conditions
a nearest-neighbour measure is used for disambiguation  The measure is
LB
EQ
v sub ij  =  | F sup   sub i k - F sub j k-1| 
EN
LE
where F sub j sup k-1 is the jth formant frequency defined
in the previous frame
k-1 and  F sup   sub i k is the ith raw data frequency estimate
for frame k
If two peaks only are found this measure is used to identify
the closest peaks in the previous frame and then the
third peak of that frame is taken to be the missing formant
position  If four peaks are found the measure is used to
determine which of them is furthest from the previous formant
values and this one is discarded
pp
This procedure works forwards using the previous frame to
disambiguate peaks given in the current one  More sophisticated
