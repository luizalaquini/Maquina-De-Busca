dimly seen extended into the air
  Are any of my men among you she said anxiously
  Yes maam several said Susan Talls husband
  Tomorrow morning I wish two or three of you to
make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen
such a person as Fanny Robin Do it quietly there is
no reason for alarm as yet She must have left whilst
we were all at the fire
  I beg yer pardon but had she any young man court+
ing her in the parish maam asked Jacob Smallbury
  I dont know said Bathsheba
  Ive never heard of any such thing maam said
two or three
  It is hardly likely either continued Bathsheba
For any lover of hers might have come to the house if
he had been a respectable lad The most mysterious
matter connected with her absence -- indeed the only
thing which gives me serious alarm -- is that she was
seen to go out of the house by Maryann with only her
indoor working gown on -- not even a bonnet
  And you mean maam excusing my words that a
young
P 119
woman would hardly go to see her young man
without dressing up said Jacob turning his mental
vision upon past experiences Thats true -- she would
not maam
  She had I think a bundle though I couldnt see
very well said a female voice from another window
which seemed that of Maryann But she had no
young man about here Hers lives in Casterbridge and
I believe hes a soldier
  Do you know his name Bathsheba said
  No mistress she was very close about it
  Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to
Casterbridge barracks said William Smallbury
  Very well if she doesnt return tomorrow mind
you go there and try to discover which man it is and
see him I feel more responsible than I should if she
had had any friends or relations alive I do hope she
has come to no harm through a man of that kind
And then theres this disgraceful affair of the bailiff --
but I cant speak of him now
  Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that
it seemed she did not think it worth while to dwell
upon any particular one Do as I told you then
she said in conclusion closing the casement
  Ay ay mistress we will they replied and moved
away
  That night at Coggans Gabriel Oak beneath the
screen of closed eyelids was busy with fancies and full
of movement like a river flowing rapidly under its ice
Night had always been the time at which he saw Bath+
sheba most vividly and through the slow hours of
shadow he tenderly regarded her image now It is
rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compen+
sate for the pain of sleeplessness but they possibly did
with Oak to-night for the delight of merely seeing her
effaced for the time his perception of the great differ+
ence between seeing and possessing
  He also thought of Plans for fetching his few utensils
and books from Norcombe The Young Mans Best
Companion The Farriers Sure Guide The Veterinary
Surgeon Paradise Lost The Pilgrims Progress Robinson
Crusoe Ashs Dictionary the Walkingames Arithmetic
constituted his library
P 120
and though a limited series it was
one from which he had acquired more sound informa+
tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities
has done from a furlong of laden shelves

THE HOMESTEAD -- A VISITOR -- HALF-CONFIDENCES
By daylight the Bower of Oaks new-found mistress
Bathsheba Everdene presented itself as a hoary build+
ing of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards
its architecture and of a proportion which told at a
glance that as is so frequently the case it had once
been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it
now altogether effaced as a distinct property and merged
in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord which com+
prised several such modest demesnes
  Fluted pilasters worked from the solid stone
decorated its front and above the roof the chimneys
were panelled or columnar some coped gables with
finials and like features still retaining traces of their
Gothic extraction Soft Brown mosses like faded
velveteen formed cushions upon the stone tiling and
tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the
eaves of the low surrounding buildings A gravel walk
leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted
at the sides with more moss -- here it was a silver-green
variety the nut-brown of the gravel being visible to the
width of only a foot or two in the centre This circum+
stance and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect
here together with the animated and contrasting state
of the reverse facade suggested to the imagination that
on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes
the vital principle of the house had turned round inside
