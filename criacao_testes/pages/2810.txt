unto Ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the LORD and of his statutes to Israel

712 Artaxerxes king of kings unto Ezra the priest a scribe of the
law of the God of heaven perfect peace and at such a time

713 I make a decree that all they of the people of Israel and of
his priests and Levites in my realm which are minded of their own
freewill to go up to Jerusalem go with thee

714 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven
counsellors to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to
the law of thy God which is in thine hand 715 And to carry the
silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely
offered unto the God of Israel whose habitation is in Jerusalem 716
And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province
of Babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the
priests offering willingly for the house of their God which is in
Jerusalem 717 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money
bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink
offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God
which is in Jerusalem

718 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to
do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of
your God

719 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house
of thy God those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem

720 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God
which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the kings
treasure house

721 And I even I Artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the
treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever Ezra the
priest the scribe of the law of the God of heaven shall require of
you it be done speedily 722 Unto an hundred talents of silver and
to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and
to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much

723 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven let it be
diligently done for the house of the God of heaven for why should
there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons  724 Also
we certify you that touching any of the priests and Levites singers
porters Nethinims or ministers of this house of God it shall not be
lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them

725 And thou Ezra after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine
hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that
are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy God and teach
ye them that know them not

726 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the
king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto
death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to
imprisonment

727 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers which hath put such a
thing as this in the kings heart to beautify the house of the LORD
which is in Jerusalem 728 And hath extended mercy unto me before the
king and his counsellors and before all the kings mighty princes
And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me and
I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me
