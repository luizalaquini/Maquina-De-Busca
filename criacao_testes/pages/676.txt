Jon


Big enough for you Snowflakes speckled Tormund’s broad face melting in his hair and beard

‘The giants swayed slowly atop the mammoths as they rode past two by two Jon’s garron shied frightened by such strangeness but whether it was the mammoths or their riders that scared him it was hard to say Even Ghost backed off a step baring his teeth in a silent snarl The direwolf was big but the mammoths were a deal bigger and there were many and more of them

Jon took the horse in hand and held him still so he could count the giants emerging from the blowing snow and pale mists that swirled along the Milkwater He was well beyond fifty when Tormund said something and he lost the count There must be hundreds No matter how many went past they just seemed to keep coming

In Old Nan’s stories giants were outsized men who lived in colossal castles fought with huge swords and walked about in boots a boy could hide in These were something else more bearlike than human and as wooly as the mammoths they rode Seated it was hard to say how big they truly were Ten feet tall maybe or twelve Jon thought Maybe fourteen but no taller Their sloping chests might have passed for those of men but their arms hung down too far and their lower torsos looked half again as wide as their upper Their legs were shorter than their arms but very thick and they wore no boots at all their feet were broad splayed things hard and horny and black Neckless their huge heavy heads thrust forward from between their shoulder blades and their faces were squashed and brutal Rats’ eyes no larger than beads were almost lost within folds of horny flesh but they snuffled constantly smelling as much as they saw

They’re not wearing skins Jon realized That’s hair Shaggy pelts covered their bodies thick below the waist sparser above The stink that came off them was choking but perhaps that was the mammoths And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth He looked for great swords ten feet long but saw only clubs Most were just the limbs of dead trees some still trailing shattered branches A few had stone balls lashed to the ends to make colossal mauls The song never says if the horn can put them back to sleep

One of the giants coming up on them looked older than the rest His pelt was grey and streaked with white and the mammoth he rode larger than any of the others was grey and white as well Tormund shouted something up to him as he passed harsh clanging words in a tongue that Jon did not comprehend The giant’s lips split apart to reveal a mouth full of huge square teeth and he made a sound half belch and half rumble After a moment Jon realized he was laughing The mammoth turned its massive head to regard the two of them briefly one huge tusk passing over the top of Jon’s head as the beast lumbered by leaving huge footprints in the soft mud and fresh snow along the river The giant shouted down something in the same coarse tongue that Tormund had used

Was that their king asked Jon

Giants have no kings no more’n mammoths do nor snow bears nor the great whales o’ the grey sea That was Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg Mag the Mighty You can kneel to him if you like he won’t mind I know your kneeler’s knees must be itching for want of some king to bend to Watch out he don’t step on you though Giants have bad eyes and might be he wouldn’t see some little crow all the way down there by his feet

What did you say to him Was that the Old Tongue

Aye I asked him if that was his father he was forking they looked so much alike except his father had a better smell

And what did he say to you

Tormund Thunderfist cracked a gap-toothed smile He asked me if that was my daughter riding there beside me with her smooth pink cheeks The wildling shook snow from his arm and turned his horse about It may be he never saw a man without a beard before Come we start back Mance grows sore wroth when I’m not found in my accustomed place

Jon wheeled and followed Tormund back toward the head of the column his new cloak hanging heavy from his shoulders It was made of unwashed sheepskins worn fleece side in as the wildlings suggested It kept the snow off well enough and at night it was good and warm but he kept his black cloak as well folded up beneath his saddle Is it true you killed a giant once he asked Tormund as they rode Ghost loped silently beside them leaving paw prints in the new-fallen snow

Now why would you doubt a mighty man like me It was winter and I was half a boy and stupid the way boys are I went too far and my horse died and then a storm caught me A true storm not no little dusting such as this Har I knew I’d freeze to death before it broke So I found me a sleeping giant cut open her belly and crawled up right inside her Kept me warm enough she did but the stink near did for me The worst thing was she woke up when the spring come and took me for her babe Suckled me for three whole moons before I could get away Har There’s times I miss the taste o’ giant’s milk though

If she nursed you you couldn’t have killed her

I never did but see you don’t go spreading that about Tormund Giantsbane has a better ring to it than Tormund Giantsbabe and that’s the honest truth o’ it

So how did you come by your other names Jon asked Mance called you the Horn-Blower didn’t he Mead-king of Ruddy Hall Husband to Bears Father to Hosts It was the horn blowing he particularly wanted to hear about but he dared not ask too plainly And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth Is that where they had come from them and their mammoths Had Mance Rayder found the Horn of Joramun and given it to Tormund Thunderfist to blow

Are all crows so curious asked Tormund Well here’s a tale for you It were another winter colder even than the one I spent inside that giant and snowing day and night snowflakes as big as your head not these little things It snowed so hard the whole village was half buried I was in me Ruddy Hall with only a cask o’ mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it The more I drank the more I got to thinking about this woman lived close by a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever saw She had a temper on her that one but oh she could be warm too and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth

The more I drank the more I thought about her and the more I thought the harder me member got till I couldn’t suffer it no more Fool that I was I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels wrapped a winding wool around me face and set off to find her The snow was coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice and the wind blew right through me and froze me bones but finally I come on her all bundled up like I was

The woman had a terrible temper and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o’ them furs but when I did oh she was hotter even than I remembered and we had a fine old time and then I went to sleep Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining but I was in no fit state to enjoy it All ripped and torn I was and half me member bit right off and there on me floor was a she-bear’s pelt And soon enough the free folk were telling tales o’ this bald bear seen in the woods with the queerest pair o’ cubs behind her Har He slapped a meaty thigh Would that I could find her again She was fine to lay with that bear Never was a woman gave me such a fight nor such strong sons neither

’What could you do if you did find her Jon asked smiling You said she bit your member off

Only half And half me member is twice as long as any other man’s Tormund snorted Now as to you… is it true they cut your members off when they take you for the Wall

No Jon said affronted

I think it must be true Else why refuse Ygritte She’d hardly give you any fight at all seems to me The girl wants you in her that’s plain enough to see
