1012 And their whole body and their backs and their hands and
their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the
wheels that they four had

1013 As for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing O
wheel

1014 And every one had four faces the first face was the face of a
cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the
face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle

1015 And the cherubims were lifted up This is the living creature
that I saw by the river of Chebar

1016 And when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when
the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the
same wheels also turned not from beside them

1017 When they stood these stood and when they were lifted up
these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature
was in them

1018 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
the house and stood over the cherubims

1019 And the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the
earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside
them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORDs
house and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above

1020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
by the river of Chebar and I knew that they were the cherubims

1021 Every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and
the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings

1022 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
by the river of Chebar their appearances and themselves they went
every one straight forward

111 Moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east
gate of the LORDs house which looketh eastward and behold at the
door of the gate five and twenty men among whom I saw Jaazaniah the
son of Azur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah princes of the people

112 Then said he unto me Son of man these are the men that devise
mischief and give wicked counsel in this city 113 Which say It is
not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the
flesh

114 Therefore prophesy against them prophesy O son of man

115 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me and said unto me Speak
Thus saith the LORD Thus have ye said O house of Israel for I know
the things that come into your mind every one of them

116 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled
the streets thereof with the slain

117 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Your slain whom ye have laid
in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron
but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it

118 Ye have feared the sword and I will bring a sword upon you
saith the Lord GOD

119 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you
into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you

1110 Ye shall fall by the sword I will judge you in the border of
Israel and ye shall know that I am the LORD

1111 This city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the
flesh in the midst thereof but I will judge you in the border of
Israel 1112 And ye shall know that I am the LORD for ye have not
walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done
after the manners of the heathen that are round about you

1113 And it came to pass when I prophesied that Pelatiah the son of
Benaiah died Then fell I down upon my face and cried with a loud
voice and said Ah Lord GOD wilt thou make a full end of the remnant
of Israel  1114 Again the word of the LORD came unto me saying
1115 Son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy
kindred and all the house of Israel wholly are they unto whom the
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said Get you far from the LORD unto us
is this land given in possession

1116 Therefore say Thus saith the Lord GOD Although I have cast
them far off among the heathen and although I have scattered them
among the countries yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in
the countries where they shall come

1117 Therefore say Thus saith the Lord GOD I will even gather you
from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have
been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel

1118 And they shall come thither and they shall take away all the
detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from
thence
