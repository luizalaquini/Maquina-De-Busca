have they uttered their voice from Zoar even unto Horonaim as an
heifer of three years old for the waters also of Nimrim shall be
desolate

4835 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab saith the LORD him that
offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods

4836 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes and mine
heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres because the
riches that he hath gotten are perished

4837 For every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all
the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth

4838 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
Moab and in the streets thereof for I have broken Moab like a vessel
wherein is no pleasure saith the LORD

4839 They shall howl saying How is it broken down how hath Moab
turned the back with shame so shall Moab be a derision and a
dismaying to all them about him

4840 For thus saith the LORD Behold he shall fly as an eagle and
shall spread his wings over Moab

4841 Kerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the
mighty mens hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a
woman in her pangs

4842 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath
magnified himself against the LORD

4843 Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee O
inhabitant of Moab saith the LORD

4844 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he
that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for I will
bring upon it even upon Moab the year of their visitation saith the
LORD

4845 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the
force but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon and a flame from
the midst of Sihon and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown
of the head of the tumultuous ones

4846 Woe be unto thee O Moab the people of Chemosh perisheth for
thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives

4847 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days
saith the LORD Thus far is the judgment of Moab

491 Concerning the Ammonites thus saith the LORD Hath Israel no
sons  hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit Gad and his
people dwell in his cities  492 Therefore behold the days come
saith the LORD that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in
Rabbah of the Ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her
daughters shall be burned with fire then shall Israel be heir unto
them that were his heirs saith the LORD

493 Howl O Heshbon for Ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of Rabbah
gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for
their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes
together

494 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley O
backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying Who shall
come unto me  495 Behold I will bring a fear upon thee saith the
Lord GOD of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be
driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that
wandereth

496 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of
Ammon saith the LORD

497 Concerning Edom thus saith the LORD of hosts Is wisdom no more
in Teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom
vanished  498 Flee ye turn back dwell deep O inhabitants of
Dedan for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him the time that I
will visit him

499 If grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some
gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have
enough

4910 But I have made Esau bare I have uncovered his secret places
and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his
brethren and his neighbours and he is not

4911 Leave thy fatherless children I will preserve them alive and
let thy widows trust in me

4912 For thus saith the LORD Behold they whose judgment was not to
drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall
altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt
surely drink of it

4913 For I have sworn by myself saith the LORD that Bozrah shall
become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the
cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes
