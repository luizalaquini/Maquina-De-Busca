plan
But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers he
retorts Is that everyones problem That our enemies
might have a few hours to reflect on the fact that theyre
dying instead of just being blown to bits
Back in the old days when we were nothing more than
a couple of kids hunting outside of 12 Gale said things like
this and worse But then they were just words Here put into
practice they become deeds that can never be reversed
You dont know how those District Two people ended
up in the Nut I say They may have been coerced They
may be held against their will Some are our own spies Will
you kill them too
I would sacrifice a few yes to take out the rest of
them he replies And if I were a spy in there Id say
Bring on the avalanches
I know hes telling the truth That Gale would sacrifice
his life in this way for the cause--no one doubts it Perhaps
wed all do the same if we were the spies and given the
choice I guess I would But its a coldhearted decision to
make for other people and those who love them
You said we had two choices Boggs tells him To
trap them or to flush them out I say we try to avalanche the
mountain but leave the train tunnel alone People can
escape into the square where well be waiting for them
Heavily armed I hope says Gale You can be sure
theyll be
Heavily armed Well take them prisoner agrees
Boggs
Lets bring Thirteen into the loop now Beetee
suggests Let President Coin weigh in
Shell want to block the tunnel says Gale with
conviction
Yes most likely But you know Peeta did have a point
in his propos About the dangers of killing ourselves off Ive
been playing with some numbers Factoring in the
casualties and the wounded andI think its at least worth a
conversation says Beetee
Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that
conversation Gale and I are released with the rest I take
him hunting so he can blow off some steam but hes not
talking about it Probably too angry with me for countering
him
The call does happen a decision is made and by
evening Im suited up in my Mockingjay outfit with my bow
slung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects me
to Haymitch in 13--just in case a good opportunity for a
propo arises We wait on the roof of the Justice Building
with a clear view of our target
Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the
commanders in the Nut because in the past theyve been
little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot But
after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the
mountain the planes have their attention By the time the
Capitols antiaircraft weapons begin to fire its already too
late
Gales plan exceeds anyones expectations Beetee
was right about being unable to control the avalanches
once theyd been set in motion The mountainsides are
naturally unstable but weakened by the explosions they
seem almost fluid Whole sections of the Nut collapse
before our eyes obliterating any sign that human beings
have ever set foot on the place We stand speechless tiny
and insignificant as waves of stone thunder down the
mountain Burying the entrances under tons of rock Raising
a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky Turning the
Nut into a tomb
I imagine the hell inside the mountain Sirens wailing
Lights flickering into darkness Stone dust choking the air
The shrieks of panicked trapped beings stumbling madly
for a way out only to find the entrances the launchpad the
ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock
trying to force its way in Live wires flung free fires breaking
out rubble making a familiar path a maze People
slamming shoving scrambling like ants as the hill presses
in threatening to crush their fragile shells
Katniss Haymitchs voice is in my earpiece I try to
answer back and find both of my hands are clamped tightly
over my mouth Katniss
On the day my father died the sirens went off during
my school lunch No one waited for dismissal or was
expected to The response to a mine accident was
something outside the control of even the Capitol I ran to
Prims class I still remember her tiny at seven very pale
but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk
Waiting for me to collect her as Id promised I would if the
sirens ever sounded She sprang out of her seat grabbed
my coat sleeve and we wove through the streams of
people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main
entrance of the mine We found our mother clenching the
rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back In
retrospect I guess I should have known there was a
problem right then Because why were we looking for her
when the reverse should have been true
The elevators were screeching burning up and down
their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into
the light of day With each group came cries of relief
relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands
wives children parents siblings We stood in the freezing
air as the afternoon turned overcast a light snow dusted the
