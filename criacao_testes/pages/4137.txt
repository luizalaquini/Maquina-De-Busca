calamities in other ways
 Well tis  but a happy Providence ordered that it
should be no worse and I feel my thanks As to
shepherd there Im sure misess ought to have made
ye her baily -- such a fitting man fort as you be
I dont mind owning that I expected it said Oak
frankly  Indeed I hoped for the place At the same
time Miss Everdene has a right to be own baily if
she choose -- and to keep me down to be a common
shepherd only Oak drew a slow breath looked sadly
into the bright ashpit and seemed lost in thoughts not
of the most hopeful hue
The genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate
the nearly lifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs
briskly upon the hay and to recognize for the first time
the fact that they were born Their noise increased to a
chorus of baas upon which Oak pulled the milk-can from
before the fire and taking a small tea-pot from the pocket
of his smock-frock filled it with milk and taught those of
the helpless creatures which were not to be restored to
their dams how to drink from the spout -- a trick they
acquired with astonishing aptitude
And she dont even let ye have the skins of the
dead lambs I hear resumed Joseph Poorgrass his
eyes lingering on the operations of Oak with the neces+
sary melancholy
I dont have them said Gabriel
Ye be very badly used shepherd hazardcd Joseph
again in
P 160
the hope of getting Oak as an ally in lamenta+
tion after all I think shes took against ye -- that
I do
O no -- not at all replied Gabriel hastily and a
sigh escaped him which the deprivation of lamb skins
could hardly have caused
Before any further remark had been added a shade
darkened the door and Boldwood entered the malthouse
bestowing upon each a nod of a quality between friendli+
ness and condescension
Ah Oak I thought you were here he said I
met the mail-cart ten minutes ago and a letter was put
into my hand which I opened without reading the
address I believe it is yours You must excuse the
accident please
O yes -- not a bit of difference Mr Boldwood --
not a bit said Gabriel readily He had not a corre+
spondent on earth nor was there a possible letter coming
to him whose contents the whole parish would not have
been welcome to persue
Oak stepped aside and read the following in an
unknown hand --
 DEAR FRIEND -- I do not know your name but l think
these few lines will reach you which I wrote to thank you
for your kindness to me the night I left Weatherbury in a
reckless way I also return the money I owe you which
you will excuse my not keeping as a gift All has ended
well and I am happy to say I am going to be married to
the young man who has courted me for some time -- Sergeant
Troy of the 11th Dragoon Guards now quartered in this
town He would I know object to my having received
anything except as a loan being a man of great respecta+
bility and high honour -- indeed a nobleman by blood
 I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the
contents of this letter a secret for the present dear friend
We mean to surprise Weatherbury by coming there soon
as husband and wife though l blush to state it to one nearly
a strangen The sergeant grew up in Weatherbury Thank+
ing you again for your kindness
I am your sincere well-wisher
 FANNV ROBIN
 Have you read it Mr Boldwood said Gabriel
if not you had better do so I know you are interested
in Fanny Robin
P 161
Boldwood read the letter and looked grieved
Fanny -- poor Fanny the end she is so confident
of has not yet come she should remember -- and may
never come I see she gives no address
What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy said
Gabriel
Hm -- Im afraid not one to build much hope upon
in such a case as this the farmer murmured though
hes a clever fellow and up to everything A slight
romance attaches to him too His mother was a French
governess and it seems that a secret attachment existed
between her and the late Lord Severn She was married
to a poor medical man and soon after an infant was
horn and while money was forthcoming all went on
well Unfortunately for her boy his best friends died
and he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyers
in Casterbridge He stayed there for some time and
might have worked himself into a dignified position of
some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak of
enlisting I have much doubt if ever little Fanny will
surprise us in the way she mentions -- very much doubt
A silly girl -- silly girl
The door was hurriedly burst open again and in
came running Cainy Ball out of breath his mouth red
and open like the bell of a penny trumpet from which
