She gave him a silver for his trouble and sent him on his way before she turned back to the old man with the white beard Who is it that I owe my life to

You owe me nothing Your Grace I am called Arstan though Belwas named me Whitebeard on the voyage here Though Jhogo had released him the old man remained on one knee Aggo picked up his staff turned it over cursed softly in Dothraki scraped the remains of the manticore off on a stone and handed it back

And who is Belwas she asked

The huge brown eunuch swaggered forward sheathing his arakh I am Belwas Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen Never did I lose He slapped his belly covered with scars I let each man cut me once before I kill him Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain

Dany had no need to count his scars there were many she could see at a glance And why are you here Strong Belwas

From Meereen I am sold to Qohor and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in his hair He it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea and old Whitebeard to serve him

The fat man with sweet stink in his hair…Illyrio she said You were sent by Magister Illyrio

We were Your Grace old Whitebeard replied The Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending us in his stead but he cannot sit a horse as he did in his youth and sea travel upsets his digestion Earlier he had spoken in the Valyrian of the Free Cities but now he changed to the Common Tongue I regret if we caused you alarm If truth be told we were not certain we expected someone more… more…

Regal Dany laughed She had no dragon with her and her raiment was hardly queenly You speak the Common Tongue well Arstan Are you of Westeros

I am I was born on the Dornish Marches Your Grace As a boy I squired for a knight of Lord Swann’s household He held the tall staff upright beside him like a lance in need of a banner Now I squire for Belwas

A bit old for such aren’t you Ser Jorah had shouldered his way to her side holding the brass platter awkwardly under his arm Belwas’s hard head had left it badly bent

Not too old to serve my liege Lord Mormont

You know me as well

I saw you fight a time or two At Lannisport where you near unhorsed the Kingslayer And on Pyke there as well You do not recall Lord Mormont

Ser Jorah frowned Your face seems familiar but there were hundreds at Lannisport and thousands on Pyke And I am no lord Bear Island was taken from me I am but a knight

A knight of my Queensguard Dany took his arm And my true friend and good counselor She studied Arstan’s face He had a great dignity to him a quiet strength she liked Rise Arstan Whitebeard Be welcome Strong Belwas Ser Jorah you know Ko Aggo and Ko Jhogo are blood of my blood They crossed the red waste with me and saw my dragons born

Horse boys Belwas grinned toothily Belwas has killed many horse boys in the fighting pits They jingle when they die

Aggo’s arakh leapt to his hand Never have I killed a fat brown man Belwas will be the first

Sheath your steel blood of my blood said Dany this man comes to serve me Belwas you will accord all respect to my people or you will leave my service sooner than you’d wish and with more scars than when you came

The gap-toothed smile faded from the giant’s broad brown face replaced by a confused scowl Men did not often threaten Belwas it would seem and less so girls a third his size

Dany gave him a smile to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke Now tell me what would Magister Illyrio have of me that he would send you all the way from Pentos

He would have dragons said Belwas gruffly and the girl who makes them He would have you

Belwas has the truth of us Your Grace said Arstan We were told to find you and bring you back to Pentos The Seven Kingdoms have need of you Robert the Usurper is dead and the realm bleeds When we set sail from Pentos there were four kings in the land and no justice to be had

Joy bloomed in her heart but Dany kept it from her face I have three dragons she said and more than a hundred in my khalasar with all their goods and horses

it is no matter boomed Belwas We take all The fat man hires three ships for his little silverhair queen

It is so Your Grace Arstan Whitebeard said The great cog Saduleon is berthed at the end of the quay and the galleys Summer Sun and Joso’s Prank are anchored beyond the breakwater

Three heads has the dragon Dany thought wondering I shall tell my people to make ready to depart at once But the ships that bring me home must bear different names
