Sansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister’s face to know the boy was telling the truth but Joffrey was in no mood to listen The wine had made him wild Are you going to pick up your sword

Mycah shook his head It’s only a stick m’lord It’s not no sword it’s only a stick

And you’re only a butcher’s boy and no knight Joffrey lifted Lion’s Tooth and laid its point on Mycah’s cheek below the eye as the butcher’s boy stood trembling That was my lady’s sister you were hitting do you know that A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah’s flesh and a slow red line trickled down the boy’s cheek

Stop it Arya screamed She grabbed up her fallen stick

Sansa was afraid Arya you stay out of this

I won’t hurt him… much Prince Joffrey told Arya never taking his eyes off the butcher’s boy

Arya went for him

Sansa slid off her mare but she was too slow Arya swung with both hands There was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the prince’s head and then everything happened at once before Sansa’s horrified eyes Joffrey staggered and whirled around roaring curses Mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him Arya swung at the prince again but this time Joffrey caught the blow on Lion’s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands The back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire Sansa was shrieking No no stop it stop it both of you you’re spoiling it but no one was listening Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey’s head She hit his horse instead and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah Stop it don’t stop it Sansa screamed Joffrey slashed at Arya with his sword screaming obscenities terrible words filthy words Arya darted back frightened now but Joffrey followed hounding her toward the woods backing her up against a tree Sansa didn’t know what to do She watched helplessly almost blind from her tears

Then a grey blur flashed past her and suddenly Nymeria was there leaping jaws closing around Joffrey’s sword arm The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet and they rolled in the grass the wolf snarling and ripping at him the prince shrieking in pain Get it off he screamed Get it off

Arya’s voice cracked like a whip Nymeria

The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya’s side The prince lay in the grass whimpering cradling his mangled arm His shirt was soaked in blood Arya said She didn’t hurt you… much She picked up Lion’s Tooth where it had fallen and stood over him holding the sword with both hands

Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her No he said don’t hurt me I’ll tell my mother

You leave him alone Sansa screamed at her sister

Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air putting her whole body into the throw The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river It hit the water and vanished with a splash Joffrey moaned Arya ran off to her horse Nymeria loping at her heels

After they had gone Sansa went to Prince Joffrey His eyes were closed in pain his breath ragged Sansa knelt beside him Joffrey she sobbed Oh look what they did look what they did My poor prince Don’t be afraid I’ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you Tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair

His eyes snapped open and looked at her and there was nothing but loathing there nothing but the vilest contempt Then go he spit at her And don’t touch me





EDDARD

They’ve found her my lord

Ned rose quickly Our men or Lannister’s

It was Jory his steward Vayon Poole replied She’s not been harmed

Thank the gods Ned said His men had been searching for Arya for four days now but the queen’s men had been out hunting as well Where is she Tell Jory to bring her here at once

I am sorry my lord Poole told him The guards on the gate were Lannister men and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in She’s being taken directly before the king…

Damn that woman Ned said striding to the door Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber Her voice may be needed He descended the tower steps in a red rage He had led searches himself for the first three days and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand but now his fury was on him filling him with strength

Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard but Ned ignored them in his haste He would have run but he was still the King’s Hand and a Hand must keep his dignity He was aware of the eyes that followed him of the muttered voices wondering what he would do

The castle was a modest holding a half day’s ride south of the Trident The royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord Ser Raymun Darry while the hunt for Arya and the butcher’s boy was conducted on both sides of the river They were not welcome visitors Ser Raymun lived under the king’s peace but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar’s dragon banners at the Trident and his three older brothers had died there a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten With king’s men Darry men Lannister men and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them tensions burned hot and heavy

The king had appropriated Ser Raymun’s audience chamber and that was where Ned found them The room was crowded when he burst in Too crowded he thought left alone he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably

Robert was slumped in Darry’s high seat at the far end of the room his face closed and sullen Cersei Lannister and her son stood beside him The queen had her hand on Joffrey’s shoulder Thick silken bandages still covered the boy’s arm

Arya stood in the center of the room alone but for Jory Cassel every eye upon her Arya Ned called loudly He went to her his boots ringing on the stone floor When she saw him she cried out and began to sob

Ned went to one knee and took her in his arms She was shaking I’m sorry she sobbed I’m sorry I’m sorry

I know he said She felt so tiny in his arms nothing but a scrawny little girl It was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble Are you hurt

No Her face was dirty and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks Hungry some I ate some berries but there was nothing else

We’ll feed you soon enough Ned promised He rose to face the king What is the meaning of this His eyes swept the room searching for friendly faces But for his own men they were few enough Ser Raymun Darry guarded his look well Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything and old Ser Barristan was grave the rest were Lannister men and hostile Their only good fortune was that both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing leading searches north of the Trident Why was I not told that my daughter had been found Ned demanded his voice ringing Why was she not brought to me at once

He spoke to Robert but it was Cersei Lannister who answered How dare you speak to your king in that manner

At that the king stirred Quiet woman he snapped He straightened in his seat I am sorry Ned I never meant to frighten the girl It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly

And what business is that Ned put ice in his voice

The queen stepped forward You know full well Stark This girl of yours attacked my son Her and her butcher’s boy That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off

That’s not true Arya said loudly She just bit him a little He was hurting Mycah

Joff told us what happened the queen said You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him

That’s not how it was Arya said close to tears again Ned put a hand on her shoulder

Yes it is Prince Joffrey insisted They all attacked me and she threw Lion’s Tooth in the river Ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke

Liar Arya yelled

Shut up the prince yelled back

Enough the king roared rising from his seat his voice thick with irritation Silence fell He glowered at Arya through his thick beard Now child you will tell me what happened Tell it all and tell it true It is a great crime to lie to a king Then he looked over at his son When she is done you will have your turn Until then hold your tongue

As Arya began her story Ned heard the door open behind him He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into the middle of the Trident Renly Baratheon began to laugh The king bristled Ser Barristan escort my brother from the hall before he chokes

Lord Renly stifled his laughter My brother is too kind I can find the door myself He bowed to Joffrey Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river As the door swung shut behind him Ned heard him say Lion’s Tooth and guffaw once more

Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events When his son was done talking the king rose heavily from his seat looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this He says one thing she says another

They were not the only ones present Ned said Sansa come here Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished He knew the truth Tell us what happened

His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white a silver chain around her neck Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone She blinked at her sister then at the young prince I don’t know she said tearfully looking as though she wanted to bolt I don’t remember Everything happened so fast I didn’t see…
