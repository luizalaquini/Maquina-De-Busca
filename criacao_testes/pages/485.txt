But thinking of the village made her remember the march and the storeroom and the Tickler She thought of the little boy who’d been hit in the face with the mace of stupid old All-for-Joffrey of Lommy Greenhands I was a sheep and then I was a mouse I couldn’t do anything but hide Arya chewed her lip and tried to think when her courage had come back Jaqen made me brave again He made me a ghost instead of a mouse

She had been avoiding the Lorathi since Weese’s death Chiswyck had been easy anyone could push a man off the wallwalk but Weese had raised that ugly spotted dog from a pup and only some dark magic could have turned the animal against him Yoren found Jaqen in a black cell the same as Rorge and Biter she remembered Jaqen did something horrible and Yoren knew that’s why he kept him in chains If the Lorathi was a wizard Rorge and Biter could be demons he called up from some hell not men at all

Jaqen still owed her one death In Old Nan’s stories about men who were given magic wishes by a grumkin you had to be especially careful with the third wish because it was the last Chiswyck and Weese hadn’t been very important The last death has to count Arya told herself every night when she whispered her names But now she wondered if that was truly the reason she had hesitated So long as she could kill with a whisper Arya need not be afraid of anyone… but once she used up the last death she would only be a mouse again

With Pinkeye awake she dared not go back to her bed Not knowing where else to hide she made for the godswood She liked the sharp smell of the pines and sentinels the feel of grass and dirt between her toes and the sound the wind made in the leaves A slow little stream meandered through the wood and there was one spot where it had eaten the ground away beneath a deadfall

There beneath rotting wood and twisted splintered branches she found her hidden sword

Gendry was too stubborn to make one for her so she had made her own by breaking the bristles off a broom Her blade was much too light and had no proper grip but she liked the sharp jagged splintery end

Whenever she had a free hour she stole away to work at the drills Syrio had taught her moving barefoot over the fallen leaves slashing at branches and whacking down leaves Sometimes she even climbed the trees and danced among the upper branches her toes gripping the limbs as she moved back and forth teetering a little less every day as her balance returned to her Night was the best time no one ever bothered her at night

Arya climbed Up in the kingdom of the leaves she unsheathed and for a time forgot them all Ser Amory and the Mummers and her father’s men alike losing herself in the feel of rough wood beneath the soles of her feet and the swish of sword through air A broken branch became Joffrey She struck at it until it fell away The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the Hound were only leaves but she killed them all as well slashing them to wet green ribbons When her arm grew weary she sat with her legs over a high limb to catch her breath in the cool dark air listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted Through the leafy canopy she could see the bone-white branches of the heart tree It looks just like the one in Winterfell from here If only it had been… then when she climbed down she would have been home again and maybe find her father sitting under the weirwood where he always sat

Shoving her sword through her belt she slipped down branch to branch until she was back on the ground The light of the moon painted the limbs of the weirwood silvery white as she made her way toward it but the five-pointed red leaves turned black by night Arya stared at the face carved into its trunk It was a terrible face its mouth twisted its eyes flaring and full of hate Is that what a god looked like Could gods be hurt the same as people I should pray she thought suddenly

Arya went to her knees She wasn’t sure how she should begin She clasped her hands together Help me you old gods she prayed silently Help me get those men out of the dungeon so we can kill Ser Amory and bring me home to Winterfell Make me a water dancer and a wolf and not afraid again ever

Was that enough Maybe she should pray aloud if she wanted the old gods to hear Maybe she should pray longer Sometimes her father had prayed a long time she remembered But the old gods had never helped him Remembering that made her angry You should have saved him she scolded the tree He prayed to you all the time I don’t care if you help me or not I don’t think you could even if you wanted to

Gods are not mocked girl

The voice startled her She leapt to her feet and drew her wooden sword Jaqen H’ghar stood so still in the darkness that he seemed one of the trees A man comes to hear a name One and two and then comes three A man would have done

Arya lowered the splintery point toward the ground How did you know I was here

A man sees A man hears A man knows

She regarded him suspiciously Had the gods sent him How’d you make the dog kill Weese Did you call Rorge and Biter up from hell Is Jaqen H’ghar your true name

Some men have many names Weasel Arry Arya

She backed away from him until she was pressed against the heart tree Did Gendry tell

A man knows he said again My lady of Stark

Maybe the gods had sent him in answer to her prayers I need you to help me get those men out of the dungeons That Glover and those others all of them We have to kill the guards and open the cell somehow—

A girl forgets he said quietly Two she has had three were owed If a guard must die she needs only speak his name

But one guard won’t be enough we need to kill them all to open the cell Arya bit her lip hard to stop from crying I want you to save the northmen like I saved you

He looked down at her pitilessly Three lives were snatched from a god Three lives must be repaid The gods are not mocked His voice was silk and steel

I never mocked She thought for a moment The name… can I name anyone And you’ll kill him

Jaqen H’ghar inclined his head A man has said

Anyone she repeated A man a woman a little baby or Lord Tywin or the High Septon or your father

A man’s sire is long dead but did he live and did you know his name he would die at your command
