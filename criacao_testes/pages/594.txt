371 And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it that he rent
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the
house of the LORD

372 And he sent Eliakim who was over the household and Shebna the
scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz

373 And they said unto him Thus saith Hezekiah This day is a day of
trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth

374 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh whom
the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God
and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left

375 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah

376 And Isaiah said unto them Thus shall ye say unto your master
Thus saith the LORD Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard
wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me

377 Behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land

378 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish

379 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia He is come
forth to make war with thee And when he heard it he sent messengers
to Hezekiah saying 3710 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of
Judah saying Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee
saying Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria

3711 Behold thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
3712 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of
Eden which were in Telassar  3713 Where is the king of Hamath and
the king of Arphad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena and
Ivah  3714 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the
LORD and spread it before the LORD

3715 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD saying 3716 O LORD of
hosts God of Israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art
the God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast
made heaven and earth

3717 Incline thine ear O LORD and hear open thine eyes O LORD
and see and hear all the words of Sennacherib which hath sent to
reproach the living God

3718 Of a truth LORD the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
nations and their countries 3719 And have cast their gods into the
fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and
stone therefore they have destroyed them

3720 Now therefore O LORD our God save us from his hand that all
the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD even thou
only

3721 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah saying Thus
saith the LORD God of Israel Whereas thou hast prayed to me against
Sennacherib king of Assyria 3722 This is the word which the LORD
hath spoken concerning him The virgin the daughter of Zion hath
despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of Jerusalem
hath shaken her head at thee

3723 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast
thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against
the Holy One of Israel

3724 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord and hast said By
the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the
mountains to the sides of Lebanon and I will cut down the tall
cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and I will enter
into the height of his border and the forest of his Carmel

3725 I have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet
have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places

3726 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it and of ancient
times that I have formed it now have I brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps

3727 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were
dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted
before it be grown up

3728 But I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and
thy rage against me

3729 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
mine ears therefore will I put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in
