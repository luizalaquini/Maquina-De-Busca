the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God

614 For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under
the law but under grace

615 What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but
under grace God forbid

616 Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey
his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of
obedience unto righteousness  617 But God be thanked that ye were
the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you

618 Being then made free from sin ye became the servants of
righteousness

619 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness unto holiness

620 For when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from
righteousness

621 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed  for the end of those things is death

622 But now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye
have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life

623 For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal
life through Jesus Christ our Lord

71 Know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth  72
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from
the law of her husband

73 So then if while her husband liveth she be married to another
man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead
she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be
married to another man

74 Wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the
body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who
is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God

75 For when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by
the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death

76 But now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we
were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the
oldness of the letter

77 What shall we say then Is the law sin God forbid Nay I had not
known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law
had said Thou shalt not covet

78 But sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence For without the law sin was dead

79 For I was alive without the law once but when the commandment
came sin revived and I died

710 And the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be
unto death

711 For sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by
it slew me

712 Wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just
and good

713 Was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid But
sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is
good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful

714 For we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold
under sin

715 For that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not
but what I hate that do I

716 If then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that
it is good

717 Now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me

718 For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which
is good I find not

719 For the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would
not that I do

720 Now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin
that dwelleth in me
