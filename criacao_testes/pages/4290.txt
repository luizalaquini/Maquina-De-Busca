Adaptive quantization exploits information about the amplitude of the signal
and as a rough generalization yields a reduction of one bit per sample
in the data rate for telephone-quality speech over ordinary logarithmic
quantization for a given signal-to-noise ratio  Alternatively for the
same data rate an improvement of 6 dB in signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained
Some results for actual schemes are given by Rabiner and Schafer 1978

However there is other information in the time waveform of speech namely the
sample-to-sample correlation which can be exploited to give further reductions
rh Differential coding
Differential pulse code modulation DPCM in its simplest form uses the
present speech sample as a prediction of the next one
and stores the prediction error em that is the sample-to-sample difference
This is a simple case of predictive encoding
Referring back to the speech waveform displayed in Figure 35
it seems plausible that the data rate can be reduced by transmitting the difference
between successive samples instead of their absolute values  less bits are
required for the difference signal for a given overall accuracy because it
does not assume such extreme values as the absolute signal level
Actually the improvement is not all that great em about 4 - 5 dB in
signal-to-noise ratio or just under one bit per sample for a given
signal-to-noise ratio em for the difference signal can be nearly as large as
the absolute signal level
pp
If DPCM is used in conjunction with adaptive quantization giving one form of
adaptive differential pulse code modulation ADPCM both the overall amplitude
variation and the sample-to-sample correlation are exploited leading to a
combined gain of 10 - 11 dB in signal-to-noise ratio or just under two bits
reduction per sample for telephone-quality speech  Another form of adaptation
is to alter the predictor by multiplying the previous sample value by a
parameter which is adjusted for best performance
Then the transmitted signal at time n is
LB
EQ
en  =  xn - axn-1
EN
LE
where the parameter a is adapted and stored on a syllabic time-scale  This
leads to a slight improvement in signal-to-noise ratio which can be combined
with that achieved by adaptive quantization  Much more substantial benefits
can be realized by using a weighted sum of the past several up to 15 speech
samples and adapting all the weights  This is the basic idea of linear
prediction which is developed in Chapter 6
rh Delta modulation
The coding methods presented so far all increase the complexity of the
analogue-to-digital interface or if the sampled waveform is coded
digitally they increase the processing required before and after storage
One method which considerably
ul
simplifies
the interface is the limiting case
of DPCM with just 1-bit quantization  Only the sign of the difference between
the current and last values is transmitted  Figure 39 shows the conversion
hardware
FC Figure 39
The encoding part is essentially the same as a tracking DA
where the value in a counter is forced to track the analogue input by
incrementing or decrementing the counter according as the input exceeds or
falls short of the analogue equivalent of the counters contents  However
for this encoding scheme called delta modulation the increment-decrement
signal itself forms the discrete representation of the waveform instead of the counters
contents  The analogue waveform can be reconstituted from the bit stream with
another counter and DA converter  Alternatively an all-analogue implementation
can be used both for the encoder and decoder with a capacitor as integrator
whose charging current is controlled digitally  This is a much cheaper realization
pp
It is fairly obvious that the sampling frequency for delta modulation will need
to be considerably higher than for straightforward PCM  Figure 310 shows
an effect called slope overload which occurs when the sampling rate is too low
FC Figure 310
Either a higher sample rate or a larger step size will reduce the overload
however larger steps increase the noise level of the alternate 1s and -1s
that occur when no input is present em called granular noise  A compromise
is necessary between slope overload and granular noise for a given bit rate
Delta modulation results in lower data rates than logarithmic quantization
for a given signal-to-noise ratio if that ratio is low poor-quality speech
As the desired speech quality is increased its data rate grows faster than
that of logarithmic PCM  The crossover point occurs at much lower than
telephone quality speech and so although delta modulation is used for some
applications where the permissible data rate is severely constrained
it is not really suitable for speech output from computers
pp
It is profitable to adjust the step size leading to
ul
adaptive
delta modulation
A common strategy is to increase or decrease the step size by a multiplicative
constant which depends on whether the new transmitted bit will be equal to
or different from the last one  That is
LB nnnn
NI nn
stepsizen+1  =  stepsizen times 2  if xn+1xnxn-1
or xn+1xnxn-1

slope overload condition
NI nn
stepsizen+1 = stepsizen2  if xn+1xn-1xn
or xn+1xn-1xn
