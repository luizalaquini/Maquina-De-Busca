Fourier transforms can only deal with a finite stretch of a time signal
by assuming that the signal is periodic for if gt is evaluated from
its transform Gr according to the formula above and t is chosen outside
the interval 0b then a periodic extension of the function gt is obtained
automatically
Furthermore periodicity in one domain implies discreteness in the other
Hence if we transform a

stretch of a

time waveform
we get a frequency-domain representation which is also finite or equivalently
periodic and discrete
This is the discrete Fourier transform DFT
and takes a discrete periodic time-domain function into a discrete
periodic frequency-domain one as illustrated in Figure 44
FC Figure 44
It is defined by
LB

gn  = 
1 over N  sum from r=0 to N-1Gre sup  + j2 pi rnN

Gr  =  sum from n=0 to N-1 gne sup  - j2 pi rnN

or writing  W=e sup -j2 pi N

gn  = 
1 over N  sum from r=0 to N-1GrW sup -rn

Gr  =  sum from n=0 to N-1 gnW sup rn

The 1N in the first equation is the same normalizing
factor as the 1b in the Fourier series
for the finite time domain is 0N
in the discrete case and 0b in the Fourier series case
It does not matter
whether it is written into the forward or the reverse transform but it is usually
placed as shown above as a matter of convention

As illustrated by Figure 45 discrete Fourier transforms
take an input of N real values representing equally-spaced time samples
in the interval 0b and produce as output N complex values representing
equally-spaced frequency samples in the interval 0Nb
FC Figure 45
Note that the end-point of this frequency interval is the sampling frequency
It seems odd that the input is real and the output is the same number of
ul
complex
quantities  we seem to be getting some numbers for nothing
However this isnt so for it is easy to show that if the input sequence is
real the output frequency
spectrum has a symmetry about its mid-point half the sampling frequency
This can be expressed as
LB
DFT symmetry000000 
 mark G half N +r = G half N -r sup   if g is real-valued

where  denotes the conjugate of a complex quantity
that is a+jb sup  = a-jb

It was argued above that the frequency spectrum in the DFT is periodic with
the spectrum from 0 to the sampling frequency being repeated regularly up and
down the frequency axis  It can easily be seen from the DFT equation that
this is so  It can be written
LB
DFT periodicity lineup GN+r = Gr  always

sh 45  Estimating the frequency spectrum of speech using the DFT
pp
Speech signals are not exactly periodic  Although the waveform in a particular
pitch period will usually resemble those in the preceding and following pitch
periods it will certainly not be identical to them
As the articulation of the speech changes the formant positions will alter
As we saw in Chapter 2 the pitch itself is certainly not constant
Hence the fundamental assumption of the DFT that the waveform is periodic
is not really justified  However the signal is quasi-periodic for changes
from period to period will not usually be very great  One way of computing
the short-term frequency spectrum of speech is to use
ul
pitch-synchronous
Fourier transformation where single pitch periods are isolated from the
waveform and processed with the DFT  This gives a rather accurate estimate
of the spectrum  Unfortunately it is difficult to determine the beginning
and end of each pitch cycle as we shall see later in this chapter when
discussing pitch extraction techniques
