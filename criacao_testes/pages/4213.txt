Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room
He still indecisively lingered beside the body He was
deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that
circumstances were putting on with regard to Troys
wife and at his own powerlessness to counteract them
n spite of his careful manoeuvring all this day the very
worst event that could in any way have happened in
connection with the burial had happened now Oak
imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after+
noons work that might cast over Bathshebas life a shade
which the interposition of many lapsing years might but
indifferently lighten and which nothing at all might
altogether remove
Suddenly as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba
from at any rate immediate anguish he looked again
as he had looked before at the chalk writing upon the
P 351
coffinlid The scrawl was this simple one  Fanny
Robin and child Gabriel took his handkerchief and
carefully rubbed out the two latter words leaving visible
the inscription  Fanny Robin  only He then left the
room and went out quietly by the front door

FANNYS REVENGE
 DO you want me any longer maam   inquired Liddy
at a later hour the same evening standing by the door
with a chamber candlestick in her hand and addressing
Bathsheba who sat cheerless and alone in the large
parlour beside the first fire of the season
 No more to-night Liddy
lll sit up for master if you like maam I am not
at all afraid of Fanny if I may sit in my own room and 
have a candle She was such a childlike nesh young
thing that her spirit couldnt appear to anybody if it
tried Im quite sure
O no no You go to bed Ill sit up for him
myself till twelve oclock and if he has not arrived by
that time I shall give him up and go to bed too
It is half-past ten now
Oh is it
Why dont you sit upstairs maam  
 Why dont I   said Bathsheba desultorily It
isn t worth while -- theres a fire here Liddy She
suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper
Have you heard anything strange said of Fanny
The words had no sooner escaped her than an expres+
sion of unutterable regret crossed her face and she
burst into tears
No -- not a word  said Liddy looking at the
weeping woman with astonishment What is it makes
you cry so maam has anything hurt you   She came
to Bathshebas side with a face full of sympathy
 No Liddy-i dont want you any more I can
hardly say why I have taken to crying lately I never
used to cry Good-night
Liddy then left the parlour and closed the door
P 353
Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now  not lone+
lier actually than she had heen before her marriage
but her loneliness then was to that of the present time
as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a
cave And within the last day or two had come these
disquieting thoughts about her husbands past Her
wayward sentiment that evening concerning Fannys
temporary resting-place had been the result of a strange
complication of impulses in Bathshebas bosom Per+
haps it would be more accurately described as a
determined rebellion against her prejudices a revulsion
from a lower instinct of uncharitableness which would
have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman be+
cause in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the atten+
tions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means
ceased from loving though her love was sick to death
just now with the gravity of a further misgiving
In five or ten minutes there was another tap at the
door Liddy reappeared and coming in a little way
stood hesitating until at length she said Maryann has
just heard something very strange but I know it isnt
true And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in
a day or two
What is it 
 Oh nothing connected with you or us maam It
is about Fanny That same thing you have heard
I have heard nothing
I mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury
within this last hour -- that --  --  Liddy came close to
her mistress and whispered the remainder of the sentence
slowly into her ear inclining her head as she spoke in
the direction of the room where Fanny lay
Bathsheba trembled from head to foot
I dont believe it   she said excitedly And
theres only one name written on the coffin-cover
Nor I maam And a good many others dont
for we should surely have been told more about it if it
had been true -- dont you think so maam  
We might or we might not
Bathsheba turned and looked into the fire that
Liddy might not see her
