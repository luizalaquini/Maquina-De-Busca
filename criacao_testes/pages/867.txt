It was not enough though He had wrapped his cloak around her shoulders and sworn to protect her but that was as cruel a jape as the crown the Freys had placed atop the head of Robb Stark’s direwolf after they’d sewn it onto his headless corpse Sansa knew that as well The way she looked at him her stiffness when she climbed into their bed… when he was with her never for an instant could he forget who he was or what he was No more than she did She still went nightly to the godswood to pray and Tyrion wondered if she were praying for his death She had lost her home her place in the world and everyone she had ever loved or trusted Winter is coming warned the Stark words and truly it had come for them with a vengeance But it is high summer for House Lannister So why am I so bloody cold

He pulled on his boots fastened his cloak with a lion’s head brooch and slipped out into the torchlit hall There was this much to be said for his marriage it had allowed him to escape Maegor’s Holdfast Now that he had a wife and household his lord father had agreed that more suitable accommodations were required and Lord Gyles had found himself abruptly dispossessed of his spacious apartments atop the Kitchen Keep And splendid apartments they were too with a large bedchamber and adequate solar a bath and dressing room for his wife and small adjoining chambers for Pod and Sansa’s maids Even Bronn’s cell by the stair had a window of sorts Well more an arrow slit but it lets in light The castle’s main kitchen was just across the courtyard true but Tyrion found those sounds and smells infinitely preferable to sharing Maegor’s with his sister The less he had to see of Cersei the happier he was like to be

Tyrion could hear Brella’s snoring as he passed her cell Shae complained of that but it seemed a small enough price to pay Varys had suggested the woman to him in former days she had run Lord Renly’s household in the city which had given her a deal of practice at being blind deaf and mute

Lighting a taper he made his way back to the servants’ steps and descended The floors below his own were still and he heard no footsteps but his own Down he went to the ground floor and beyond to emerge in a gloomy cellar with a vaulted stone ceiling Much of the castle was connected underground and the Kitchen Keep was no exception Tyrion waddled along a long dark passageway until he found the door he wanted and pushed through

Within the dragon skulls were waiting and so was Shae I thought m’lord had forgotten me Her dress was draped over a black tooth near as tall as she was and she stood within the dragon’s jaws nude Balerion he thought Or was it Vhagar One dragon skull looked much like another

Just the sight of her made him hard Come out of there

I won’t She smiled her wickedest smile M’lord will pluck me from the dragon’s jaws I know But when he waddled closer she leaned forward and blew out the taper

Shae… He reached but she spun and slipped free

You have to catch me Her voice came from his left M’lord must have played monsters and maidens when he was little

Are you calling me a monster

No more than I’m a maiden She was behind him her steps soft against the floor You need to catch me all the same

He did finally but only because she let herself be caught By the time she slipped into his arms he was flushed and out of breath from stumbling into dragon skulls All that was forgotten in an instant when he felt her small breasts pressed against his face in the dark her stiff little nipples brushing lightly over his lips and the scar where his nose had been Tyrion pulled her down onto the floor My giant she breathed as he entered her My giant’s come to save me

After as they lay entwined amongst the dragon skulls he rested his head against her inhaling the smooth clean smell of her hair We should go back he said reluctantly It must be near dawn Sansa will be waking

You should give her dreamwine Shae said like Lady Tanda does with Lollys A cup before she goes to sleep and we could fuck in bed beside her without her waking She giggled Maybe we should some night Would m’lord like that Her hand found his shoulder and began to knead the muscles there Your neck is hard as stone What troubles you

Tyrion could not see his fingers in front of his face but he ticked his woes off on them all the same My wife My sister My nephew My father The Tyrells He had to move to his other hand Varys Pycelle Littlefinger The Red Viper of Dorne He had come to his last finger The face that stares back out of the water when I wash

Shae kissed his maimed scarred nose A brave face A kind and good face I wish I could see it now

All the sweet innocence of the world was in her voice Innocence Fool she’s a whore all she knows of men is the bit between their legs Fool fool Better you than me Tyrion sat We have a long day before us both of us You shouldn’t have blown out that taper How are we to find our clothing

She laughed Maybe we’ll have to go naked

And if we’re seen my lord father will hang you Hiring Shae as one of Sansa’s maids had given him an excuse to be seen talking with her but Tyrion did not delude himself that they were safe Varys had warned him I gave Shae a false history but it was meant for Lollys and Lady Tanda Your sister is of a more suspicious mind If she should ask me what I know…

You will tell her some clever lie

No I will tell her that the girl is a common camp follower that you acquired before the battle on the Green Fork and brought to King’s Landing against your lord father’s express command I will not lie to the queen

You have lied to her before Shall I tell her that

The eunuch sighed That cuts more deeply than a knife my lord I have served you loyally but I must also serve your sister when I can How long do you think she would let me live if I were of no further use to her whatsoever I have no fierce sellsword to protect me no valiant brother to avenge me only some little birds who whisper in my ear With those whisperings I must buy my life anew each day

Pardon me if I do not weep for you

I shall but you must pardon me if I do not weep for Shae I confess I do not understand what there is in her to make a clever man like you act such a fool

You might if you were not a eunuch

Is that the way of it A man may have wits or a bit of meat between his legs but not both Varys tittered Perhaps I should be grateful I was cut then
