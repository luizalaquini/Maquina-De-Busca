You bloody crows Tormund’s tone was gruff yet strangely gentle That Longspear stole me daughter Munda me little autumn apple Took her right out o’ my tent with all four o’ her brothers about Toregg slept through it the great lout and Torwynd    well Torwynd the Tame that says all that needs saying don’t it The young ones gave the lad a fight though

And Munda asked Jon

She’s my own blood said Tormund proudly She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off and I hear he’s got so many scratches on his back he can’t wear a cloak She likes him well enough though And why not He don’t fight with no spear you know Never has So where do you think he got that name Har

Jon had to laugh Even now even here Ygritte had been fond of Longspear Ryk He hoped he found some joy with Tormund’s Munda Someone needed to find some joy somewhere

You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte would have told him I know that I am going to die he thought I know that much at least All men die he could almost hear her say and women too and every beast that flies or swims or runs It’s not the when o’ dying that matters it’s the how of it Jon Snow Easy for you to say he thought back You died brave in battle storming the castle of a foe I’m going to die a turncloak and a killer Nor would his death be quick unless it came on the end of Mance’s sword

Soon they were among the tents It was the usual wildling camp a sprawling jumble of cookfires and piss pits children and goats wandering freely sheep bleating among the trees horse hides pegged up to dry There was no plan to it no order no defenses But there were men and women and animals everywhere

Many ignored him but for every one who went about his business there were ten who stopped to stare children squatting by the fires old women in dog carts cave dwellers with painted faces raiders with claws and snakes and severed heads painted on their shields all turned to have a look Jon saw spearwives too their long hair streaming in the piney wind that sighed between the trees

There were no true hills here but Mance Rayder’s white fur tent had been raised on a spot of high stony ground right on the edge of the trees The King-beyond-the-Wall was waiting outside his ragged red-and-black cloak blowing in the wind Harma Dogshead was with him Jon saw back from her raids and feints along the Wall and Varamyr Sixskins as well attended by his shadowcat and two lean grey wolves

When they saw who the Watch had sent Harma turned her head and spat and one of Varamyr’s wolves bared its teeth and growled You must be very brave or very stupid Jon Snow Mance Rayder said to come back to us wearing a black cloak

What else would a man of the Night’s Watch wear

Kill him urged Harma Send his body back up in that cage o’ theirs and tell them to send us someone else I’ll keep his head for my standard A turncloak’s worse than a dog

I warned you he was false Varamyr’s tone was mild but his shadow-cat was staring at Jon hungrily through slitted grey eyes I never did like the smell o’ him

Pull in your claws beastling Tormund Giantsbane swung down off his horse The lad’s here to hear You lay a paw on him might be I’ll take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting

Tormund Crowlover Harma sneered You are a great sack o’ wind old man

The skinchanger was grey-faced round-shouldered and bald a mouse of a man with a wolfling’s eyes Once a horse is broken to the saddle any man can mount him he said in a soft voice Once a beast’s been joined to a man any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him Orell was withering inside his feathers so I took the eagle for my own But the joining works both ways warg Orell lives inside me now whispering how much he hates you And I can soar above the Wall and see with eagle eyes

So we know said Mance We know how few you were when you stopped the turtle We know how many came from Eastwatch We know how your supplies have dwindled Pitch oil arrows spears Even your stair is gone and that cage can only lift so many We know And now you know we know He opened the flap of the tent Come inside The rest of you wait here

What even me said Tormund

Particularly you Always

It was warm within A small fire burned beneath the smoke holes and a brazier smouldered near the pile of furs where Dalla lay pale and sweating Her sister was holding her hand Val Jon remembered I was sorry when Jarl fell he told her

Val looked at him with pale grey eyes He always climbed too fast She was as fair as he’d remembered slender full-breasted graceful even at rest with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid of honey-colored hair that fell to her waist

Dalla’s time is near Mance explained She and Val will stay They know what I mean to say

Jon kept his face as still as ice Foul enough to slay a man in his own tent under truce Must I murder him in front of his wife as their child is being born He closed the fingers of his sword hand Mance was not wearing armor but his own sword was sheathed on his left hip And there were other weapons in the tent daggers and dirks a bow and a quiver of arrows a bronze-headed spear lying beside that big black   

   horn

Jon sucked in his breath

A warhorn a bloody great warhorn

Yes Mance said The Horn of Winter that Joramun once blew to wake giants from the earth

The horn was huge eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put his arm inside up to the elbow If this came from an aurochs it was the biggest that ever lived At first he thought the bands around it were bronze but when he moved closer he realized they were gold Old gold more brown than yellow and graven with runes

Ygritte said you never found the horn

Did you think only crows could lie I liked you well enough for a bastard    but I never trusted you A man needs to earn my trust

Jon faced him If you’ve had the Horn of Joramun all along why haven’t you used it Why bother building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in our beds If this horn is all the songs say why not just sound it and be done

It was Dalla who answered him Dalla great with child lying on her pile of furs beside the brazier We free folk know things you kneelers have forgotten Sometimes the short road is not the safest Jon Snow The Horned Lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt There is no safe way to grasp it

Mance ran a hand along the curve of the great horn No man goes hunting with only one arrow in his quiver he said I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares and open the gate for us I drew your garrison away with feints and raids and secondary attacks Bowen Marsh swallowed that lure as I knew he would but your band of cripples and orphans proved to be more stubborn than anticipated Don’t think you’ve stopped us though The truth is you are too few and we are too many I could continue the attack here and still send ten thousand men to cross the Bay of Seals on rafts and take Eastwatch from the rear I could storm the Shadow Tower too I know the approaches as well as any man alive I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles you’ve abandoned all of them at once

Why don’t you then Jon could have drawn Longclaw then but he wanted to hear what the wildling had to say

Blood said Mance Rayder I’d win in the end yes but you’d bleed me and my people have bled enough

Your losses haven’t been that heavy

Not at your hands Mance studied Jon’s face You saw the Fist of the First Men You know what happened there You know what we are facing

The Others   

They grow stronger as the days grow shorter and the nights colder First they kill you then they send your dead against you The giants have not been able to stand against them nor the Thenns the ice river clans the Hornfoots

Nor you

Nor me There was anger in that admission and bitterness too deep for words Raymun Redbeard Bael the Bard Gendel and Gorne the Horned Lord they all came south to conquer but I’ve come with my tail between my legs to hide behind your Wall He touched the horn again If I sound the Horn of Winter the Wall will fall Or so the songs would have me believe There are those among my people who want nothing more   

But once the Wall is fallen Dalla said what will stop the Others

Mance gave her a fond smile It’s a wise woman I’ve found A true queen He turned back to Jon Go back and tell them to open their gate and let us pass If they do I will give them the horn and the Wall will stand until the end of days

Open the gate and let them pass Easy to say but what must follow Giants camping in the ruins of Winterfell Cannibals in the wolfswood chariots sweeping across the barrowlands free folk stealing the daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwives off the Stony Shore Are you a true king Jon asked suddenly

I’ve never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne if that’s what you’re asking Mance replied My birth is as low as a man’s can get no septon’s ever smeared my head with oils I don’t own any castles and my queen wears furs and amber not silk and sapphires I am my own champion my own fool and my own harpist You don’t become King-beyond-the-Wall because your father was The free folk won’t follow a name and they don’t care which brother was born first They follow fighters When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings Tormund was one the Magnar another The other three I slew when they made it plain they’d sooner fight than follow

You can kill your enemies Jon said bluntly but can you rule your friends If we let your people pass are you strong enough to make them keep the king’s peace and obey the laws

Whose laws The laws of Winterfell and King’s Landing Mance laughed When we want laws we’ll make our own You can keep your king’s justice too and your king’s taxes I’m offering you the horn not our freedom We will not kneel to you

What if we refuse the offer Jon had no doubt that they would The Old Bear might at least have listened though he would have balked at the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on the Seven Kingdoms But Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt would dismiss the notion out of hand

If you refuse Mance Rayder said Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days hence at dawn

He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell them of the horn but if he left Mance still alive Lord Janos and Ser Alliser would seize on that as proof that he was a turncloak A thousand thoughts flickered through Jon’s head If I can destroy the horn smash it here and now    but before he could begin to think that through he heard the low moan of some other horn made faint by the tent’s hide walls Mance heard it too Frowning he went to the door Jon followed

The warhorn was louder outside Its call had stirred the wildling camp Three Hornfoot men jogged past carrying long spears Horses were whinnying and snorting giants roaring in the Old Tongue and even the mammoths were restless
