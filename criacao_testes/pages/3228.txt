thronged him

843 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had
spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any
844 Came behind him and touched the border of his garment and
immediately her issue of blood stanched

845 And Jesus said Who touched me When all denied Peter and they
that were with him said Master the multitude throng thee and press
thee and sayest thou Who touched me  846 And Jesus said Somebody
hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me

847 And when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling
and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the
people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed
immediately

848 And he said unto her Daughter be of good comfort thy faith
hath made thee whole go in peace

849 While he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogues house saying to him Thy daughter is dead trouble not
the Master

850 But when Jesus heard it he answered him saying Fear not
believe only and she shall be made whole

851 And when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in
save Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the
maiden

852 And all wept and bewailed her but he said Weep not she is not
dead but sleepeth

853 And they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead

854 And he put them all out and took her by the hand and called
saying Maid arise

855 And her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he
commanded to give her meat

856 And her parents were astonished but he charged them that they
should tell no man what was done

91 Then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power
and authority over all devils and to cure diseases

92 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the
sick

93 And he said unto them Take nothing for your journey neither
staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two
coats apiece

94 And whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence
depart

95 And whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them

96 And they departed and went through the towns preaching the
gospel and healing every where

97 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he
was perplexed because that it was said of some that John was risen
from the dead 98 And of some that Elias had appeared and of
others that one of the old prophets was risen again

99 And Herod said John have I beheaded but who is this of whom I
hear such things And he desired to see him

910 And the apostles when they were returned told him all that they
had done And he took them and went aside privately into a desert
place belonging to the city called Bethsaida

911 And the people when they knew it followed him and he received
them and spake unto them of the kingdom of God and healed them that
had need of healing

912 And when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and
said unto him Send the multitude away that they may go into the
towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are
here in a desert place

913 But he said unto them Give ye them to eat And they said We
have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and
buy meat for all this people

914 For they were about five thousand men And he said to his
disciples Make them sit down by fifties in a company

915 And they did so and made them all sit down

916 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up
to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to
set before the multitude

917 And they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
