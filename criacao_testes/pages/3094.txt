2820 Again the word of the LORD came unto me saying 2821 Son of
man set thy face against Zidon and prophesy against it 2822 And
say Thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee O Zidon and
I will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that I
am the LORD when I shall have executed judgments in her and shall be
sanctified in her

2823 For I will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets
and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon
her on every side and they shall know that I am the LORD

2824 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
Israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that
despised them and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD

2825 Thus saith the Lord GOD When I shall have gathered the house of
Israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be
sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell
in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob

2826 And they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and
plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when I have
executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them
and they shall know that I am the LORD their God

291 In the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the
month the word of the LORD came unto me saying 292 Son of man set
thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and
against all Egypt 293 Speak and say Thus saith the Lord GOD
Behold I am against thee Pharaoh king of Egypt the great dragon
that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said My river is
mine own and I have made it for myself

294 But I will put hooks in thy jaws and I will cause the fish of
thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and I will bring thee up out of
the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick
unto thy scales

295 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all
the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou
shalt not be brought together nor gathered I have given thee for
meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven

296 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD
because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel

297 When they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and
rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest
and madest all their loins to be at a stand

298 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will bring a sword
upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee

299 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall
know that I am the LORD because he hath said The river is mine and
I have made it

2910 Behold therefore I am against thee and against thy rivers and
I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate from the
tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia

2911 No foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall
pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years

2912 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are
laid waste shall be desolate forty years and I will scatter the
Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the
countries

2913 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD At the end of forty years will I
gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered
2914 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt and will cause
them to return into the land of Pathros into the land of their
habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom

2915 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt
itself any more above the nations for I will diminish them that they
shall no more rule over the nations

2916 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel
which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look
after them but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD

2917 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the
first month in the first day of the month the word of the LORD came
unto me saying 2918 Son of man Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus every head was
made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his
army for Tyrus for the service that he had served against it 2919
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will give the land of
Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and he shall take her
multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the
wages for his army

2920 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
served against it because they wrought for me saith the Lord GOD

2921 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud
