crowning boughs in a weakened moan The dry leaves
in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes
a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few and
sending them spinning across the grass A group or
two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
had remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs
which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks
with smart taps
Betwenne this half-wooded half naked hill and the
vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly com+
manded was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade
 -- the sounds from which suggested that what it con+
cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here
P 58
The thin grasses more or less coating the hill were
touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers and
almost of differing natures -- one rubbing the blades
heavily another raking them piercingly another brushing
them like a soft broom The instinctive act of human+
kind was to stand and listen and learn how the trees
to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
choir how hedges and other shapes to leeward them
caught the note lowering it to the tenderest sob and
how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south to
be heard no more
The sky was clear -- remarkably clear -- and the
twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of
one body timed by a common pulse The North Star
was directly in the winds eye and since evening the
Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east till he
was now at a right angle with the meridian A
difference of colour in the stars -- oftener read of than
seen in England-was really perceptible here The
sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely
glitter the star called Capella was yellow Aldebaran and
Betelgueux shone with a fiery red
To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear
midnight such as this the roll of the world eastward is
almost a palpable movement The sensation may be
caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
objects which is perceptible in a few minutes of still+
ness or by the better outlook upon space that a hill
affords or by the wind or by the solitude  but whatever
be its origin the impression of riding along is vivid and
abiding The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
use and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it
is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the
night and having first expanded with a sense of differ+
ence from the mass of civilised mankind who are
dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at
this time long and quietly watch your stately progress
through the stars After such a nocturnal reconnoitre
it is hard to get back to earth and to believe that the
consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from
a tiny human frame
Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to
P 59
be heard
in this place up against the sky They had a
clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind
and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
nature They were the notes of Farmer Oaks flute
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
air  it seemed muffled in some way and was altogether
too curtailed in power to spread high or wide It came
from the direction of a small dark object under the
plantation hedge -- a shepherds hut -- now presenting
an outline to which an uninitiated person might have
been puzzled to attach either meaning or use
The image as a whole was that of a small Noahs
Ark on a small Ararat allowing the traditionary outlines
and general form of the Ark which are followed by toy+
makers -- and by these means are established in mens
imaginations among their firmest because earliest im+
pressions -- to pass as an approximate pattern The
hut stood on little wheels which raised its floor about a
foot from the ground Such shepherds huts are dragged
into the fields when the lambing season comes on to
shelter the shepherd in his- enforced nightly attendance
It was only latterly that people had begun to call
Gabriel Farmer Oak During the twelvemonth pre+
ceding this time he had been enabled by sustained
efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the
small shepp farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion
and stock it with two hundred sheep Previously he
had been a bailiff for a short time and earlier still a
shepherd only having from his childhood assisted his
father in tending the floeks of large proprietors till old
Gabriel sank to rest
This venture unaided and alone into the paths of
farming as master and not as man with an advance of
sheep not yet paid for was a critical juncture with
Gabriel Oak and he recognised his position clearly
The first movement in his new progress was the lambing
of his ewes and sheep having been his speciality from
his youth he wisely refrained from deputing -- the task
of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice
The wind continued to beat-about the corners of the
hut but the flute-playing ceased A rectangular space
