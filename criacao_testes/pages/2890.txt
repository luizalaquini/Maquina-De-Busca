6816 Why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which God desireth
to dwell in yea the LORD will dwell in it for ever

6817 The chariots of God are twenty thousand even thousands of
angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place

6818 Thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive
thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that
the LORD God might dwell among them

6819 Blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even
the God of our salvation Selah

6820 He that is our God is the God of salvation and unto GOD the
Lord belong the issues from death

6821 But God shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses

6822 The Lord said I will bring again from Bashan I will bring my
people again from the depths of the sea

6823 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and
the tongue of thy dogs in the same

6824 They have seen thy goings O God even the goings of my God my
King in the sanctuary

6825 The singers went before the players on instruments followed
after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels

6826 Bless ye God in the congregations even the Lord from the
fountain of Israel

6827 There is little Benjamin with their ruler the princes of Judah
and their council the princes of Zebulun and the princes of
Naphtali

6828 Thy God hath commanded thy strength strengthen O God that
which thou hast wrought for us

6829 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
unto thee

6830 Rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with
the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of
silver scatter thou the people that delight in war

6831 Princes shall come out of Egypt Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
her hands unto God

6832 Sing unto God ye kingdoms of the earth O sing praises unto the
Lord Selah

6833 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens which were of
old lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice

6834 Ascribe ye strength unto God his excellency is over Israel and
his strength is in the clouds

6835 O God thou art terrible out of thy holy places the God of
Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people Blessed
be God



691 Save me O God for the waters are come in unto my soul

692 I sink in deep mire where there is no standing I am come into
deep waters where the floods overflow me

693 I am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God

694 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are
mighty then I restored that which I took not away

695 O God thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from
thee

696 Let not them that wait on thee O Lord GOD of hosts be ashamed
for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake O
God of Israel

697 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach shame hath covered my
face

698 I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my
mothers children

699 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me

6910 When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my
reproach

6911 I made sackcloth also my garment and I became a proverb to
them
