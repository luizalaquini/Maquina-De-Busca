I was fourteen times eleven months at Millpond St
Judes  nodding north-west-by-north Old Twills
wouldnt hire me for more than eleven months at a
time to keep me from being chargeable to the parish
if so be I was disabled Then I was three year at
Mellstock and Ive been here one-and-thirty year come
Candlemas How much is that
  Hundred and seventeen chuckled another old
gentleman given to mental arithmetic and little con+
versation who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner
  Well then thats my age said the maltster em+
phatically
  O no father said Jacob Your turnip-hoeing
were in the summer and your malting in the winter of
the same years and ye dont ought to count-both halves
father
P 114
  Chok it all I lived through the summers didnt
I Thats my question I suppose yell say next I be
no age at all to speak of
  Sure we shant said Gabriel soothingly
  Ye be a very old aged person malter attested Jan
must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able
to live so long mustnt he neighbours
  True true ye must malter wonderful said the
meeting unanimously
  The maltster being know pacified was even generous
enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the
virtue of having lived a great many years by mentioning
that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
older than he
  While the cup was being examined the end of
Gabriel Oaks flute became visible over his smock-frock
I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at Caster+
bridge
  You did said Gabriel blushingh faintly Ive been
in great trouble neighbours and was driven to it
take it careless-like shepherd and your time will come
tired
  Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since
Christmas said Jan Coggan Come raise a tune
Master Oak
  That I will said Gabriel pulling out his flute and
putting it together A poor tool neighbours but
such as I can do ye shall have and welcome
  Oak then struck up Jockey to the Fair and played
that sparkling melody three times through accenting the
notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively
manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping
with his foot to beat time
  He can blow the flute very well -- that a can said
a young married man who having no individuality worth
mentioning was known as Susan Talls husband He
continued Id as lief as not be able to blow into a
flute as well-as that
P 115
  Hes a clever man and tis a true comfort for us to
have such a shepherd murmured Joseph Poorgrass in
a soft cadence We ought to feel full o thanksgiving
that hes not a player of bady songs instead of these
merry tunes for twould have been just as easy for God
to have made the shepherd a loose low man -- a man of
iniquity so to speak it -- as what he is Yes for our wives
and daughters sakes we should feel real thanks giving
  True true -- real thanksgiving dashed in Mark
Clark conclusively not feeling it to be of any conse+
quence to his opinion that he had only heard about a
word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said
  Yes added Joseph beginning to feel like a man in
the Bible for evil do thrive so in these times that ye
may be as much deceived in the clanest shaved and
whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the
turnpike if I may term it so
  Ay I can mind yer face now shepherd said
Henery Fray criticising Gabriel with misty eyes as he
entered upon his second tune Yes -- now I see ee
blowing into the flute I know ee to be the same man
I see play at Casterbridge for yer mouth were scrimped
up and yer eyes a-staring out like a strangled mans --
just as they be now
  Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man
look such a scarecrow observed Mr Mark Clark with
additional criticism of Gabriels countenance the latter
person jerking out with the ghastly grimace required by
the instrument the chorus of Dame Durden
  I hope you dont mind that young mans bad
manners in naming your features whispered Joseph to
Gabriel
  Not at all said Mr Oak
  For by nature ye be a very handsome man
shepherd continued Joseph Poorgrass with winning
sauvity
  Ay that ye be shepard said the company
  Thank you very much said Oak in the modest
tone good
P 116
manners demanded thinking however that
he would never let Bathsheba see him playing the
flute in this severe showing s discretion equal to that
related to its sagacious inventress the divine Minerva
