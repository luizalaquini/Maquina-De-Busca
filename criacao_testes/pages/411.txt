Your father listened I have no doubt But in the end he decided for himself Bran will you let me tell you about a dream Jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers

The Walders aren’t my brothers

She paid that no heed You were sitting at supper but instead of a servant Maester Luwin brought you your food He served you the king’s cut off the roast the meat rare and bloody but with a savory smell that made everyone’s mouth water The meat he served the Freys was old and grey and dead Yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours

I don’t understand

You will my brother says When you do we’ll talk again

Bran was almost afraid to sit to supper that night but when he did it was pigeon pie they set before him Everyone else was served the same and he couldn’t see that anything was wrong with the food they served the Walders Maester Luwin has the truth of it he told himself Nothing bad was coming to Winterfell no matter what Jojen said Bran was relieved… but disappointed too So long as there was magic anything could happen Ghosts could walk trees could talk and broken boys could grow up to be knights But there isn’t he said aloud in the darkness of his bed There’s no magic and the stories are just stories

And he would never walk nor fly nor be a knight





TYRION

The rushes were scratchy under the soles of his bare feet My cousin chooses a queer hour to come visiting Tyrion told a sleep-befuddled Podrick Payne who’d doubtless expected to be well roasted for waking him See him to my solar and tell him I’ll be down shortly

It was well past midnight he judged from the black outside the window Does Lancel think to find me drowsy and slow of wit at this hour he wondered No Lancel scarce thinks at all this is Cersei’s doing His sister would be disappointed Even abed he worked well into the morning—reading by the flickering light of a candle scrutinizing the reports of Varys’s whisperers and poring over Littlefinger’s books of accounts until the columns blurred and his eyes ached

He splashed some tepid water on his face from the basin beside his bed and took his time squatting in the garderobe the night air cold on his bare skin Ser Lancel was sixteen and not known for his patience Let him wait and grow more anxious in the waiting When his bowels were empty Tyrion slipped on a bedrobe and roughed his thin flaxen hair with his fingers all the more to look as if he had wakened from sleep

Lancel was pacing before the ashes of the hearth garbed in slashed red velvet with black silk undersleeves a jeweled dagger and a gilded scabbard hanging from his swordbelt Cousin Tyrion greeted him Your visits are too few To what do I owe this undeserved pleasure

Her Grace the Queen Regent has sent me to command you to release Grand Maester Pycelle Ser Lancel showed Tyrion a crimson ribbon bearing Cersei’s lion seal impressed in golden wax Here is her warrant

So it is Tyrion waved it away I hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength so soon after her illness it would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse

Her Grace is quite recovered Ser Lancel said curtly

Music to my ears Though not a tune I’m fond of I should have given her a larger dose Tyrion had hoped for a few more days without Cersei’s interference but he was not too terribly surprised by her return to health She was Jaime’s twin after all He made himself smile pleasantly Pod build us a fire the air is too chilly for my taste Will you take a cup with me Lancel I find that mulled wine helps me sleep

I need no help sleeping Ser Lancel said I am come at Her Grace’s behest not to drink with you Imp

Knighthood had made the boy bolder Tyrion reflected—that and the sorry part he had played in murdering King Robert Wine does have its dangers He smiled as he poured As to Grand Maester Pycelle… if my sweet sister is so concerned for him I would have thought she’d come herself Instead she sends you What am I to make of that

Make of it what you will so long as you release your prisoner The Grand Maester is a staunch friend to the Queen Regent and under her personal protection A hint of a sneer played about the lad’s lips he was enjoying this He takes his lessons from Cersei Her Grace will never consent to this outrage She reminds you that she is Joffrey’s regent

As I am Joffrey’s Hand

The Hand serves the young knight informed him airily The regent rules until the king is of age

Perhaps you ought write that down so I’ll remember it better The fire was crackling merrily You may leave us Pod Tyrion told his squire Only when the boy was gone did he turn back to Lancel There is more

Yes Her Grace bids me inform you that Ser Jacelyn Bywater defied a command issued in the king’s own name

Which means that Cersei has already ordered Bywater to release Pycelle and been rebuffed I see

She insists that the man be removed from his office and placed under arrest for treason I warn you—
