Dany was near tears as they carried her back The taste in her mouth was one she had known before fear For years she had lived in terror of Viserys afraid of waking the dragon This was even worse It was not just for herself that she feared now but for her baby He must have sensed her fright for he moved restlessly inside her Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently wishing she could reach him touch him soothe him You are the blood of the dragon little one she whispered as her litter swayed along curtains drawn tight You are the blood of the dragon and the dragon does not fear

Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak Dany ordered them to leave her—all but Ser Jorah Tell me she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions Was it the Usurper

Yes The knight drew out a folded parchment A letter to Viserys from Magister Illyrio Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death or your brother’s

My brother Her sob was half a laugh He does not know yet does he The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship This time her laugh was half a sob She hugged herself protectively And me you said Only me

You and the child Ser Jorah said grim

No He cannot have my son She would not weep she decided She would not shiver with fear The Usurper has woken the dragon now she told herself… and her eyes went to the dragon’s eggs resting in their nest of dark velvet The shifting lamplight limned their stony scales and shimmering motes of jade and scarlet and gold swam in the air around them like courtiers around a king

Was it madness that seized her then born of fear Or some strange wisdom buried in her blood Dany could not have said She heard her own voice saying Ser Jorah light the brazier

Khaleesi The knight looked at her strangely It is so hot Are you certain

She had never been so certain Yes I… I have a chill Light the brazier

He bowed As you command

When the coals were afire Dany sent Ser Jorah from her She had to be alone to do what she must do This is madness she told herself as she lifted the black-and-scarlet egg from the velvet It will only crack and burn and it’s so beautiful Ser Jorah will call me a fool if I ruin it and yet and yet…

Cradling the egg with both hands she carried it to the fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals The black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat Flames licked against the stone with small red tongues Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire As she stepped back from the brazier the breath trembled in her throat

She watched until the coals had turned to ashes Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon’s eggs And that was all

Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon Ser Jorah had said Dany gazed at her eggs sadly What had she expected A thousand thousand years ago they had been alive but now they were only pretty rocks They could not make a dragon A dragon was air and fire Living flesh not dead stone

The brazier was cold again by the time Khal Drogo returned Cohollo was leading a packhorse behind him with the carcass of a great white lion slung across its back Above the stars were coming out The khal laughed as he swung down off his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the hrakkar had raked him through his leggings I shall make you a cloak of its skin moon of my life he swore

When Dany told him what had happened at the market all laughter stopped and Khal Drogo grew very quiet

This poisoner was the first Ser Jorah Mormont warned him but he will not be the last Men will risk much for a lordship

Drogo was silent for a time Finally he said This seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life Better he should run after her So he will Jhogo Jorah the Andal to each of you I say choose any horse you wish from my herds and it is yours Any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the moon of my life I make this gift to you for what you did

And to Rhaego son of Drogo the stallion who will mount the world to him I also pledge a gift To him I will give this iron chair his mother’s father sat in I will give him Seven Kingdoms I Drogo khal will do this thing His voice rose and he lifted his fist to the sky I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses I will rape their women take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains This I vow I Drogo son of Bharbo This I swear before the Mother of Mountains as the stars look down in witness

His khalasar left Vaes Dothrak two days later striking south and west across the plains Khal Drogo led them on his great red stallion with Daenerys beside him on her silver The wineseller hurried behind them naked on foot chained at throat and wrists His chains were fastened to the halter of Dany’s silver As she rode he ran after her barefoot and stumbling No harm would come to him… so long as he kept up





CATELYN

It was too far to make out the banners clearly but even through the drifting fog she could see that they were white with a dark smudge in their center that could only be the direwolf of Stark grey upon its icy field When she saw it with her own eyes Catelyn reined up her horse and bowed her head in thanks The gods were good She was not too late

They await our coming my lady Ser Wylis Manderly said as my lord father swore they would

Let us not keep them waiting any longer ser Ser Brynden Tully put the spurs to his horse and trotted briskly toward the banners Catelyn rode beside him

Ser Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel followed leading their levies near fifteen hundred men some twenty-odd knights and as many squires two hundred mounted lances swordsmen and freeriders and the rest foot armed with spears pikes and tridents Lord Wyman had remained behind to see to the defenses of White Harbor A man of near sixty years he had grown too stout to sit a horse If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime I should have eaten a few less eels he’d told Catelyn when he met her ship slapping his massive belly with both hands His fingers were fat as sausages My boys will see you safe to your son though have no fear
