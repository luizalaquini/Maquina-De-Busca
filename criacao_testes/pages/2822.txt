swelled not

922 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide
them into corners so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land
of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan

923 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and
broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to
their fathers that they should go in to possess it

924 So the children went in and possessed the land and thou
subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites and
gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the
land that they might do with them as they would

925 And they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses
full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit
trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness

926 Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee
and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which
testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great
provocations

927 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies
who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold
mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of
their enemies

928 But after they had rest they did evil again before thee
therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they
had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou
deliver them according to thy mercies 929 And testifiedst against
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt
proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against
thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and
withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear

930 Yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against
them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear
therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands

931 Nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly
consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful
God

932 Now therefore our God the great the mighty and the terrible
God who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem
little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our
princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers
and on all thy people since the time of the kings of Assyria unto
this day

933 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou
hast done right but we have done wickedly 934 Neither have our
kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor
hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou
didst testify against them

935 For they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great
goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which
thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works

936 Behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou
gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof
behold we are servants in it 937 And it yieldeth much increase unto
the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they
have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure
and we are in great distress

938 And because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it
and our princes Levites and priests seal unto it

101 Now those that sealed were Nehemiah the Tirshatha the son of
Hachaliah and Zidkijah 102 Seraiah Azariah Jeremiah 103 Pashur

themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God their
wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge
