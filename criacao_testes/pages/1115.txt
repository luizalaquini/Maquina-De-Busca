Who will chimed the talkative raven Who will

Truly the gods had heard Jon’s prayer that night the fire had caught in the dead man’s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames It was the face that haunted him most surrounded by a nimbus of fire hair blazing like straw the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath

Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone Yet in his nightmare he faced it again… and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard’s features It was his father’s skin that burst and blackened his father’s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean but it frightened him more than he could say

A sword’s small payment for a life Mormont concluded Take it I’ll hear no more of it is that understood

Yes my lord The soft leather gave beneath Jon’s fingers as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already He knew he should be honored and he was and yet…

He is not my father The thought leapt unbidden to Jon’s mind Lord Eddard Stark is my father I will not forget him no matter how many swords they give me Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man’s sword he dreamt of…

I want no courtesies either Mormont said so thank me no thanks Honor the steel with deeds not words

Jon nodded Does it have a name my lord

It did once Longclaw it was called

Claw the raven cried Claw

Longclaw is an apt name Jon tried a practice cut He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air as if it had a will of its own Wolves have claws as much as bears

The Old Bear seemed pleased by that I suppose they do You’ll want to wear that over the shoulder I imagine It’s too long for the hip at least until you’ve put on a few inches And you’ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well Ser Endrew can show you some moves when your burns have healed

Ser Endrew Jon did not know the name

Ser Endrew Tarth a good man He’s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

Jon lowered the sword Why he said stupidly

Mormont snorted Because I sent him why do you think He’s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers’s wrist I have commanded him to take ship to King’s Landing and lay it before this boy king That should get young Joffrey’s attention I’d think… and Ser Alliser’s a knight highborn anointed with old friends at court altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow

Crow Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant

As well the Lord Commander continued ignoring the bird’s protest it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke He jabbed a finger up at Jon’s face And don’t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly but you’re not a boy anymore however many years you’ve seen That’s a man’s sword you have there and it will take a man to wield her I’ll expect you to act the part henceforth

Yes my lord Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard If not the blade he would have chosen it was nonetheless a noble gift and freeing him from Alliser Thorne’s malignance was nobler still

The Old Bear scratched at his chin I had forgotten how much a new beard itches he said Well no help for that Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties

Yes my lord

Good The night will be cold I’ll want hot spice wine Find me a flagon of red not too sour and don’t skimp on the spices And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I’m like to boil him That last haunch was grey Even the bird wouldn’t touch it He stroked the raven’s head with his thumb and the bird made a contented quorking sound Away with you I’ve work to do

The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair carrying the sword in his good hand Sweet steel one man said You earned that Snow another told him Jon made himself smile back at them but his heart was not in it He knew he should be pleased yet he did not feel it His hand ached and the taste of anger was in his mouth though he could not have said who he was angry with or why

A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King’s Tower where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence They’d hung a target on the granary doors so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers but he knew lurkers when he saw them No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out Well come about let’s have a look

At what Jon said

Toad sidled close Your rosy butt cheeks what else

The sword Grenn stated We want to see the sword

Jon raked them with an accusing look You knew

Pyp grinned We’re not all as dumb as Grenn

You are so insisted Grenn You’re dumber

Halder gave an apologetic shrug I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel the builder said and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole’s Town

We knew even before that though Grenn said Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade

The sword Matt insisted The others took up the chant The sword the sword the sword

Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them turning it this way and that so they could admire it The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight dark and deadly Valyrian steel he declared solemnly trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt

I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel declared Toad He cut his head off trying to shave

Pyp grinned The Night’s Watch is thousands of years old he said but I’ll wager Lord Snow’s the first brother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander’s Tower

The others laughed and even Jon had to smile The fire he’d started had not in truth burned down that formidable stone tower but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors where the Old Bear had his chambers No one seemed to mind that very much since it had also destroyed Othor’s murderous corpse

The other wight the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers had also been destroyed cut near to pieces by a dozen swords… but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead even arms and armor offered small protection

That grim thought soured Jon’s fragile mood I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear’s supper he announced brusquely sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard His friends meant well but they did not understand It was not their fault truly they had not had to face Othor they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands How could they hope to comprehend He turned away from them abruptly and strode off sullen Pyp called after him but Jon paid him no mind

They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin’s Tower after the fire and it was there he returned Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon’s boots The direwolf’s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men Jon knelt scratched his ear and showed him the pommel of the sword Look It’s you

Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick Jon smiled You’re the one deserves an honor he told the wolf… and suddenly he found himself remembering how he’d found him that day in the late summer snow They had been riding off with the other pups but Jon had heard a noise and turned back and there he was white fur almost invisible against the drifts He was all alone he thought apart from the others in the litter He was different so they drove him out

Jon He looked up Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels His cheeks were red and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation

Sam Jon stood What is it Do you want to see the sword If the others had known no doubt Sam did too

The fat boy shook his head I was heir to my father’s blade once he said mournfully Heartsbane Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times but it always scared me It was Valyrian steel beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I’d hurt one of my sisters Dickon will have it now He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak I ah… Maester Aemon wants to see you

It was not time for his bandages to be changed Jon frowned suspiciously Why he demanded Sam looked miserable That was answer enough You told him didn’t you Jon said angrily You told him that you told me

I… he… Jon I didn’t want to… he asked… I mean I think he knew he sees things no one else sees…

He’s blind Jon pointed out forcefully disgusted I can find the way myself He left Sam standing there openmouthed and quivering

He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery feeding the ravens Clydas was with him carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage Sam said you wanted me

The maester nodded I did indeed Clydas give Jon the bucket Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me The hunched pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder Toss the meat into the cages Aemon instructed him The birds will do the rest 

Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars beating at the metal with night-black wings The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first Lord Mormont’s raven likes fruit and corn
