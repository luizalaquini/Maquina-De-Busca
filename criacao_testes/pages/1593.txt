on the slippery ledge we make our way to a narrow bridge
and cross it In an alcove at the far side Pollux smacks a
ladder with his hand and points up the shaft This is it Our
way out
A quick glance at our party tells me somethings off
Wait Where are Jackson and Leeg One
They stayed at the Grinder to hold the mutts back
says Homes
What Im lunging back for the bridge willing to leave
no one to those monsters when he yanks me back
Dont waste their lives Katniss Its too late for them
Look Homes nods to the pipe where the mutts are
slithering onto the ledge
Stand back Gale shouts With his explosive-tipped
arrows he rips the far side of the bridge from its
foundation The rest sinks into the bubbles just as the mutts
reach it
For the first time I get a good look at them A mix of
human and lizard and who knows what else White tight
reptilian skin smeared with gore clawed hands and feet
their faces a mess of conflicting features Hissing shrieking
my name now as their bodies contort in rage Lashing out
with tails and claws taking huge chunks of one another or
their own bodies with wide lathered mouths driven mad by
their need to destroy me My scent must be as evocative to
them as theirs is to me More so because despite its
toxicity the mutts begin to throw themselves into the foul
sewer
Along our bank everyone opens fire I choose my
arrows without discretion sending arrowheads fire
explosives into the mutts bodies Theyre mortal but only
just No natural thing could keep coming with two dozen
bullets in it Yes we can eventually kill them only there are
so many an endless supply pouring from the pipe not even
hesitating to take to the sewage
But its not their numbers that make my hands shake
so
No mutt is good All are meant to damage you Some
take your life like the monkeys Others your reason like the
tracker jackers However the true atrocities the most
frightening incorporate a perverse psychological twist
designed to terrify the victim The sight of the wolf mutts
with the dead tributes eyes The sound of the jabberjays
replicating Prims tortured screams The smell of Snows
roses mixed with the victims blood Carried across the
sewer Cutting through even this foulness Making my heart
run wild my skin turn to ice my lungs unable to suck air Its
as if Snows breathing right in my face telling me its time to
die
The others are shouting at me but I cant seem to
respond Strong arms lift me as I blast the head off a mutt
whose claws have just grazed my ankle Im slammed into
the ladder Hands shoved against the rungs Ordered to
climb My wooden puppet limbs obey Movement slowly
brings me back to my senses I detect one person above
me Pollux Peeta and Cressida are below We reach a
platform Switch to a second ladder Rungs slick with sweat
and mildew At the next platform my head has cleared and
the reality of whats happened hits me I begin frantically
pulling people up off the ladder Peeta Cressida Thats it
What have I done What have I abandoned the others
to Im scrambling back down the ladder when one of my
boots kicks someone
Climb Gale barks at me Im back up hauling him in
peering into the gloom for more No Gale turns my face
to him and shakes his head Uniform shredded Gaping
wound in the side of his neck
Theres a human cry from below Someones still
alive I plead
No Katniss Theyre not coming says Gale Only the
mutts are
Unable to accept it I shine the light from Cressidas
gun down the shaft Far below I can just make out Finnick
struggling to hang on as three mutts tear at him As one
yanks back his head to take the death bite something
bizarre happens Its as if Im Finnick watching images of
my life flash by The mast of a boat a silver parachute
Mags laughing a pink sky Beetees trident Annie in her
wedding dress waves breaking over rocks Then its over
I slide the Holo from my belt and choke out nightlock
nightlock nightlock Release it Hunch against the wall with
the others as the explosion rocks the platform and bits of
mutt and human flesh shoot out of the pipe and shower us
Theres a clank as Pollux slams a cover over the pipe
and locks it in place Pollux Gale Cressida Peeta and
me Were all thats left Later the human feelings will come
Now Im conscious only of an animal need to keep the
remnants of our band alive We cant stop here
Someone comes up with a bandage We tie it around
Gales neck Get him to his feet Only one figure stays
huddled against the wall Peeta I say Theres no
response Has he blacked out I crouch in front of him
pulling his cuffed hands from his face Peeta His eyes
are like black pools the pupils dilated so that the blue
irises have all but vanished The muscles in his wrists are
hard as metal
Leave me he whispers I cant hang on
Yes You can I tell him
Peeta shakes his head Im losing it Ill go mad Like
them
