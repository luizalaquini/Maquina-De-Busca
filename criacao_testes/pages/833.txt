Deftly done Catelyn decided Robb keeps the Westerling out of Lord Walder’s sight as well

Gout and brittle bones had taken their toll of old Walder Frey They found him propped up in his high seat with a cushion beneath him and an ermine robe across his lap His chair was black oak its back carved into the semblance of two stout towers joined by an arched bridge so massive that its embrace turned the old man into a grotesque child There was something of the vulture about Lord Walder and rather more of the weasel His bald head spotted with age thrust out from his scrawny shoulders on a long pink neck Loose skin dangled beneath his receding chin his eyes were runny and clouded and his toothless mouth moved constantly sucking at the empty air as a babe sucks at his mother’s breast

The eighth Lady Frey stood beside Lord Walder’s high seat At his feet sat a somewhat younger version of himself a stooped thin man of fifty whose costly garb of blue wool and grey satin was strangely accented by a crown and collar ornamented with tiny brass bells The likeness between him and his lord was striking save for their eyes Lord Frey’s small dim and suspicious the other’s large amiable and vacant Catelyn recalled that one of Lord Walder’s brood had fathered a halfwit long years ago During past visits the Lord of the Crossing had always taken care to hide this one away Did he always wear a fool’s crown or is that meant as mockery of Robb It was a question she dare not ask

Frey sons daughters children grandchildren husbands wives and servants crowded the rest of the hall But it was the old man who spoke You will forgive me if I do not kneel I know My legs no longer work as they did though that which hangs between ’em serves well enough heh His mouth split in a toothless smile as he eyed Robb’s crown Some would say it’s a poor king who crowns himself with bronze Your Grace

Bronze and iron are stronger than gold and silver Robb answered The old Kings of Winter wore such a sword-crown

Small good it did them when the dragons came Heh That heh seemed to please the lackwit who bobbed his head from side to side jingling crown and collar Sire Lord Walder said forgive my Aegon the noise He has less wits than a crannogman and he’s never met a king before One of Stevron’s boys We call him Jinglebell

Ser Stevron mentioned him my lord Robb smiled at the lackwit Well met Aegon Your father was a brave man

Jinglebell jingled his bells A thin line of spit ran from one corner of his mouth when he smiled

Save your royal breath You’d do as well talking to a chamberpot Lord Walder shifted his gaze to the others Well Lady Catelyn I see you have returned to us And young Ser Edmure the victor of the Stone Mill Lord Tully now I’ll need to remember that You’re the fifth Lord Tully I’ve known I outlived the other four heh Your bride’s about here somewhere I suppose you want a look at her

I would my lord

Then you’ll have it But clothed She’s a modest girl and a maid You won’t see her naked till the bedding Lord Walder cackled Heh Soon enough soon enough He craned his head about Benfrey go fetch your sister Be quick about it Lord Tully’s come all the way from Riverrun A young knight in a quartered surcoat bowed and took his leave and the old man turned back to Robb And where’s your bride Your Grace The fair Queen Jeyne A Westerling of the Crag I’m told heh

I left her at Riverrun my lord She was too weary for more travel as we told Ser Ryman

That makes me grievous sad I wanted to behold her with mine own weak eyes We all did heh Isn’t that so my lady

Pale wispy Lady Frey seemed startled that she would be called upon to speak Y-yes my lord We all so wanted to pay homage to Queen Jeyne She must be fair to look on

She is most fair my lady There was an icy stillness in Robb’s voice that reminded Catelyn of his father

The old man either did not hear it or refused to pay it any heed Fairer than my own get heh Elsewise how could her face and form have made the King’s Grace forget his solemn promise

Robb suffered the rebuke with dignity No words can set that right I know but I have come to make my apologies for the wrong I did your House and to beg for your forgiveness my lord

Apologies heh Yes you vowed to make one I recall I’m old but I don’t forget such things Not like some kings it seems The young remember nothing when they see a pretty face and a nice firm pair of teats isn’t that so I was the same Some might say I still am heh heh They’d be wrong though wrong as you were But now you’re here to make amends It was my girls you spurned though Mayhaps it’s them should hear you beg for pardon Your Grace My maiden girls Here have a look at them When he waggled his fingers a flurry of femininity left their places by the walls to line up beneath the dais Jinglebell started to rise as well his bells ringing merrily but Lady Frey grabbed the lackwit’s sleeve and tugged him back down

Lord Walder named the names My daughter Arwyn he said of a girl of fourteen Shirei my youngest trueborn daughter Ami and Marianne are granddaughters I married Ami to Ser Pate of Sevenstreams but the Mountain killed the oaf so I got her back That’s a Cersei but we call her Little Bee her mother’s a Beesbury More granddaughters One’s a Walda and the others… well they have names whatever they are…

I’m Merry Lord Grandfather one girl said

You’re noisy that’s for certain Next to Noisy is my daughter Tyta Then another Walda Alyx Marissa… are you Marissa I thought you were She’s not always bald The maester shaved her hair off but he swears it will soon grow back The twins are Serra and Sarra He squinted down at one of the younger girls Heh are you another Walda

The girl could not have been more than four I’m Ser Aemon Rivers’s Walda lord great grandfather She curtsied

How long have you been talking Not that you’re like to have anything sensible to say your father never did He’s a bastard’s son besides heh Go away I wanted only Freys up here The King in the North has no interest in base stock Lord Walder glanced to Robb as Jinglebell bobbed his head and chimed There they are all maidens Well and one widow but there’s some who like a woman broken in You might have had any one of them

It would have been an impossible choice my lord said Robb with careful courtesy They’re all too lovely

Lord Walder snorted And they say my eyes are bad Some will do well enough I suppose Others… well it makes no matter They weren’t good enough for the King in the North heh Now what is it you have to say

My ladies Robb looked desperately uncomfortable but he had known this moment must come and he faced it without flinching All men should keep their word kings most of all I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow The fault is not in you What I did was not done to slight you but because I loved another No words can set it right I know yet I come before you to ask forgiveness that the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends

The smaller girls fidgeted anxiously Their older sisters waited for Lord Walder on his black oak throne Jinglebell rocked back and forth bells chiming on collar and crown
