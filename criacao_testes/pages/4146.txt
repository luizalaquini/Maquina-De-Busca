The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel
has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind It
is a sort of
P 183
attenuated variety of Ixions punishment
and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of
heavy and the bodys centre of gravity seems to
settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere be+
tween the eyebrows and the crown Bathsheba felt
the unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen
turns
  Will you turn Gabriel and let me hold the shears
she said My head is in awhirl and I cant talk
Gabriel turned Bathsheba then began with some
awkwardness allowing her thoughts to stray occasion+
ally from her story to attend to the shears which
required a little nicety in sharpening
  I wanted to ask you if the men made any observa+
tions on my going behind the sedge with Mr Boldwood
yesterday
  Yes they did said Gabriel You dont hold
the shears right miss -- I knew you wouldnt know the
way -- hold like this
He relinquished the winch and inclosing her two
hands completely i his own taking each as we some+
times slasp a childs hand in teaching him to write
grasped the shears with her Incline the edge so
he said
  Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words
and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in+
structor as he spoke
  That will do exclaimed Bathsheba Loose my
hands I wont have them held Turn the winch
Gabriel freed her hands quietly retired to his
handle and the grinding went on
  Did the men think it odd she said again
Odd was not the idea miss
What did they say
That Farmer Boldwoods name and your own
were likely to be flung over pulpit together before the
year was out
I thought so by the look of them Why theres
nothing in it A more foolish remark was never made
and I want you to contradict it thats what I came for
  Gabriel looked incredulous and sad but between
his moments of incredulity relieved
They must have heard our conversation she
continued
P 184
Well then Bathsheba said Oak stopping the
handle and gazing into her face with astonishment
  Miss Everdene you mean she said with dignity
  I mean this that if Mr Boldwood really spoke of
marriage I baint going to tell a story and say he
didnt to please you I have already tried to please
you too much for my own good
Hathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity
She did not know whether to pity him for disappointed
love of her or to be angry with him for having got
over it -- his tone being ambiguous
  I said I wanted you just to mention that it was
not true I was going to be married to him she mur+
mured with a slight decline in her assurance
I can say that to them if you wish Miss Everdene
And I could likewise give an opinion to ee on what
you have done
I daresay But I dont want your opinion
I suppose not said Gabriel bitterly and going on
with his turning his words rising and falling in a
regular swell and cadence as he stooped or rose with
the winch which directed them according to his
position perpendiculary into the earth or horizontally
along the garden his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon
the ground
  With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act
but as does not always happen time gained was
prudence insured It must be added however that
time was very seldom gained At this period the
single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings
that she valued as sounder than her own was Gabriel
Oaks And the outspoken honesty of his character
was such- that on any subject even that of her love
for or marriage with another man the same disinter+
estedness of opinion might be calculated on and be
had for the asking Thoroughly convinced of the
impossibility of his own suit a high resolve constrained
him not to injure that of another This is a lovers
most stoical virtue as the lack of it is a lovers most
venial sin Hnowing he would reply truly she asked
the question painful as she must have known the sub+
ject would be Such is the selfishness of some charm+
ing women Perhaps it was some excuse for her thus
torturing honesty to her own advantage that she had
P 185
absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach
Well what is your opinion of my conduct she
said quietly
That it is unworthy of any thoughtful and meek
and comely woman
In an instant Bathshebas face coloured with the
