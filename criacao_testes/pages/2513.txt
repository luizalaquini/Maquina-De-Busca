thy neighbours hand ye shall not oppress one another 2515
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee 2516 According to the multitude of years thou
shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of
years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee

2517 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear
thy Godfor I am the LORD your God

2518 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do
them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety

2519 And the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill
and dwell therein in safety

2520 And if ye shall say What shall we eat the seventh year behold
we shall not sow nor gather in our increase 2521 Then I will
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring
forth fruit for three years

2522 And ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until
the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
store

2523 The land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me

2524 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
redemption for the land

2525 If thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his
possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold

2526 And if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to
redeem it 2527 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof and
restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may
return unto his possession

2528 But if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the
year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return
unto his possession

2529 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may
he redeem it

2530 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in
the jubile

2531 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be
redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile

2532 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites and the houses of the
cities of their possession may the Levites redeem at any time

2533 And if a man purchase of the Levites then the house that was
sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of
jubile for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their
possession among the children of Israel

2534 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold
for it is their perpetual possession

2535 And if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee
then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a
sojourner that he may live with thee

2536 Take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy God that
thy brother may live with thee

2537 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy
victuals for increase

2538 I am the LORD your God which brought you forth out of the land
of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God

2539 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be
sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
2540 But as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with
thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile

2541 And then shall he depart from thee both he and his children
with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return

2542 For they are my servants which I brought forth out of the land
of Egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen

2543 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy
God

2544 Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have
shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy
