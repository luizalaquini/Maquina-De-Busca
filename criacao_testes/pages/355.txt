Is the doublet new

It is You’re most observant

Plum and yellow Are those the colors of your House

No But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out or so I’ve found

That’s a handsome knife as well

Is it There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes He drew the knife and glanced at it casually as if he had never seen it before Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt A trifle plain though It’s yours if you would like it

Mine Tyrion gave him a long look No I think not Never mine He knows the insolent wretch He knows and he knows that I know and he thinks that I cannot touch him

If ever truly a man had armored himself in gold it was Petyr Baelish not Jaime Lannister Jaime’s famous armor was but gilded steel but Littlefinger ah… Tyrion had learned a few things about sweet Petyr to his growing disquiet

Ten years ago Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king’s other collectors King Robert had been a prodigious spender A man like Petyr Baelish who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third was invaluable to his Hand Littlefinger’s rise had been arrow-swift Within three years of his coming to court he was master of coin and a member of the small council and today the crown’s revenues were ten times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor… though the crown’s debts had grown vast as well A master juggler was Petyr Baelish

Oh he was clever He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault no He paid the king’s debts in promises and put the king’s gold to work He bought wagons shops ships houses He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys stored it moved it dyed it sold it The golden dragons bred and multiplied and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings

And in the process he moved his own men into place The Keepers of the Keys were his all four The King’s Counter and the King’s Scales were men he’d named The officers in charge of all three mints Harbormasters tax farmers customs sergeants wool factors toll collectors pursers wine factors nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger They were men of middling birth by and large merchants’ sons lesser lordlings sometimes even foreigners but judging from their results far more able than their highborn predecessors

No one had ever thought to question the appointments and why should they Littlefinger was no threat to anyone A clever smiling genial man everyone’s friend always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required and yet of such undistinguished birth one step up from a hedge knight he was not a man to fear He had no banners to call no army of retainers no great stronghold no holdings to speak of no prospects of a great marriage

But do I dare touch him Tyrion wondered Even if he is a traitor He was not at all certain he could least of all now while the war raged Given time he could replace Littlefinger’s men with his own in key positions but…

A shout rang up from the yard Ah His Grace has killed a hare Lord Baelish observed

No doubt a slow one Tyrion said My lord you were fostered at Riverrun I’ve heard it said that you grew close to the Tullys

You might say so The girls especially

How close

I had their maidenhoods Is that close enough

The lie—Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie—was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied About her defloration and the dagger as well The longer he lived the more Tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true Lord Hoster’s daughters do not love me he confessed I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make Yet coming from you the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears 

That would depend on the words If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother waste someone else’s time Joffrey will never surrender his plaything and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl

I mean to have Arya as well I have men searching

Searching is not finding

I’ll keep that in mind my lord In any case it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway For her I have a sweeter offer

Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn true… but also more fearful and I understand she hates you

She believes she has good reason When I was her guest in the Eyrie she insisted that Id murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials He leaned forward If I gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer she might think more kindly of me

That made Littlefinger sit up True killer I confess you make me curious Who do you propose

It was Tyrion’s turn to smile Gifts I give my friends freely Lysa Arryn would need to understand that
