I gave Brandon my favor to wear and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother I did so gladly though I never saw Ned’s face until our wedding day I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent him off to his war and his king and the woman who bore him his bastard because I always did my duty

Her steps took her to the sept a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst her mother’s gardens and filled with rainbow light It was crowded when they entered Catelyn was not alone in her need for prayer She knelt before the painted marble image of the Warrior and lit a scented candle for Edmure and another for Robb off beyond the hills Keep them safe and help them to victory she prayed and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those they leave behind

The septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at her prayers so Catelyn lingered for the celebration She did not know this septon an earnest young man close to Edmure’s age He performed his office well enough and his voice was rich and pleasant when he sang the praises to the Seven but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd long dead Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what she had seen and felt in Renly’s pavilion and he might have known what it meant as well and what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams Osmynd my father Uncle Brynden old Maester Kym they always seemed to know everything but now there is only me and it seems I know nothing not even my duty How can I do my duty if I do not know where it lies

Catelyn’s knees were stiff by the time she rose though she felt no wiser Perhaps she would go to the godswood tonight and pray to Ned’s gods as well They were older than the Seven

Outside she found song of a very different sort Rymund the Rhymer sat by the brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners his deep voice ringing as he sang of Lord Deremond at the Bloody Meadow

And there he stood with sword in hand

the last of Darry’s ten…

Brienne paused to listen for a moment broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against her chest A mob of ragged boys raced by screeching and flailing at each other with sticks Why do boys so love to play at war Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer The singer’s voice swelled as he neared the end of his song

And red the grass beneath his feet

and red his banners bright

and red the glow of setting sun

that bathed him in its light

Come on come on the great lord called

my sword is hungry still

And with a cry of savage rage

They swarmed across the rill…

Fighting is better than this waiting Brienne said You don’t feel so helpless when you fight You have a sword and a horse sometimes an axe When you’re armored it’s hard for anyone to hurt you

Knights die in battle Catelyn reminded her

Brienne looked at her with those blue and beautiful eyes As ladies die in childbed No one sings songs about them

Children are a battle of a different sort Catelyn started across the yard A battle without banners or warhorns but no less fierce Carrying a child bringing it into the world… your mother will have told you of the pain…

I never knew my mother Brienne said My father had ladies… a different lady every year but…

Those were no ladies Catelyn said As hard as birth can be Brienne what comes after is even harder At times I feel as though I am being torn apart Would that there were five of me one for each child so I might keep them all safe

And who would keep you safe my lady

Her smile was wan and tired Why the men of my House Or so my lady mother taught me My lord father my brother my uncle my husband they will keep me safe… but while they are away from me I suppose you must fill their place Brienne

Brienne bowed her head I shall try my lady

Later that day Maester Vyman brought a letter She saw him at once hoping for some word from Robb or from Ser Rodrik in Winterfell but the message proved to be from one Lord Meadows who named himself castellan of Storm’s End It was addressed to her father her brother her son or whoever now holds Riverrun Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead the man wrote and Storm’s End had opened its gate to Stannis Baratheon the trueborn and rightful heir The castle garrison had sworn their swords to his cause one and all and no man of them had suffered harm

Save Cortnay Penrose Catelyn murmured She had never met the man yet she grieved to hear of his passing Robb should know of this at once she said Do we know where he is

At last word he was marching toward the Crag the seat of House Westerling said Maester Vyman If I dispatched a raven to Ashemark it may be that they could send a rider after him

Do so

Catelyn read the letter again after the maester was gone Lord Meadows says nothing of Robert’s bastard she confided to Brienne I suppose he yielded the boy with the rest though I confess I do not understand why Stannis wanted him so badly

Perhaps he fears the boy’s claim

A bastard’s claim No it’s something else… what does this child look like

He is seven or eight comely with black hair and bright blue eyes Visitors oft thought him Lord Renly’s own son

And Renly favored Robert Catelyn had a glimmer of understanding Stannis means to parade his brother’s bastard before the realm so men might see Robert in his face and wonder why there is no such likeness in Joffrey

Would that mean so much

Those who favor Stannis will call it proof Those who support Joffrey will say it means nothing Her own children had more Tully about them than Stark Arya was the only one to show much of Ned in her features And Jon Snow but he was never mine She found herself thinking of Jon’s mother that shadowy secret love her husband would never speak of Does she grieve for Ned as I do Or did she hate him for leaving her bed for mine Does she pray for her son as I have prayed for mine

They were uncomfortable thoughts and futile If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall as some whispered the lady was long dead if not Catelyn had no clue who or where his mother might be And it made no matter Ned was gone now and his loves and his secrets had all died with him

Still she was struck again by how strangely men behaved when it came to their bastards Ned had always been fiercely protective of Jon and Ser Cortnay Penrose had given up his life for this Edric Storm yet Roose Bolton’s bastard had meant less to him than one of his dogs to judge from the tone of the queer cold letter Edmure had gotten from him not three days past He had crossed the Trident and was marching on Harrenhal as commanded he wrote A strong castle and well garrisoned but His Grace shall have it if I must kill every living soul within to make it so He hoped His Grace would weigh that against the crimes of his bastard son whom Ser Rodrik Cassel had put to death A fate he no doubt earned Bolton had written Tainted blood is ever treacherous and Ramsay’s nature was sly greedy and cruel I count myself well rid of him The trueborn sons my young wife has promised me would never have been safe while he lived

The sound of hurrying footsteps drove the morbid thoughts from her head Ser Desmond’s squire dashed panting into the room and knelt My lady… Lannisters… across the river

Take a long breath lad and tell it slowly

He did as she bid him A column of armored men he reported Across the Red Fork They are flying a purple unicorn below the lion of Lannister

Some son of Lord Brax Brax had come to Riverrun once when she was a girl to propose wedding one of his sons to her or Lysa She wondered whether it was this same son out there now leading the attack

The Lannisters had ridden out of the southeast beneath a blaze of banners Ser Desmond told her when she ascended to the battlements to join him A few outriders no more he assured her The main strength of Lord Tywin’s host is well to the south We are in no danger here

South of the Red Fork the land stretched away open and flat From the watchtower Catelyn could see for miles Even so only the nearest ford was visible Edmure had entrusted Lord Jason Mallister with its defense as well as that of three others farther upriver The Lannister riders were milling about uncertainly near the water crimson and silver banners flapping in the wind No more than fifty my lady Ser Desmond estimated

Catelyn watched the riders spread out in a long line Lord Jason’s men waited to receive them behind rocks and grass and hillocks A trumpet blast sent the horsemen forward at a ponderous walk splashing down into the current For a moment they made a brave show all bright armor and streaming banners the sun flashing off the points of their lances

Now she heard Brienne mutter

It was hard to make out what was happening but the screams of the horses seemed loud even at this remove and beneath them Catelyn heard the fainter clash of steel on steel A banner vanished suddenly as its bearer was swept under and soon after the first dead man drifted past their walls borne along by the current By then the Lannisters had pulled back in confusion She watched as they re-formed conferred briefly and galloped back the way they had come The men on the walls shouted taunts after them though they were already too far off to hear

Ser Desmond slapped his belly Would that Lord Hoster could have seen that It would have made him dance

My father’s dancing days are past I fear Catelyn said and this fight is just begun The Lannisters will come again Lord Tywin has twice my brother’s numbers

He could have ten times and it would not matter Ser Desmond said The west bank of the Red Fork is higher than the east my lady and well wooded Our bowmen have good cover and a clear field for their shafts… and should any breach occur Edmure will have his best knights in reserve ready to ride wherever they are most sorely needed The river will hold them
