And even that they would do

Yes Missandei’s voice had grown soft Your Grace

Dany squeezed her hand You would sooner I did not ask it of them though Why is that Why do you care

This one does not    I    Your Grace   

Tell me

The girl lowered her eyes Three of them were my brothers once Your Grace

Then I hope your brothers are as brave and clever as you Dany leaned back into her pillow and let the litter bear her onward back to Balerion one last time to set her world in order And back to Drogon Her mouth set grimly

It was a long dark windy night that followed Dany fed her dragons as she always did but found she had no appetite herself She cried awhile alone in her cabin then dried her tears long enough for yet another argument with Groleo Magister Illyrio is not here she finally had to tell him and if he was he could not sway me either I need the Unsullied more than I need these ships and I will hear no more about it

The anger burned the grief and fear from her for a few hours at the least Afterward she called her bloodriders to her cabin with Ser Jorah They were the only ones she truly trusted

She meant to sleep afterward to be well rested for the morrow but an hour of restless tossing in the stuffy confines of the cabin soon convinced her that was hopeless Outside her door she found Aggo fitting a new string to his bow by the light of a swinging oil lamp Rakharo sat crosslegged on the deck beside him sharpening his arakh with a whetstone Dany told them both to keep on with what they were doing and went up on deck for a taste of the cool night air The crew left her alone as they went about their business but Ser Jorah soon joined her by the rail He is never far Dany thought He knows my moods too well

Khaleesi You ought to be asleep Tomorrow will be hot and hard I promise you You’ll need your strength

Do you remember Eroeh she asked him

The Lhazareen girl

They were raping her but I stopped them and took her under my protection Only when my sun-and-stars was dead Mago took her back used her again and killed her Aggo said it was her fate

I remember Ser Jorah said

I was alone for a long time Jorah All alone but for my brother I was such a small scared thing Viserys should have protected me but instead he hurt me and scared me worse He shouldn’t have done that He wasn’t just my brother he was my king Why do the gods make kings and queens if not to protect the ones who can’t protect themselves

Some kings make themselves Robert did

He was no true king Dany said scornfully He did no justice Justice    that’s what kings are for

Ser Jorah had no answer He only smiled and touched her hair so lightly It was enough

That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar riding to the Trident But she was mounted on a dragon not a horse When she saw the Usurper’s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming but another part exulted This is how it was meant to be The other was a nightmare and I have only now awakened

She woke suddenly in the darkness of her cabin still flush with triumph Balerion seemed to wake with her and she heard the faint creak of wood water lapping against the hull a football on the deck above her head And something else

Someone was in the cabin with her

Irri Jhiqui Where are you Her handmaids did not respond It was too black to see but she could hear them breathing Jorah is that you

They sleep a woman said They all sleep The voice was very close Even dragons must sleep

She is standing over me Who’s there Dany peered into the darkness She thought she could see a shadow the faintest outline of a shape What do you want to me

Remember To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Quaithe Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily Khaleesi murmured Jhiqui rubbing her eyes Viserion woke and opened his jaws and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask Khaleesi are you unwell asked Jhiqui

A dream Dany shook her head I dreamed a dream no more Go back to sleep All of us go back to sleep Yet try as she might sleep would not come again

If I look back I am lost Dany told herself the next morning as she entered Astapor through the harbor gates She dared not remind herself how small and insignificant her following truly was or she would lose all courage Today she rode her silver clad in horsehair pants and painted leather vest a bronze medallion belt about her waist and two more crossed between her breasts Irri and Jhiqui had braided her hair and hung it with a tiny silver bell whose chime sang of the Undying of Qarth burned in their Palace of Dust

The red brick streets of Astapor were almost crowded this morning Slaves and servants lined the ways while the slavers and their women donned their tokars to look down from their stepped pyramids They are not so different from Qartheen after all she thought They want a glimpse of dragons to tell their children of and their children’s children It made her wonder how many of them would ever have children

Aggo went before her with his great Dothraki bow Strong Belwas walked to the right of her mare the girl Missandei to her left Ser Jorah Mormont was behind in mail and surcoat glowering at anyone who came too near Rakharo and Jhogo protected the litter Dany had commanded that the top be removed so her three dragons might be chained to the platform Irri and Jhiqui rode with them to try and keep them calm Yet Viserion’s tail lashed back and forth and smoke rose angry from his nostrils Rhaegal could sense something wrong as well Thrice he tried to take wing only to be pulled down by the heavy chain in Jhiqui’s hand Drogon coiled into a ball wings and tail tucked tight Only his eyes remained to tell that he was not asleep

The rest of her people followed Groleo and the other captains and their crews and the eighty-three Dothraki who remained to her of the hundred thousand who had once ridden in Drogo’s khalasar She put the oldest and weakest on the inside of the column with the nursing women and those with child and the little girls and the boys too young to braid their hair The rest—her warriors such as they were—rode outside and moved their dismal herd along the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived both red waste and black salt sea

I ought to have a banner sewn she thought as she led her tattered band up along Astapor’s meandering river She closed her eyes to imagine how it would look all flowing black silk and on it the red three-headed dragon of Targaryen breathing golden flames A banner such as Rhaegar might have borne The river’s banks were strangely tranquil The Worm the Astapori called the stream It was wide and slow and crooked dotted with tiny wooded islands She glimpsed children playing on one of them darting amongst elegant marble statues On another island two lovers kissed in the shade of tall green trees with no more shame than Dothraki at a wedding Without clothing she could not tell if they were slave or free

The Plaza of Pride with its great bronze harpy was too small to hold all the Unsullied she had bought Instead they had been assembled in the Plaza of Punishment fronting on Astapor’s main gate so they might be marched directly from the city once Daenerys had taken them in hand There were no bronze statues here only a wooden platform where rebellious slaves were racked and flayed and hanged The Good Masters place them so they will be the first thing a new slave sees upon entering the city Missandei told her as they came to the plaza

At first glimpse Dany thought their skin was striped like the zorses of the Jogos Nhai Then she rode her silver nearer and saw the raw red flesh beneath the crawling black stripes Flies Flies and maggots The rebellious slaves had been peeled like a man might peel an apple in a long curling strip One man had an arm black with flies from fingers to elbow and red and white beneath Dany reined in beneath him What did this one do

He raised a hand against his owner

Her stomach roiling Dany wheeled her silver about and trotted toward the center of the plaza and the army she had bought so dear Rank on rank on rank they stood her stone halfmen with their hearts of brick eight thousand and six hundred in the spiked bronze caps of fully trained Unsullied and five thousand odd behind them bareheaded yet armed with spears and shortswords The ones farthest to the back were only boys she saw but they stood as straight and still as all the rest

Kraznys mo Nakloz and his fellows were all there to greet her Other well-born Astapori stood in knots behind them sipping wine from silver flutes as slaves circulated among them with trays of olives and cherries and figs The elder Grazdan sat in a sedan chair supported by four huge copper-skinned slaves Half a dozen mounted lancers rode along the edges of the plaza keeping back the crowds who had come to watch The sun flashed blinding bright off the polished copper disks sewn to their cloaks but she could not help but notice how nervous their horses seemed They fear the dragons And well they might

Kraznys had a slave help her from her saddle His own hands were full one clutched his tokar while the other held an ornate whip Here they are He looked at Missandei Tell her they are hers    if she can pay

She can the girl said

Ser Jorah barked a command and the trade goods were brought forward Six bales of tiger skins three hundred bolts of fine silk Jars of saffron jars of myrrh jars of pepper and curry and cardamom an onyx mask twelve jade monkeys casks of ink in red and black and green a box of rare black amethysts a box of pearls a cask of pitted olives stuffed with maggots a dozen casks of pickled cave fish a great brass gong and a hammer to beat it with seventeen ivory eyes and a huge chest full of books written in tongues that Dany could not read And more and more and more Her people stacked it all before the slavers

While the payment was being made Kraznys mo Nakloz favored her with a few final words on the handling of her troops They are green as yet he said through Missandei Tell the whore of Westeros she would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking Whatever plunder she takes will be hers alone Unsullied have no lust for gold or gems And should she take captives a few guards will suffice to march them back to Astapor We’ll buy the healthy ones and for a good price And who knows In ten years some of the boys she sends us may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper

Finally there were no more trade goods to add to the pile Her Dothraki mounted their horses once more and Dany said This was all we could carry The rest awaits you on the ships a great quantity of amber and wine and black rice And you have the ships themselves So all that remains is   

   the dragon finished the Grazdan with the spiked beard who spoke the Common Tongue so thickly

And here he waits Ser Jorah and Belwas walked beside her to the litter where Drogon and his brothers lay basking in the sun Jhiqui unfastened one end of the chain and handed it down to her When she gave a yank the black dragon raised his head hissing and unfolded wings of night and scarlet Kraznys mo Nakloz smiled broadly as their shadow fell across him

Dany handed the slaver the end of Drogon’s chain In return he presented her with the whip The handle was black dragonbone elaborately carved and inlaid with gold Nine long thin leather lashes trailed from it each one tipped by a gilded claw The gold pommel was a woman’s head with pointed ivory teeth The harpy’s fingers Kraznys named the scourge

Dany turned the whip in her hand Such a light thing to bear such weight Is it done then Do they belong to me

It is done he agreed giving the chain a sharp pull to bring Drogon down from the litter

Dany mounted her silver She could feel her heart thumping in her chest She felt desperately afraid Was this what my brother would have done She wondered if Prince Rhaegar had been this anxious when he saw the Usurper’s host formed up across the Trident with all their banners floating on the wind

She stood in her stirrups and raised the harpy’s fingers above her head for all the Unsullied to see IT IS DONE she cried at the top of her lungs YOU ARE MINE She gave the mare her heels and galloped along the first rank holding the fingers high YOU ARE THE DRAGON’S NOW YOU’RE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR IT IS DONE IT IS DONE
