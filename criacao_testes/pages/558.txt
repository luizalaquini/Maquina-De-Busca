Ah you are in Maegor’s Holdfast my lord A chamber over the Queen’s Ballroom Her Grace wanted you kept close so she might watch over you herself

I’ll wager she did Return me Tyrion commanded Own bed Own chambers Where I will have my own men about me and my own maester too if I find one I can trust

Your own… my lord that would not be possible The King’s Hand has taken up residence in your former chambers

I Am King’s Hand He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking and confused by what he was hearing

Maester Ballabar looked distressed No my lord I… you were wounded near death Your lord father has taken up those duties now Lord Tywin he…

Here

Since the night of the battle Lord Tywin saved us all The smallfolk say it was King Renly’s ghost but wiser men know better It was your father and Lord Tyrell with the Knight of Flowers and Lord Littlefinger They rode through the ashes and took the usurper Stannis in the rear It was a great victory and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help His Grace set the realm to rights gods be praised

Gods be praised Tyrion repeated hollowly His bloody father and bloody Littlefinger and Renly’s ghost I want… Who do I want He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch him Shae Who could he send for who could he trust Varys Bronn Ser Jacelyn …my squire he finished Pod Payne It was Pod on the bridge of boats the lad saved my life

The boy The odd boy

Odd boy Podrick Payne You go Send him

As you will my lord Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited He wondered how long he had been here asleep Cersei would have me sleep forever but I won’t be so obliging

Podrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse My lord He crept close to the bed How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom Tyrion wondered I meant to stay by you but the maester sent me away

Send him away Hear me Talk’s hard Need dreamwine Dreamwine not milk of the poppy Go to Frenken Frenken not Ballabar Watch him make it Bring it here Pod stole a glance at Tyrion’s face and just as quickly averted his eyes Well I cannot blame him for that I want Tyrion went on mine own Guard Bronn Where’s Bronn

They made him a knight

Even frowning hurt Find him Bring him

As you say My lord Bronn

Tyrion seized the lad’s wrist Ser Mandon

The boy flinched I n-never meant to k-k-k-k—

Dead You’re certain Dead

He shuffled his feet sheepish Drowned

Good Say nothing Of him Of me Any of it Nothing

By the time his squire left the last of Tyrion’s strength was gone as well He lay back and closed his eyes Perhaps he would dream of Tysha again I wonder how she’d like my face now he thought bitterly





JON

When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire Jon knew their end was near

It will be good to feel warm again if only for a little while he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree Ghost sat on his haunches watching silent as ever Will he howl for me when I’m dead as Bran’s wolf howled when he fell Jon wondered Will Shaggydog howl far off in Winterfell and Grey Wind and Nymeria wherever they might be
