Tyrion sat alone sipping at what remained of the fine sweet Dornish wine Servants came and went clearing the dishes from the table He told them to leave the wine When they were done Varys came gliding into the hall wearing flowing lavender robes that matched his smell Oh sweetly done my good lord

Then why do I have this bitter taste in my mouth He pressed his fingers into his temples I told them to throw Allar Deem into the sea I am sorely tempted to do the same with you

You might be disappointed by the result Varys replied The storms come and go the waves crash overhead the big fish eat the little fish and I keep on paddling Might I trouble you for a taste of the wine that Lord Slynt enjoyed so much

Tyrion waved at the flagon frowning

Varys filled a cup Ah Sweet as summer He took another sip I hear the grapes singing on my tongue

I wondered what that noise was Tell the grapes to keep still my head is about to split It was my sister That was what the oh-so-loyal Lord Janos refused to say Cersei sent the gold cloaks to that brothel

Varys tittered nervously So he had known all along

You left that part out Tyrion said accusingly

Your own sweet sister Varys said so grief-stricken he looked close to tears It is a hard thing to tell a man my lord I was fearful how you might take it Can you forgive me

No Tyrion snapped Damn you Damn her He could not touch Cersei he knew Not yet not even if he’d wanted to and he was far from certain that he did Yet it rankled to sit here and make a mummer’s show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of Janos Slynt and Allar Deem while his sister continued on her savage course In future you will tell me what you know Lord Varys All of what you know

The eunuch’s smile was sly That might take rather a long time my good lord I know quite a lot

Not enough to save this child it would seem

Alas no There was another bastard a boy older I took steps to see him removed from harm’s way… but I confess I never dreamed the babe would be at risk A baseborn girl less than a year old with a whore for a mother What threat could she pose

She was Robert’s Tyrion said bitterly That was enough for Cersei it would seem

Yes It is grievous sad I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother who was so young and loved the king

Did she Tyrion had never seen the dead girl’s face but in his mind she was Shae and Tysha both Can a whore truly love anyone I wonder No don’t answer Some things I would rather not know He had settled Shae in a sprawling stone-and-timber manse with its own well and stable and garden he had given her servants to see to her wants a white bird from the Summer Isles to keep her company silks and silver and gemstones to adorn her guards to protect her And yet she seemed restive She wanted to be with him more she told him she wanted to serve him and help him You help me most here between the sheets he told her one night after their loving as he lay beside her his head pillowed against her breast his groin aching with a sweet soreness She made no reply save with her eyes He could see there that it was not what she’d wanted to hear

Sighing Tyrion started to reach for the wine again then remembered Lord Janos and pushed the flagon away It does seem my sister was telling the truth about Stark’s death We have my nephew to thank for that madness

King Joffrey gave the command Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne carried it out swiftly without hesitation…

…almost as if they had expected it Yes we have been over this ground before without profit A folly

With the City Watch in hand my lord you are well placed to see to it that His Grace commits no further… follies To be sure there is still the queen’s household guard to consider…

The red cloaks Tyrion shrugged Vylarr’s loyalty is to Casterly Rock He knows I am here with my father’s authority Cersei would find it hard to use his men against me… besides they are only a hundred I have half again as many men of my own And six thousand gold cloaks if Bywater is the man you claim

You will find Ser Jacelyn to be courageous honorable obedient… and most grateful

To whom I wonder Tyrion did not trust Varys though there was no denying his value He knew things beyond a doubt Why are you so helpful my lord Varys he asked studying the man’s soft hands the bald powdered face the slimy little smile

You are the Hand I serve the realm the king and you

As you served Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark

I served Lord Arryn and Lord Stark as best I could I was saddened and horrified by their most untimely deaths

Think how I feel I’m like to be next
