Jon had never been half the hunter that Theon was but he was no stranger to the longbow either There were dark shapes slipping around the armory backs against the stone but he could not see them well enough to waste an arrow He heard distant shouts and saw the archers on the Tower of Guards loosing shafts at the ground That was too far off to concern Jon But when he glimpsed three shadows detach themselves from the old stables fifty yards away he stepped up to the crenel raised his bow and drew They were running so he led them waiting waiting…

The arrow made a soft hiss as it left his string A moment later there was a grunt and suddenly only two shadows were loping across the yard They ran all the faster but Jon had already pulled a second arrow from his quiver This time he hurried the shot too much and missed The wildlings were gone by the time he nocked again He searched for another target and found four rushing around the empty shell of the Lord Commander’s Keep The moonlight glimmered off their spears and axes and the gruesome devices on their round leathern shields skulls and bones serpents bear claws twisted demonic faces Free folk he knew The Thenns carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses but theirs were plain and unadorned These were the lighter wicker shields of raiders

Jon pulled the goose feather back to his ear aimed and loosed the arrow then nocked and drew and loosed again The first shaft pierced the bearclaw shield the second one a throat The wildling screamed as he went down He heard the deep thrum of Deaf Dick’s crossbow to his left and Satin’s a moment later I got one the boy cried hoarsely I got one in the chest

Get another Jon called

He did not have to search for targets now only choose them He dropped a wildling archer as he was fitting an arrow to his string then sent a shaft toward the axeman hacking at the door of Hardin’s Tower That time he missed but the arrow quivering in the oak made the wildling reconsider It was only as he was running off that Jon recognized Big Boil Half a heartbeat later old Mully put an arrow through his leg from the roof of the Flint Barracks and he crawled off bleeding That will stop him bitching about his boil Jon thought

When his quiver was empty he went to get another and moved to a different crenel side by side with Deaf Dick Follard Jon got off three arrows for every bolt Deaf Dick discharged but that was the advantage of the longbow The crossbow penetrated better some insisted but it was slow and cumbersome to reload He could hear the wildlings shouting to each other and somewhere to the west a warhorn blew The world was moonlight and shadow and time became an endless round of notch and draw and loose A wildling arrow ripped through the throat of the straw sentinel beside him but Jon Snow scarcely noticed Give me one clean shot at the Magnar of Thenn he prayed to his father’s gods The Magnar at least was a foe that he could hate Give me Styr

His fingers were growing stiff and his thumb was bleeding but still Jon notched and drew and loosed A gout of flame caught his eye and he turned to see door of the common hall afire It was only a few moments before the whole great timbered hall was burning Three-Finger Hobb and his Mole’s Town helpers were safe atop the Wall he knew but it felt like a punch in the belly all the same JON Deaf Dick yelled in his thick voice the armory They were on the roof he saw One had a torch Dick hopped up on the crenel for a better shot jerked his crossbow to his shoulder and sent a quarrel thrumming toward the torch man He missed

The archer down below him didn’t

Follard never made a sound only toppled forward headlong over the parapet It was a hundred feet to the yard below Jon heard the thump as he was peering round a straw soldier trying to see where the arrow had come from Not ten feet from Deaf Dick’s body he glimpsed a leather shield a ragged cloak a mop of thick red hair Kissed by fire he thought lucky He brought his bow up but his fingers would not part and she was gone as suddenly as she’d appeared He swiveled cursing and loosed a shaft at the men on the armory roof instead but he missed them as well

By then the east stables were afire too black smoke and wisps of burning hay pouring from the stalls When the roof collapsed a flames rose up roaring so loud they almost drowned out the warhorns of the Thenns Fifty of them were pounding up the kingsroad in tight column their shields held up above their heads Others were swarming through the vegetable garden across the flagstone yard around the old dry well Three had hacked their way through the doors of Maester Aemon’s apartments in the timber keep below the rookery and a desperate fight was going on atop the Silent Tower longswords against bronze axes None of that mattered The dance has moved on he thought

Jon hobbled across to Satin and grabbed him by the shoulder With me he shouted Together they moved to the north parapet where the King’s Tower looked down on the gate and Donal Noye’s makeshift wall of logs and barrels and sacks of corn The Thenns were there before them

They wore halfhelms and had thin bronze disks sewn to their long leather shirts Many wielded bronze axes though a few were chipped stone More had short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads that gleamed redly in the light from the burning stables They were screaming in the Old Tongue as they stormed the barricade jabbing with their spears swinging their bronze axes spilling corn and blood with equal abandon while crossbow quarrels and arrows rained down on them from the archers that Donal Noye had posted on the stair

What do we do Satin shouted

We kill them Jon shouted back a black arrow in his hand

No archer could have asked for an easier shot The Thenns had their backs to the King’s Tower as they charged the crescent clambering over bags and barrels to reach the men in black Both Jon and Satin chanced to choose the same target He had just reached the top of the barricade when an arrow sprouted from his neck and a quarrel between his shoulder blades Half a heartbeat later a longsword took him in the belly and he fell back onto the man behind him Jon reached down to his quiver and found it empty again Satin was winding back his crossbow He left him to it and went for more arrows but he hadn’t taken more than three steps before the trap slammed open three feet in front of him Bloody hell I never even heard the door break

There was no time to think or plan or shout for help Jon dropped his bow reached back over his shoulder ripped Longclaw from its sheath and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower Bronze was no match for Valyrian steel The blow sheared right through the Thenn’s helm and deep into his skull and he went crashing back down where he’d come from There were more behind him Jon knew from the shouting He fell back and called to Satin The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through his cheek He vanished too The oil Jon said Satin nodded Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they’d left beside the fire lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil and dumped it down the hole on the Thenns below The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick Jon kicked the trapdoor shut set the heavy iron kettle on top of it and gave the boy with the pretty face a hard shake Retch later Jon yelled Come

They had only been gone from the parapets for a few moments but everything below had changed A dozen black brothers and a few Mole’s Town men still stood atop the crates and barrels but the wildlings were swarming over all along the crescent pushing them back Jon saw one shove his spear up through Rast’s belly so hard he lifted him into the air Young Henly was dead and Old Henly was dying surrounded by foes He could see Easy spinning and slashing laughing like a loon his cloak flapping as he leapt from cask to cask A bronze axe caught him just below the knee and the laughter turned into a bubbling shriek

They’re breaking Satin said

No said Jon they’re broken

It happened quickly One mole fled and then another and suddenly all the villagers were throwing down their weapons and abandoning the barricade The brothers were too few to hold alone Jon watched them try and form a line to fall back in order but the Thenns washed over them with spear and axe and then they were fleeing too Dornish Dilly slipped and went down on his face and a wildling planted a spear between his shoulder blades Kegs slow and short of breath had almost reached the bottom step when a Thenn caught the end of his cloak and yanked him around… but a crossbow quarrel dropped the man before his axe could fall Got him Satin crowed as Kegs staggered to the stair and began to crawl up the steps on hands and knees

The gate is lost Donal Noye had closed and chained it but it was there for the taking the iron bars glimmering red with reflected firelight the cold black tunnel behind No one had fallen back to defend it the only safety was on top of the Wall seven hundred feet up the crooked wooden stairs

What gods do you pray to Jon asked Satin

The Seven the boy from Oldtown said

Pray then Jon told him Pray to your new gods and I’ll pray to my old ones It all turned here

With the confusion at the trapdoor Jon had forgotten to fill his quiver He limped back across the roof and did that now and picked up his bow as well The kettle had not moved from where he’d left it so it seemed as though they were safe enough for the nonce The dance has moved on and we’re watching from the gallery he thought as he hobbled back Satin was loosing quarrels at the wildlings on the steps then ducking down behind a merlon to cock the crossbow He may be pretty but he’s quick

The real battle was on the steps Noye had put spearmen on the two lowest landings but the headlong flight of the villagers had panicked them and they had joined the flight racing up toward the third landing with the Thenns killing anyone who fell behind The archers and crossbowmen on the higher landings were trying to drop shafts over their heads Jon nocked an arrow drew and loosed and was pleased when one of the wildlings went rolling down the steps The heat of the fires was making the Wall weep and the flames danced and shimmered against the ice The steps shook to the footsteps of men running for their lives

Again Jon notched and drew and loosed but there was only one of him and one of Satin and a good sixty or seventy Thenns pounding up the stairs killing as they went drunk on victory On the fourth landing three brothers in black cloaks stood shoulder to shoulder with longswords in their hands and battle was joined again briefly But there were only three and soon enough the wildling tide washed over them and their blood dripped down the steps A man is never so vulnerable in battle as when he flees Lord Eddard had told Jon once A running man is like a wounded animal to a soldier It gets his bloodlust up The archers on the fifth landing fled before the battle even reached them It was a rout a red rout

Fetch the torches Jon told Satin There were four of them stacked beside the fire their heads wrapped in oily rags There were a dozen fire arrows too The Oldtown boy thrust one torch into the fire until it was blazing brightly and brought the rest back under his arm unlit He looked frightened again as well he might Jon was frightened too

It was then that he saw Styr The Magnar was climbing up the barricade over the gutted corn sacks and smashed barrels and the bodies of friends and foe alike His bronze scale armor gleamed darkly in the firelight Styr had taken off his helm to survey the scene of his triumph and the bald earless whoreson was smiling In his hand was a long weirwood spear with an ornate bronze head When he saw the gate he pointed the spear at it and barked something in the Old Tongue to the half-dozen Thenns around him Too late Jon thought You should have led your men over the barricade you might have been able to save a few

Up above a warhorn sounded long and low Not from the top of the Wall but from the ninth landing some two hundred feet up where Donal Noye was standing

Jon notched a fire arrow to his bowstring and Satin lit it from the torch He stepped to the parapet drew aimed loosed Ribbons of flame trailed behind as the shaft sped downward and thudded into its target crackling

Not Styr The steps Or more precisely the casks and kegs and sacks that Donal Noye had piled up beneath the steps as high as the first landing the barrels of lard and lamp oil the bags of leaves and oily rags the split logs bark and wood shavings Again said Jon and Again and Again Other longbowmen were firing too from every tower top in range some sending their arrows up in high arcs to drop before the Wall When Jon ran out of fire arrows he and Satin began to light the torches and fling them from the crenels

Up above another fire was blooming The old wooden steps had drunk up oil like a sponge and Donal Noye had drenched them from the ninth landing all the way down to the seventh Jon could only hope that most of their own people had staggered up to safety before Noye threw the torches The black brothers at least had known the plan but the villagers had not

Wind and fire did the rest All Jon had to do was watch With flames below and flames above the wildlings had nowhere to go Some continued upward and died Some went downward and died Some stayed where they were They died as well Many leapt from the steps before they burned and died from the fall Twenty-odd Thenns were still huddled together between the fires when the ice cracked from the heat and the whole lower third of the stair broke off along with several tons of ice That was the last that Jon Snow saw of Styr the Magnar of Thenn The Wall defends itself he thought

Jon asked Satin to help him down to the yard His wounded leg hurt so badly that he could hardly walk even with the crutch Bring the torch he told the boy from Oldtown I need to look for someone It had been mostly Thenns on the steps Surely some of the free folk had escaped Mance’s people not the Magnar’s She might have been one So they climbed down past the bodies of the men who’d tried the trapdoor and Jon wandered through the dark with his crutch under one arm and the other around the shoulders of a boy who’d been a whore in Oldtown

The stables and the common hall had burned down to smoking cinders by then but the fire still raged along the wall climbing step by step and landing by landing From time to time they’d hear a groan and then a craaaack and another chunk would come crashing off the Wall The air was full of ash and ice crystals

He found Quort dead and Stone Thumbs dying He found some dead and dying Thenns he had never truly known He found Big Boil weak from all the blood he’d lost but still alive

He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commander’s Tower with an arrow between her breasts The ice crystals had settled over her face and in the moonlight it looked as though she wore a glittering silver mask

The arrow was black Jon saw but it was fletched with white duck feathers Not mine he told himself not one of mine But he felt as if it were

When he knelt in the snow beside her her eyes opened Jon Snow she said very softly It sounded as though the arrow had found a lung Is this a proper castle now Not just a tower

It is Jon took her hand

Good she whispered I wanted t’ see one proper castle before… before I…

You’ll see a hundred castles he promised her The battle’s done Maester Aemon will see to you He touched her hair You’re kissed by fire remember Lucky It will take more than an arrow to kill you Aemon will draw it out and patch you up and we’ll get you some milk of the poppy for the pain

She just smiled at that D’you remember that cave We should have stayed in that cave I told you so

We’ll go back to the cave he said You’re not going to die Ygritte You’re not

Oh Ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand You know nothing Jon Snow she sighed dying
