The rain was running off him His burned arm was wrapped in leaves and linen and bound tight against his chest by a crude rope sling but the older burns that marked his face glistened black and slick in the glow of their little fire Making more knights Dondarrion the intruder said in a growl I ought to kill you all over again for that

Lord Beric faced him coolly I’d hoped we’d seen the last of you Clegane How did you come to find us

It wasn’t hard You made enough bloody smoke to be seen in Oldtown

What’s become of the sentries I posted

Clegane’s mouth twitched Those two blind men Might be I killed them both What would you do if I had

Anguy strung his bow Notch was doing the same Do you wish to die so very much Sandor asked Thoros You must be mad or drunk to follow us here

Drunk on rain You didn’t leave me enough gold to buy a cup of wine you whoresons

Anguy drew an arrow We’re outlaws Outlaws steal It’s in the songs if you ask nice Tom may sing you one Be thankful we didn’t kill you

Come try it Archer I’ll take that quiver off you and shove those arrows up your freckly little arse

Anguy raised his longbow but Lord Beric lifted a hand before he could loose Why did you come here Clegane

To get back what’s mine

Your gold

What else It wasn’t for the pleasure of looking at your face Dondarrion I’ll tell you that You’re uglier than me now And a robber knight besides it seems

I gave you a note for your gold Lord Beric said calmly A promise to pay when the war’s done

I wiped my arse with your paper I want the gold

We don’t have it I sent it south with Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy grain and seed across the Mander

To feed all them whose crops you burned said Gendry

Is that the tale now Sandor Clegane laughed again As it happens that’s just what I meant to do with it Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and their poxy whelps

You’re lying said Gendry

The boy has a mouth on him I see Why believe them and not me Couldn’t be my face could it Clegane glanced at Arya You going to make her a knight too Dondarrion The first eight-year-old girl knight

I’m twelve Arya lied loudly and I could be a knight if I wanted I could have killed you too only Lem took my knife Remembering that still made her angry

Complain to Lem not me Then tuck your tail between your legs and run Do you know what dogs do to wolves

Next time I will kill you I’ll kill your brother too

No His dark eyes narrowed That you won’t He turned back to Lord Beric Say make my horse a knight He never shits in the hall and doesn’t kick more than most he deserves to be knighted Unless you meant to steal him too

Best climb on that horse and go warned Lem

I’ll go with my gold Your own god said I’m guiltless—

The Lord of Light gave you back your life declared Thoros of Myr He did not proclaim you Baelor the Blessed come again The red priest unsheathed his sword and Arya saw that Jack and Merrit had drawn as well Lord Beric still held the blade he’d used to dub Gendry Maybe this time they’ll kill him

The Hound’s mouth gave another twitch You’re no more than common thieves

Lem glowered Your lion friends ride into some village take all the food and every coin they find and call it foraging The wolves as well so why not us No one robbed you dog You just been good and foraged

Sandor Clegane looked at their faces every one as if he were trying to commit them all to memory Then he walked back out into the darkness and the pouring rain from whence he’d come with never another word The outlaws waited wondering   

I best go see what he did to our sentries Harwin took a wary look out the door before he left to make certain the Hound was not lurking just outside

How’d that bloody bastard get all that gold anyhow Lem Lemoncloak said to break the tension

Anguy shrugged He won the Hand’s tourney In King’s Landing The bowman grinned I won a fair fortune myself but then I met Dancy Jayde and Alayaya They taught me what roast swan tastes like and how to bathe in Arbor wine

Pissed it all away did you laughed Harwin

Not all I bought these boots and this excellent dagger

You ought t’have bought some land and made one o’ them roast swan girls an honest woman said Jack-Be-Lucky Raised yourself a crop o’ turnips and a crop o’ sons

Warrior defend me What a waste that would have been to turn my gold to turnips

I like turnips said Jack aggrieved I could do with some mashed turnips right now

Thoros of Myr paid no heed to the banter The Hound has lost more than a few bags of coin he mused He has lost his master and kennel as well He cannot go back to the Lannisters the Young Wolf would never have him nor would his brother be like to welcome him That gold was all he had left it seems to me

Bloody hell said Watty the Miller He’ll come murder us in our sleep for sure then

No Lord Beric had sheathed his sword Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly but not in our sleep Anguy on the morrow take the rear with Beardless Dick If you see Clegane still sniffing after us kill his horse

That’s a good horse Anguy protested

Aye said Lem It’s the bloody rider we should be killing We could use that horse

I’m with Lem Notch said Let me feather the dog a few times discourage him some

Lord Beric shook his head Clegane won his life beneath the hollow hill I will not rob him of it

My lord is wise Thoros told the others Brothers a trial by battle is a holy thing You heard me ask R’hllor to take a hand and you saw his fiery finger snap Lord Beric’s sword just as he was about to make an end of it The Lord of Light is not yet done with Joffrey’s Hound it would seem

Harwin soon returned to the brewhouse Puddingfoot was sound asleep but unharmed

Wait till I get hold of him said Lem I’ll cut him a new bunghole He could have gotten every one of us killed

No one rested very comfortably that night knowing that Sandor Clegane was out there in the dark somewhere close Arya curled up near the fire warm and snug yet sleep would not come She took out the coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her and curled her fingers around it as she lay beneath her cloak It made her feel strong to hold it remembering how she’d seen the ghost in Harrenhal She could kill with a whisper then

Jaqen was gone though He’d left her Hot Pie left me too and now Gendry is leaving Lommy had died Yoren had died Syrio Forel had died even her father had died and Jaqen had given her a stupid iron penny and vanished Valar morghulis she whispered softly tightening her fist so the hard edges of the coin dug into her palm Ser Gregor Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei Arya tried to imagine how they would look when they were dead but it was hard to bring their faces to mind The Hound she could see and his brother the Mountain and she would never forget Joffrey’s face or his mother’s    but Raff and Dunsen and Polliver were all fading and even the Tickler whose looks had been so commonplace
