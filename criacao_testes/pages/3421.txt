She was a young filly spirited and splendid Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal There was something about her that took the breath away She was grey as the winter sea with a mane like silver smoke

Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck ran her fingers through the silver of her mane Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated Silver for the silver of your hair the khal says

She’s beautiful Dany murmured

She is the pride of the khalasar Illyrio said Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal

Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle so much smaller than the ones she was used to Dany sat there uncertain for a moment No one had told her about this part What should I do she asked Illyrio

It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered Take the reins and ride You need not go far

Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups She was only a fair rider she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees

And for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid Or perhaps it was for the first time ever

The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait and the crowd parted for her every eye upon them Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying The horse broke into a trot and she smiled Dothraki scrambled to clear a path The slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded She sent it into a gallop and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way As she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path They were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then and she gave the filly her head

The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings

When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio she said Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time

The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then Dany had lost all track of time Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse a lean red stallion As the khal was saddling the horse Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver dug his fingers into her leg and said Please him sweet sister or I swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before

The fear came back to her then with her brother’s words She felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her

They rode out together as the stars came out leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind Khal Drogo spoke no word to her but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode I am the blood of the dragon she whispered aloud as she followed trying to keep her courage up I am the blood of the dragon I am the blood of the dragon The dragon was never afraid

Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers She felt as fragile as glass in his hands her limbs as weak as water She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses and when he turned to look at her she began to cry

Khal Drogo stared at her tears his face strangely empty of expression No he said He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb

You speak the Common Tongue Dany said in wonder

No he said again

Perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one word more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better Drogo touched her hair lightly sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki Dany did not understand the words yet there was warmth in the tone a tenderness she had never expected from this man

He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking up into his eyes Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone Taking her lightly under the arms he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream Then he sat on the ground facing her legs crossed beneath him their faces finally at a height No he said

Is that the only word you know she asked him

Drogo did not reply His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair one by one After a moment Dany leaned forward to help When they were done Drogo gestured She understood Slowly carefully she began to undo his braid

It took a long time All the while he sat there silently watching her When she was done he shook his head and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness oiled and gleaming She had never seen hair so long so black so thick

Then it was his turn He began to undress her

His fingers were deft and strangely tender He removed her silks one by one carefully while Dany sat unmoving silent looking at his eyes When he bared her small breasts she could not help herself She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands No Drogo said He pulled her hands away from her breasts gently but firmly then lifted her face again to make her look at him No he repeated

No she echoed back at him

He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks The night air was chilly on her bare skin She shivered and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs She was afraid of what would come next but for a while nothing happened Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed looking at her drinking in her body with his eyes

After a while he began to touch her Lightly at first then harder She could sense the fierce strength in his hands but he never hurt her He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers one by one He ran a hand gently down her leg He stroked her face tracing the curve of her ears running a finger gently around her mouth He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers He turned her around massaged her shoulders slid a knuckle down the path of her spine

It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled He circled her nipples with his thumbs pinched them between thumb and forefinger then began to pull at her very lightly at first then more insistently until her nipples stiffened and began to ache

He stopped then and drew her down onto his lap Dany was flushed and breathless her heart fluttering in her chest He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes No he said and she knew it was a question

She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs Yes she whispered as she put his finger inside her





EDDARD

The summons came in the hour before the dawn when the world was still and grey

Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill groggy from sleep to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse Up Stark he roared Up up We have matters of state to discuss

By all means Ned said Come inside Your Grace Alyn lifted the flap of the tent

No no no Robert said His breath steamed with every word The camp is full of ears Besides I want to ride out and taste this country of yours Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen Ned saw There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes dress and mount up

Robert set the pace driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him trying to keep up He called out a question as they rode but the wind blew his words away and the king did not hear him After that Ned rode in silence They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist By then the guard had fallen back a small distance safely out of earshot but still Robert would not slow

Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge and finally the king pulled up By then they were miles south of the main party Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him Gods he swore laughing it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride I swear Ned this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad He had never been a patient man Robert Baratheon That damnable wheelhouse the way it creaks and groans climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain… I promise you if that wretched thing breaks another axle I’m going to burn it and Cersei can walk

Ned laughed I will gladly light the torch for you

Good man The king clapped him on the shoulder I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going

A smile touched Ned’s lips I do believe you mean it

I do I do the king said What do you say Ned Just you and me two vagabond knights on the kingsroad our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight

Would that we could Ned said but we have duties now my liege… to the realm to our children I to my lady wife and you to your queen We are not the boys we were

You were never the boy you were Robert grumbled More’s the pity And yet there was that one time… what was her name that common girl of yours Becca No she was one of mine gods love her black hair and these sweet big eyes you could drown in them Yours was… Aleena No You told me once Was it Merryl You know the one I mean your bastard’s mother

Her name was Wylla Ned replied with cool courtesy and I would sooner not speak of her

Wylla Yes The king grinned She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor even for an hour You never told me what she looked like…

Ned’s mouth tightened in anger Nor will I Leave it be Robert for the love you say you bear me I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn in the sight of gods and men

Gods have mercy you scarcely knew Catelyn
