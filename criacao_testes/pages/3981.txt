them a twist and tie them tightly with a length of vine
making an apple-sized bundle
At the hospital room door I watch Johanna for a
moment realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasive
attitude Stripped of that as she is now theres only a slight
young woman her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awake
against the power of the drugs Terrified of what sleep will
bring I cross to her and hold out the bundle
Whats that she says hoarsely Damp edges of her
hair form little spikes over her forehead
I made it for you Something to put in your drawer I
place it in her hands Smell it
She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative
sniff Smells like home Tears flood her eyes
Thats what I was hoping You being from Seven and
all I say Remember when we met You were a tree
Well briefly
Suddenly she has my wrist in an iron grip You have
to kill him Katniss
Dont worry I resist the temptation to wrench my arm
free
Swear it On something you care about she hisses
I swear it On my life But she doesnt let go of my
arm
On your familys life she insists
On my familys life I repeat I guess my concern for
my own survival isnt compelling enough She lets go and I
rub my wrist Why do you think Im going anyway
brainless
That makes her smile a little I just needed to hear it
She presses the bundle of pine needles to her nose and
closes her eyes
The remaining days go by in a whirl After a brief
workout each morning my squads on the shooting range
full-time in training I practice mostly with a gun but they
reserve an hour a day for specialty weapons which means I
get to use my Mockingjay bow Gale his heavy militarized
one The trident Beetee designed for Finnick has a lot of
special features but the most remarkable is that he can
throw it press a button on a metal cuff on his wrist and
return it to his hand without chasing it down
Sometimes we shoot at Peacekeeper dummies to
become familiar with the weaknesses in their protective
gear The chinks in the armor so to speak If you hit flesh
youre rewarded with a burst of fake blood Our dummies
are soaked in red
Its reassuring to see just how high the overall level of
accuracy is in our group Along with Finnick and Gale the
squad includes five soldiers from 13 Jackson a middleaged
woman whos Boggss second in command looks
kind of sluggish but can hit things the rest of us cant even
see without a scope Farsighted she says Theres a pair
of sisters in their twenties named Leeg--we call them Leeg
1 and Leeg 2 for clarity--who are so similar in uniform I
cant tell them apart until I notice Leeg 1 has weird yellow
flecks in her eyes Two older guys Mitchell and Homes
never say much but can shoot the dust off your boots at fifty
yards I see other squads that are also quite good but I
dont fully understand our status until the morning Plutarch
joins us
Squad Four-Five-One you have been selected for a
special mission he begins I bite the inside of my lip
hoping against hope that its to assassinate Snow We
have numerous sharpshooters but rather a dearth of
camera crews Therefore weve handpicked the eight of
you to be what we call our Star Squad You will be the onscreen
faces of the invasion
Disappointment shock then anger run through the
group What youre saying is we wont be in actual
combat snaps Gale
You will be in combat but perhaps not always on the
front line If one can even isolate a front line in this type of
war says Plutarch
None of us wants that Finnicks remark is followed
by a general rumble of assent but I stay silent Were
going to fight
Youre going to be as useful to the war effort as
possible Plutarch says And its been decided that you
are of most value on television Just look at the effect
Katniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit Turned
the whole rebellion around Do you notice how shes the
only one not complaining Its because she understands the
power of that screen
Actually Katniss isnt complaining because she has no
intention of staying with the Star Squad but she
recognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitol before
carrying out any plan Still to be too compliant may arouse
suspicion as well
But its not all pretend is it I ask Thatd be a waste
of talent
Dont worry Plutarch tells me Youll have plenty of
real targets to hit But dont get blown up Ive got enough on
my plate without having to replace you Now get to the
Capitol and put on a good show
The morning we ship out I say good-bye to my family I
havent told them how much the Capitols defenses mirror
the weapons in the arena but my going off to war is awful
enough on its own My mother holds me tightly for a long
time I feel tears on her cheek something she suppressed
when I was slated for the Games Dont worry Ill be
