the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived but
because its vigour was overwelming
I would not own it to anybody esle -- nor do I
exactly to you Still there might have been some self+
conceit in my foolish supposition the other night I
knew that what I said in admiration might be an
opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure
but I certainly did think that the kindness of your
nature might prevent you judging an uncontrolled
tongue harshly -- which you have done -- and thinking
badly of me and wounding me this morning when I
am working hard to save your hay
Well you need not think more of that perhaps you
did not mean to be rude to me by speaking out your
mind indeed I believe you did not said the shrewd
woman in painfully innocent earnest And I thank
you for giving help here But -- -but mind you dont
speak to me again in that way or in any other unless
I speak to you
O Miss Bathsheba That is to hard
No it isnt Why is it
You will never speak to me for I shall not be
here long I am soon going back again to the miser+
able monotony of drill -- and perhaps our regiment will
be ordered out soon And yet you take away the one
little ewe-lamb of plaesure that I have in this dull life
of mine Well perhaps generosity is not a womans
most marked characteristic
When are you going from here she asked with
some interest
In a month
But how can it give you pleasure to speak to me
Can you ask Miss Everdene -- knowing as you do
 -- what my offence is based on
I you do care so much for a silly trifle of that
kind then I dont mind doing it she uncertainly and
doubtingly answered But you cant really care for a
word from me you only say so -- I think you only
say so
thats unjust -- but I wont repeat the remark I
am too
P 229
gratified to get such a mark of your friendship
at any price to cavil at the tone I do Miss Everdene
care for it You may think a man foolish to want a
mere word --  just a good morning Perhaps he is -- I
dont know But you have never been a man looking
upon a woman and that woman yourself
 Well
 Then you know nothing of what such an experience
is like -- and Heaven forbid that you ever should
Nonsense flatterer What is it like I am
interested in knowing
Put shortly it is not being able to think hear or
look in any direction except one without wretchedness
nor there without torture
 Ah sergeant it wont do -- you are pretending   she
said shaking her head  Your words are too dashing
to be true
I am not upon the honour of a soldier
But why is it so -- Of course I ask for mere pas+
time
 Because you are so distracting -- and I am so
distracted 
 You look like it
 I am indeed
 Why you only saw me the other night
 That makes no difference The lightning works in+
stantaneously I loved you then at once -- as I do now
Bathsheba surveyed him curiously from the feet
upward as high as she liked to venture her glance
which was not quite so high as his eyes
 You cannot and you dont she said demurely
There is-no such sudden feeling in people I wont
listen to you any longer Hear me I wish I knew what
oclock it is -- I am going -- I have wasted too much time
here already
The sergeant looked at his watch and told her
 What havent you a watch miss he inquired
I have not just at present -- I am about to get a
new one
No You shall be given one Yes -- you  shall
A gift Miss Everdene -- a gift
And before she knew what the young -- man was
intending a heavy gold watch was in her hand
P 230
It is an unusually good one for a man like me to
possess he quietly said That watch has a history
Press the spring and open the back
She did so
What do you see
A crest and a motto
 A coronet with five points and beneath Cedit amor
rebus -- Love yields to circumstance Its the motto
of the Earls of Severn That watch belonged to the
last lord and was given to my mothers husband a
medical man for his use till I came of age when it was
to be given to me It was all the fortune that ever I
inherited That watch has regulated imperial interests
in its time -- the stately ceremonial the courtly assigna+
