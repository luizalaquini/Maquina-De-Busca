to the limit with soldiers in their dark gray uniforms
sleeping with their heads on their packs After a couple of
days travel we disembark inside one of the mountain
tunnels leading to the Capitol and make the rest of the sixhour
trek on foot taking care to step only on a glowing
green paint line that marks safe passage to the air above
We come out in the rebel encampment a ten-block
stretch outside the train station where Peeta and I made
our previous arrivals Its already crawling with soldiers
Squad 451 is assigned a spot to pitch its tents This area
has been secured for over a week Rebels pushed out the
Peacekeepers losing hundreds of lives in the process The
Capitol forces fell back and have regrouped farther into the
city Between us lie the booby-trapped streets empty and
inviting Each one will need to be swept of pods before we
can advance
Mitchell asks about hoverplane bombings--we do feel
very naked pitched out in the open--but Boggs says its not
an issue Most of the Capitols air fleet was destroyed in 2
or during the invasion If it has any craft left its holding on to
them Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make a
last-minute escape to some presidential bunker
somewhere if needed Our own hoverplanes were
grounded after the Capitols antiaircraft missiles decimated
the first few waves This war will be battled out on the
streets with hopefully only superficial damage to the
infrastructure and a minimum of human casualties The
rebels want the Capitol just as the Capitol wanted 13
After three days much of Squad 451 risks deserting
out of boredom Cressida and her team take shots of us
firing They tell us were part of the disinformation team If
the rebels only shoot Plutarchs pods it will take the Capitol
about two minutes to realize we have the holograph So
theres a lot of time spent shattering things that dont matter
to throw them off the scent Mostly we just add to the piles
of rainbow glass thats been blown off the exteriors of the
candy-colored buildings I suspect they are intercutting this
footage with the destruction of significant Capitol targets
Once in a while it seems a real sharpshooters services are
needed Eight hands go up but Gale Finnick and I are
never chosen
Its your own fault for being so camera-ready I tell
Gale If looks could kill
I dont think they quite know what to do with the three of
us particularly me I have my Mockingjay outfit with me but
Ive only been taped in my uniform Sometimes I use a gun
sometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrows
Its as if they dont want to entirely lose the Mockingjay but
they want to downgrade my role to foot soldier Since I dont
care its amusing rather than upsetting to imagine the
arguments going on back in 13
While I outwardly express discontent about our lack of
any real participation Im busy with my own agenda Each
of us has a paper map of the Capitol The city forms an
almost perfect square Lines divide the map into smaller
squares with letters along the top and numbers down the
side to form a grid I consume this noting every intersection
and side street but its remedial stuff The commanders
here are working off Plutarchs holograph Each has a
handheld contraption called a Holo that produces images
like I saw in Command They can zoom into any area of the
grid and see what pods await them The Holos an
independent unit a glorified map really since it can neither
send nor receive signals But its far superior to my paper
version
A Holo is activated by a specific commanders voice
giving his or her name Once its working it responds to the
other voices in the squadron so if say Boggs were killed
or severely disabled someone could take over If anyone in
the squad repeats nightlock three times in a row the Holo
will explode blowing everything in a five-yard radius skyhigh
This is for security reasons in the event of capture Its
understood that we would all do this without hesitation
So what I need to do is steal Boggss activated Holo
and clear out before he notices I think it would be easier to
steal his teeth
On the fourth morning Soldier Leeg 2 hits a
mislabeled pod It doesnt unleash a swarm of muttation
gnats which the rebels are prepared for but shoots out a
sunburst of metal darts One finds her brain Shes gone
before the medics can reach her Plutarch promises a
speedy replacement
The following evening the newest member of our
squad arrives With no manacles No guards Strolling out
of the train station with his gun swinging from the strap over
his shoulder Theres shock confusion resistance but 451
is stamped on the back of Peetas hand in fresh ink Boggs
relieves him of his weapon and goes to make a call
It wont matter Peeta tells the rest of us The
president assigned me herself She decided the propos
needed some heating up
Maybe they do But if Coin sent Peeta here shes
decided something else as well That Im of more use to her
dead than alive
PART III
THE ASSASSIN
19
Ive never really seen Boggs angry before Not when
Ive disobeyed his orders or puked on him not even when
Gale broke his nose But hes angry when he returns from
