both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the
stranger that sojourneth among them

1530 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born
in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the LORD and that
soul shall be cut off from among his people

1531 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD and hath broken
his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity
shall be upon him

1532 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they
found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day

1533 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
and Aaron and unto all the congregation

1534 And they put him in ward because it was not declared what
should be done to him

1535 And the LORD said unto Moses The man shall be surely put to
death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the
camp

1536 And all the congregation brought him without the camp and
stoned him with stones and he died as the LORD commanded Moses

1537 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 1538 Speak unto the
children of Israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the
borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they
put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue 1539 And it
shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember
all the commandments of the LORD and do them and that ye seek not
after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a
whoring 1540 That ye may remember and do all my commandments and
be holy unto your God

1541 I am the LORD your God which brought you out of the land of
Egypt to be your God I am the LORD your God

161 Now Korah the son of Izhar the son of Kohath the son of Levi
and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab and On the son of Peleth
sons of Reuben took men 162 And they rose up before Moses with
certain of the children of Israel two hundred and fifty princes of
the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown 163 And they
gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said
unto them Ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are
holy every one of them and the LORD is among them wherefore then
lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD  164 And
when Moses heard it he fell upon his face 165 And he spake unto
Korah and unto all his company saying Even to morrow the LORD will
shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near
unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto
him

166 This do Take you censers Korah and all his company 167 And
put fire therein and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow
and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose he shall be
holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of Levi

168 And Moses said unto Korah Hear I pray you ye sons of Levi
169 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel
hath separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near
to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD and to
stand before the congregation to minister unto them  1610 And he
hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of Levi
with thee and seek ye the priesthood also  1611 For which cause
both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD
and what is Aaron that ye murmur against him  1612 And Moses sent
to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab which said We will not
come up 1613 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of
a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness
except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us  1614 Moreover
thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey
or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the
eyes of these men we will not come up

1615 And Moses was very wroth and said unto the LORD Respect not
thou their offering I have not taken one ass from them neither have
I hurt one of them

1616 And Moses said unto Korah Be thou and all thy company before
the LORD thou and they and Aaron to morrow 1617 And take every
man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the LORD
every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and
Aaron each of you his censer

1618 And they took every man his censer and put fire in them and
laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation with Moses and Aaron

1619 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the LORD
appeared unto all the congregation

1620 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying 1621
Separate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume
them in a moment

1622 And they fell upon their faces and said O God the God of the
