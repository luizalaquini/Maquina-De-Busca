The gods are just thought Sansa Robb had died at a wedding feast as well It was Robb she wept for Him and Margaery Poor Margaery twice wed and twice widowed Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve pushed down the gown and wriggled out of it She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak shook out the clothing she had hidden there Dress warmly Ser Dontos had told her and dress dark She had no blacks so she chose a dress of thick brown wool The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls though The cloak will cover them The cloak was a deep green with a large hood She slipped the dress over her head and donned the cloak though she left the hood down for the moment There were shoes as well simple and sturdy with flat heels and square toes The gods heard my prayer she thought She felt so numb and dreamy My skin has turned to porcelain to ivory to steel Her hands moved stiffly awkwardly as if they had never let down her hair before For a moment she wished Shae was there to help her with the net

When she pulled it free her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders The web of spun silver hung from her fingers the fine metal glimmering softly the stones black in the moonlight Black amethysts from Asshai One of them was missing Sansa lifted the net for a closer look There was a dark smudge in the silver socket where the stone had fallen out

A sudden terror filled her Her heart hammered against her ribs and for an instant she held her breath Why am I so scared it’s only an amethyst a black amethyst from Asshai no more than that It must have been loose in the setting that’s all It was loose and it fell out and now it’s lying somewhere in the throne room or in the yard unless…

Ser Dontos had said the hair net was magic that it would take her home He told her she must wear it tonight at Joffrey’s wedding feast The silver wire stretched tight across her knuckles Her thumb rubbed back and forth against the hole where the stone had been She tried to stop but her fingers were not her own Her thumb was drawn to the hole as the tongue is drawn to a missing tooth What kind of magic The king was dead the cruel king who had been her gallant prince a thousand years ago If Dontos had lied about the hair net had he lied about the rest as well What if he never comes What if there is no ship no boat on the river no escape What would happen to her then

She heard a faint rustle of leaves and stuffed the silver hair net down deep in the pocket of her cloak Who’s there she cried Who is it The godswood was dim and dark and the bells were ringing Joff into his grave

Me He staggered out from under the trees reeling drunk He caught her arm to steady himself Sweet Jonquil I’ve come Your Florian has come don’t be afraid

Sansa pulled away from his touch You said I must wear the hair net The silver net with… what sort of stones are those

Amethysts Black amethysts from Asshai my lady

They’re no amethysts Are they Are they You lied

Black amethysts he swore There was magic in them

There was murder in them

Softly my lady softly No murder He choked on his pigeon pie Dontos chortled Oh tasty tasty pie Silver and stones that’s all it was silver and stone and magic

The bells were tolling and the wind was making a noise like he had made as he tried to suck a breath of air You poisoned him You did You took a stone from my hair…

Hush you’ll be the death of us I did nothing Come we must away they’ll search for you Your husband’s been arrested

Tyrion she said shocked

Do you have another husband The Imp the dwarf uncle she thinks he did it He grabbed her hand and pulled at her This way we must away quickly now have no fear

Sansa followed unresisting I could never abide the weeping of women Joff once said but his mother was the only woman weeping now In Old Nan’s stories the grumkins crafted magic things that could make a wish come true Did I wish him dead she wondered before she remembered that she was too old to believe in grumkins Tyrion poisoned him Her dwarf husband had hated his nephew she knew Could he truly have killed him Did he know about my hair net about the black amethysts He brought Joff wine How could you make someone choke by putting an amethyst in their wine If Tyrion did it they will think I was part of it as well she realized with a start of fear How not They were man and wife and Joff had killed her father and mocked her with her brother’s death One flesh one heart one soul

Be quiet now my sweetling said Dontos Outside the godswood we must make no sound Pull up your hood and hide your face Sansa nodded and did as he said

He was so drunk that sometimes Sansa had to lend him her arm to keep him from falling The bells were ringing out across the city more and more of them joining in She kept her head down and stayed in the shadows close behind Dontos While descending the serpentine steps he stumbled to his knees and retched My poor Florian she thought as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve Dress dark he’d said yet under his brown hooded cloak he was wearing his old surcoat red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns the arms of House Hollard Why are you wearing your surcoat Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again he… oh… Nothing Joff had decreed mattered any longer

I wanted to be a knight For this at least Dontos lurched back to his feet and took her arm Come Be quiet now no questions

They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper They were inside a long gallery Along the walls stood empty suits of armor dark and dusty their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs As they hurried past the taper’s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist The hollow knights are turning into dragons she thought

One more stair took them to an oaken door banded with iron Be strong now my Jonquil you are almost there When Dontos lifted the bar and pulled open the door Sansa felt a cold breeze on her face She passed through twelve feet of wall and then she was outside the castle standing at the top of the cliff Below was the river above the sky and one was as black as the other

We must climb down Ser Dontos said At the bottom a man is waiting to row us out to the ship

I’ll fall Bran had fallen and he had loved to climb

No you won’t There’s a sort of ladder a secret ladder carved into the stone Here you can feel it my lady He got down on his knees with her and made her lean over the edge of the cliff groping with her fingers until she found the handhold cut into the face of the bluff Almost as good as rungs

Even so it was a long way down I can’t

You must
