His quarry met him sword in hand He was tall and spare wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel but he’d lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face but the tall man slammed it aside Dwarf he screamed Die He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around him hacking at his head and shoulders Steel rang on steel and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was Where in the seven hells was Bronn Die the man grunted chopping at him savagely Tyrion barely got his shield up in time and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow The shattered pieces fell away from his arm Die the swordsman bellowed shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the temple so hard his head rang The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the steel The tall man grinned… until Tyrion’s destrier bit quick as a snake laying his cheek bare to the bone Then he screamed Tyrion buried his axe in his head You die he told him and he did

As he wrenched the blade free he heard a shout ‘Eddard a voice rang out For Eddard and Winterfell The knight came thundering down on him swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around his head Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for Bronn His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint His axe was gone as fast as that He clawed for his sword but the morningstar was circling again coming at his face A sickening crunch and he was falling He did not recall hitting the ground but when he looked up there was only sky above him He rolled onto his side and tried to find his feet but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed The knight who had felled him drew up above him Tyrion the Imp he boomed down You are mine Do you yield Lannister

Yes Tyrion thought but the word caught in his throat He made a croaking sound and fought his way to his knees fumbling for a weapon His sword his dirk anything…

Do you yield The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse Man and horse both seemed immense The spiked ball swung in a lazy circle Tyrion’s hands were numb his vision blurred his scabbard empty Yield or die the knight declared his flail whirling faster and faster

Tyrion lurched to his feet driving his head into the horse’s belly The animal gave a hideous scream and reared It tried to twist away from the agony a shower of blood and viscera poured down over Tyrion’s face and the horse fell like an avalanche The next he knew his visor was packed with mud and something was crushing his foot He wriggled free his throat so tight he could scarce talk …yield… he managed to croak faintly

Yes a voice moaned thick with pain

Tyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again The horse had fallen away from him onto its rider The knight’s leg was trapped the arm he’d used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle Yield he repeated Fumbling at his belt with his good hand he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion’s feet I yield my lord

Dazed the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade Pain hammered through his elbow when he moved his arm The battle seemed to have moved beyond him No one remained on his part of the field save a large number of corpses Ravens were already circling and landing to feed He saw that Ser Kevan had brought up his center in support of the van his huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners back against the hills They were struggling on the slopes pikes thrusting against another wall of shields these oval and reinforced with iron studs As he watched the air filled with arrows again and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire I believe you are losing ser he told the knight under the horse The man made no reply

The sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl though he could scarcely lift the sword he held for the agony in his elbow Brorm reined up and looked down on him

Small use you turned out to be Tyrion told him

It would seem you did well enough on your own Bronn answered You’ve lost the spike off your helm though

Tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm The spike had snapped off clean I haven’t lost it I know just where it is Do you see my horse

By the time they found it the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin’s reserve came sweeping up along the river Tyrion watched his father fly past the crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across the field Five hundred knights surrounded him sunlight flashing off the points of their lances The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their charge

With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter He and Bronn went looking for his men Many he found among the dead Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood his arm gone at the elbow a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him Shagga was slumped beneath a tree riddled with arrows Conn’s head in his lap Tyrion thought they were both dead but as he dismounted Shagga opened his eyes and said They have killed Conn son of Coratt Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast where the spear thrust had killed him When Bronn pulled Shagga to his feet the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time He plucked them out one by one cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga and showed them four ears she had taken Timett they discovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men Of the three hundred clansmen who had ridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister perhaps half had survived

He left the living to look after the dead sent Bronn to take charge of his captive knight and went alone in search of his father Lord Tywin was seated by the river sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his breastplate A fine victory Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion Your wild men fought well

His father’s eyes were on him pale green flecked with gold so cool they gave Tyrion a chill Did that surprise you Father he asked Did it upset your plans We were supposed to be butchered were we not

Lord Tywin drained his cup his face expressionless I put the least disciplined men on the left yes I anticipated that they would break Robb Stark is a green boy more like to be brave than wise I’d hoped that if he saw our left collapse he might plunge into the gap eager for a rout Once he was fully committed Ser Kevan’s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve

And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage yet keep me ignorant of your plans

A feigned rout is less convincing his father said and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages

A pity my savages ruined your dance Tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet and let it fall to the ground wincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm

The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years Lord Tywin admitted but a victory is a victory You appear to be wounded

Tyrion’s right arm was soaked with blood Good of you to notice Father he said through clenched teeth Might I trouble you to send for your maesters Unless you relish the notion of having a one-armed dwarf for a son…

An urgent shout of Lord Tywin turned his father’s head before he could reply Tywin Lannister rose to his feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his courser The horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth Ser Addam dropped to one knee a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate My liege we have taken some of their commanders Lord Cerwyn Ser Wylis Manderly Harrion Karstark four Freys Lord Hornwood is dead and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us

And the boy Lord Tywin asked

Ser Addam hesitated The Stark boy was not with them my lord They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse riding hard for Riverrun

A green boy Tyrion remembered more like to be brave than wise He would have laughed if he hadn’t hurt so much





CATELYN

The woods were full of whispers

Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley Beneath the trees warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist leafy ground while men made nervous jests in hushed voices Now and again she heard the chink of spears the faint metallic slither of chain mail but even those sounds were muffled

It should not be long now my lady Hallis Mollen said He had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come it was his right as Winterfell’s captain of guards and Robb had not refused it to him She had thirty men around her charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if the fighting went against them Robb had wanted fifty Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough that he would need every sword for the fight They made their peace at thirty neither happy with it

It will come when it comes Catelyn told him When it came she knew it would mean death Hal’s death perhaps… or hers or Robb’s No one was safe No life was certain Catelyn was content to wait to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook to feel the warm wind in her hair

She was no stranger to waiting after all Her men had always made her wait Watch for me little cat her father would always tell her when he rode off to court or fair or battle And she would standing patiently on the battlements of Riverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by He did not always come when he said he would and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding trotting along the rivershore toward the landing Did you watch for me he’d ask when he bent to bug her Did you little cat

Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well I shall not be long my lady he had vowed We will be wed on my return Yet when the day came at last it was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the sept

Ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with promises on his lips At least he had left her with more than words he had given her a son Nine moons had waxed and waned and Robb had been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south She had brought him forth in blood and pain not knowing whether Ned would ever see him Her son He had been so small…

And now it was for Robb that she waited… for Robb and for Jaime Lannister the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all The Kingslayer is restless and quick to anger her uncle Brynden had told Robb And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said

If Robb was frightened he gave no sign of it Catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men touching one on the shoulder sharing a jest with another helping a third to gentle an anxious horse His armor clinked softly when he moved Only his head was bare Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair so like her own and wondered when her son had grown so big Fifteen and near as tall as she was

Let him grow taller she asked the gods Let him know sixteen and twenty and fifty Let him grow as tall as his father and hold his own son in his arms Please please please As she watched him this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels all she could see was the babe they had laid at her breast at Riverrun so long ago

The night was warm but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her shiver Where are they she wondered Could her uncle have been wrong So much rested on the truth of what he had told them Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men and sent them ahead to screen his march Jaime does not know Ser Brynden said when he rode back I’ll stake my life on that No bird has reached him my archers have seen to that We’ve seen a few of his outriders but those that saw us did not live to tell of it He ought to have sent out more He does not know

How large is his host her son asked

Twelve thousand foot scattered around the castle in three separate camps with the rivers between her uncle said with the craggy smile she remembered so well There is no other way to besiege Riverrun yet still that will be their undoing Two or three thousand horse

The Kingslayer has us three to one said Galbart Glover

‘True enough Ser Brynden said yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks

Yes Robb asked

Patience

Their host was greater than it had been when they left the Twins Lord Jason Mallister had brought his power out from Seagard to join them as they swept around the headwaters of the Blue Fork and galloped south and others had crept forth as well hedge knights and small lords and masterless men-at-arms who had fled north when her brother Edmure’s army was shattered beneath the walls of Riverrun They had driven their horses as hard as they dared to reach this place before Jaime Lannister had word of their coming and now the hour was at hand

Catelyn watched her son mount up Olyvar Frey held his horse for him Lord Walder’s son two years older than Robb and ten years younger and more anxious He strapped Robb’s shield in place and handed up his helm When he lowered it over the face she loved so well a tall young knight sat on his grey stallion where her son had been It was dark among the trees where the moon did not reach When Robb turned his head to look at her she could see only black inside his visor I must ride down the line Mother he told her Father says you should let the men see you before a battle

‘Go then she said Let them see you

‘It will give them courage Robb said
