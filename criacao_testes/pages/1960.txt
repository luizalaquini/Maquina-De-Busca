It is not necessary to consider varying loudness on a prosodic basis
in most speech synthesis systems
pp
The above examples show how prosodic features have segmental influences
as well
The converse is also true  some segmental features have a prosodic effect
The last chapter described how stress is associated with increased aspiration
of syllable-initial unvoiced stops  Furthermore stressed syllables
are articulated with greater effort than unstressed ones and hence the formant
transitions are more likely to attain their target values
under circumstances which would otherwise cause them to fall short
In unstressed syllables extreme vowels like
ul
ee aa uuc

tend to more centralized sounds
like
ul
i uh u
respectively
Although all British English vowels
ul
can
appear in unstressed syllables they often become reduced into a
centralized form
Consider the following examples
LB
NI
diplomat	 
ul
d i p l uh m aa t
NI
diplomacy	 
ul
d i p l uh u m uh s i
NI
diplomatic	 
ul
d i p l uh m aa t i k
LE
The vowel of the second syllable is reduced to
ul
uh
in diplomat and diplomatic whereas the root form diploma and also
diplomacy has a diphthong
c
ul
uh uc

there  The third syllable has an
ul
aa
in diplomat and diplomatic which is reduced to
ul
uh
in diplomacy
In these cases the reduction is shown explicitly in the phonetic transcription
but in more marginal examples where it is less extreme it will not be
pp
I have tried to emphasize in previous chapters that prosodic features are
important in speech synthesis
There is something very basic about them
Rhythm is an essential part of all bodily activity em of breathing
walking working and playing em and so it pervades speech too
Mothers and babies communicate effectively using intonation alone
Some experiments have indicated that the language environment of
an infant affects his babbling at an early age before he has effective
segmental control
There is no doubt that tone of voice plays a large part in human
communication
pp
However early attempts at synthesis did not pay too
much attention to prosodics perhaps because it was thought sufficient to get the
meaning across by providing clear segmentals
As artificial speech grows more widespread however it is becoming
apparent that its acceptability to users and hence its ultimate
success depends to a large extent on incorporating natural-sounding
prosodics  Flat arhythmic speech may be comprehensible in short stretches
but it strains the concentration in significant discourse and people
are not usually prepared to listen to it
Unfortunately current commercial speech output systems do not really tackle
prosodic questions which indicates our present rather inadequate
state of knowledge
pp
The importance of prosodics for automatic speech
ul
recognition
is beginning to be appreciated too  Some research projects
have attended to the automatic identification of points of stress
in the hope that the clear articulation of stressed syllables can be used
to provide anchor points in an unknown utterance for example see Lea
