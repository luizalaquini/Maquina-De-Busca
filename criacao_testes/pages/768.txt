The ironmen have my castle and now the Lannisters hold my brother Galbart Glover said in a voice thick with despair Robett Glover had survived the battle but had been captured near the kingsroad not long after

Not for long her son promised I will offer them Martyn Lannister in exchange Lord Tywin will have to accept for his brother’s sake Martyn was Ser Kevan’s son a twin to the Willem that Lord Karstark had butchered Those murders still haunted her son Catelyn knew He had tripled the guard around Martyn but still feared for his safety

I should have traded the Kingslayer for Sansa when you first urged it Robb said as they walked the gallery If I’d offered to wed her to the Knight of Flowers the Tyrells might be ours instead of Joffrey’s I should have thought of that

Your mind was on your battles and rightly so Even a king cannot think of everything

Battles muttered Robb as he led her out beneath the trees I have won every battle yet somehow I’m losing the war He looked up as if the answer might be written on the sky The ironmen hold Winterfell and Moat Cailin too Father’s dead and Bran and Rickon maybe Arya And now your father too

She could not let him despair She knew the taste of that draught too well herself My father has been dying for a long time You could not have changed that You have made mistakes Robb but what king has not Ned would have been proud of you

Mother there is something you must know

Catelyn’s heart skipped a beat This is something he hates Something he dreads to tell me All she could think of was Brienne and her mission Is it the Kingslayer

No It’s Sansa

She’s dead Catelyn thought at once Brienne failed Jaime is dead and Cersei has killed my sweet girl in retribution For a moment she could barely speak Is… is she gone Robb

Gone He looked startled Dead Oh Mother no not that they haven’t harmed her not that way only… a bird came last night but I couldn’t bring myself to tell you not until your father was sent to his rest Robb took her hand They married her to Tyrion Lannister

Catelyn’s fingers clutched at his The Imp

Yes

He swore to trade her for his brother she said numbly Sansa and Arya both We would have them back if we returned his precious Jaime he swore it before the whole court How could he marry her after saying that in sight of gods and men

He’s the Kingslayer’s brother Oathbreaking runs in their blood Robb’s fingers brushed the pommel of his sword If I could I’d take his ugly head off Sansa would be a widow then and free There’s no other way that I can see They made her speak the vows before a septon and don a crimson cloak

Catelyn remembered the twisted little man she had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie I should have let Lysa push him out her Moon Door My poor sweet Sansa… why would anyone do this to her

For Winterfell Robb said at once With Bran and Rickon dead Sansa is my heir If anything should happen to me…

She clutched tight at his hand Nothing will happen to you Nothing I could not stand it They took Ned and your sweet brothers Sansa is married Arya is lost my father’s dead… if anything befell you I would go mad Robb You are all I have left You are all the north has left

I am not dead yet Mother

Suddenly Catelyn was full of dread Wars need not be fought until the last drop of blood Even she could hear the desperation in her voice You would not be the first king to bend the knee nor even the first Stark

His mouth tightened No Never

There is no shame in it Balon Greyjoy bent the knee to Robert when his rebellion failed Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires

Did Aegon kill King Torrhen’s father He pulled his hand from hers Never I said

He is playing the boy now not the king The Lannisters do not need the north They will require homage and hostages no more… and the Imp will keep Sansa no matter what we do so they have their hostage The ironmen will prove a more implacable enemy I promise you To have any hope of holding the north the Greyjoys must leave no single sprig of House Stark alive to dispute their right Theon’s murdered Bran and Rickon so now all they need do is kill you… and Jeyne yes Do you think Lord Balon can afford to let her live to bear you heirs

Robb’s face was cold Is that why you freed the Kingslayer To make a peace with the Lannisters

I freed Jaime for Sansa’s sake… and Arya’s if she still lives You know that But if I nurtured some hope of buying peace as well was that so ill

Yes he said The Lannisters killed my father
