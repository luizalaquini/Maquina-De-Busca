make no mention of the name of other gods neither let it be heard out
of thy mouth

2314 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year

2315 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread thou shalt eat
unleavened bread seven days as I commanded thee in the time
appointed of the month Abib for in it thou camest out from Egypt and
none shall appear before me empty 2316 And the feast of harvest
the firstfruits of thy labours which thou hast sown in the field and
the feast of ingathering which is in the end of the year when thou
hast gathered in thy labours out of the field

2317 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the
LORD God

2318 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
bread neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning

2319 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
the house of the LORD thy God Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mothers milk

2320 Behold I send an Angel before thee to keep thee in the way
and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared

2321 Beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will
not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him

2322 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I
speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary
unto thine adversaries

2323 For mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the
Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites
the Hivites and the Jebusites and I will cut them off

2324 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do
after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite
break down their images

2325 And ye shall serve the LORD your God and he shall bless thy
bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of
thee

2326 There shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy
land the number of thy days I will fulfil

2327 I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people
to whom thou shalt come and I will make all thine enemies turn their
backs unto thee

2328 And I will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the
Hivite the Canaanite and the Hittite from before thee

2329 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the
land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against
thee

2330 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee
until thou be increased and inherit the land

2331 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of
the Philistines and from the desert unto the river for I will
deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt
drive them out before thee

2332 Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods

2333 They shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin
against me for if thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare
unto thee

241 And he said unto Moses Come up unto the LORD thou and Aaron
Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel and worship ye
afar off

242 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD but they shall not come
nigh neither shall the people go up with him

243 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and
all the judgments and all the people answered with one voice and
said All the words which the LORD hath said will we do

244 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD and rose up early in
the morning and builded an altar under the hill and twelve pillars
according to the twelve tribes of Israel

245 And he sent young men of the children of Israel which offered
burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD

246 And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basons and half
of the blood he sprinkled on the altar

247 And he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of
the people and they said All that the LORD hath said will we do and
be obedient

248 And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and
said Behold the blood of the covenant which the LORD hath made with
