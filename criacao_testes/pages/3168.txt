God command that these stones be made bread

44 But he answered and said It is written Man shall not live by
bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God

45 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him
on a pinnacle of the temple 46 And saith unto him If thou be the
Son of God cast thyself down for it is written He shall give his
angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee
up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone

47 Jesus said unto him It is written again Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God

48 Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain
and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
49 And saith unto him All these things will I give thee if thou
wilt fall down and worship me

410 Then saith Jesus unto him Get thee hence Satan for it is
written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
serve

411 Then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and
ministered unto him

412 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he
departed into Galilee 413 And leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in
Capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of Zabulon and
Nephthalim 414 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias
the prophet saying 415 The land of Zabulon and the land of
Nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond Jordan Galilee of the
Gentiles 416 The people which sat in darkness saw great light and
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
up

417 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say Repent for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand

418 And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren Simon
called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for
they were fishers

419 And he saith unto them Follow me and I will make you fishers of
men

420 And they straightway left their nets and followed him

421 And going on from thence he saw other two brethren James the
son of Zebedee and John his brother in a ship with Zebedee their
father mending their nets and he called them

422 And they immediately left the ship and their father and followed
him

423 And Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of
sickness and all manner of disease among the people

424 And his fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him
all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and
those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick
and those that had the palsy and he healed them

425 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee
and from Decapolis and from Jerusalem and from Judaea and from
beyond Jordan

51 And seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he
was set his disciples came unto him 52 And he opened his mouth and
taught them saying 53 Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven

54 Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted

55 Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth

56 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness
for they shall be filled

57 Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy

58 Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God

59 Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children
of God

510 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

511 Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake

512 Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in
heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you

513 Ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his
savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for
nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
