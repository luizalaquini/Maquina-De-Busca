Let him What do we care

Bloody fool thought Tyrion Sweet sister he explained patiently offend Tyrell and you offend Redwyne Tarly Rowan and Hightower as well and perhaps start them wondering whether Robb Stark might not be more accommodating of their desires

I will not have the rose and the direwolf in bed together declared Lord Tywin We must forestall him

How asked Cersei

By marriage Yours to begin with

It came so suddenly that Cersei could only stare for a moment Then her cheeks reddened as if she had been slapped No Not again I will not

Your Grace said Ser Kevan courteously you are a young woman still fair and fertile Surely you cannot wish to spend the rest of your days alone And a new marriage would put to rest this talk of incest for good and all

So long as you remain unwed you allow Stannis to spread his disgusting slander Lord Tywin told his daughter You must have a new husband in your bed to father children on you

Three children is quite sufficient I am Queen of the Seven Kingdoms not a brood mare The Queen Regent

You are my daughter and will do as I command

She stood I will not sit here and listen to this—

You will if you wish to have any voice in the choice of your next husband Lord Tywin said calmly

When she hesitated then sat Tyrion knew she was lost despite her loud declaration of I will not marry again

You will marry and you will breed Every child you birth makes Stannis more a liar Their father’s eyes seemed to pin her to her chair Mace Tyrell Paxter Redwyne and Doran Martell are wed to younger women likely to outlive them Balon Greyjoy’s wife is elderly and failing but such a match would commit us to an alliance with the Iron Islands and I am still uncertain whether that would be our wisest course

No Cersei said from between white lips No no no

Tyrion could not quite suppress the grin that came to his lips at the thought of packing his sister off to Pyke Just when I was about to give up praying some sweet god gives me this

Lord Tywin went on Oberyn Martell might suit but the Tyrells would take that very ill So we must look to the sons I assume you do not object to wedding a man younger than yourself

I object to wedding any—

I have considered the Redwyne twins Theon Greyjoy Quentyn Martell and a number of others But our alliance with Highgarden was the sword that broke Stannis It should be tempered and made stronger Ser Loras has taken the white and Ser Garlan is wed to one of the Fossoways but there remains the eldest son the boy they scheme to wed to Sansa Stark

Willas Tyrell Tyrion was taking a wicked pleasure in Cersei’s helpless fury That would be the cripple he said

Their father chilled him with a look Willas is heir to Highgarden and by all reports a mild and courtly young man fond of reading books and looking at the stars He has a passion for breeding animals as well and owns the finest hounds hawks and horses in the Seven Kingdoms

A perfect match mused Tyrion Cersei also has a passion for breeding He pitied poor Willas Tyrell and did not know whether he wanted to laugh at his sister or weep for her

The Tyrell heir would be my choice Lord Tywin concluded but if you would prefer another I will hear your reasons

That is so very kind of you Father Cersei said with icy courtesy It is such a difficult choice you give me Who would I sooner take to bed the old squid or the crippled dog boy I shall need a few days to consider Do I have your leave to go

You are the queen Tyrion wanted to tell her He ought to be begging leave of you

Go their father said We shall talk again after you have composed yourself Remember your duty

Cersei swept stiffly from the room her rage plain to see Yet in the end she will do as Father bid She had proved that with Robert Though there is Jaime to consider Their brother had been much younger when Cersei wed the first time he might not acquiesce to a second marriage quite so easily The unfortunate Willas Tyrell was like to contract a sudden fatal case of sword-through-bowels which could rather sour the alliance between Highgarden and Casterly Rock I should say something but what Pardon me Father but it’s our brother she wants to marry
