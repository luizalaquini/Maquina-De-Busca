He dreamt an old dream of three knights in white cloaks and a tower long fallen and Lyanna in her bed of blood

In the dream his friends rode with him as they had in life Proud Martyn Cassel Jory’s father faithful Theo Wull Ethan Glover who had been Brandon’s squire Ser Mark Ryswell soft of speech and gentle of heart the crannogman Howland Reed Lord Dustin on his great red stallion Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once but the years leech at a man’s memories even those he has vowed never to forget In the dream they were only shadows grey wraiths on horses made of mist

They were seven facing three In the dream as it had been in life Yet these were no ordinary three They waited before the round tower the red mountains of Dorne at their backs their white cloaks blowing in the wind And these were no shadows their faces burned clear even now Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning had a sad smile on his lips The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee sharpening his blade with a whetstone Across his white-enameled helm the black bat of his House spread its wings Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower the White Bull Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

I looked for you on the Trident Ned said to them

We were not there Ser Gerold answered

Woe to the Usurper if we had been said Ser Oswell

When King’s Landing fell Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword and I wondered where you were

Far away Ser Gerold said or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne and our false brother would burn in seven hells

I came down on Storm’s End to lift the siege Ned told them and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty I was certain you would be among them

Our knees do not bend easily said Ser Arthur Dayne

Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone with your queen and Prince Viserys I thought you might have sailed with him

Ser Willem is a good man and true said Ser Oswell

But not of the Kingsguard Ser Gerold pointed out The Kingsguard does not flee

Then or now said Ser Arthur He donned his helm

We swore a vow explained old Ser Gerold

Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him with shadow swords in hand They were seven against three

And now it begins said Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands The blade was pale as milkglass alive with light

No Ned said with sadness in his voice Now it ends As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow he could hear Lyanna screaming Eddard she called A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky as blue as the eyes of death

Lord Eddard Lyanna called again

I promise he whispered Lya I promise…

Lord Eddard a man echoed from the dark

Groaning Eddard Stark opened his eyes Moonlight streamed through the tall windows of the Tower of the Hand

Lord Eddard A shadow stood over the bed

How… how long The sheets were tangled his leg splinted and plastered A dull throb of pain shot up his side

Six days and seven nights The voice was Vayon Poole’s The steward held a cup to Ned’s lips Drink my lord

What…

Only water Maester Pycelle said you would be thirsty
