Another nephew The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile house

Cousin Ser Brynden corrected Brother to Lord Tywin’s late wife so twice related An old man and a bit of a dullard but he has a son Ser Daven who is more formidable

Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field

We have some time yet before we must face them This lot will be sellswords freeriders and green boys from the stews of Lannisport Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle… and make no mistake Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer He will not rush in heedless He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal

Unless… said Catelyn

Yes Ser Brynden prompted

Unless he must leave Harrenhal she said to face some other threat

Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully Lord Renly

King Renly If she would ask help from the man she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself

Perhaps The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile He’ll want something though

He’ll want what kings always want she said Homage





TYRION

Janos Slynt was a butcher’s son and he laughed like a man chopping meat More wine Tyrion asked him

I should not object Lord Janos said holding out his cup He was built like a keg and had a similar capacity I should not object at all That’s a fine red From the Arbor

Dornish Tyrion gestured and his serving man poured But for the servants he and Lord Janos were alone in the Small Hall at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness Quite the find Dornish wines are not often so rich

Rich said the big frog-faced man taking a healthy gulp He was not a man for sipping Janos Slynt Tyrion had made note of that at once Yes rich that’s the very word I was searching for the very word You have a gift for words Lord Tyrion if I might say so And you tell a droll tale Droll yes

I’m pleased you think so… but I’m not a lord as you are A simple Tyrion will suffice for me Lord Janos

As you wish He took another swallow dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear its point enameled in dark red And he was well and truly drunk

Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine but he was very full The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service This evening they had supped on oxtail soup summer greens tossed with pecans grapes red fennel and crumbled cheese hot crab pie spiced squash and quails drowned in butter Each dish had come with its own wine Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal Tyrion said

For a certainty Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service what do you say

Wars have been fought over less he said and they both had a good long laugh You’re a bold man to take Harrenhal for your seat Such a grim place and huge… costly to maintain And some say cursed as well

Should I fear a pile of stone He hooted at the notion A bold man you said You must be bold to rise As I have To Harrenhal yes And why not You know You are a bold man too I sense Small mayhap but bold

You are too kind More wine

No No truly I… oh gods be damned yes Why not A bold man drinks his fill

Truly Tyrion filled Lord Slynt’s cup to the brim I have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch
