LORD in walking in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he did
to make Israel to sin

1620 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his treason that he
wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel  1621 Then were the people of Israel divided into
two parts half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath to
make him king and half followed Omri

1622 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
that followed Tibni the son of Ginath so Tibni died and Omri
reigned

1623 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
reign over Israel twelve years six years reigned he in Tirzah

1624 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which
he built after the name of Shemer owner of the hill Samaria

1625 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD and did worse
than all that were before him

1626 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and
in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin to provoke the LORD God of
Israel to anger with their vanities

1627 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might
that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of Israel  1628 So Omri slept with his fathers and was
buried in Samaria and Ahab his son reigned in his stead

1629 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel and Ahab the son of Omri
reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years

1630 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
all that were before him

1631 And it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to
walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat that he took to wife
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians and went and
served Baal and worshipped him

1632 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which
he had built in Samaria

1633 And Ahab made a grove and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him

1634 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho he laid the
foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest son Segub according to the word of the LORD
which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun

171 And Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead
said unto Ahab As the LORD God of Israel liveth before whom I stand
there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word

172 And the word of the LORD came unto him saying 173 Get thee
hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook Cherith
that is before Jordan

174 And it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and I have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there

175 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD for he
went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan

176 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and
bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook

177 And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up
because there had been no rain in the land

178 And the word of the LORD came unto him saying 179 Arise get
thee to Zarephath which belongeth to Zidon and dwell there behold
I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee

1710 So he arose and went to Zarephath And when he came to the gate
of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks
and he called to her and said Fetch me I pray thee a little water
in a vessel that I may drink

1711 And as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said
Bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand

1712 And she said As the LORD thy God liveth I have not a cake but
an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and
behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for
me and my son that we may eat it and die

1713 And Elijah said unto her Fear not go and do as thou hast said
but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and
after make for thee and for thy son

1714 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel The barrel of meal shall
not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the
LORD sendeth rain upon the earth
