From a pragmatic point of view there are two advantages to basing
a synthesis strategy on this hypothesis
Firstly it provides a way to represent the many influences of higher-level
processes like syntax and semantics on rhythm using a simple notation which
fits naturally into the phonetic utterance representation
and which people find quite easy to understand and generate
Secondly it tends to produce a heavily accentuated but not unnatural
speech rhythm which can easily be moderated into a more acceptable rhythm
by departing from isochrony in a controlled manner
pp
The ISP procedure does not make feet exactly isochronous
It starts with a standard foot time and attempts to fit the syllables of the
foot into this time
If doing so would result in certain syllables having less than a preset minimum
duration the isochrony constraint is relaxed and the foot is expanded
There is no preset
ul
maximum
syllable length
However when the durations of individual phoneme postures are adjusted
to realize the calculated syllable durations
limits are imposed on the amount by which individual phonemes can be expanded
or contracted
Thus a hierarchy of limits exists
pp
The rate of talking is determined by the standard foot time
If this time is short many feet will be forced to have durations longer than
the standard and the speech will be less isochronous
This seems to accord with common human experience
If the standard time is longer however the minimum syllable limit
will always be exceeded and the speech will be completely isochronous
If it is too long the above-mentioned limits to phoneme expansion will
come into play and again partially destroy the isochrony
pp
It has often been observed that the final foot of an utterance tends to be
longer than others as does the tonic foot em that which bears the
major stress
This is easy to accomodate simply by making the target duration
longer for these feet
rh From feet to syllables
A foot is a succession of syllables one or more
And it is obvious that since there are more syllables in some feet than
in others some syllables must occupy less time than others in order to preserve
the tendency towards isochrony of feet
pp
However the duration of a foot is not divided evenly between its constituent
syllables  The syllables have a definite rhythm of their own which seems
to be governed by
LB
NP
the nature of the salient that is the first syllable of the foot
NP
the presence of word boundaries within the foot
LE
A salient syllable tends to be long either if it contains one of
a class of so-called long vowels or if there is a cluster of two or more
consonants following the vowel
The pattern of syllables and word boundaries governs the rhythm of the foot
and Table 82 shows the possibilities for one- two- and three-syllable feet
This theory of speech rhythm is due to Abercrombie 1964

while having only one syllable if the first place in it is filled by a
silent stress marked by
