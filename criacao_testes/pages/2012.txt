The TI chip has a fixed architecture and is destined forever
to implement the same vocal tract model em a 10th order lattice filter
A more recent device the Programmable Digital Signal Processor
Caldwell 1980 from Telesensory Systems allows more flexibility
in the type of model

Caldwell 1980

It can serve as a digital formant synthesizer or a linear predictive
synthesizer and the order of model number of formants in the former case
can be changed
pp
Before describing the PDSP it is worth looking at an earlier microprocessor
which was designed for digital signal processing
Some industry observers have said that this processor the Intel 2920
is to the analogue design engineer what the first microprocessor was to
the random logic engineer way back in the mists of time early 1970s
rh The analogue microprocessor
The 2920 is a digital microprocessor
However it contains an on-chip DA converter which can be used in
successive approximation fashion for AD conversion under program control
and its architecture is designed to aid digital signal processing calculations
Although the precision of conversion is 9 bits internal arithmetic is
done with 25 bits to accomodate the accumulation of round-off errors in
arithmetic operations
An on-chip programmable read-only memory holds a 192-instruction program
which is executed in sequence with no program jumps allowed
This ensures that each pass through the program takes the same time
so that the analogue waveform is regularly sampled and processed
pp
The device is implemented in n-channel MOS technology which makes it
slightly faster than the pMOS Speak n Spell chip
At its fastest operating speed each instruction takes 400 nsec
The 192-instruction program therefore executes in 786 musec corresponding
to a sampling rate of almost 13 kHz
Thus the processor can handle signals with a bandwidth of 65 kHz em ample
for high-quality speech
However a special EOP end of program instruction is provided which
causes an immediate jump back to the beginning
Hence if the program occupies less than 192 instructions faster sampling
rates can be used
For example a single second-order formant resonance
requires only 14 instructions and so can
be executed at over 150 kHz
pp
Despite this speed the 2920 is only marginally capable of synthesizing
speech
Table 117 gives approximate numbers of instructions needed to do some
subtasks for speech generation Hoff and Li 1980

FG Table 117  2920 instruction counts for typical speech subsystems
The parameter entry and data distribution procedure
collects 10 8-bit parameters from a serial input stream at a frame rate of
100 framess
The parameter data rate is 8 Kbits and the routine assumes that the
2920 performs each complete cycle in 125 musec to generate sampled speech
at 8 kHz
Therefore one bit of parameter data is accepted on every cycle
The glottal pulse program generates an asymmetrical triangular waveform
Chapter 5 while the noise generator uses a 17-bit pseudo-random feedback
shift register
About 30 of the 192-instruction program memory is consumed by these
essential tasks
A two-multiplier lattice section takes 20 instructions
and so only six sections can fit into the remaining program space
It may be possible to use two 2920s to implement a complete 10 or 12th
order lattice but the results of the first stage must be passed to the
second by transmitting analogue or digital data between each of the
2920s analogue ports em not a terribly satisfactory method
pp
Since a formant filter occupies only 14 instructions up to nine of them
would fit in the program space left after the above-mentioned essential
subsystems
Although other necessary house-keeping tasks may reduce this number
substantially
it does seem possible to implement a formant synthesizer on a single 2920
