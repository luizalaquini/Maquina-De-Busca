1025 And behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying
Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life  1026 He said unto
him What is written in the law how readest thou  1027 And he
answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy
mind and thy neighbour as thyself

1028 And he said unto him Thou hast answered right this do and
thou shalt live

1029 But he willing to justify himself said unto Jesus And who is
my neighbour  1030 And Jesus answering said A certain man went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him
of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead

1031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way and
when he saw him he passed by on the other side

1032 And likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked
on him and passed by on the other side

1033 But a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and
when he saw him he had compassion on him 1034 And went to him and
bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own
beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him

1035 And on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and
gave them to the host and said unto him Take care of him and
whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee

1036 Which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him
that fell among the thieves  1037 And he said He that shewed mercy
on him Then said Jesus unto him Go and do thou likewise

1038 Now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a
certain village and a certain woman named Martha received him into
her house

1039 And she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet
and heard his word

1040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and
said Lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
alone  bid her therefore that she help me

1041 And Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha thou art
careful and troubled about many things 1042 But one thing is
needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken
away from her

111 And it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place
when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
pray as John also taught his disciples

112 And he said unto them When ye pray say Our Father which art in
heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done as
in heaven so in earth

113 Give us day by day our daily bread

114 And forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from
evil

115 And he said unto them Which of you shall have a friend and
shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him Friend lend me three
loaves 116 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and I
have nothing to set before him  117 And he from within shall answer
and say Trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are
with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee

118 I say unto you Though he will not rise and give him because he
is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give
him as many as he needeth

119 And I say unto you Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye
shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you

1110 For every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened

1111 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he
give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a
serpent  1112 Or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a
scorpion  1113 If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask him  1114 And he was casting out a
devil and it was dumb And it came to pass when the devil was gone
out the dumb spake and the people wondered

1115 But some of them said He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
the chief of the devils

1116 And others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven

1117 But he knowing their thoughts said unto them Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided
against a house falleth

1118 If Satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom
