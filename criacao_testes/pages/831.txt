Grenn go wake Maester Aemon said Pyp Tell him Jon needs more milk of the poppy

Yes Jon thought No he said The Magnar…

We know said Pyp The sentries on the Wall have been told to keep one eye on the south and Donal Noye dispatched some men to Weatherback Ridge to watch the kingsroad Maester Aemon’s sent birds to Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower too

Maester Aemon shuffled to the bedside one hand on Grenn’s shoulder Jon be gentle with yourself It is good that you have woken but you must give yourself time to heal We drowned the wound with boiling wine and closed you up with a poultice of nettle mustard seed and moldy bread but unless you rest…

I can’t Jon fought through the pain to sit Mance will be here soon… thousands of men giants mammoths… has word been sent to Winterfell To the king Sweat dripped off his brow He closed his eyes a moment

Grenn gave Pyp a strange look He doesn’t know

Jon said Maester Aemon much and more happened while you were away and little of it good Balon Greyjoy has crowned himself again and sent his longships against the north Kings sprout like weeds at every hand and we have sent appeals to all of them yet none will come They have more pressing uses for their swords and we are far off and forgotten And Winterfell… Jon be strong… Winterfell is no more…

No more Jon stared at Aemon’s white eyes and wrinkled face My brothers are at Winterfell Bran and Rickon…

The maester touched his brow I am so very sorry Jon Your brothers died at the command of Theon Greyjoy after he took Winterfell in his father’s name When your father’s bannermen threatened to retake it he put the castle to the torch

Your brothers were avenged Grenn said Bolton’s son killed all the ironmen and it’s said he’s flaying Theon Greyjoy inch by inch for what he did

I’m sorry Jon Pyp squeezed his shoulder We are all

Jon had never liked Theon Greyjoy but he had been their father’s ward Another spasm of pain twisted up his leg and the next he knew he was flat on his back again There’s some mistake he insisted At Queenscrown I saw a direwolf a grey direwolf… grey… it knew me If Bran was dead could some part of him live on in his wolf as Orell lived within his eagle

Drink this Grenn held a cup to his lips Jon drank His head was full of wolves and eagles the sound of his brothers’ laughter The faces above him began to blur and fade They can’t be dead Theon would never do that And Winterfell… grey granite oak and iron crows wheeling around the towers steam rising off the hot pools in the godswood the stone kings sitting on their thrones… how could Winterfell be gone

When the dreams took him he found himself back home once more splashing in the hot pools beneath a huge white weirwood that had his father’s face Ygritte was with him laughing at him shedding her skins till she was naked as her name day trying to kiss him but he couldn’t not with his father watching He was the blood of Winterfell a man of the Night’s Watch I will not father a bastard he told her I will not I will not You know nothing Jon Snow she whispered her skin dissolving in the hot water the flesh beneath sloughing off her bones until only skull and skeleton remained and the pool bubbled thick and red





Catelyn


They heard the Green Fork before they saw it an endless susurrus like the growl of some great beast The river was a boiling torrent half again as wide as it had been last year when Robb had divided his army here and vowed to take a Frey to bride as the price of his crossing He needed Lord Walder and his bridge then and he needs them even more now Catelyn’s heart was full of misgivings as she watched the murky green waters swirl past There is no way we will ford this nor swim across and it could be a moon’s turn before these waters fall again

As they neared the Twins Robb donned his crown and summoned Catelyn and Edmure to ride beside him Ser Raynald Westerling bore his banner the direwolf of Stark on its ice-white field

The gatehouse towers emerged from the rain like ghosts hazy grey apparitions that grew more solid the closer they rode The Frey stronghold was not one castle but two mirror images in wet stone standing on opposite sides of the water linked by a great arched bridge From the center of its span rose the Water Tower the river running straight and swift below Channels had been cut from the banks to form moats that made each twin an island The rains had turned the moats to shallow lakes

Across the turbulent waters Catelyn could see several thousand men encamped around the eastern castle their banners hanging like so many drowned cats from the lances outside their tents The rain made it impossible to distinguish colors and devices Most were grey it seemed to her though beneath such skies the whole world seemed grey

Tread lightly here Robb she cautioned her son Lord Walder has a thin skin and a sharp tongue and some of these sons of his will doubtless take after their father You must not let yourself be provoked

I know the Freys Mother I know how much I wronged them and how much I need them I shall be as sweet as a septon

Catelyn shifted her seat uncomfortably If we are offered refreshment when we arrive on no account refuse Take what is offered and eat and drink where all can see If nothing is offered ask for bread and cheese and a cup of wine

I’m more wet than hungry…

Robb listen to me Once you have eaten of his bread and salt you have the guest right and the laws of hospitality protect you beneath his roof
