Theon wants me to yield the castle Bran said as the maester was fastening the cloak with his favorite wolf’s-head clasp of silver and jet

There is no shame in that A lord must protect his smallfolk Cruel places breed cruel peoples Bran remember that as you deal with these ironmen Your lord father did what he could to gentle Theon but I fear it was too little and too late

The ironman who came for them was a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard that covered half his chest He bore the boy easily enough though he looked none too happy with the task Rickon’s bedchamber was a half turn down the steps The four-year-old was cranky at being woken I want Mother he said I want her And Shaggydog too

Your mother is far away my prince Maester Luwin pulled a bedrobe over the child’s head But I’m here and Bran He took Rickon by the hand and led him out

Below they came on Meera and Jojen being herded from their room by a bald man whose spear was three feet taller than he was When Jojen looked at Bran his eyes were green pools full of sorrow Other ironmen had rousted the Freys Your brother’s lost his kingdom Little Walder told Bran You’re no prince now just a hostage

So are you Jojen said and me and all of us

No one was talking to you frogeater

One of the ironmen went before them carrying a torch but the rain had started again and soon drowned it out As they hurried across the yard they could hear the direwolves howling in the godswood I hope Summer wasn’t hurt falling from the tree

Theon Greyjoy was seated in the high seat of the Starks He had taken off his cloak Over a shirt of fine mail he wore a black surcoat emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House His hands rested on the wolves’ heads carved at the ends of the wide stone arms Theon’s sitting in Robb’s chair Rickon said

Hush Rickon Bran could feel the menace around them but his brother was too young A few torches had been lit and a fire kindled in the great hearth but most of the hall remained in darkness There was no place to sit with the benches stacked against the walls so the castle folk stood in small groups not daring to speak He saw Old Nan her toothless mouth opening and closing Hayhead was carried in between two of the other guards a bloodstained bandage wrapped about his bare chest Poxy Tym wept inconsolably and Beth Cassel cried with fear

What have we here Theon asked of the Reeds and Freys

These are Lady Catelyn’s wards both named Walder Frey Maester Luwin explained And this is Jojen Reed and his sister Meera son and daughter to Howland Reed of Greywater Watch who came to renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell

Some might call that ill-timed said Theon though not for me Here you are and here you’ll stay He vacated the high seat Bring the prince here Lorren The black-bearded man dumped Bran onto the stone as if he were a sack of oats

People were still being driven into the Great Hall prodded along with shouts and the butts of the spears Gage and Osha arrived from the kitchens spotted with flour from making the morning bread Mikken they dragged in cursing Farlen entered limping struggling to support Palla Her dress had been ripped in two she held it up with a clenched fist and walked as if every step were agony Septon Chayle rushed to lend a hand but one of the ironmen knocked him to the floor

The last man marched through the doors was the prisoner Reek whose stench preceded him ripe and pungent Bran felt his stomach twist at the smell of him We found this one locked in a tower cell announced his escort a beardless youth with ginger-colored hair and sodden clothing doubtless one of those who’d swum the moat He says they call him Reek

Can’t think why Theon said smiling Do you always smell so bad or did you just finish fucking a pig

Haven’t fucked no one since they took me m’lord Heke’s me true name I was in service to the Bastard o’ the Dreadfort till the Starks give him an arrow in the back for a wedding gift

Theon found that amusing Who did he marry

The widow o’ Hornwood m’lord

That crone Was he blind She has teats like empty wineskins dry and withered

It wasn’t her teats he wed her for m’lord

The ironmen slammed shut the tall doors at the foot of the hall From the high seat Bran could see about twenty of them He probably left some guards on the gates and the armory Even so there couldn’t be more than thirty

Theon raised his hands for quiet You all know me—

Aye we know you for a sack of steaming dung shouted Mikken before the bald man drove the butt of his spear into his gut then smashed him across the face with the shaft The smith stumbled to his knees and spat out a tooth

Mikken you be silent Bran tried to sound stern and lordly the way Robb did when he made a command but his voice betrayed him and the words came out in a shrill squeak

Listen to your little lordling Mikken said Theon He has more sense than you do

A good lord protects his people he reminded himself I’ve yielded Winterfell to Theon

Louder Bran And call me prince

He raised his voice I have yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon All of you should do as he commands you

Damned if I will bellowed Mikken

Theon ignored the outburst My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands He claims the north as well by right of conquest You are all his subjects

Bugger that Mikken wiped the blood from his mouth I serve the Starks not some treasonous squid of—aah The butt of the spear smashed him face first into the stone floor

Smiths have strong arms and weak heads observed Theon But if the rest of you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark you’ll find me as generous a lord as you could want

On his hands and knees Mikken spat blood Please don’t Bran wished at him but the blacksmith shouted If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o’—

The bald man drove the point of his spear into the back of Mikken’s neck Steel slid through flesh and came out his throat in a welter of blood A woman screamed and Meera wrapped her arms around Rickon It’s blood he drowned on Bran thought numbly His own blood

Who else has something to say asked Theon Greyjoy

Hodor hodor hodor hodor shouted Hodor eyes wide

Someone kindly shut that halfwit up

Two ironmen began to beat Hodor with the butts of their spears The stableboy dropped to the floor trying to shield himself with his hands

I will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was Theon raised his voice to be heard above the smack of wood on flesh Betray me though and you’ll wish you hadn’t And don’t think the men you see here are the whole of my power Torrhen’s Square and Deepwood Motte will soon be ours as well and my uncle is sailing up the Saltspear to seize Moat Cailin If Robb Stark can stave off the Lannisters he may reign as King of the Trident hereafter but House Greyjoy holds the north now

Stark’s lords will fight you the man Reek called out That bloated pig at White Harbor for one and them Umbers and Karstarks too You’ll need men Free me and I’m yours

Theon weighed him a moment You’re cleverer than you smell but I could not suffer that stench

Well said Reek I could wash some If I was free

A man of rare good sense Theon smiled Bend the knee

One of the ironmen handed Reek a sword and he laid it at Theon’s feet and swore obedience to House Greyjoy and King Balon Bran could not look The green dream was coming true

M’lord Greyjoy Osha stepped past Mikken’s body I was brought here captive too You were there the day I was taken

I thought you were a friend Bran thought hurt

I need fighters Theon declared not kitchen sluts

It was Robb Stark put me in the kitchens For the best part of a year I’ve been left to scour kettles scrape grease and warm the straw for this one She threw a look at Gage I’ve had a bellyful of it Put a spear in my hand again

I got a spear for you right here said the bald man who’d killed Mikken He grabbed his crotch grinning
