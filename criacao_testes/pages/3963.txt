so wonderful Remember when you made each one a
different animal
Yeah Pigs and cats and things says Peeta You
saidabout an accident
I can see the sheen of sweat on Dellys forehead as
she tries to work around the question It was bad No
onecould stay she says haltingly
Hang in there girl says Haymitch
But I know youre going to like it here Peeta The
people have been really nice to us Theres always food
and clean clothes and schools much more interesting
says Delly
Why hasnt my family come to see me Peeta asks
They cant Dellys tearing up again A lot of people
didnt get out of Twelve So well need to make a new life
here Im sure they could use a good baker Do you
remember when your father used to let us make dough girls
and boys
There was a fire Peeta says suddenly
Yes she whispers
Twelve burned down didnt it Because of her says
Peeta angrily Because of Katniss He begins to pull on
the restraints
Oh no Peeta It wasnt her fault says Delly
Did she tell you that he hisses at her
Get her out of there says Plutarch The door opens
immediately and Delly begins to back toward it slowly
She didnt have to I was-- Delly begins
Because shes lying Shes a liar You cant believe
anything she says Shes some kind of mutt the Capitol
created to use against the rest of us Peeta shouts
No Peeta Shes not a-- Delly tries again
Dont trust her Delly says Peeta in a frantic voice I
did and she tried to kill me She killed my friends My
family Dont even go near her Shes a mutt
A hand reaches through the doorway pulls Delly out
and the door swings shut But Peeta keeps yelling A mutt
Shes a stinking mutt
Not only does he hate me and want to kill me he no
longer believes Im human It was less painful being
strangled
Around me the recovery team members scribble like
crazy taking down every word Haymitch and Plutarch grab
my arms and propel me out of the room They lean me up
against a wall in the silent hallway But I know Peeta
continues to scream behind the door and the glass
Prim was wrong Peeta is irretrievable I cant stay
here anymore I say numbly If you want me to be the
Mockingjay youll have to send me away
Where do you want to go asks Haymitch
The Capitol Its the only place I can think of where I
have a job to do
Cant do it Plutarch says Not until all the districts
are secure Good news is the fightings almost over in all of
them but Two Its a tough nut to crack though
Thats right First the districts Next the Capitol And
then I hunt down Snow
Fine I say Send me to Two

District 2 is a large district as one might expect
composed of a series of villages spread across the
mountains Each was originally associated with a mine or
quarry although now many are devoted to the housing and
training of Peacekeepers None of this would present much
of a challenge since the rebels have 13s airpower on their
side except for one thing At the center of the district is a
virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of the
Capitols military
Weve nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed
Plutarchs tough nut to crack comment to the weary and
discouraged rebel leaders here The Nut was established
directly after the Dark Days when the Capitol had lost 13
and was desperate for a new underground stronghold They
had some of their military resources situated on the
outskirts of the Capitol itself--nuclear missiles aircraft
troops--but a significant chunk of their power was now
under an enemys control Of course there was no way they
could hope to replicate 13 which was the work of centuries
However in the old mines of nearby District 2 they saw
opportunity From the air the Nut appeared to be just
another mountain with a few entrances on its faces But
inside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs of stones
had been cut hauled to the surface and transported down
slippery narrow roads to make distant buildings There was
even a train system to facilitate transporting the miners
from the Nut to the very center of the main town in District 2
It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during the
Victory Tour standing on the wide marble steps of the
Justice Building trying not to look too closely at Catos and
Cloves grieving families assembled below us
It was not the most ideal terrain plagued as it was by
mudslides floods and avalanches But the advantages
outweighed the concerns As theyd cut deep into the
mountain the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone
to support the infrastructure The Capitol reinforced these
and set about making the mountain their new military base
Filling it with computer banks and meeting rooms barracks
and arsenals Widening entrances to allow the exit of
hovercraft from the hangar installing missile launchers But
on the whole leaving the exterior of the mountain largely
