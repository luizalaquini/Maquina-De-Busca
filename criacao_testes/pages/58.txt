She bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen Her fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck How could Littlefinger have known she was here Ser Rodrik would never have told him Old he might be but he was stubborn and loyal to a fault Were they too late had the Lannisters reached King’s Landing before her No if that were true Ned would be here too and surely he would have come to her How…

Then she thought Moreo The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were damn him She hoped he’d gotten a good price for the information

They had brought a horse for her The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks When they reached the Red Keep the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door then up endless steps to a tower

He was alone in the room seated at a heavy wooden table an oil lamp beside him as he wrote When they ushered her inside he set down his pen and looked at her Cat he said quietly

Why have I been brought here in this fashion

He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards Leave us The men departed You were not mistreated I trust he said after they had gone I gave firm instructions He noticed her bandages Your hands…

Catelyn ignored the implied question I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench she said icily As a boy you still knew the meaning of courtesy

I’ve angered you my lady That was never my intent He looked contrite The look brought back vivid memories for Catelyn He had been a sly child but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite it was a gift he had The years had not changed him much Petyr had been a small boy and he had grown into a small man an inch or two shorter than Catelyn slender and quick with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes He had a little pointed chin beard now and threads of silver in his dark hair though he was still shy of thirty They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak Even as a child he had always loved his silver

How did you know I was in the city she asked him

Lord Varys knows all Petyr said with a sly smile He will be joining us shortly but I wanted to see you alone first It has been too long Cat How many years

Catelyn ignored his familiarity There were more important questions So it was the King’s Spider who found me

Littlefinger winced You don’t want to call him that He’s very sensitive Comes of being an eunuch I imagine Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing Oftimes he knows about it before it happens He has informants everywhere His little birds he calls them One of his little birds heard about your visit Thankfully Varys came to me first

Why you

He shrugged Why not me I am master of coin the king’s own councillor Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone leaving only Maester Pycelle and me I was the obvious choice I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa Varys knows that

Does Varys know about…

Lord Varys knows everything… except why you are here He lifted an eyebrow Why are you here

A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband and if a mother needs her daughters close who can tell her no

Littlefinger laughed Oh very good my lady but please don’t expect me to believe that I know you too well What were the Tully words again

Her throat was dry Family Duty Honor she recited stiffly He did know her too well

Family Duty Honor he echoed All of which required you to remain in Winterfell where our Hand left you No my lady something has happened This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency I beg of you let me help Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other There was a soft knock on the door Enter Littlefinger called out

The man who stepped through the door was plump perfumed powdered and as hairless as an egg He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet Lady Stark he said taking her hand in both of his to see you again after so many years is such a joy His flesh was soft and moist and his breath smelled of lilacs Oh your poor hands Have you burned yourself sweet lady The fingers are so delicate… Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve shall I send for a jar

Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp I thank you my lord but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts

Varys bobbed his head I was grievous sad to hear about your son And him so young The gods are cruel

On that we agree Lord Varys she said The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb the master of none but his whisperers

The eunuch spread his soft hands On more than that I hope sweet lady I have great esteem for your husband our new Hand and I know we do both love King Robert

Yes she was forced to say For a certainty

Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert quipped Littlefinger He smiled slyly At least in Lord Varys’s hearing
