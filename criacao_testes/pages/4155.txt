the window facing down the table She was thus at
the head without mingling with the men
This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited her
red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
skeins of her shadowy hair She seemed to expect
assistance and the seat at the bottom of the table was
at her request left vacant until after they had begun
and the duties appertaining to that end which he did
with great readiness
At this moment Mr Boldwood came in at the gate
and crossed the green to Bathsheba at the window
He apologized for his lateness  his arrival was evidently
by arrangement
 Gabriel said she  will you move again please
and let Mr Boldwood come there 
Oak moved in silence back to his original seat
The gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style
in a new coat and white waistcoat quite contrasting
with his usual sober suits of grey Inwardy too he
was blithe and consequently chatty to an exceptional
degree So also was Bathsheba now that he had come
though the uninvited presence of Pennyways the bailiff
who had been dismissed for theft disturbed her equan+
imity for a while
Supper being ended Coggan began on his own
private account without reference to listeners  --
lve lost my love and l care not
Ive lost my love and l care not
I shall soon have another
P 206
Thats better than tother
Ive lost my love and I care not
This lyric when concluded was received with a
silently appreciative gaze at the table implying that the
performance like a work by those established authors
who are independent of notices in the papers was a
well-known delight which required no applause
Now Master Poorgass your song said Coggan
I be all but in liquor and the gift is wanting in
me said Joseph diminishing himself
Nonsense woust never be so ungrateful Joseph --
never said Coggan expressing hurt feelings by an
inflection of voice And mistress is looking hard at
ye as much as to say Sing at once Joseph Poor+
grass 
Faith so she is well I must suffer it  Just
eye my features and see if the tell-tale blood overheats
me much neighbours
No yer blushes be quite reasonable said Coggan
I always tries to keep my colours from rising when
a beautys eyes get fixed on me said Joseph differently
but if so be tis willed they do they must
Now Joseph your song please said Bathsheba
from the window
Well really maam he replied in a yielding tone
I dont know what to say It would be a poor plain
ballet of my own composure
Hear hear  said the supper-party
Poorgrass thus assured trilled forth a flickering yet
commendable piece of sentiment the tune of which
consisted of the key-note and another the latter being
the sound chiefly dwelt upon This was so successful
that he rashly plunged into a second in the same
breath after a few false starts  --
I sow-ed th-e
I sow-ed
I sow-ed the-e seeds of love
I-it was all i-in the-e spring
I-in A-pril Ma-ay a-nd sun-ny June
When sma-all bi-irds they do sing
P 207
 Well put out of hand said Coggan at the end of the
verse   They do sing  was a very taking paragraph
Ay and there was a pretty place at seeds of
love and twas well heaved out Though love  is
a nasty high corner when a mans voice is getting
crazed Next verse Master Poorgrass
But during this rendering young Bob Coggan ex+
hibited one of those anomalies which will afflict little
people when other persons are particularly serious  in
trying to check his laughter he pushed down his throat
as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of when
after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time his
mirth burst out through his nose Joseph perceived it
and with hectic cheeks of indignation instantly ceased
singing Coggan boxed Bobs ears immediately
Go on Joseph -- go on and never mind the young
scamp said Coggan Tis a very catching ballet
Now then again -- the next bar Ill help ye to flourish
up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy  --
O the wi-il-lo-ow tree will twist
And the wil-low tre-ee wiill twine
But the singer could not be set going again Bob
Coggan was sent home for his ill manners and tran+
quility was restored by Jacob Smallbury who volunteered
a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which
the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion
the swains Chromis and Mnasylus and other jolly dogs
of his day
It was still the beaming time of evening though
