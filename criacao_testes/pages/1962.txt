Accent is the potential for salience as marked for example
in a dictionary or lexicon
Thus the discussion of the diplo- words above is about accent
Stress is an articulatory phenomenon associated with increased
muscular activity
Usually syllables which are perceived as salient were produced with stress
but in shouting for example all syllables can be stressed em even
non-salient ones
Furthermore accented syllables may not be salient
For instance the first syllable of the word very is accented
that is potentially salient but in a sentence as uttered it may or may not be
salient  One can say
LB
c
ul
hes
very good
LE
with salience on he and possibly good or
LB
hes
ul
very
good
LE
with salience on the first syllable of very and possibly good
pp
Non-standard stress patterns are frequently used to bring out contrasts
Words like a and the are normally unstressed but can be stressed
in contexts where ambiguity has arisen
Thus factors which operate at a much higher level than the phonetic structure
of the utterance must be taken into account when deciding where stress
should be assigned  These include syntactic and semantic considerations
as well as the attitude of the speaker and the likely attitude of
the listener to the material being spoken
For example I might say
LB
Anna
ul
and
Nikki should go
LE
with emphasis on the and purely because I was aware that my listener
might quibble about the expense of sending them both
Clearly some notation is needed to communicate to the synthesis process
how the utterance is supposed to be rendered

For speech stored in source-filter form and concatenated on a
slot-filling basis it would be useful to
have stored typical pitch contours which can be applied to the
synthetic utterances
From a practical point of view it is important to be able to generate
natural-sounding pitch for high-quality artificial speech
Although several algorithms for creating completely synthetic contours
have been proposed em and we will examine one later in this chapter em
they are unsuitable for high-quality speech
They are generally designed for use with synthesis-by-rule from phonetics
and the rather poor quality of articulation does not encourage the
development of excellent pitch assignment procedures  With speech
synthesized by rule there is generally an emphasis on keeping the
data storage requirements to a minimum and so it is not appropriate
to store complete contours
Moreover if speech is entered in textual
form as phoneme strings it is natural to attach pitch information as markers
in the text rather than by entering a complete and detailed contour
pp
The picture is rather different for concatenated segments of natural speech
In the airline reservation system with utterances formed from templates like
LB
Flight number em leaves em at em  arrives in em at em 
LE
it is attractive to store the pitch contour of one complete instance of the
utterance and apply it to all synthetic versions
pp
There is an enormous literature on the anatomy of intonation and much of it
rests upon the notion of a pitch contour as a descriptive aid to analysis
Underlying this is the assumption usually unstated that a contour can be
discussed independently of the particular stream of words that manifests it
that a single contour can somehow be bound to any sentence or phrase or
clause to produce an acceptable utterance  But the contour and its binding
are generally described only at the grossest level the details being left
unspecified
pp
There are phonetic influences on pitch em the characteristic lowering
during certain consonants was mentioned above em and these are
not normally considered as part of intonation
Such effects will certainly spoil attempts to store contours extracted
from living speech and apply them to different utterances but the impairment
may not be too great for pitch is only one of many segmental clues to
consonant identification
pp
In the system mentioned earlier which generated 7-digit telephone numbers
by concatenating formant-coded words a single natural pitch contour
was applied to all utterances
It was taken to match as well as possible the general shape of the
contours measured in naturally-spoken telephone numbers  However this is a very
restricted environment for telephone numbers exhibit almost no variety in
the configuration of stressed and unstressed syllables em
the only digit which is not a monosyllable is seven
