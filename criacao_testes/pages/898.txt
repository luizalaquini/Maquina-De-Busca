Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of food which even Tyrion found hard to swallow Sansa must have poisoned him Joff practically put his cup down in her lap and he’d given her ample reason Any doubts Tyrion might have had vanished when his wife did One flesh one heart one soul His mouth twisted She wasted no time proving how much those vows meant to her did she Well what did you expect dwarf

And yet… where would Sansa have gotten poison He could not believe the girl had acted alone in this Do I really want to find her Would the judges believe that Tyrion’s child bride had poisoned a king without her husband’s knowledge I wouldn’t Cersei would insist that they had done the deed together

Even so he gave the parchment to his uncle the next day Ser Kevan frowned at it Lady Sansa is your only witness

I will think of others in time

Best think of them now The judges mean to begin the trial three days hence

That’s too soon You have me shut up here under guard how am I to find witnesses to my innocence

Your sister’s had no difficulty finding witnesses to your guilt Ser Kevan rolled up the parchment Ser Addam has men hunting for your wife Varys has offered a hundred stags for word of her whereabouts and a hundred dragons for the girl herself If the girl can be found she will be found and I shall bring her to you I see no harm in husband and wife sharing the same cell and giving comfort to one another

You are too kind Have you seen my squire

I sent him to you yesterday Did he not come

He came Tyrion admitted and then he went

I shall send him to you again

But it was the next morning before Podrick Payne returned He stepped inside the room hesitantly with fear written all over his face Bronn came in behind him The sellsword knight wore a jerkin studded with silver and a heavy riding cloak with a pair of fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through his swordbelt

One look at Bronn’s face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach It took you long enough

The boy begged or I wouldn’t have come at all I am expected at Castle Stokeworth for supper

Stokeworth Tyrion hopped from the bed And pray what is there for you in Stokeworth

A bride Bronn smiled like a wolf contemplating a lost lamb I’m to wed Lollys the day after next

Lollys Perfect bloody perfect Lady Tanda’s lackwit daughter gets a knightly husband and a father of sorts for the bastard in her belly and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater climbs another rung It had Cersei’s stinking fingers all over it My bitch sister has sold you a lame horse The girl’s dim-witted

If I wanted wits I’d marry you

Lollys is big with another man’s child

And when she pops him out I’ll get her big with mine

She’s not even heir to Stokeworth Tyrion pointed out She has an elder sister Falyse A married sister

Married ten years and still barren said Bronn Her lord husband shuns her bed It’s said he prefers virgins

He could prefer goats and it wouldn’t matter The lands will still pass to his wife when Lady Tanda dies

Unless Falyse should die before her mother

Tyrion wondered whether Cersei had any notion of the sort of serpent she’d given Lady Tanda to suckle And if she does would she care Why are you here then

Bronn shrugged You once told me that if anyone ever asked me to sell you out you’d double the price

Yes Is it two wives you want or two castles
