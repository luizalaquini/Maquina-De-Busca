blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies

413 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness

414 I said LORD be merciful unto me heal my soul for I have
sinned against thee

415 Mine enemies speak evil of me When shall he die and his name
perish

416 And if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it

417 All that hate me whisper together against me against me do they
devise my hurt

418 An evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that
he lieth he shall rise up no more

419 Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat
of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me

4110 But thou O LORD be merciful unto me and raise me up that I
may requite them

4111 By this I know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me

4112 And as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest
me before thy face for ever

4113 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting and to
everlasting Amen and Amen



421 As the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul
after thee O God

422 My soul thirsteth for God for the living God when shall I come
and appear before God

423 My tears have been my meat day and night while they continually
say unto me Where is thy God

424 When I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I had
gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with
the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday

425 Why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted in
me  hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance

426 O my God my soul is cast down within me therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermonites from the
hill Mizar

427 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me

428 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time and
in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the God of
my life

429 I will say unto God my rock Why hast thou forgotten me why go I
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy

4210 As with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while
they say daily unto me Where is thy God

4211 Why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted
within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is the
health of my countenance and my God



431 Judge me O God and plead my cause against an ungodly nation O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man

432 For thou art the God of my strength why dost thou cast me off
why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy

433 O send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them
bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles

434 Then will I go unto the altar of God unto God my exceeding joy
yea upon the harp will I praise thee O God my God

435 Why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted
within me hope in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health
of my countenance and my God



441 We have heard with our ears O God our fathers have told us
what work thou didst in their days in the times of old

442 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst
