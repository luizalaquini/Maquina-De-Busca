GABRIELS RESOLVE -- THE VISIT -- THE MISTAKE
THE only superiority in women that is tolerable to the
rival sex is as a rule that of the unconscious kind  but
a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes
please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the
subordinated man
This well-favoured and comely girl soon made appre+
ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young
Farmer Oak
Love being an extremely exacting usurer a sense of
exorbitant profit spiritually by an exchange of hearts
being at the bottom of pure passions as that of exorbi+
tant profit bodily or materially is at the bottom of
those of lower atmosphere every morning Oaks feelings
were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations
upon his chances His dog waited for his meals in a
way so like that in which Oak waited for the girls
presence that the farmer was quite struck with the
resemblance felt it lowering and would not look at the
dog However he continued to watch through the
hedge for her regular coming and thus his sentiments
towards her were ideepened without any corresponding
effect being produced upon herself Oak had nothing
finished and ready to say as yet and not being able
to frame love phrases which end where they begin 
passionate tales -- +
     -- -Full of sound and fury
   -- -signifting nothing -- +
he said no word at all
By making inquiries he found that the girls name
was Bathsheba Everdene and that the cow would go
dry in about seven days He dreaded the eight day
At last the eighth day came The cow had ceased
to give milk for that year and Bathsheba Everdene
came up the hill no more Gabriel had reached a
pitch of existence he never
P 74
could have anticipated a
short time before He liked saying Bathsheba as a
private enjoyment instead of whistling turned over his
taste to black hair though he had sworn by brown ever
since he was a boy isolated himself till the space he
filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness Marriage
transforms a distraction into a support the power of
which should be and happily often is in direct pro+
portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants Oak
began now to see light in this direction and said to
himself Ill make her my wife or upon my soul I shall
be good for nothing  
All this while he was perplexing himself about an
errand on which he might consistently visit the cottage
of Bathshebas aunt
He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe
mother of a living lamb On a day which had a
summer face and a winter constitution-a fine January
morning when there was just enough blue sky visible to
make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more and an
occasional gleam of silvery sunshine Oak put the lamb
into a respectable Sunday basket and stalked across the
fields to the house of Mrs Hurst the aunt -- George
the dog walking behind with a countenance of great
concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be
taking
Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling
from the chimney with strange meditation At evening
he had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the
spot of its origin -- seen the hearth and Bathsheba
beside it -- beside it in her out-door dress for the
clothes she had worn on the hill were by association
equally with her person included in the compass of his
affection they seemed at this early time of his love a
necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath+
sheba Everdene
He had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind -- of a
nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly
ornate -- of a degree between fine-market-day and wet+
Sunday selection He thoroughly cleaned his silver
watch-chain with whiting put new lacing straps to his
boots looked to the brass eyelet-holes

 went to the
inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick
and trimmed it vigorously on his way back took a new
handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box put
on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs
of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose
and lily without the defects of either and used all the
hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry sandy and
inextricably curly hair till he had deepened it to a
splendidly novel colour between that of guano and
Roman cement making it stick to his head like mace
round a nutmeg or wet seaweed round a boulder after
the ebb
Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save
