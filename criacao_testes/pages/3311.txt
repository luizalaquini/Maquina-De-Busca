721 I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present
with me

722 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man 723 But I
see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members

724 O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of
this death  725 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then
with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the
law of sin

81 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit

82 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death

83 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
flesh God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
for sin condemned sin in the flesh 84 That the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after
the Spirit

85 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh
but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit

86 For to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded
is life and peace

87 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not
subject to the law of God neither indeed can be

88 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God

89 But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit if so be that the
Spirit of God dwell in you Now if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ he is none of his

810 And if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the
Spirit is life because of righteousness

811 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you

812 Therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live
after the flesh

813 For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live

814 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of
God

815 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but
ye have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father

816 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are
the children of God 817 And if children then heirs heirs of God
and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we
may be also glorified together

818 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us

819 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of God

820 For the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope 821 Because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the children of God

822 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now

823 And not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits
of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for
the adoption to wit the redemption of our body

824 For we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for
what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for  825 But if we hope for
that we see not then do we with patience wait for it

826 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered

827 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
Spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
will of God

828 And we know that all things work together for good to them that
love God to them who are the called according to his purpose

829 For whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son that he might be the firstborn
among many brethren
