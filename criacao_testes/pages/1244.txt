Catelyn was shocked You’ve killed envoys

False envoys Edmure declared They pledged me their peace and surrendered their weapons so I allowed them freedom of the castle and for three nights they ate my meat and drank my mead whilst I talked with Ser Cleos On the fourth night they tried to free the Kingslayer He pointed up That big brute killed two guards with naught but those ham hands of his caught them by the throats and smashed their skulls together while that skinny lad beside him was opening Lannister’s cell with a bit of wire gods curse him The one on the end was some sort of damned mummer He used my own voice to command that the River Gate be opened The guardsmen swear to it Enger and Delp and Long Lew all three If you ask me the man sounded nothing like me and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the same

This was the Imp’s work Catelyn suspected it stank of the same sort of cunning he had displayed at the Eyrie Once she would have named Tyrion the least dangerous of the Lannisters Now she was not so certain How is it you caught them

Ah as it happened I was not in the castle I’d crossed the Tumblestone to ah…

You were whoring or wenching Get on with the tale

Edmure’s cheeks flamed as red as his beard It was the hour before dawn and I was only then returning When Long Lew saw my boat and recognized me he finally thought to wonder who was standing below barking commands and raised a cry

Tell me the Kingslayer was retaken

Yes though not easily Jaime got hold of a sword slew Poul Pernford and Ser Desmond’s squire Myles and wounded Delp so badly that Maester Vyman fears he’ll soon die as well It was a bloody mess At the sound of steel some of the other red cloaks rushed to join him barehand or no I hanged those beside the four who freed him and threw the rest in the dungeons Jaime too We’ll have no more escapes from that one He’s down in the dark this time chained hand and foot and bolted to the wall

And Cleos Frey

He swears he knew naught of the plot Who can say The man is half Lannister half Frey and all liar I put him in Jaime’s old tower cell

You say he brought terms

If you can call them that You’ll like them no more than I did I promise

Can we hope for no help from the south Lady Stark asked Utherydes Wayn her father’s steward This charge of incest… Lord Tywin does not suffer such slights lightly He will seek to wash the stain from his daughter’s name with the blood of her accuser Lord Stannis must see that He has no choice but to make common cause with us

Stannis has made common cause with a power greater and darker Let us speak of these matters later Catelyn trotted over the drawbridge putting the grisly row of dead Lannisters behind her Her brother kept pace As they rode out into the bustle of Riverrun’s upper bailey a naked toddler ran in front of the horses Catelyn jerked her reins hard to avoid him glancing about in dismay Hundreds of smallfolk had been admitted to the castle and allowed to erect crude shelters against the walls Their children were everywhere underfoot and the yard teemed with their cows sheep and chickens Who are all these folk

My people Edmure answered They were afraid

Only my sweet brother would crowd all these useless mouths into a castle that might soon be under siege Catelyn knew that Edmure had a soft heart sometimes she thought his head was even softer She loved him for it yet still…

Can Robb be reached by raven

He’s in the field my lady Ser Desmond replied The bird would have no way to find him

Utherydes Wayn coughed Before he left us the young king instructed us to send you on to the Twins upon your return Lady Stark He asks that you learn more of Lord Walder’s daughters to help him select his bride when the time comes

We’ll provide you with fresh mounts and provisions her brother promised You’ll want to refresh yourself before—

I’ll want to stay Catelyn said dismounting She had no intention of leaving Riverrun and her dying father to pick Robb’s wife for him Robb wants me safe I cannot fault him for that but his pretext is growing threadbare Boy she called and an urchin from the stables ran out to take the reins of her horse

Edmure swung down from his saddle He was a head taller than she was but he would always be her little brother Cat he said unhappily Lord Tywin is coming—

He is making for the west to defend his own lands If we close our gates and shelter behind the walls we can watch him pass with safety

This is Tully land Edmure declared If Tywin Lannister thinks to cross it unbloodied I mean to teach him a hard lesson

The same lesson you taught his son Her brother could be stubborn as river rock when his pride was touched but neither of them was likely to forget how Ser Jaime had cut Edmure’s host to bloody pieces the last time he had offered battle We have nothing to gain and everything to lose by meeting Lord Tywin in the field Catelyn said tactfully

The yard is not the place to discuss my battle plans

As you will Where shall we go

Her brother’s face darkened For a moment she thought he was about to lose his temper with her but finally he snapped The godswood If you will insist

She followed him along a gallery to the godswood gate Edmure’s anger had always been a sulky sullen thing Catelyn was sorry she had wounded him but the matter was too important for her to concern herself with his pride When they were alone beneath the trees Edmure turned to face her

You do not have the strength to meet the Lannisters in the field she said bluntly

When all my strength is marshaled I should have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse Edmure said

Which means Lord Tywin will have near twice your numbers

Robb’s won his battles against worse odds Edmure replied and I have a plan You’ve forgotten Roose Bolton Lord Tywin defeated him on the Green Fork but failed to pursue When Lord Tywin went to Harrenhal Bolton took the ruby ford and the crossroads He has ten thousand men I’ve sent word to Helman Tallhart to join him with the garrison Robb left at the Twins—

Edmure Robb left those men to hold the Twins and make certain Lord Walder keeps faith with us

He has Edmure said stubbornly The Freys fought bravely in the Whispering Wood and old Ser Stevron died at Oxcross we hear Ser Ryman and Black Walder and the rest are with Robb in the west Martyn has been of great service scouting and Ser Perwyn helped see you safe to Renly Gods be good how much more can we ask of them Robb’s betrothed to one of Lord Walder’s daughters and Roose Bolton wed another I hear And haven’t you taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at Winterfell

A ward can easily become a hostage if need be She had not known that Ser Stevron was dead nor of Bolton’s marriage

If we’re two hostages to the good all the more reason Lord Walder dare not play us false Bolton needs Frey’s men and Ser Helman’s as well I’ve commanded him to retake Harrenhal

That’s like to be a bloody business

Yes but once the castle falls Lord Tywin will have no safe retreat My own levies will defend the fords of Red Fork against his crossing If he attacks across the river he’ll end as Rhaegar did when he tried to cross the Trident If he holds back he’ll be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal and when Robb returns from the west we can finish him for good and all

Her brother’s voice was full of brusque confidence but Catelyn found herself wishing that Robb had not taken her uncle Brynden west with him The Blackfish was the veteran of half a hundred battles Edmure was the veteran of one and that one lost

The plan’s a good one he concluded Lord Tytos says so and Lord Jonos as well When did Blackwood and Bracken agree about anything that was not certain I ask you

Be that as it may She was suddenly weary Perhaps she was wrong to oppose him Perhaps it was a splendid plan and her misgivings only a woman’s fears She wished Ned were here or her uncle Brynden or…Have you asked Father about this

Father is in no state to weigh strategies Two days ago he was making plans for your marriage to Brandon Stark Go see him yourself if you do not believe me This plan will work Cat you’ll see

I hope so Edmure I truly do She kissed him on the cheek to let him know she meant it and went to find her father

Lord Hoster Tully was much as she had left him—abed haggard flesh pale and clammy The room smelled of sickness a cloying odor made up in equal parts of stale sweat and medicine When she pulled back the drapes her father gave a low moan and his eyes fluttered open He stared at her as if he could not comprehend who she was or what she wanted

Father She kissed him I am returned

He seemed to know her then You’ve come he whispered faintly lips barely moving

Yes she said Robb sent me south but I hurried back

South… where… is the Eyrie south sweetling I don’t recall… oh dear heart I was afraid… have you forgiven me child Tears ran down his cheeks

You’ve done nothing that needs forgiveness Father She stroked his limp white hair and felt his brow The fever still burned him from within despite all the maester’s potions
