A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin’s Tower for Ghost The direwolf walked beside him to the stables Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered Jon saddled his mare mounted and rode out from Castle Black south across the moonlit night Ghost raced ahead of him flying over the ground gone in the blink of an eye Jon let him go A wolf needed to hunt

He had no destination in mind He wanted only to ride He followed the creek for a time listening to the icy trickle of water over rock then cut across the fields to the kingsroad It stretched out before him narrow and stony and pocked with weeds a road of no particular promise yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing Winterfell was down that road and beyond it Riverrun and King’s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places Casterly Rock the Isle of Faces the red mountains of Dorne the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea the smoking ruins of old Valyria All the places that Jon would never see The world was down that road… and he was here

Once he swore his vow the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon I have not sworn yet he muttered He was no outlaw bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes He had come here freely and he might leave freely… until he said the words He need only ride on and he could leave it all behind By the time the moon was full again he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers

Your half brothers a voice inside reminded him And Lady Stark who will not welcome you There was no place for him in Winterfell no place in King’s Landing either Even his own mother had not had a place for him The thought of her made him sad He wondered who she had been what she had looked like why his father had left her Because she was a whore or an adulteress fool Something dark and dishonorable or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her

Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill but the Wall was there pale beneath the moon vast and cold running from horizon to horizon

He wheeled his horse around and started for home

Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander’s Tower The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back By the time he reached the stables he knew what he must do

Maester Aemon’s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery Aged and frail the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night’s Watch being blind he was spared having to look at them Clydas was short bald and chinless with small pink eyes like a mole Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon’s egg and a face red with boils and pimples Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry

It was Chett who answered Jon’s knock I need to speak to Maester Aemon Jon told him

The maester is abed as you should be Come back on the morrow and maybe he’ll see you He began to shut the door

Jon jammed it open with his boot I need to speak to him now The morning will be too late

Chett scowled The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night Do you know how old he is

Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you Jon said Give him my pardons I would not disturb his rest if it were not important

And if I refuse

Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door I can stand here all night if I must

The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him Wait in the library There’s wood Start a fire I won’t have the maester catching a chill on account of you

Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon The old man was clad in his bed robe but around his throat was the chain collar of his order A maester did not remove it even to sleep The chair beside the fire would be pleasant he said when he felt the warmth on his face When he was settled comfortably Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door

I am sorry to have woken you Maester Jon Snow said

You did not wake me Maester Aemon replied I find I need less sleep as I grow older and I am grown very old I often spend half the night with ghosts remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion So tell me Jon Snow why have you come calling at this strange hour

To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night’s Watch

This is no concern of Maester Aemon Chett complained

Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne the maester said gently Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow as you surely know Why then come to me

The Lord Commander listens to you Jon told him And the wounded and the sick of the Night’s Watch are in your charge

And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick

He will be Jon promised unless you help

He told them all of it even the part where he’d set Ghost at Rast’s throat Maester Aemon listened silently blind eyes fixed on the fire but Chett’s face darkened with each word Without us to keep him safe Sam will have no chance Jon finished He’s hopeless with a sword My sister Arya could tear him apart and she’s not yet ten If Ser Alliser makes him fight it’s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed

Chett could stand no more I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall he said He is a pig and a hopeless craven as well if what you say is true
