wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and
their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any
more at all

3113 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and
old together for I will turn their mourning into joy and will
comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow

3114 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my
people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the LORD

3115 Thus saith the LORD A voice was heard in Ramah lamentation
and bitter weeping Rahel weeping for her children refused to be
comforted for her children because they were not

3116 Thus saith the LORD Refrain thy voice from weeping and thine
eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the LORD and
they shall come again from the land of the enemy

3117 And there is hope in thine end saith the LORD that thy
children shall come again to their own border

3118 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus Thou hast
chastised me and I was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke turn thou me and I shall be turned for thou art the LORD my
God

3119 Surely after that I was turned I repented and after that I was
instructed I smote upon my thigh I was ashamed yea even
confounded because I did bear the reproach of my youth

3120 Is Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since I
spake against him I do earnestly remember him still therefore my
bowels are troubled for him I will surely have mercy upon him saith
the LORD

3121 Set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart
toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again O
virgin of Israel turn again to these thy cities

3122 How long wilt thou go about O thou backsliding daughter for
the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth A woman shall compass
a man

3123 Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel As yet they
shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof
when I shall bring again their captivity The LORD bless thee O
habitation of justice and mountain of holiness

3124 And there shall dwell in Judah itself and in all the cities
thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks

3125 For I have satiated the weary soul and I have replenished every
sorrowful soul

3126 Upon this I awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me

3127 Behold the days come saith the LORD that I will sow the house
of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the
seed of beast

3128 And it shall come to pass that like as I have watched over
them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to
destroy and to afflict so will I watch over them to build and to
plant saith the LORD

3129 In those days they shall say no more The fathers have eaten a
sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge

3130 But every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that
eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge

3131 Behold the days come saith the LORD that I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah 3132
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the
day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
Egypt which my covenant they brake although I was an husband unto
them saith the LORD 3133 But this shall be the covenant that I will
make with the house of Israel After those days saith the LORD I
will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts
and will be their God and they shall be my people

3134 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every
man his brother saying Know the LORD for they shall all know me
from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the LORD for
I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more

3135 Thus saith the LORD which giveth the sun for a light by day
and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night
which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar The LORD of hosts
is his name 3136 If those ordinances depart from before me saith
the LORD then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
before me for ever

3137 Thus saith the LORD If heaven above can be measured and the
foundations of the earth searched out beneath I will also cast off
all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the LORD

3138 Behold the days come saith the LORD that the city shall be
built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the
