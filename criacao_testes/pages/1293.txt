Not the Mother of Dragons

Not even for twenty ships

Not for a hundred

His mouth curled downward I do not have a hundred But you have three dragons Grant me one for all my kindnesses You will still have two and thirty ships as well

Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros But I do not have a small army How many ships do you own Xaro

Eighty-three if one does not count my pleasure barge

And your colleagues in the Thirteen

Among us all perhaps a thousand

And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Their trifling fleets are of no account

Even so she said tell me

Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood

And the Asshai’i the Braavosi the Summer Islanders the Ibbenese and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea how many ships do they have All together

Many and more he said irritably What does this matter

I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world Dany smiled at him sweetly it seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair

Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose Did I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust This is the very thing I feared The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife A third of all the ships in the world Pah Pah I say Pah

Dany had not seen him since His seneschal brought her messages each cooler than the last She must quit his house He was done feeding her and her people He demanded the return of his gifts which she had accepted in bad faith Her only consolation was that at least she’d had the great good sense not to marry him

The warlocks whispered of three treasons… once for blood and once for gold and once for love The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third She did not think so What Pyat did was not for gold and Xaro had never truly loved her

The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side Her bell rang softly and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth Child of three they had called her daughter of death slayer of lies bride of fire So many threes Three fires three mounts to ride three treasons The dragon has three heads she sighed Do you know what that means Jorah

Your Grace The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon red on black

I know that But there are no three-headed dragons

The three heads were Aegon and his sisters

Visenya and Rhaenys she recalled I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys

Blue lips speak only lies isn’t that what Xaro told you Why do you care what the warlocks whispered All they wanted was to suck the life from you you know that now

Perhaps she said reluctantly Yet the things I saw…

A dead man in the prow of a ship a blue rose a banquet of blood… what does any of it mean Khaleesi A mummer’s dragon you said What is a mummer’s dragon pray

A cloth dragon on poles Dany explained Mummers use them in their follies to give the heroes something to fight

Ser Jorah frowned

Dany could not let it go His is the song of ice and fire my brother said I’m certain it was my brother Not Viserys Rhaegar He had a harp with silver strings

Ser Jorah’s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together Prince Rhaegar played such a harp he conceded You saw him

She nodded There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon

Prince Aegon was Rhaegar’s heir by Elia of Dorne Ser Jorah said But if he was this prince that was promised the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall

I remember Dany said sadly They murdered Rhaegar’s daughter as well the little princess Rhaenys she was named like Aegon’s sister There was no Visenya but he said the dragon has three heads What is the song of ice and fire

It’s no song I’ve ever heard

I went to the warlocks hoping for answers but instead they’ve left me with a hundred new questions

By then there were people in the streets once more Make way Aggo shouted while Jhogo sniffed at the air suspiciously I smell it Khaleesi he called The poison water The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon it Water that a horse could not drink was water they wanted no part of They will learn Dany resolved I braved their sea with Khal Drogo Now they can brave mine

Qarth was one of the world’s great ports its great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells Winesinks warehouses and gaming dens lined the streets cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods Cutpurses cutthroats spellsellers and moneychangers mingled with every crowd The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar if a man did not ask where they came from Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat’s milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders Seamen from half a hundred nations wandered amongst the stalls drinking spiced liquors and trading jokes in queer-sounding tongues The air smelled of salt and frying fish of hot tar and honey of incense and oil and sperm

Aggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled them as he rode Jhogo bought a handful of fat white cherries Elsewhere they saw beautiful bronze daggers for sale dried squids and carved onyx a potent magical elixir made of virgin’s milk and shade of the evening even dragon’s eggs which looked suspiciously like painted rocks

As they passed the long stone quays reserved for the ships of the Thirteen she saw chests of saffron frankincense and pepper being off-loaded from Xaro’s ornate Vermillion Kiss Beside her casks of wine bales of sourleaf and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure to sail on the evening tide Farther along a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves It was well known that the cheapest place to buy a slave was right off the ship and the banners floating from her masts proclaimed that the Sunblaze had just arrived from Astapor on Slaver’s Bay

Dany would get no help from the Thirteen the Tourmaline Brotherhood or the Ancient Guild of Spicers She rode her silver past several miles of their quays docks and storehouses all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer Islands Westeros and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock

She dismounted beside a gaming pit where a basilisk was tearing a big red dog to pieces amidst a shouting ring of sailors Aggo Jhogo you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the captains

As you say Khaleesi We will watch you as you go

It was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more and even the Common Tongue Dany thought as they approached the first ship Sailors dockworkers and merchants alike gave way before her not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side Despite the heat of the day Ser Jorah wore his green wool surcoat over chainmail the black bear of Mormont sewn on his chest

But neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships they needed

You require passage for a hundred Dothraki all their horses yourself and this knight and three dragons said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before he walked away laughing When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn Queen of the Seven Kingdoms he gave her a deadface look and said Aye and I’m Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire The owner of Lord Faro’s Belly would risk dragons but not Dothraki I’ll have no such godless savages in my Belly I’ll not The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means and might have been beyond Xaro’s Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for her needs Bravo was bound for the Jade Sea and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy

As they made their way toward the next quay Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of her back Your Grace You are being followed No do not turn He guided her gently toward a brass-seller’s booth This is a noble work my queen he proclaimed loudly lifting a large platter for her inspection See how it shines in the sun

The brass was polished to a high sheen Dany could see her face in it… and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right she could see behind her I see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff Which is it

Both of them Ser Jorah said They have been following us since we left Quicksilver

The ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly making one man seem long and gaunt the other immensely squat and broad A most excellent brass great lady the merchant exclaimed Bright as the sun And for the Mother of Dragons only thirty honors

The platter was worth no more than three Where are my guards Dany declared This man is trying to rob me For Jorah she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue They may not mean me ill Men have looked at women since time began perhaps it is no more than that
