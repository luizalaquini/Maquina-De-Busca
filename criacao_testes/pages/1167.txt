Aerion the Monstrous Jon knew that name The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon was one of Old Nan’s more gruesome tales His little brother Bran had loved it

The very one though he named himself Aerion Brightflame One night in his cups he drank a jar of wildfire after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse Not quite a year after King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord

Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm his own maester had seen to that That was the year of the Great Council he said The lords passed over Prince Aerion’s infant son and Prince Daeron’s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon

Yes and no First they offered it quietly to Aemon And quietly he refused The gods meant for him to serve not to rule he told them He had sworn a vow and would not break it though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him Well no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion’s on the throne and Daeron’s girl was a lackwit besides being female so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon’s younger brother—Aegon the Fifth of His Name Aegon the Unlikely they called him born the fourth son of a fourth son Aemon knew and rightly that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother’s rule would seek to use him so he came to the Wall And here he has remained while his brother and his brother’s son and his son each reigned and died in turn until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings

King croaked the raven The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont’s shoulder King it said again strutting back and forth

He likes that word Jon said smiling

An easy word to say An easy word to like

King the bird said again

I think he means for you to have a crown my lord

The realm has three kings already and that’s two too many for my liking Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow

It made him feel odd My lord why have you told me this about Maester Aemon

Must I have a reason Mormont shifted in his seat frowning Your brother Robb has been crowned King in the North You and Aemon have that in common A king for a brother

And this too said Jon A vow

The Old Bear gave a loud snort and the raven took flight flapping in a circle about the room Give me a man for every vow I’ve seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders

I’ve always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell

Mormont gave a whistle and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm A lord’s one thing a king’s another He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket They will garb your brother Robb in silks satins and velvets of a hundred different colors while you live and die in black ringmail He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her You’ll have no wife nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms Robb will rule you will serve Men will call you a crow Him they’ll call Your Grace Singers will praise every little thing he does while your greatest deeds all go unsung Tell me that none of this troubles you Jon… and I’ll name you a liar and know I have the truth of it

Jon drew himself up taut as a bowstring And if it did trouble me what might I do bastard as I am

What will you do Mormont asked Bastard as you are

Be troubled said Jon and keep my vows





CATELYN

Her son’s crown was fresh from the forge and it seemed to Catelyn Stark that the weight of it pressed heavy on Robb’s head

The ancient crown of the Kings of Winter had been lost three centuries ago yielded up to Aegon the Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission What Aegon had done with it no man could say Lord Hoster’s smith had done his work well and Robb’s crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords Of gold and silver and gemstones it had none bronze and iron were the metals of winter dark and strong to fight against the cold

As they waited in Riverrun’s Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them she saw Robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair moments later he moved it forward again later he gave it a quarter turn as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow It is no easy thing to wear a crown Catelyn thought watching especially for a boy of fifteen years

When the guards brought in the captive Robb called for his sword Olyvar Frey offered it up hilt first and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees a threat plain for all to see Your Grace here is the man you asked for announced Ser Robin Ryger captain of the Tully household guard

Kneel before the king Lannister Theon Greyjoy shouted Ser Robin forced the prisoner to his knees

He did not look a lion Catelyn reflected This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady Genna who was sister to Lord Tywin Lannister but he had none of the fabled Lannister beauty the fair hair and green eyes Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks weak chin and thin face of his sire Ser Emmon Frey old Lord Walder’s second son His eyes were pale and watery and he could not seem to stop blinking but perhaps that was only the light The cells below Riverrun were dark and damp… and these days crowded as well

Rise Ser Cleos Her son’s voice was not as icy as his father’s would have been but he did not sound a boy of fifteen either War had made a man of him before his time Morning light glimmered faintly against the edge of the steel across his knees

Yet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious it was the beast Grey Wind her son had named him A direwolf large as any elkhound lean and smoke-dark with eyes like molten gold When the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight every man in that hall could smell the scent of fear Ser Cleos had been taken during the battle in the Whispering Wood where Grey Wind had ripped out the throats of half a dozen men

The knight scrambled up edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers laughed aloud Thank you my lord

Your Grace barked Lord Umber the Greatjon ever the loudest of Robb’s northern bannermen… and the truest and fiercest as well or so he insisted He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the North and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-made sovereign

Your Grace Ser Cleos corrected hastily Pardons

He is not a bold man this one Catelyn thought More of a Frey than a Lannister in truth His cousin the Kingslayer would have been a much different matter They would never have gotten that honorific through Ser Jaime Lannister’s perfect teeth

I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in King’s Landing You’ll travel under a peace banner with thirty of my best men to escort you

Ser Cleos was visibly relieved Then I should be most glad to bring His Grace’s message to the queen

Understand Robb said I am not giving you your freedom Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged me his support and that of House Frey Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering Wood but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner That makes you a Lannister not a Frey I want your pledge on your honor as a knight that after you deliver my message you’ll return with the queen’s reply and resume your captivity

Ser Cleos answered at once I do so vow

Every man in this hall has heard you warned Catelyn’s brother Ser Edmure Tully who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father If you do not return the whole realm will know you forsworn

I will do as I pledged Ser Cleos replied stiffly What is this message 

An offer of peace Robb stood longsword in hand Grey Wind moved to his side The hall grew hushed Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms I will sheath this sword and make an end to the war between us

In the back of the hall Catelyn glimpsed the tall gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark shove through a rank of guards and out the door No one else moved Robb paid the disruption no mind Olyvar the paper he commanded The squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment

Robb unrolled it First the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from King’s Landing to White Harbor It is to be understood that Sansa’s betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon is at an end When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell I will release the queen’s cousins the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey and give them safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered

Catelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips

Secondly my lord father’s bones will be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell as he would have wished The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King’s Landing must also be returned

Living men had gone south and cold bones would return Ned had the truth of it she thought His place was at Winterfell he said as much but would I hear him No Go I told him you must be Robert’s Hand for the good of our House for the sake of our children… my doing mine no other…

Third my father’s greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand here at Riverrun

She watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt his face as still as stone

Fourth the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident Once he does so I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps save Jaime Lannister alone who will remain my hostage for his father’s good behavior

She studied Theon Greyjoy’s sly smile wondering what it meant That young man had a way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to Catelyn had never liked it
