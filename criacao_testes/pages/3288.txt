nourished by the kings country

1221 And upon a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his
throne and made an oration unto them

1222 And the people gave a shout saying It is the voice of a god
and not of a man

1223 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave
not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost

1224 But the word of God grew and multiplied

1225 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had
fulfilled their ministry and took with them John whose surname was
Mark

131 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and
Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen which had been brought up with Herod the
tetrarch and Saul

132 As they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
them

133 And when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on
them they sent them away

134 So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed unto
Seleucia and from thence they sailed to Cyprus

135 And when they were at Salamis they preached the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews and they had also John to their minister

136 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos they found a
certain sorcerer a false prophet a Jew whose name was Barjesus
137 Which was with the deputy of the country Sergius Paulus a
prudent man who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the
word of God

138 But Elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation
withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith

139 Then Saul who also is called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost
set his eyes on him

1310 And said O full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of
the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to
pervert the right ways of the Lord  1311 And now behold the hand
of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun
for a season And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand

1312 Then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord

1313 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos they came to
Perga in Pamphylia and John departing from them returned to
Jerusalem

1314 But when they departed from Perga they came to Antioch in
Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down

1315 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent unto them saying Ye men and brethren if ye have
any word of exhortation for the people say on

1316 Then Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said Men of
Israel and ye that fear God give audience

1317 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted
the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with
an high arm brought he them out of it

1318 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
the wilderness

1319 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan
he divided their land to them by lot

1320 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
hundred and fifty years until Samuel the prophet

1321 And afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul
the son of Cis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of forty
years

1322 And when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be
their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said I have
found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall
fulfil all my will

1323 Of this mans seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
Israel a Saviour Jesus 1324 When John had first preached before his
coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel

1325 And as John fulfilled his course he said Whom think ye that I
am  I am not he But behold there cometh one after me whose shoes
of his feet I am not worthy to loose
