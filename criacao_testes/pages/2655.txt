1917 And Saul said unto Michal Why hast thou deceived me so and
sent away mine enemy that he is escaped And Michal answered Saul He
said unto me Let me go why should I kill thee  1918 So David fled
and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told him all that Saul
had done to him And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth

1919 And it was told Saul saying Behold David is at Naioth in
Ramah

1920 And Saul sent messengers to take David and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as appointed
over them the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul and they
also prophesied

1921 And when it was told Saul he sent other messengers and they
prophesied likewise And Saul sent messengers again the third time
and they prophesied also

1922 Then went he also to Ramah and came to a great well that is in
Sechu and he asked and said Where are Samuel and David And one
said Behold they be at Naioth in Ramah

1923 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God
was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to
Naioth in Ramah

1924 And he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before
Samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that
night Wherefore they say Is Saul also among the prophets  201 And
David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan
What have I done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy
father that he seeketh my life  202 And he said unto him God
forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either
great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father
hide this thing from me it is not so

203 And David sware moreover and said Thy father certainly knoweth
that I have found grace in thine eyes and he saith Let not Jonathan
know this lest he be grieved but truly as the LORD liveth and as
thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death

204 Then said Jonathan unto David Whatsoever thy soul desireth I
will even do it for thee

205 And David said unto Jonathan Behold to morrow is the new moon
and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go
that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even

206 If thy father at all miss me then say David earnestly asked
leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city for there is a
yearly sacrifice there for all the family

207 If he say thus It is well thy servant shall have peace but if
he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him

208 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast
brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee
notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why
shouldest thou bring me to thy father  209 And Jonathan said Far be
it from thee for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my
father to come upon thee then would not I tell it thee  2010 Then
said David to Jonathan Who shall tell me or what if thy father
answer thee roughly  2011 And Jonathan said unto David Come and
let us go out into the field And they went out both of them into the
field

2012 And Jonathan said unto David O LORD God of Israel when I have
sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and
behold if there be good toward David and I then send not unto thee
and shew it thee 2013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan but
if it please my father to do thee evil then I will shew it thee and
send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the LORD be with
thee as he hath been with my father

2014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
the LORD that I die not 2015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy
kindness from my house for ever no not when the LORD hath cut off
the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth

2016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David saying Let
the LORD even require it at the hand of Davids enemies

2017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again because he loved him
for he loved him as he loved his own soul

2018 Then Jonathan said to David To morrow is the new moon and thou
shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty

2019 And when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down
quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone Ezel

2020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though I
shot at a mark

2021 And behold I will send a lad saying Go find out the arrows
If I expressly say unto the lad Behold the arrows are on this side
of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no
hurt as the LORD liveth
