316 Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them
The LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of
Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen
that which is done to you in Egypt 317 And I have said I will bring
you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the
Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey

318 And they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou
and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say
unto him The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us
go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we
may sacrifice to the LORD our God

319 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not
by a mighty hand

320 And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my
wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and after that he will
let you go

321 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians
and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty

322 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that
sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your
daughters and ye shall spoil the Egyptians

41 And Moses answered and said But behold they will not believe
me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say The LORD hath not
appeared unto thee

42 And the LORD said unto him What is that in thine hand And he
said A rod

43 And he said Cast it on the ground And he cast it on the ground
and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it

44 And the LORD said unto Moses Put forth thine hand and take it by
the tail And he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a
rod in his hand 45 That they may believe that the LORD God of their
fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
hath appeared unto thee

46 And the LORD said furthermore unto him Put now thine hand into
thy bosom And he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it
out behold his hand was leprous as snow

47 And he said Put thine hand into thy bosom again And he put his
hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and
behold it was turned again as his other flesh

48 And it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither
hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign

49 And it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two
signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the
water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land

410 And Moses said unto the LORD O my LORD I am not eloquent
neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but I
am slow of speech and of a slow tongue

411 And the LORD said unto him Who hath made mans mouth or who
maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the
LORD  412 Now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach
thee what thou shalt say

413 And he said O my LORD send I pray thee by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send

414 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said
Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother I know that he can speak well
And also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth
thee he will be glad in his heart

415 And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and I
will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye
shall do

416 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him
instead of God

417 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt
do signs

418 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law and said
unto him Let me go I pray thee and return unto my brethren which
are in Egypt and see whether they be yet alive And Jethro said to
Moses Go in peace

419 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian Go return into Egypt
for all the men are dead which sought thy life

420 And Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass
and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the rod of God in
