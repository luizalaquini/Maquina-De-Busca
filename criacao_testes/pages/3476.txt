My lord Poole said he commanded us to send you to him the moment you opened your eyes The steward busied himself lighting a bedside candle

Ned cursed softly Robert was never known for his patience Tell him I’m too weak to come to him If he wishes to speak with me I should be pleased to receive him here I hope you wake him from a sound sleep And summon… He was about to say Jory when he remembered Summon the captain of my guard

Alyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken his leave My lord

Poole tells me it has been six days Ned said I must know how things stand

The Kingslayer is fled the city Alyn told him The talk is he’s ridden back to Casterly Rock to join his father The story of how Lady Catelyn took the Imp is on every lip I have put on extra guards if it please you

It does Ned assured him My daughters

They have been with you every day my lord Sansa prays quietly but Arya… He hesitated She has not said a word since they brought you back She is a fierce little thing my lord I have never seen such anger in a girl

Whatever happens Ned said I want my daughters kept safe I fear this is only the beginning

No harm will come to them Lord Eddard Alyn said I stake my life on that

Jory and the others…

I gave them over to the silent sisters to be sent north to Winterfell Jory would want to lie beside his grandfather

It would have to be his grandfather for Jory’s father was buried far to the south Martyn Cassel had perished with the rest Ned had pulled the tower down afterward and used its bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge It was said that Rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy but for Ned it was a bitter memory They had been seven against three yet only two had lived to ride away Eddard Stark himself and the little crannogman Howland Reed He did not think it omened well that he should dream that dream again after so many years

You’ve done well Alyn Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned The steward bowed low His Grace is without my lord and the queen with him

Ned pushed himself up higher wincing as his leg trembled with pain He had not expected Cersei to come It did not bode well that she had Send them in and leave us What we have to say should not go beyond these walls Poole withdrew quietly

Robert had taken time to dress He wore a black velvet doublet with the crowned stag of Baratheon worked upon the breast in golden thread and a golden mantle with a cloak of black and gold squares A flagon of wine was in his hand his face already flushed from drink Cersei Lannister entered behind him a jeweled tiara in her hair

Your Grace Ned said Your pardons I cannot rise

No matter the king said gruffly Some wine From the Arbor A good vintage

A small cup Ned said My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy

A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders the queen declared

Quiet woman Robert snapped He brought Ned a cup of wine Does the leg still pain you

Some Ned said His head was swimming but it would not do to admit to weakness in front of the queen

Pycelle swears it will heal clean Robert frowned I take it you know what Catelyn has done

I do Ned took a small swallow of wine My lady wife is blameless Your Grace All she did she did at my command

I am not pleased Ned Robert grumbled

By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood Cersei demanded Who do you think you are

The Hand of the King Ned told her with icy courtesy Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king’s peace and enforce the king’s justice

You were the Hand Cersei began but now—

Silence the king roared You asked him a question and he answered it Cersei subsided cold with anger and Robert turned back to Ned Keep the king’s peace you say Is this how you keep my peace Ned Seven men are dead…

Eight the queen corrected Tregar died this morning of the blow Lord Stark gave him

Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets the king said I will not have it Ned

Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp—

I said I will not have it To hell with her reasons You will command her to release the dwarf at once and you will make your peace with Jaime

Three of my men were butchered before my eyes because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me Am I to forget that

My brother was not the cause of this quarrel Cersei told the king Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel His men attacked Jaime and his guards even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad

You know me better than that Robert Ned said Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me He was there

I’ve talked to Littlefinger Robert said He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse

Some whorehouse Damn your eyes Robert I went there to have a look at your daughter Her mother has named her Barra She looks like that first girl you fathered when we were boys together in the Vale He watched the queen as he spoke her face was a mask still and pale betraying nothing

Robert flushed Barra he grumbled Is that supposed to please me Damn the girl I thought she had more sense

She cannot be more than fifteen and a whore and you thought she had sense Ned said incredulous His leg was beginning to pain him sorely It was hard to keep his temper The fool child is in love with you Robert

The king glanced at Cersei This is no fit subject for the queen’s ears

Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say Ned replied I am told the Kingslayer has fled the city Give me leave to bring him back to justice

The king swirled the wine in his cup brooding He took a swallow No he said I want no more of this Jaime slew three of your men and you five of his Now it ends

Is that your notion of justice Ned flared If so I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand

The queen looked to her husband If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to you—

Do you take me for Aerys Robert interrupted

I took you for a king Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers by all the laws of marriage and the bonds we share The Starks have driven off the one and seized the other This man dishonors you with every breath he takes and yet you stand there meekly asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine

Robert’s face was dark with anger How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue woman

Cersei’s face was a study in contempt What a jape the gods have made of us two she said By all rights you ought to be in skirts and me in mail

Purple with rage the king lashed out a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head She stumbled against the table and fell hard yet Cersei Lannister did not cry out Her slender fingers brushed her cheek where the pale smooth skin was already reddening On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face I shall wear this as a badge of honor she announced

Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again Robert vowed He shouted for a guard Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room tall and somber in his white armor The queen is tired See her to her bedchamber The knight helped Cersei to her feet and led her out without a word
