256 For thus saith the Lord GOD Because thou hast clapped thine
hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy
despite against the land of Israel 257 Behold therefore I will
stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to
the heathen and I will cut thee off from the people and I will cause
thee to perish out of the countries I will destroy thee and thou
shalt know that I am the LORD

258 Thus saith the Lord GOD Because that Moab and Seir do say
Behold the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen 259
Therefore behold I will open the side of Moab from the cities from
his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country
Bethjeshimoth Baalmeon and Kiriathaim 2510 Unto the men of the
east with the Ammonites and will give them in possession that the
Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations

2511 And I will execute judgments upon Moab and they shall know that
I am the LORD

2512 Thus saith the Lord GOD Because that Edom hath dealt against
the house of Judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and
revenged himself upon them 2513 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD I
will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom and will cut off man and
beast from it and I will make it desolate from Teman and they of
Dedan shall fall by the sword

2514 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
Israel and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and
according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the Lord
GOD

2515 Thus saith the Lord GOD Because the Philistines have dealt by
revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy
it for the old hatred 2516 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD
Behold I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines and I will
cut off the Cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast

2517 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
rebukes and they shall know that I am the LORD when I shall lay my
vengeance upon them

261 And it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the
month that the word of the LORD came unto me saying 262 Son of
man because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem Aha she is
broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me I
shall be replenished now she is laid waste 263 Therefore thus saith
the Lord GOD Behold I am against thee O Tyrus and will cause many
nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come
up

264 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus and break down her
towers I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the
top of a rock

265 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
sea for I have spoken it saith the Lord GOD and it shall become a
spoil to the nations

266 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
sword and they shall know that I am the LORD

267 For thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I will bring upon Tyrus
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon a king of kings from the north with
horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much
people

268 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he
shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and
lift up the buckler against thee

269 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his
axes he shall break down thy towers

2610 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the
wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as
men enter into a city wherein is made a breach

2611 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong
garrisons shall go down to the ground

2612 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of
thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy
pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy
dust in the midst of the water

2613 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound
of thy harps shall be no more heard

2614 And I will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a
place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for I the LORD
have spoken it saith the Lord GOD

2615 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus Shall not the isles shake at
the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is
made in the midst of thee  2616 Then all the princes of the sea
shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put
off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with
