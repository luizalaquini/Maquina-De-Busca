Robb Stark seemed puzzled Is this some trap Lannister What’s Bran to you Why should you want to help him

Your brother Jon asked it of me And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned

The door to the yard flew open Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in breathless The direwolves were with him The boy stopped by the door wide-eyed but the wolves came on Their eyes found Lannister or perhaps they caught his scent Summer began to growl first Grey Wind picked it up They padded toward the little man one from the right and one from the left

The wolves do not like your smell Lannister Theon Greyioy commented

Perhaps it’s time I took my leave Tyrion said He took a step backward… and Shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him snarling Lannister recoiled and Summer lunged at him from the other side He reeled away unsteady on his feet and Grey Wind snapped at his arm teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth

No Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister’s men reached for their steel Summer here Summer to me

The direwolf heard the voice glanced at Bran and again at Lannister He crept backward away from the little man and settled down below Bran’s dangling feet

Robb had been holding his breath He let it out with a sigh and called Grey Wind His direwolf moved to him swift and silent Now there was only Shaggydog rumbling at the small man his eyes burning like green fire

Rickon call him Bran shouted to his baby brother and Rickon remembered himself and screamed Home Shaggy home now The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon who hugged him tightly around the neck

Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf mopped at his brow and said in a flat voice How interesting

Are you well my lord asked one of his men his sword in hand He glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke

My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp but nothing was harmed save my dignity

Even Robb looked shaken The wolves… I don’t know why they did that…

No doubt they mistook me for dinner Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran I thank you for calling them off young ser I promise you they would have found me quite indigestible And now I will be leaving truly

A moment my lord Maester Luwin said He moved to Robb and they huddled close together whispering Bran tried to hear what they were saying but their voices were too low

Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword I… I may have been hasty with you he said You’ve done Bran a kindness and well… Robb composed himself with an effort The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it Lannister

Spare me your false courtesies boy You do not love me and you do not want me here I saw an inn outside your walls in the winter town I’ll find a bed there and both of us will sleep easier For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me He spoke to one of the black brothers an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard Yoren we go south at daybreak You will find me on the road no doubt With that he made his exit struggling across the hall on his short legs past Rickon and out the door His men followed

The four of the Night’s Watch remained Robb turned to them uncertainly I have had rooms prepared and you’ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road I hope you will honor us at table tonight He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note it was a speech he had learned not words from the heart but the black brothers thanked him all the same

Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed Old Nan was asleep in her chair Hodor said Hodor gathered up his great-grandmother and carried her off snoring softly while Bran lay thinking Robb had promised that he could feast with the Night’s Watch in the Great Hall Summer he called The wolf bounded up on the bed Bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek I can ride now he whispered to his friend We can go hunting in the woods soon wait and see After a time he slept

In his dream he was climbing again pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones his feet scrabbling for purchase Higher and higher he climbed through the clouds and into the night sky and still the tower rose before him When he paused to look down his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping Bran cried out and clung for dear life The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly He could not fly He waited until his heart had stopped pounding until he could breathe and he began to climb again There was no way to go but up Far above him outlined against a vast pale moon he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles His arms were sore and aching but he dared not rest He forced himself to climb faster The gargoyles watched him ascend Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier Perhaps once they had been lions but now they were twisted and grotesque Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear He must not listen he told himself he must not hear so long as he did not hear them he was safe But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung he knew he was not safe after all I didn’t hear he wept as they came closer and closer I didn’t I didn’t

He woke gasping lost in darkness and saw a vast shadow looming over him I didn’t hear he whispered trembling in fear but then the shadow said Hodor and lit the candle by the bedside and Bran sighed with relief

Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands When it was time he carried him down to the Great Hall where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire The lord’s seat at the head of the table had been left empty but Robb sat to the right of it with Bran across from him They ate suckling pig that night and pigeon pie and turnips soaking in butter and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs Summer snatched table scraps from Bran’s hand while Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner Winterfell’s dogs would not come near the hall now Bran had found that strange at first but he was growing used to it

Yoren was senior among the black brothers so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester Luwin The old man had a sour smell as if he had not washed in a long time He ripped at the meat with his teeth cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow Ser Alliser’s bane he grunted and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen the black brothers grew ominously quiet

What is it Bran asked

Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest There’s hard news m’lords and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead but the man as asks the question must bear the answer Stark’s gone

One of the other men said The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce and he’s late returning my lord

Too long Yoren said Most like he’s dead
