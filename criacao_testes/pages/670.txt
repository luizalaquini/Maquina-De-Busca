My elders talk too much and I don’t need you to tell me to drink my ale He took a big swallow to show that it was so

Arya did the same After days of drinking from brooks and puddles and then the muddy Trident the ale tasted as good as the little sips of wine her father used to allow her A smell was drifting out from the kitchen that made her mouth water but her thoughts were still full of that boat Sailing it will be harder than stealing it If we wait until they’re all asleep…

The serving boy reappeared with big round loaves of bread Arya broke off a chunk hungrily and tore into it It was hard to chew though sort of thick and lumpy and burned on the bottom

Hot Pie made a face as soon as he tasted it That’s bad bread he said It’s burned and tough besides

It’s better when there’s stew to sop up said Lem

No it isn’t said Anguy but you’re less like to break your teeth

You can eat it or go hungry said Husband Do I look like some bloody baker I’d like to see you make better

I could said Hot Pie It’s easy You kneaded the dough too much that’s why it’s so hard to chew He took another sip of ale and began talking lovingly of breads and pies and tarts all the things he loved Arya rolled her eyes

Tom sat down across from her Squab he said or Arry or whatever your true name might be this is for you He placed a dirty scrap of parchment on the wooden tabletop between them

She looked at it suspiciously What is it

Three golden dragons We need to buy those horses

Arya looked at him warily They’re our horses

Meaning you stole them yourselves is that it No shame in that girl War makes thieves of many honest folk Tom tapped the folded parchment with his finger I’m paying you a handsome price More than any horse is worth if truth be told

Hot Pie grabbed the parchment and unfolded it There’s no gold he complained loudly It’s only writing

Aye said Tom and I’m sorry for that But after the war we mean to make that good you have my word as a king’s man

Arya pushed back from the table and got to her feet You’re no king’s men you’re robbers

If you’d ever met a true robber you’d know they do not pay not even in paper It’s not for us we take your horses child it’s for the good of the realm so we can get about more quickly and fight the fights that need fighting The king’s fights Would you deny the king

They were all watching her the Archer big Lem Husband with his sallow face and shifty eyes Even Sharna who stood in the door to the kitchen squinting They are going to take our horses no matter what I say she realized We’ll need to walk to Riverrun unless… We don’t want paper Arya slapped the parchment out of Hot Pie’s hand You can have our horses for that boat outside But only if you show us how to work it

Tom Sevenstrings stared at her a moment and then his wide homely mouth quirked into a rueful grin He laughed aloud Anguy joined in and then they were all laughing Lem Lemoncloak Sharna and Husband even the serving boy who had stepped out from behind the casks with a crossbow under one arm Arya wanted to scream at them but instead she started to smile…

Riders Gendry’s shout was shrill with alarm The door burst open and there he was Soldiers he panted Coming down the river road a dozen of them

Hot Pie leapt up knocking over his tankard but Tom and the others were unpertubed There’s no cause for spilling good ale on my floor said Sharna Sit back down and calm yourself boy there’s rabbit coming You too girl Whatever harm’s been done you it’s over and it’s done and you’re with king’s men now We’ll keep you safe as best we can

Arya’s only answer was to reach over her shoulder for her sword but before she had it halfway drawn Lem grabbed her wrist We’ll have no more of that now He twisted her arm until her hand opened His fingers were hard with callus and fearsomely strong Again Arya thought It’s happening again like it happened in the village with Chiswyck and Raff and the Mountain That Rides They were going to steal her sword and turn her back into a mouse Her free hand closed around her tankard and she swung it at Lem’s face The ale sloshed over the rim and splashed into his eyes and she heard his nose break and saw the spurt of blood When he roared his hands went to his face and she was free Run she screamed bolting

But Lem was on her again at once with his long legs that made one of his steps equal to three of hers She twisted and kicked but he yanked her off her feet effortlessly and held her dangling while the blood ran down his face

Stop it you little fool he shouted shaking her back and forth Stop it now Gendry moved to help her until Tom Sevenstrings stepped in front of him with a dagger

By then it was too late to flee She could hear horses outside and the sound of men’s voices A moment later a man came swaggering through the open door a Tyroshi even bigger than Lem with a great thick beard bright green at the ends but growing out grey Behind came a pair of crossbowmen helping a wounded man between them and then others…

A more ragged band Arya had never seen but there was nothing ragged about the swords axes and bows they carried One or two gave her curious glances as they entered but no one said a word A one-eyed man in a rusty pothelm sniffed the air and grinned while an archer with a head of stiff yellow hair was shouting for ale After them came a spearman in a lioncrested helm an older man with a limp a Braavosi sellsword a…

Harwin Arya whispered It was Under the beard and the tangled hair was the face of Hullen’s son who used to lead her pony around the yard ride at quintain with Jon and Robb and drink too much on feast days He was thinner harder somehow and at Winterfell he had never worn a beard but it was him—her father’s man Harwin Squirming she threw herself forward trying to wrench free of Lem’s iron grip It’s me she shouted Harwin it’s me don’t you know me don’t you The tears came and she found herself weeping like a baby just like some stupid little girl Harwin it’s me
