Craster’s hall was dim after daylight Inside the night’s torches had burned low and it was hard to know that the sun had risen Lord Mormont’s raven was the first to spy him enter Three lazy flaps of its great black wings and it perched atop Longclaw’s hilt Corn It nipped at a strand of Jon’s hair

Ignore that wretched beggar bird Jon it’s just had half my bacon The Old Bear sat at Craster’s board breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread bacon and sheepgut sausage Craster’s new axe was on the table its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight Its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above but the women were all up moving about and serving What sort of day do we have

Cold but the rain has stopped

Very good See that my horse is saddled and ready I mean for us to ride within the hour Have you eaten Craster serves plain fare but filling

I will not eat Craster’s food he decided suddenly I broke my fast with the men my lord Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw The bird hopped back to Mormont’s shoulder where it promptly shat You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me the Old Bear grumbled The raven quorked

He found Sam behind the hall standing with Gilly at the broken rabbit hutch She was helping him back into his cloak but when she saw Jon she stole away Sam gave him a look of wounded reproach I thought you would help her

And how was I to do that Jon said sharply Take her with us wrapped up in your cloak We were commanded not to—

I know said Sam guiltily but she was afraid I know what it is to be afraid I told her    He swallowed

What That we’d take her with us

Sam’s fat face blushed a deep red On the way home He could not meet Jon’s eyes She’s going to have a baby

Sam have you taken leave of all your sense We may not even return this way And if we do do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster’s wives

I thought    maybe by then I could think of a way   

I have no time for this I have horses to groom and saddle Jon walked away as confused as he was angry Sam’s heart was as big as the rest of him but for all his reading he could be as thick as Grenn at times It was impossible and dishonorable besides So why do I feel so ashamed

Jon took his accustomed position at Mormont’s side as the Night’s Watch streamed out past the skulls on Craster’s gate They struck off north and west along a crooked game trail Melting ice dripped down all about them a slower sort of rain with its own soft music North of the compound the brook was in full spate choked with leaves and bits of wood but the scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across The water ran as high as a horse’s belly Ghost swam emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping brown When he shook spraying mud and water in all directions Mormont said nothing but on his shoulder the raven screeched

My lord Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more Craster has no sheep Nor any sons

Mormont made no answer

At Winterfell one of the serving women told us stories Jon went on She used to say that there were wildlings who would lay with the Others to birth half-human children

Hearth tales Does Craster seem less than human to you

In half a hundred ways He gives his sons to the wood

A long silence Then Yes And Yes the raven muttered strutting Yes yes yes

You knew

Smallwood told me Long ago All the rangers know though few will talk of it

Did my uncle know

All the rangers Mormont repeated You think I ought to stop him Kill him if need be The Old Bear sighed Were it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths I’d gladly send Yoren or Conwys to collect the boys We could raise them to the black and the Watch would be that much the stronger But the wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I These boys are Craster’s offerings His prayers if you will

His wives must offer different prayers Jon thought

How is it you came to know this the Old Bear asked him From one of Craster’s wives

Yes my lord Jon confessed I would sooner not tell you which She was frightened and wanted help

The wide world is full of people wanting help Jon Would that some could find the courage to help themselves Craster sprawls in his loft even now stinking of wine and lost to sense On his board below lies a sharp new axe Were it me I’d name it Answered Prayer’ and make an end

Yes Jon thought of Gilly She and her sisters They were nineteen and Craster was one but   

Yet it would be an ill day for us if Craster died Your uncle could tell you of the times Craster’s Keep made the difference between life and death for our rangers

My father    He hesitated

Go on Jon Say what you would say

My father once told me that some men are not worth having Jon finished A bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself

Craster is his own man He has sworn us no vows Nor is he subject to our laws Your heart is noble Jon but learn a lesson here We cannot set the world to rights That is not our purpose The Night’s Watch has other wars to fight

Other wars Yes I must remember Jarman Buckwell said I might have need of my sword soon

Did he Mormont did not seem pleased Craster said much and more last night and confirmed enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on his floor Mance Rayder is gathering his people together in the Frostfangs That’s why the villages are empty It is the same tale that Ser Denys Mallister had from the wildling his men captured in the Gorge but Craster has added the where and that makes all the difference

Is he making a city or an army

Now that is the question How many wildlings are there How many men of fighting age No one knows with certainty The Frostfangs are cruel inhospitable a wilderness of stone and ice They will not long sustain any great number of people I can see only one purpose in this gathering Mance Rayder means to strike south into the Seven Kingdoms

Wildlings have invaded the realm before Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both back at Winterfell Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather’s grandfather and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard

Aye and long before them came the Horned Lord and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne and in ancient days Joramun who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side    but the Night’s Watch is only a shadow of what we were and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides us The Lord of Winterfell is dead and his heir has marched his strength south to fight the Lannisters The wildlings may never again have such a chance as this I knew Mance Rayder Jon He is an oathbreaker yes    but he has eyes to see and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart

What will we do asked Jon

Find him said Mormont Fight him Stop him

Three hundred thought Jon against the fury of the wild His fingers opened and closed





THEON

She was undeniably a beauty But your first is always beautiful Theon Greyjoy thought

Now there’s a pretty grin a woman’s voice said behind him The lordling likes the look of her does he

Theon turned to give her an appraising glance He liked what he saw Ironborn he knew at a glance lean and long-legged with black hair cut short wind-chafed skin strong sure hands a dirk at her belt Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face but her smile made up for it He judged her a few years older than he was but no more than five-and-twenty She moved as if she were used to a deck beneath her feet

Yes she’s a sweet sight he told her though not half so sweet as you
