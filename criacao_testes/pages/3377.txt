exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be
partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is
in the world through lust

15 And beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue
and to virtue knowledge 16 And to knowledge temperance and to
temperance patience and to patience godliness 17 And to godliness
brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity

18 For if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ

19 But he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar
off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins

110 Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your
calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never
fall 111 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ

112 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established
in the present truth

113 Yea I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance 114 Knowing that shortly I must
put off this my tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed
me

115 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
have these things always in remembrance

116 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty

117 For he received from God the Father honour and glory when there
came such a voice to him from the excellent glory This is my beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased

118 And this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with
him in the holy mount

119 We have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until
the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts 120 Knowing this
first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation

121 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost

21 But there were false prophets also among the people even as there
shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable
heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon
themselves swift destruction

22 And many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of

23 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not
and their damnation slumbereth not

24 For if God spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down
to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved
unto judgment 25 And spared not the old world but saved Noah the
eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon
the world of the ungodly 26 And turning the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an
ensample unto those that after should live ungodly 27 And delivered
just Lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked 28 For
that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed
his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds 29 The
Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished 210 But
chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and
despise government Presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities

211 Whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not
railing accusation against them before the Lord

212 But these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and
destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and
shall utterly perish in their own corruption 213 And shall receive
the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot
in the day time Spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves
with their own deceivings while they feast with you 214 Having eyes
full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable
souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed
children 215 Which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray
following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor who loved the wages of
unrighteousness 216 But was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass
speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet

217 These are wells without water clouds that are carried with a
tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
