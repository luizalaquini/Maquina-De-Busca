I was delayed Jaime closed the door softly My sister outdid herself I’m told Seventy-seven courses and a regicide never a wedding like it How long have you known I was free

The eunuch told me a few days after your escape I sent men into the riverlands to look for you Gregor Clegane Samwell Spicer the brothers Plumm Varys put out the word as well but quietly We agreed that the fewer people who knew you were free the fewer would be hunting you

Did Varys mention this He moved closer to the fire to let his father see

Lord Tywin pushed himself out of his chair breath hissing between his teeth Who did this If Lady Catelyn thinks—

Lady Catelyn held a sword to my throat and made me swear to return her daughters This was your goat’s work Vargo Hoat the Lord of Harrenhal

Lord Tywin looked away disgusted No longer Ser Gregor’s taken the castle The sellswords deserted their erstwhile captain almost to a man and some of Lady Whent’s old people opened a postern gate Clegane found Hoat sitting alone in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths half-mad with pain and fever from a wound that festered His ear I’m told

Jaime had to laugh Too sweet His ear He could scarcely wait to tell Brienne though the wench wouldn’t find it half so funny as he did Is he dead yet

Soon They have taken off his hands and feet but Clegane seems amused by the way the Qohorik slobbers

Jaime’s smile curdled What about his Brave Companions

The few who stayed at Harrenhal are dead The others scattered They’ll make for ports I’ll warrant or try and lose themselves in the woods His eyes went back to Jaime’s stump and his mouth grew taut with fury We’ll have their heads Every one Can you use a sword with your left hand

I can hardly dress myself in the morning Jaime held up the hand in question for his father’s inspection Four fingers a thumb much like the other Why shouldn’t it work as well

Good His father sat That is good I have a gift for you For your return After Varys told me…

Unless it’s a new hand let it wait Jaime took the chair across from him How did Joffrey die

Poison It was meant to appear as though he choked on a morsel of food but I had his throat slit open and the maesters could find no obstruction

Cersei claims that Tyrion did it

Your brother served the king the poisoned wine with a thousand people looking on

That was rather foolish of him

I have taken Tyrion’s squire into custody His wife’s maids as well We shall see if they have anything to tell us Ser Addam’s gold cloaks are searching for the Stark girl and Varys has offered a reward The king’s justice will be done

The king’s justice You would execute your own son

He stands accused of regicide and kinslaying If he is innocent he has nothing to fear First we must needs consider the evidence for and against him

Evidence In this city of liars Jaime knew what sort of evidence would be found Renly died strangely as well when Stannis needed him to

Lord Renly was murdered by one of his own guards some woman from Tarth

That woman from Tarth is the reason I’m here I tossed her into a cell to appease Ser Loras but I’ll believe in Renly’s ghost before I believe she did him any harm But Stannis—

It was poison that killed Joffrey not sorcery Lord Tywin glanced at Jaime’s stump again You cannot serve in the Kingsguard without a sword hand—

I can he interrupted And I will There’s precedent I’ll look in the White Book and find it if you like Crippled or whole a knight of the Kingsguard serves for life

Cersei ended that when she replaced Ser Barristan on grounds of age A suitable gift to the Faith will persuade the High Septon to release you from your vows Your sister was foolish to dismiss Selmy admittedly but now that she has opened the gates—

—someone needs to close them again Jaime stood I am tired of having highborn women kicking pails of shit at me Father No one ever asked me if I wanted to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard but it seems I am I have a duty—

You do Lord Tywin rose as well A duty to House Lannister You are the heir to Casterly Rock That is where you should be Tommen should accompany you as your ward and squire The Rock is where he’ll learn to be a Lannister and I want him away from his mother I mean to find a new husband for Cersei Oberyn Martell perhaps once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten Highgarden And it is past time you were wed The Tyrells are now insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen but if I were to offer you instead—

NO Jaime had heard all that he could stand No more than he could stand He was sick of it sick of lords and lies sick of his father his sister sick of the whole bloody business No No No No No How many times must I say no before you’ll hear it Oberyn Martell The man’s infamous and not just for poisoning his sword He has more bastards than Robert and beds with boys as well And if you think for one misbegotten moment that I would wed Joffrey’s widow…

Lord Tyrell swears the girl’s still maiden

She can die a maiden as far as I’m concerned I don’t want her and I don’t want your Rock

You are my son—

I am a knight of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard And that’s all I mean to be

Firelight gleamed golden in the stiff whiskers that framed Lord Tywin’s face A vein pulsed in his neck but he did not speak And did not speak And did not speak

The strained silence went on until it was more than Jaime could endure Father… he began

You are not my son Lord Tywin turned his face away You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and only that Very well ser Go do your duty





Davos


Their voices rose like cinders swirling up into purple evening sky Lead us from the darkness O my Lord Fill our hearts with fire so we may walk your shining path

The nightfire burned against the gathering dark a great bright beast whose shifting orange light threw shadows twenty feet tall across the yard All along the walls of Dragonstone the army of gargoyles and grotesques seemed to stir and shift

Davos looked down from an arched window in the gallery above He watched Melisandre lift her arms as if to embrace the shivering flames R’hllor she sang in a voice loud and clear you are the light in our eyes the fire in our hearts the heat in our loins Yours is the sun that warms our days yours the stars that guard us in the dark of night

Lord of Light defend us The night is dark and full of terrors Queen Selyse led the responses her pinched face full of fervor King Stannis stood beside her jaw clenched hard the points of his red-gold crown shimmering whenever he moved his head He is with them but not of them Davos thought Princess Shireen was between them the mottled grey patches on her face and neck almost black in the firelight

Lord of Light protect us the queen sang The king did not respond with the others He was staring into the flames Davos wondered what he saw there Another vision of the war to come Or something closer to home

R’hllor who gave us breath we thank you sang Melisandre R’hllor who gave us day we thank you

We thank you for the sun that warms us Queen Selyse and the other worshipers replied We thank you for the stars that watch us We thank you for our hearths and for our torches that keep the savage dark at bay There were fewer voices saying the responses than there had been the night before it seemed to Davos fewer faces flushed with orange light about the fire But would there be fewer still on the morrow… or more

The voice of Ser Axell Florent rang loud as a trumpet He stood barrelchested and bandy-legged the firelight washing his face like a monstrous orange tongue Davos wondered if Ser Axell would thank him after The work they did tonight might well make him the King’s Hand as he dreamed

Melisandre cried We thank you for Stannis by your grace our king We thank you for the pure white fire of his goodness for the red sword of justice in his hand for the love he bears his leal people Guide him and defend him R’hllor and grant him strength to smite his foes

Grant him strength answered Queen Selyse Ser Axell Devan and the rest Grant him courage Grant him wisdom
