shape Every fourth was a dot
HORSES TRAMPING
He screwed up his face and emitted a long
 whew-w-w  
 Lame said Oak
 Yes Dainty is lamed  the near-foot-afore said
Coggan slowly staring still at the footprints
 Well push on said Gabriel remounting his humid
steed
Although the road along its greater part had been as
good as any turnpike-road in the country it was nomin+
ally only a byway The last turning had brought them
into the high road leading to Bath Coggan recollected
himself
We shall have him now   he exclaimed
 Where  
 Sherton Turnpike The keeper of that gate is the
sleepiest man between here and London -- Dan Randall
thats his name -- knowed en for years when he was at
Casterbridge gate Between the lameness and the gate
tis a done job
was said until against a shady background of foliage
five white bars were visible crossing their route a little
way ahead
 Hush -- we are almost close   said Gabriel
Amble on upon the grass said Coggan
The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a
dark shape in front of them The silence of this lonely
time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter
 Hoy-a-hoy  Gate  
It appeared that there had been a previous call which
they had not noticed for on their close approach the
door of the turnpike-house opened and the keeper
came out half-dressed with a candle in his hand The
rays illumined the whole group
 Keep the gate close   shouted Gabriel  He has
stolen the horse

 Who   said the turnpike-man
Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig and saw a
woman -- Bathsheba his mistress
On hearing his voice she had turned her face away
from the light Coggan had however caught sight of
her in the meanwhile
Why tis mistress-ill take my oath   he said
amazed
Bathsheba it certainly was and she had by this time
done the trick she could do so well in crises not of love
namely mask a surprise by coolness of manner
 Well Gabriel she inquired quietly  where are you
going  
 We thought --  --  began Gabriel
Bath she said taking for her own
use the assurance that Gahriel lacked An important
matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to
liddy and go off at once What then were you
following me 
 We thought the horse was stole
 Weli-what a thing  How very foolish of you not
to know that I had taken the trap and horse I could
neither wake Maryann nor get into the house though
I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill
Fortunately I could get the key of the coach-house so
I troubled no one further Didnt you think it might
be me
 Why should we miss  
 Perhaps not Why those are never Farmer Bold+
woods horses  Goodness mercy  what have you been
 doing bringing trouble upon me in this way What
mustnt a lady move an inch from her door without being
dogged like a thief
But how was we to know if you left no account of
your doings   expostulated Coggan and ladies dont
 drive at these hours miss as a jineral rule of society
I did leave an account -- and you would have seen
it in the morning I wrote in chalk on the coach-house
doors that I had come back for the horse and gig and
driven off that I could arouse nobody and should
return soon
 But youll consider maam that we couldnt see
that till it got daylight
True she said and though vexed at first she had
too much

sense to blame them long or seriously for a
devotion to her that was as valuable as it was rare
She added with a very pretty grace  Well I really thank
you heartily for taking all this trouble but I wish you
had borrowed anybodys horses but Mr Boldwoods
Dainty is lame miss said Coggan Can ye go
on
lt was only a stone in her shoe I got down and
pulled it out a hundred yards back I can manage
very well thank you I shall be in Bath by daylight
Will you now return please
She turned her head -- the gatemans candle
shimmering upon her quick clear eyes as she did so --
passed through the gate and was soon wrapped in the
embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs
Coggan and Gabriel put about their horses and fanned
