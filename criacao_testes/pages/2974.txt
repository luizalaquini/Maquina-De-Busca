61 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon
a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple

62 Above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain
he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with
twain he did fly

63 And one cried unto another and said Holy holy holy is the
LORD of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory

64 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried
and the house was filled with smoke

65 Then said I Woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of
unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips
for mine eyes have seen the King the LORD of hosts

66 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his
hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar 67 And he
laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and
thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged

68 Also I heard the voice of the Lord saying Whom shall I send and
who will go for us Then said I Here am I send me

69 And he said Go and tell this people Hear ye indeed but
understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not

610 Make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and
shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their
ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed

611 Then said I Lord how long And he answered Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be
utterly desolate 612 And the LORD have removed men far away and
there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land

613 But yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be
eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when
they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance
thereof

71 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham the son
of Uzziah king of Judah that Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the
son of Remaliah king of Israel went up toward Jerusalem to war
against it but could not prevail against it

72 And it was told the house of David saying Syria is confederate
with Ephraim And his heart was moved and the heart of his people as
the trees of the wood are moved with the wind

73 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah Go forth now to meet Ahaz thou
and Shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fullers field 74 And say unto him Take heed
and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of
these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria
and of the son of Remaliah

75 Because Syria Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have taken evil
counsel against thee saying 76 Let us go up against Judah and vex
it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the
midst of it even the son of Tabeal 77 Thus saith the Lord GOD It
shall not stand neither shall it come to pass

78 For the head of Syria is Damascus and the head of Damascus is
Rezin and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken
that it be not a people

79 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is
Remaliahs son If ye will not believe surely ye shall not be
established

710 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz saying 711 Ask thee a
sign of the LORD thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height
above

712 But Ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the LORD

713 And he said Hear ye now O house of David Is it a small thing
for you to weary men but will ye weary my God also  714 Therefore
the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall
conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel

715 Butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the
evil and choose the good

716 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose
the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her
kings

717 The LORD shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy
fathers house days that have not come from the day that Ephraim
departed from Judah even the king of Assyria

718 And it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD shall hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and
for the bee that is in the land of Assyria

719 And they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate
