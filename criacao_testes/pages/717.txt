My brother visited Pentos Myr Braavos near all the Free Cities The magisters and archons fed him wine and promises but his soul was starved to death A man cannot sup from the beggar’s bowl all his life and stay a man I had my taste in Qarth that was enough I will not come to Pentos bowl in hand

Better to come a beggar than a slaver Arstan said

There speaks one who has been neither Dany’s nostrils flared Do you know what it is like to be sold squire I do My brother sold me to Khal Drogo for the promise of a golden crown Well Drogo crowned him in gold though not as he had wished and I… my sun-and-stars made a queen of me but if he had been a different man it might have been much otherwise Do you think I have forgotten how it felt to be afraid

Whitebeard bowed his head Your Grace I did not mean to give offense

Only lies offend me never honest counsel Dany patted Arstan’s spotted hand to reassure him I have a dragon’s temper that’s all You must not let it frighten you

I shall try and remember Whitebeard smiled

He has a good face and great strength to him Dany thought She could not understand why Ser Jorah mistrusted the old man so Could he be jealous that I have found another man to talk to Unbidden her thoughts went back to the night on Balerion when the exile knight had kissed her He should never have done that He is thrice my age and of too low a birth for me and I never gave him leave No true knight would ever kiss a queen without her leave She had taken care never to be alone with Ser Jorah after that keeping her handmaids with her aboard ship and sometimes her bloodriders He wants to kiss me again I see it in his eyes

What Dany wanted she could not begin to say but Jorah’s kiss had woken something in her something that been sleeping since Khal Drogo died Lying abed in her narrow bunk she found herself wondering how it would be to have a man squeezed in beside her in place of her handmaid and the thought was more exciting than it should have been Sometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of her lover was always younger and more comely though his face remained a shifting shadow

Once so tormented she could not sleep Dany slid a hand down between her legs and gasped when she felt how wet she was Scarce daring to breathe she moved her fingers back and forth between her lower lips slowly so as not to wake Irri beside her until she found one sweet spot and lingered there touching herself lightly timidly at first and then faster Still the relief she wanted seemed to recede before her until her dragons stirred and one screamed out across the cabin and Irri woke and saw what she was doing

Dany knew her face was flushed but in the darkness Irri surely could not tell Wordless the handmaid put a hand on her breast then bent to take a nipple in her mouth Her other hand drifted down across the soft curve of belly through the mound of fine silvery-gold hair and went to work between Dany’s thighs It was no more than a few moments until her legs twisted and her breasts heaved and her whole body shuddered She screamed then Or perhaps that was Drogon Irri never said a thing only curled back up and went back to sleep the instant the thing was done

The next day it all seemed a dream And what did Ser Jorah have to do with it if anything It is Drogo I want my sun-and-stars Dany reminded herself Not Irri and not Ser Jorah only Drogo Drogo was dead though She’d thought these feelings had died with him there in the red waste but one treacherous kiss had somehow brought them back to life He should never have kissed me He presumed too much and I permitted it It must never happen again She set her mouth grimly and gave her head a shake and the bell in her braid chimed softly

Closer to the bay the city presented a fairer face The great brick pyramids lined the shore the largest four hundred feet high All manner of trees and vines and flowers grew on their broad terraces and the winds that swirled around them smelled green and fragrant Another gigantic harpy stood atop the gate this one made of baked red clay and crumbling visibly with no more than a stub of her scorpion’s tail remaining The chain she grasped in her clay claws was old iron rotten with rust It was cooler down by the water though The lapping of the waves against the rotting pilings made a curiously soothing sound

Aggo helped Dany down from her litter Strong Belwas was seated on a massive piling eating a great haunch of brown roasted meat Dog he said happily when he saw Dany Good dog in Astapor little queen Eat He offered it with a greasy grin

That is kind of you Belwas but no Dany had eaten dog in other places at other times but just now all she could think of was the Unsullied and their stupid puppies She swept past the huge eunuch and up the plank onto the deck of Balerion

Ser Jorah Mormont stood waiting for her Your Grace he said bowing his head The slavers have come and gone Three of them with a dozen scribes and as many slaves to lift and fetch They crawled over every foot of our holds and made note of all we had He walked her aft How many men do they have for sale

None Was it Mormont she was angry with or this city with its sullen heat its stinks and sweats and crumbling bricks They sell eunuchs not men Eunuchs made of brick like the rest of Astapor Shall I buy eight thousand brick eunuchs with dead eyes that never move who kill suckling babes for the sake of a spiked hat and strangle their own dogs They don’t even have names So don’t call them men ser

Khaleesi he said taken aback by her fury the Unsullied are chosen as boys and trained—

I have heard all I care to of their training Dany could feel tears welling in her eyes sudden and unwanted Her hand flashed up and cracked Ser Jorah hard across the face It was either that or cry

Mormont touched the cheek she’d slapped If I have displeased my queen—

You have You’ve displeased me greatly ser If you were my true knight you would never have brought me to this vile sty If you were my true knight you would never have kissed me or looked at my breasts the way you did or…

As Your Grace commands I shall tell Captain Groleo to make ready to sail on the evening tide for some sty less vile

No said Dany Groleo watched them from the forecastle and his crew was watching too Whitebeard her bloodriders Jhiqui every one had stopped what they were doing at the sound of the slap I want to sail now not on the tide I want to sail far and fast and never look back But I can’t can I There are eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale and I must find some way to buy them And with that she left him and went below

Behind the carved wooden door of the captain’s cabin her dragons were restless Drogon raised his head and screamed pale smoke venting from his nostrils and Viserion flapped at her and tried to perch on her shoulder as he had when he was smaller No Dany said trying to shrug him off gently You’re too big for that now sweetling But the dragon coiled his white and gold tail around one arm and dug black claws into the fabric of her sleeve clinging tightly Helpless she sank into Groleo’s great leather chair giggling

They have been wild while you were gone Khaleesi Irri told her Viserion clawed splinters from the door do you see And Drogon made to escape when the slaver men came to see them When I grabbed his tail to hold him back he turned and bit me She showed Dany the marks of his teeth on her hand

Did any of them try to burn their way free That was the thing that frightened Dany the most

No Khaleesi Drogon breathed his fire but in the empty air The slaver men feared to come near him

She kissed Irri’s hand where Drogon had bitten it I’m sorry he hurt you Dragons are not meant to be locked up in a small ship’s cabin
