Her lord father had taught her never to steal but it was growing harder to remember why If she did not get out soon she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks She hadn’t gone hungry much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick A couple she’d eaten raw before she found Flea Bottom

In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday’s bread and a bowl o’ brown and they’d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you so long as you plucked the feathers yourself Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake but the brown wasn’t so bad It usually had barley in it and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip and sometimes even apple with a film of grease swimming on top Mostly she tried not to think about the meat Once she had gotten a piece of fish

The only thing was the pot-shops were never empty and even as she bolted down her food Arya could feel them watching Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak and she knew what they were thinking With others she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers she didn’t know what they were thinking and that scared her even more A couple times she was followed out into the alleys and chased but so far no one had been able to catch her

The silver bracelet she’d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle along with her bundle of good clothes snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in the leathers on her back her wooden practice sword… and Needle She’d been lying on top of Needle or else it would have been gone too it was worth more than all the rest together Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm to conceal the blade at her hip The wooden sword she carried in her left hand out where everybody could see it to scare off robbers but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn’t have been scared off if she’d had a battle-axe It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread Often as not she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares

Once she was outside the city she would find berries to pick or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south And she could dig for roots in the forest even run down some rabbits In the city the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups she’d heard but she didn’t like to think about that

Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets Arya scrambled through the crowds trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks She had learned to keep to the center of the street Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses but at least you could see them coming If you walked near the buildings people grabbed you In some alleys you couldn’t help but brush against the walls the buildings leaned in so close they almost met

A whooping gang of small children went running past chasing a rolling hoop Arya stared at them with resentment remembering the times she’d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon She wondered how big Rickon had grown and whether Bran was sad She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her little sister and muss her hair Not that it needed mussing She’d seen her reflection in puddles and she didn’t think hair got any more mussed than hers

She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep but she must have talked wrong or something The little ones only looked at her with quick wary eyes and ran away if she came too close Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn’t answer called her names and tried to steal from her Only yesterday a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding

A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom Arya glanced at it thoughtfully but it was well beyond the reach of her stick It made her think of the sea Maybe that was the way out Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures Maybe Arya could do that too She decided to visit the riverfront It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway and she hadn’t checked that one today

The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there She spied another pair of gold cloaks walking side by side through the fish market but they never so much as looked at her Half the stalls were empty and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered Out on the Blackwater three of the king’s war galleys moved in formation gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell Arya watched them for a bit then began to make her way along the river

When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin her heart almost stopped in her chest The sight of Winterfell’s colors brought tears to her eyes Behind them a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings Arya could not read the name painted on the hull the words were strange Myrish Braavosi perhaps even High Valyrian She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve Please she said what ship is this

She’s the Wind Witch out of Myr the man said

She’s still here Arya blurted The longshoreman gave her a queer look shrugged and walked away Arya ran toward the pier The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home… still waiting She’d imagined it had sailed ages ago

Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds his hand on the pommel of his sword Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby she stopped to rub at her eyes Her eyes her eyes her eyes why did…

Look with your eyes she heard Syrio whisper

Arya looked She knew all of her father’s men The three in the grey cloaks were strangers You the one walking rounds called out What do you want here boy The other two looked up from their dice

It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run but she knew that if she did they would be after her at once She made herself walk closer They were looking for a girl but he thought she was a boy She’d be a boy then Want to buy a pigeon She showed him the dead bird

Get out of here the guardsman said

Arya did as he told her She did not have to pretend to be frightened Behind her the men went back to their dice

She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills The Bottom had a stench to it a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner’s sheds mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses Arya wound her way through the maze dully It was not until she caught a whiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone It must have slipped from her belt as she ran or someone had stolen it and she’d never noticed For a moment she wanted to cry again She’d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that plump

Far across the city bells began to ring

Arya glanced up listening wondering what the ringing meant this time

What’s this now a fat man called from the pot-shop

The bells again gods ha’mercy wailed an old woman

A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window Is it the boy king that’s died now she shouted down leaning out over the street Ah that’s a boy for you they never last long As she laughed a naked man slid his arms around her from behind biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift

Stupid slut the fat man shouted up The king’s not dead that’s only summoning bells One tower tolling When the king dies they ring every bell in the city

Here quit your biting or I’ll ring your bells the woman in the window said to the man behind her pushing him off with an elbow So who is it died if not the king
