It was only half a lie Someone had to go to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters Bran could understand that but it did not have to be Robb His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy or to one of his lords bannermen Maester Luwin urged him to do just that but Robb would not hear of it My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell he said all Robb the Lord

Robb seemed half a stranger to Bran now transformed a lord in truth though he had not yet seen his sixteenth name day Even their father’s bannermen seemed to sense it Many tried to test him each in his own way Roose Bolton and Robett Glover both demanded the honor of battle command the first brusquely the second with a smile and a jest Stout grey-haired Maege Mormont dressed in mail like a man told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson and had no business giving her commands… but as it happened she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry Soft-spoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him a plump homely maid of thirty years who sat at her father’s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate Jovial Lord Hornwood had no daughters but he did bring gifts a horse one day a haunch of venison the next a silver-chased hunting horn the day after and he asked nothing in return… nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather and hunting rights north of a certain ridge and leave to dam the White Knife if it please the lord

Robb answered each of them with cool courtesy much as Father might have and somehow he bent them to his will

And when Lord Umber who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march Robb told him he was welcome to do so And when we are done with the Lannisters he promised scratching Grey Wind behind the ear we will march back north root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker Cursing the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him he knocked him to the floor kicked over a table and unsheathed the biggest ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen All along the benches his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet grabbing for their steel

Yet Robb only said a quiet word and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on his back his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord Robb said but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat Bran’s bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise sucking at the red stumps of fingers… but then astonishingly the huge man laughed Your meat he roared is bloody tough

And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb’s right hand his staunchest champion loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark after all and they’d damn well better bend their knees if they didn’t fancy having them chewed off

Yet that very night his brother came to Bran’s bedchamber pale and shaken after the fires had burned low in the Great Hall I thought he was going to kill me Robb confessed Did you see the way he threw down Hal like he was no bigger than Rickon Gods I was so scared And the Greatjon’s not the worst of them only the loudest Lord Roose never says a word he only looks at me and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies

That’s just one of Old Nan’s stories Bran said A note of doubt crept into his voice Isn’t it

I don’t know He gave a weary shake of his head Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us To cook for him he says Theon is certain I’ll find the girl in my bedroll one night I wish… I wish Father was here…

That was the one thing they could agree on Bran and Rickon and Robb the Lord they all wished Father was here But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues away a captive in some dungeon a hunted fugitive running for his life or even dead No one seemed to know for certain every traveler told a different tale each more terrifying than the last The heads of Father’s guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the Red Keep impaled on spikes King Robert was dead at Father’s hands The Baratheons had laid siege to King’s Landing Lord Eddard had fled south with the king’s wicked brother Renly Arya and Sansa had been murdered by the Hound Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of Riverrun Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie burning and slaughtering as he went One wine-sodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim his father’s throne

When the raven came bearing a letter marked with Father’s own seal and written in Sansa’s hand the cruel truth seemed no less incredible Bran would never forget the look on Robb’s face as he stared at their sister’s words She says Father conspired at treason with the king’s brothers he read King Robert is dead and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey She says we must be loyal and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father’s life His fingers closed into a fist crushing Sansa’s letter between them And she says nothing of Arya nothing not so much as a word Damn her What’s wrong with the girl

Bran felt all cold inside She lost her wolf he said weakly remembering the day when four of his father’s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady’s bones Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge in voices drawn and desolate Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard its headstones spotted with pale lichen where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants It was there they buried Lady while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows She had gone south and only her bones had returned

Their grandfather old Lord Rickard had gone as well with his son Brandon who was Father’s brother and two hundred of his best men None had ever returned And Father had gone south with Arya and Sansa and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone and they hadn’t come back either And now Robb meant to go Not to King’s Landing and not to swear fealty but to Riverrun with a sword in his hand And if their lord father were truly a prisoner that could mean his death for a certainty It frightened Bran more than he could say

If Robb has to go watch over him Bran entreated the old gods as they watched him with the heart tree’s red eyes and watch over his men Hal and Quent and the rest and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords And Theon too I suppose Watch them and keep them safe if it please you gods Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home

A faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered Summer bared his teeth You hear them boy a voice asked

Bran lifted his head Osha stood across the pool beneath an ancient oak her face shadowed by leaves Even in irons the wildling moved quiet as a cat Summer circled the pool sniffed at her The tall woman flinched

Summer to me Bran called The direwolf took one final sniff spun and bounded back Bran wrapped his arms around him What are you doing here He had not seen Osha since they’d taken her captive in the wolfswood though he knew she’d been set to working in the kitchens

They are my gods too Osha said Beyond the Wall they are the only gods Her hair was growing out brown and shaggy It made her look more womanly that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they’d given her when they took her mail and leather Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time when I feel the need and I let him do as he likes under my skirt when he feels the need It’s nothing to me I like the smell of flour on his hands and he’s gentler than Stiv She gave an awkward bow I’ll leave you There’s pots that want scouring

No stay Bran commanded her Tell me what you meant about hearing the gods

Osha studied him You asked them and they’re answering Open your ears listen you’ll hear

Bran listened It’s only the wind he said after a moment uncertain The leaves are rustling

Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods She seated herself across the pool from him clinking faintly as she moved Mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles with a heavy chain between them she could walk so long as she kept her strides small but there was no way for her to run or climb or mount a horse They see you boy They hear you talking That rustling that’s them talking back

What are they saying

They’re sad Your lord brother will get no help from them not where he’s going The old gods have no power in the south The weirwoods there were all cut down thousands of years ago How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes

Bran had not thought of that It frightened him If even the gods could not help his brother what hope was there Maybe Osha wasn’t hearing them right He cocked his head and tried to listen again He thought he could hear the sadness now but nothing more than that

The rustling grew louder Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming and Hodor came blundering out of the trees naked and smiling Hodor

He must have heard our voices Bran said Hodor you forgot your clothes

Hodor Hodor agreed He was dripping wet from the neck down steaming in the chill air His body was covered with brown hair thick as a pelt Between his legs his manhood swung long and heavy

Osha eyed him with a sour smile Now there’s a big man she said He has giant’s blood in him or I’m the queen

Maester Luwin says there are no more giants He says they’re all dead like the children of the forest All that’s left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time

Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall Osha said He’ll find giants then or they’ll find him My brother killed one Ten foot tall she was and stunted at that They’ve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet Fierce things they are too all hair and teeth and the wives have beards like their husbands so there’s no telling them apart The women take human men for lovers and it’s from them the half bloods come It goes harder on the women they catch The men are so big they’ll rip a maid apart before they get her with child She grinned at him But you don’t know what I mean do you boy

Yes I do Bran insisted He understood about mating he had seen dogs in the yard and watched a stallion mount a mare But talking about it made him uncomfortable He looked at Hodor Go back and bring your clothes Hodor he said Go dress

Hodor He walked back the way he had come ducking under a low-hanging tree limb

He was awfully big Bran thought as he watched him go Are there truly giants beyond the Wall he asked Osha uncertainly

Giants and worse than giants Lordling I tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy The cold winds are rising and men go out from their fires and never come back… or if they do they’re not men no more but only wights with blue eyes and cold black hands Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools Mance thinks he’ll fight the brave sweet stubborn man like the white walkers were no more than rangers but what does he know He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes but he’s still just another old black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower He’s never tasted winter I was born up there child like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her born of the Free Folk We remember Osha stood her chains rattling together I tried to tell your lordling brother Only yesterday when I saw him in the yard ‘M’lord Stark’ I called to him respectful as you please but he looked through me and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path So be it I’ll wear my irons and hold my tongue A man who won’t listen can’t hear

Tell me Robb will listen to me I know he will

Will he now We’ll see You tell him this m’lord You tell him he’s bound on marching the wrong way It’s north he should be taking his swords North not south You hear me

Bran nodded I’ll tell him

But that night when they feasted in the Great Hall Robb was not with them He took his meal in the solar instead with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the other lords bannermen to make the final plans for the long march to come It was left to Bran to fill his place at the head of the table and act the host to Lord Karstark’s sons and honored friends They were already at their places when Hodor carried Bran into the hall on his back and knelt beside the high seat Two of the serving men helped lift him from his basket Bran could feel the eyes of every stranger in the hall It had grown quiet My lords Hallis Mollen announced Brandon Stark of Winterfell

I welcome you to our fires Bran said stiffly and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship

Harrion Karstark the oldest of Lord Rickard’s sons bowed and his brothers after him yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices over the clatter of wine cups …sooner die than live like that muttered one his father’s namesake Eddard and his brother Torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out too craven to take his own life

Broken Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife Is that what he was now Bran the Broken I don’t want to be broken he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin who’d been seated to his right I want to be a knight

There are some who call my order the knights of the mind Luwin replied You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it Bran Have you ever thought that you might wear a maester’s chain There is no limit to what you might learn

I want to learn magic Bran told him The crow promised that I would fly

Maester Luwin sighed I can teach you history healing herblore I can teach you the speech of ravens and how to build a castle and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons and at the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more But Bran no man can teach you magic

The children could Bran said The children of the forest That reminded him of the promise he had made to Osha in the godswood so he told Luwin what she had said

The maester listened politely The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales I think he said when Bran was done I will talk with her again if you like but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods It’s the Lannisters who hold your lord father Bran not the children of the forest He put a gentle hand on Bran’s arm Think on what I said child

And two days later as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky Bran found himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother

You are the lord in Winterfell now Robb told him He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion his shield hung from the horse’s side wood banded with iron white and grey and on it the snarling face of a direwolf His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers sword and dagger at his waist a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders You must take my place as I took Father’s until we come home

I know Bran replied miserably He had never felt so little or alone or scared He did not know how to be a lord
