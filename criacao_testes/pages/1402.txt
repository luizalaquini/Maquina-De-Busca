The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up She planted a foot in Harwin’s cupped hands vaulted onto Gendry’s shoulders and grabbed the bars on top of the cage The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron and Arya poured the water over him He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over his head and cheeks and hands and then he licked the dampness off the bars He would have licked Arya’s fingers if she hadn’t snatched them back By the time she served the other two the same a crowd had gathered to watch her The Mad Huntsman will hear of this a man threatened He won’t like it No he won’t

He’ll like this even less then Anguy strung his longbow slid an arrow from his quiver nocked drew loosed The fat man shuddered as the shaft drove up between his chins but the cage would not let him fall Two more arrows ended the other two northmen The only sound in the market square was the splash of falling water and the buzzing of flies

Valar morghulis Arya thought

On the east side of the market square stood a modest inn with whitewashed walls and broken windows Half its roof had burnt off recently but the hole had been patched over Above the door hung a wooden shingle painted as a peach with a big bite taken out of it They dismounted at the stables sitting catty-corner and Greenbeard bellowed for grooms

The buxom red-haired innkeep howled with pleasure at the sight of them then promptly set to tweaking them Greenbeard is it Or Greybeard Mother take mercy when did you get so old Lem is that you Still wearing the same ratty cloak are you I know why you never wash it I do You’re afraid all the piss will wash out and we’ll see you’re really a knight o’ the Kingsguard And Tom o’ Sevens you randy old goat You come to see that son o’ yours Well you’re too late he’s off riding with that bloody Huntsman And don’t tell me he’s not yours

He hasn’t got my voice Tom protested weakly

He’s got your nose though Aye and t’other parts as well to hear the girls talk She spied Gendry then and pinched him on the check Look at this fine young ox Wait till Alyce sees those arms Oh and he blushes like a maid too Well Alyce will fix that for you boy see if she don’t

Arya had never seen Gendry turn so red Tansy you leave the Bull alone he’s a good lad said Tom Sevenstrings All we need from you is safe beds for a night

Speak for yourself singer Anguy slid his arm around a strapping young serving girl as freckly as he was

Beds we got said red-haired Tansy There’s never been no lack o’ beds at the Peach But you’ll all climb in a tub first Last time you lot stayed under my roof you left your fleas behind She poked Greenbeard in the chest And yours was green too You want food

If you can spare it we won’t say no Tom conceded

Now when did you ever say no to anything Tom the woman hooted I’ll roast some mutton for your friends and an old dry rat for you It’s more than you deserve but if you gargle me a song or three might be I’ll weaken I always pity the afflicted Come on come on Cass Lanna put some kettles on Jyzene help me get the clothes off them we’ll need to boil those too

She made good on all her threats Arya tried to tell them that she’d been bathed twice at Acorn Hall not a fortnight past but the red-haired woman was having none of it Two serving wenches carried her up the stairs bodily arguing about whether she was a girl or a boy The one called Helly won so the other had to fetch the hot water and scrub Arya’s back with a stiff bristly brush that almost took her skin off Then they stole all the clothes that Lady Smallwood had given her and dressed her up like one of Sansa’s dolls in linen and lace But at least when they were done she got to go down and eat

As she sat in the common room in her stupid girl clothes Arya remembered what Syrio Forel had told her the trick of looking and seeing what was there When she looked she saw more serving wenches than any inn could want and most of them young and comely And come evenfall lots of men started coming and going at the Peach They did not linger long in the common room not even when Tom took out his woodharp and began to sing Six Maids in a Pool The wooden steps were old and steep and creaked something fierce whenever one of the men took a girl upstairs I bet this is a brothel she whispered to Gendry

You don’t even know what a brothel is

I do so she insisted It’s like an inn with girls

He was turning red again What are you doing here then he demanded A brothel’s no fit place for no bloody highborn lady everybody knows that

One of the girls sat down on the bench beside him Who’s a highborn lady The little skinny one She looked at Arya and laughed I’m a king’s daughter myself

Arya knew she was being mocked You are not

Well I might be When the girl shrugged her gown slipped off one shoulder They say King Robert fucked my mother when he hid here back before the battle Not that he didn’t have all the other girls too but Leslyn says he liked my ma the best

The girl did have hair like the old king’s Arya thought a great thick mop of it as black as coal That doesn’t mean anything though Gendry has the same kind of hair too Lots of people have black hair

I’m named Bella the girl told Gendry For the battle I bet I could ring your bell too You want to

No he said gruffly

I bet you do She ran a hand along his arm I don’t cost nothing to friends of Thoros and the lightning lord

No I said Gendry rose abruptly and stalked away from the table out into the night

Bella turned to Arya Don’t he like girls

Arya shrugged He’s just stupid He likes to polish helmets and beat on swords with hammers

Oh Bella tugged her gown back over her shoulder and went to talk with Jack-Be-Lucky Before long she was sitting in his lap giggling and drinking wine from his cup Greenbeard had two girls one on each knee Anguy had vanished with his freckle-faced wench and Lem was gone as well Tom Sevenstrings sat by the fire singing The Maids that Bloom in Spring Arya sipped at the cup of watered wine the red-haired woman had allowed her listening Across the square the dead men were rotting in their crow cages but inside the Peach everyone was jolly Except it seemed to her that some of them were laughing too hard somehow

It would have been a good time to sneak away and steal a horse but Arya couldn’t see how that would help her She could only ride as far as the city gates That captain would never let me pass and if he did Harwin would come after me or that Huntsman with his dogs She wished she had her map so she could see how far Stoney Sept was from Riverrun

By the time her cup was empty Arya was yawning Gendry hadn’t come back Tom Sevenstrings was singing Two Hearts that Beat as One and kissing a different girl at the end of every verse In the corner by the window Lem and Harwin sat talking to red-haired Tansy in low voices …spent the night in Jaime’s cell she heard the woman say Her and this other wench the one who slew Renly All three o’ them together and come the morn Lady Catelyn cut him loose for love She gave a throaty chuckle

It’s not true Arya thought She never would She felt sad and angry and lonely all at once

An old man sat down beside her Well aren’t you a pretty little peach His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages and his little pig eyes were crawling up and down her Does my sweet peach have a name

For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be She wasn’t any peach but she couldn’t be Arya Stark either not here with some smelly drunk she did not know I’m…

She’s my sister Gendry put a heavy hand on the old man’s shoulder and squeezed Leave her be

The man turned spoiling for a quarrel but when he saw Gendry’s size he thought better of it Your sister is she What kind of brother are you I’d never bring no sister of mine to the Peach that I wouldn’t He got up from the bench and moved off muttering in search of a new friend

Why did you say that Arya hopped to her feet You’re not my brother

That’s right he said angrily I’m too bloody lowborn to be kin to m’lady high

Arya was taken aback by the fury in his voice That’s not the way I meant it

Yes it is He sat down on the bench cradling a cup of wine between his hands Go away I want to drink this wine in peace Then maybe I’ll go find that black-haired girl and ring her bell for her

But…

I said go away M’lady

Arya whirled and left him there A stupid bullheaded bastard boy that’s all he is He could ring all the bells he wanted it was nothing to her

Their sleeping room was at the top of the stairs under the eaves Maybe the Peach had no lack of beds but there was only one to spare for the likes of them It was a big bed though It filled the whole room just about and the musty straw-stuffed mattress looked large enough for all of them Just now though she had it to herself Her real clothes were hanging from a peg on the wall between Gendry’s stuff and Lem’s Arya took off the linen and lace pulled her tunic over her head climbed up into the bed and burrowed under the blankets Queen Cersei she whispered into the pillow King Joffrey Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Dunsen Raff and Polliver The Tickler the Hound and Ser Gregor the Mountain She liked to mix up the order of the names sometimes It helped her remember who they were and what they’d done Maybe some of them are dead she thought Maybe they’re in iron cages someplace and the crows are picking out their eyes

Sleep came as quick as she closed her eyes She dreamed of wolves that night stalking through a wet wood with the smell of rain and rot and blood thick in the air Only they were good smells in the dream and Arya knew she had nothing to fear She was strong and swift and fierce and her pack was all around her her brothers and her sisters They ran down a frightened horse together tore its throat out and feasted And when the moon broke through the clouds she threw back her head and howled

But when the day came she woke to the barking of dogs

Arya sat up yawning Gendry was stirring on her left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to her right but the baying outside all but drowned him out There must be half a hundred dogs out there She crawled from under the blankets and hopped over Lem Tom and Jack-Be-Lucky to the window When she opened the shutters wide wind and wet and cold all came flooding in together The day was grey and overcast Down below in the square the dogs were barking running in circles growling and howling There was a pack of them great black mastiffs and lean wolfhounds and black-and-white sheepdogs and kinds Arya did not know shaggy brindled beasts with long yellow teeth Between the inn and the fountain a dozen riders sat astride their horses watching the townsmen open the fat man’s cage and tug his arm until his swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground The dogs were at him at once tearing chunks of flesh off his bones

Arya heard one of the riders laugh Here’s your new castle you bloody Lannister bastard he said A little snug for the likes o’ you but we’ll squeeze you in never fret Beside him a prisoner sat sullen with coils of hempen rope tight around his wrists Some of the townsmen were throwing dung at him but he never flinched You’ll rot in them cages his captor was shouting The crows will be picking out your eyes while we’re spending all that good Lannister gold o’ yours And when them crows are done we’ll send what’s left o’ you to your bloody brother Though I doubt he’ll know you

The noise had woken half the Peach Gendry squeezed into the window beside Arya and Tom stepped up behind them naked as his name day What’s all that bloody shouting Lem complained from bed A man’s trying to get some bloody sleep

Where’s Greenbeard Tom asked him

Abed with Tansy Lem said Why
