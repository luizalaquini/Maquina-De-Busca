And I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name
of God Almighty but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them

64 And I have also established my covenant with them to give them
the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were
strangers

65 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom
the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my covenant

66 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the LORD and I
will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and I will
rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched
out arm and with great judgments 67 And I will take you to me for a
people and I will be to you a God and ye shall know that I am the
LORD your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
Egyptians

68 And I will bring you in unto the land concerning the which I did
swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give
it you for an heritage I am the LORD

Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt
