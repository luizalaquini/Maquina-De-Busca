FG Table 22 Phoneme categories
pp
Diphthongs pose no problem here because we have not classified them
as single phonemes
pp
The remaining categories are consonants  The glides are quite
similar to vowels and diphthongs though for they are voiced
continuous sounds  You can say them and prolong them
This is also true of the fricatives 
ul
r
is interesting
because it can be realized acoustically in very different ways
Some people curl the tip of the tongue
back em a so-called retroflex action of the tongue  Many people
cannot do this and their
ul
rc
s sound like
ul
wc
s
The stage Scotsmans
ul
r
is a trill where the tip of the tongue vibrates against the roof of the mouth
ul
l
is also
slightly unusual for it is the only English phoneme which is lateral em
air passes either side of it in two separate passages  Welsh
has another lateral sound a fricative which is written ll as
in Llandudno
pp
The next category is the stops  These are formed by stopping up
the mouth so that air pressure builds up behind the lips and
releasing this pressure suddenly  The result is a little
explosion and the stops are often called plosives which
usually creates a very short burst of fricative noise and in some cases
aspiration as well  They are further subdivided into voiced and
unvoiced stops depending upon whether voicing starts as soon as
the plosion occurs sometimes even before or well after it
If you put your hand in front of your mouth when saying pit you
can easily feel the puff of air that signals the plosion on the
ul
p
and probably on the
ul
t
as well
pp
In a sense nasals are really stops as well and they are often
called stops for the oral tract is blocked although the nasal
one is not  The peculiar fact that the nasal
ul
ng
never occurs at the beginning of a word in English was mentioned
earlier  Notice that for stops and nasals there is a similarity in the
ul
vertical
direction of Table 22 between
ul
p
ul
b
and
ul
m
ul
t
ul
d
and
ul
n
and
ul
k
ul
g
and
ul

ul
p
is an unvoiced version of
ul
b
try saying them
and
ul
m
is a nasalized version for
ul
b
is what you get when you
have a cold and try to say
