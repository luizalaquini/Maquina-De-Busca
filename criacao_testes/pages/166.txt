Renly has thirty men in his personal guard the rest even fewer It is not enough even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance I must have the gold cloaks The City Watch is two thousand strong sworn to defend the castle the city and the king’s peace

Ah but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another whose peace do they protect Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger setting it spinning in place Round and round it went wobbling as it turned When at last it slowed to a stop the blade pointed at Littlefinger Why there’s your answer he said smiling They follow the man who pays them He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face his grey-green eyes bright with mockery You wear your honor like a suit of armor Stark You think it keeps you safe but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move Look at you now You know why you summoned me here You know what you want to ask me to do You know it has to be done… but it’s not honorable so the words stick in your throat

Ned’s neck was rigid with tension For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak

Littlefinger laughed I ought to make you say it but that would be cruel… so have no fear my good lord For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours Six thousand gold pieces should do it A third for the Commander a third for the officers a third for the men We might be able to buy them for half that much but I prefer not to take chances Smiling he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned hilt first





JON

Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench I’ve been summoned to the sept Sam said in an excited whisper They’re passing me out of training I’m to be made a brother with the rest of you Can you believe it

No truly

Truly I’m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds He needs someone who can read and write letters

You’ll do well at that Jon said smiling

Sam glanced about anxiously Is it time to go I shouldn’t be late they might change their minds He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard The day was warm and sunny Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine

Inside the sept the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar Pyp’s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs but no one dared say a word Septon Celladar was swinging a censer filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark’s little sept in Winterfell For once the septon seemed sober

The high officers arrived in a body Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings Behind them came the senior members of the three orders red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward First Builder Othell Yarwyck and Ser Jaremy Rykker who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark

Mormont stood before the altar the rainbow shining on his broad bald head You came to us outlaws he began poachers rapers debtors killers and thieves You came to us children You came to us alone in chains with neither friends nor honor You came to us rich and you came to us poor Some of you bear the names of proud houses Others have only bastards’ names or no names at all It makes no matter All that is past now On the Wall we are all one house

At evenfall as the sun sets and we face the gathering night you shall take your vows From that moment you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch Your crimes will be washed away your debts forgiven So too you must wash away your former loyalties put aside your grudges forget old wrongs and old loves alike Here you begin anew

A man of the Night’s Watch lives his life for the realm Not for a king nor a lord nor the honor of this house or that house neither for gold nor glory nor a woman’s love but for the realm and all the people in it A man of the Night’s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons Our wife is duty Our mistress is honor And you are the only sons we shall ever know

You have learned the words of the vow Think carefully before you say them for once you have taken the black there is no turning back The penalty for desertion is death The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said Are there any among you who wish to leave our company If so go now and no one shall think the less of you

No one moved

Well and good said Mormont You may take your vows here at evenfall before Septon Celladar and the first of your order Do any of you keep to the old gods

Jon stood I do my lord

I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree as your uncle did Mormont said

Yes my lord Jon said The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks

He heard Grenn whispering behind him There’s no godswood here Is there I never saw a godswood

You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow Pyp whispered back

I would so Grenn insisted I’d see them a long way off

Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts Castle Black has no need of a godswood Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot and mayhap your gods as well
