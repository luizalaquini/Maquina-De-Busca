the mans hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an
hand breadth so he measured the breadth of the building one reed
and the height one reed

406 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east and
went up the stairs thereof and measured the threshold of the gate
which was one reed broad and the other threshold of the gate which
was one reed broad

407 And every little chamber was one reed long and one reed broad
and between the little chambers were five cubits and the threshold of
the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed

went up unto it by seven steps and the arches thereof were before
them
