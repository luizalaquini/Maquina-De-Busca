gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to
them 1736 But the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him
shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice

1737 And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the
commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for
evermore and ye shall not fear other gods

1738 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget
neither shall ye fear other gods

1739 But the LORD your God ye shall fear and he shall deliver you
out of the hand of all your enemies

1740 Howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former
manner

1741 So these nations feared the LORD and served their graven
images both their children and their childrens children as did
their fathers so do they unto this day

181 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
of Israel that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign

182 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was
Abi the daughter of Zachariah

183 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
according to all that David his father did

184 He removed the high places and brake the images and cut down
the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had
made for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to
it and he called it Nehushtan

185 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel so that after him was none
like him among all the kings of Judah nor any that were before him

186 For he clave to the LORD and departed not from following him
but kept his commandments which the LORD commanded Moses

187 And the LORD was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went
forth and he rebelled against the king of Assyria and served him
not

188 He smote the Philistines even unto Gaza and the borders
thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city

189 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel that
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it

1810 And at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth
year of Hezekiah that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel
Samaria was taken

1811 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria and
put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the
cities of the Medes 1812 Because they obeyed not the voice of the
LORD their God but transgressed his covenant and all that Moses the
servant of the LORD commanded and would not hear them nor do them

1813 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took
them

1814 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
Lachish saying I have offended return from me that which thou
puttest on me will I bear And the king of Assyria appointed unto
Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold

1815 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
of the LORD and in the treasures of the kings house

1816 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
temple of the LORD and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah
had overlaid and gave it to the king of Assyria

1817 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem And
they went up and came to Jerusalem And when they were come up they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the
highway of the fullers field

1818 And when they had called to the king there came out to them
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah which was over the household and Shebna
the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder

1819 And Rabshakeh said unto them Speak ye now to Hezekiah Thus
saith the great king the king of Assyria What confidence is this
wherein thou trustest  1820 Thou sayest but they are but vain
words I have counsel and strength for the war Now on whom dost thou
trust that thou rebellest against me  1821 Now behold thou
trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon Egypt on
which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is
Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him
