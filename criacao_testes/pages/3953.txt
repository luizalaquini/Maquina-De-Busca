want so badly to secure is the light As long as Buttercup
feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under
his paws hes bristling with aggression Thats how Ive
been since I left the arena with Peeta alive When the light
goes out completely Buttercups temporarily distraught and
confused but he recovers and moves on to other things
Thats what would happen if Peeta died But the one thing
that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light
on but put it hopelessly out of his reach high on the wall
beyond even his jumping skills He paces below the wall
wails and cant be comforted or distracted Hes useless
until I shut the light off Thats what Snow is trying to do to
me now only I dont know what form his game takes
Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs
Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being
tortured for rebel information was bad But thinking that hes
being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is
unendurable And its under the weight of this revelation that
I truly begin to break
After Crazy Cat were directed to bed The powers
been coming and going sometimes the lamps burn at full
brightness other times we squint at one another in the
brownouts At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness
and activate safety lights in each space Prim whos
decided the walls will hold up snuggles with Buttercup on
the lower bunk My mothers on the upper I offer to take a
bunk but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I
flail around so much when Im sleeping
Im not flailing now as my muscles are rigid with the
tension of holding myself together The pain over my heart
returns and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out into
my body Through my torso down my arms and legs over
my face leaving it crisscrossed with cracks One good jolt
of a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange razorsharp
shards
When the restless wiggling majority has settled into
sleep I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe
through the cavern until I find Finnick feeling for some
unspecified reason that he will understand He sits under
the safety light in his space knotting his rope not even
pretending to rest As I whisper my discovery of Snows
plan to break me it dawns on me This strategy is very old
news to Finnick Its what broke him
This is what theyre doing to you with Annie isnt it I
ask
Well they didnt arrest her because they thought shed
be a wealth of rebel information he says They know Id
never have risked telling her anything like that For her own
protection
Oh Finnick Im so sorry I say
No Im sorry That I didnt warn you somehow he tells
me
Suddenly a memory surfaces Im strapped to my bed
mad with rage and grief after the rescue Finnick is trying to
console me about Peeta Theyll figure out he doesnt
know anything pretty fast And they wont kill him if they
think they can use him against you
You did warn me though On the hovercraft Only
when you said theyd use Peeta against me I thought you
meant like bait To lure me into the Capitol somehow I
say
I shouldnt have said even that It was too late for it to
be of any help to you Since I hadnt warned you before the
Quarter Quell I shouldve shut up about how Snow
operates Finnick yanks on the end of his rope and an
intricate knot becomes a straight line again Its just that I
didnt understand when I met you After your first Games I
thought the whole romance was an act on your part We all
expected youd continue that strategy But it wasnt until
Peeta hit the force field and nearly died that I-- Finnick
hesitates
I think back to the arena How I sobbed when Finnick
revived Peeta The quizzical look on Finnicks face The
way he excused my behavior blaming it on my pretend
pregnancy That you what
That I knew Id misjudged you That you do love him
Im not saying in what way Maybe you dont know yourself
But anyone paying attention could see how much you care
about him he says gently
Anyone On Snows visit before the Victory Tour he
challenged me to erase any doubts of my love for Peeta
Convince me Snow said It seems under that hot pink
sky with Peetas life in limbo I finally did And in doing so I
gave him the weapon he needed to break me
Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence watching the
knots bloom and vanish before I can ask How do you
bear it
Finnick looks at me in disbelief I dont Katniss
Obviously I dont I drag myself out of nightmares each
morning and find theres no relief in waking Something in
my expression stops him Better not to give in to it It takes
ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to
fall apart
Well he must know I take a deep breath forcing
myself back into one piece
The more you can distract yourself the better he
says First thing tomorrow well get you your own rope
Until then take mine
I spend the rest of the night on my mattress
obsessively making knots holding them up for Buttercups
