This morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys’s day to be sure

Our overripe fruits

Hallyne bobbed his head Wisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars as was promised the queen I concur The pyromancer looked indecently pleased with that prospect

Assuming our enemies give you the time The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy dangerous and time-consuming process He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two If they can truly give us ten thousand…

He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified Perhaps a smidge of both I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste Wisdom We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire nor even one… and we most certainly do not want any mishaps

There will be no mishaps my lord Hand The substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant it is ready Above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand A protective spell has been laid on the floors hmmm most powerful Any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away and the sand smothers the blaze at once

Not to mention the careless acolyte By spell Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant clever trick He thought he would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it worked but this was not the time Perhaps when the war was won

My brethren are never careless Hallyne insisted If I may be hmmmm frank…

Oh do

The substance flows through my veins and lives in the heart of every pyromancer We respect its power But the common soldier hmmmm the crew of one of the queen’s spitfires say in the unthinking frenzy of battle… any little mistake can bring catastrophe That cannot be said too often My father often told King Aerys as much as his father told old King Jaehaerys

They must have listened Tyrion said If they had burned the city down someone would have told me So your counsel is that we had best be careful 

Be very careful said Hallyne Be very very careful

These clay jars… do you have an ample supply

We do my lord and thank you for asking

You won’t mind if I take some then A few thousand

A few thousand

Or however many your guild can spare without interfering with production It’s empty pots I’m asking for understand Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates

I will my lord but why…

Tyrion smiled up at him When you tell me to dress warmly I dress warmly When you tell me to be careful well… He gave a shrug I’ve seen enough Perhaps you would be so good as to escort me back up to my litter

It would be my great hmmm pleasure my lord Hallyne lifted the lamp and led the way back to the stairs It was good of you to visit us A great honor hmmm It has been too long since the King’s Hand graced us with his presence Not since Lord Rossart and he was of our order That was back in King Aerys’s day King Aerys took a great interest in our work

King Aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies His brother Jaime had told him a few stories of the Mad King and his pet pyromancers Joffrey will be interested as well I have no doubt Which is why I’d best keep him well away from you

It is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in his own royal person I have spoken of it to your royal sister A great feast…

It was growing warmer as they climbed His Grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war is won At my insistence The king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people go without bread

A most hmmm loving gesture my lord Perhaps instead some few of us might call upon the king at the Red Keep A small demonstration of our powers as it were to distract His Grace from his many cares for an evening Wildfire is but one of the dread secrets of our ancient order Many and wondrous are the things we might show you

I will take it up with my sister Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks but Joff’s fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough he had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning them alive

When at last they reached the top of the steps Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the Iron Torches a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance Tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadn’t known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him Wildfire was too costly to squander

They emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the Street of the Sisters near the foot of Visenya’s Hill He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men Given his purpose today it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard Besides their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble That was all to the good these days Only three nights past another mob had gathered at the gates of the Red Keep chanting for food Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them slaying four and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead Winning us still more friends
