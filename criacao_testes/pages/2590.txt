land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee

215 Then she let them down by a cord through the window for her
house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall

216 And she said unto them Get you to the mountain lest the
pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the
pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way

217 And the men said unto her We will be blameless of this thine
oath which thou hast made us swear

218 Behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou
shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy
fathers household home unto thee

219 And it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will
be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood
shall be on our head if any hand be upon him

220 And if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of
thine oath which thou hast made us to swear

221 And she said According unto your words so be it And she sent
them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the
window

222 And they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three
days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them
throughout all the way but found them not

223 So the two men returned and descended from the mountain and
passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun and told him all
things that befell them 224 And they said unto Joshua Truly the
LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us

31 And Joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from
Shittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and
lodged there before they passed over

32 And it came to pass after three days that the officers went
through the host 33 And they commanded the people saying When ye
see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God and the priests the
Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after
it

34 Yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand
cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by
which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore

35 And Joshua said unto the people Sanctify yourselves for to
morrow the LORD will do wonders among you

36 And Joshua spake unto the priests saying Take up the ark of the
covenant and pass over before the people And they took up the ark of
the covenant and went before the people

37 And the LORD said unto Joshua This day will I begin to magnify
thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was
with Moses so I will be with thee

38 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
covenant saying When ye are come to the brink of the water of
Jordan ye shall stand still in Jordan

39 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel Come hither and hear
the words of the LORD your God

310 And Joshua said Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the
Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and
the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites

311 Behold the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
passeth over before you into Jordan

312 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel
out of every tribe a man

313 And it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of
the priests that bear the ark of the LORD the LORD of all the earth
shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the waters of Jordan shall be
cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall
stand upon an heap

314 And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to
pass over Jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
before the people 315 And as they that bare the ark were come unto
Jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in
the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
time of harvest 316 That the waters which came down from above
stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam that is
beside Zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain
even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed
over right against Jericho

317 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
