Darkness descended with the thunderclap The Thenns were jabbing with their spears as the wolf darted between them The old man’s mare reared maddened by the smell of slaughter and lashed out with her hooves Longclaw was still in his hand All at once Jon Snow knew he would never get a better chance

He cut down the first man as he turned toward the wolf shoved past a second slashed at a third Through the madness he heard someone call his name but whether it was Ygritte or the Magnar he could not say The Thenn fighting to control the horse never saw him Longclaw was feather-light He swung at the back of the man’s calf and felt the steel bite down to the bone When the wildling fell the mare bolted but somehow Jon managed to grab her mane with his off hand and vault himself onto her back A hand closed round his ankle and he hacked down and saw Bodger’s face dissolve in a welter of blood The horse reared lashing out One hoof caught a Thenn in the temple with a crunch

And then they were running Jon made no effort to guide the horse It was all he could do to stay on her as they plunged through mud and rain and thunder Wet grass whipped at his face and a spear flew past his ear If the horse stumbles and breaks a leg they will run me down and kill me he thought but the old gods were with him and the horse did not stumble Lightning shivered through the black dome of sky and thunder rolled across the plains The shouts dwindled and died behind him

Long hours later the rain stopped Jon found himself alone in a sea of tall black grass There was a deep throbbing ache in his right thigh When he looked down he was surprised to see an arrow jutting out the back of it When did that happen He grabbed hold of the shaft and gave it a tug but the arrowhead was sunk deep in the meat of his leg and the pain when he pulled on it was excruciating He tried to think back on the madness at the inn but all he could remember was the beast gaunt and grey and terrible It was too large to be a common wolf A direwolf then It had to be He had never seen an animal move so fast Like a grey wind… could Robb have returned to the north

Jon shook his head He had no answers It was too hard to think… about the wolf the old man Ygritte any of it…

Clumsily he slid down off the mare’s back His wounded leg buckled under him and he had to swallow a scream This is going to be agony The arrow had to come out though and nothing good could come of waiting Jon curled his hand around the fletching took a deep breath and shoved the arrow forward He grunted then cursed It hurt so much he had to stop I am bleeding like a butchered pig he thought but there was nothing to be done for it until the arrow was out He grimaced and tried again… and soon stopped again trembling Once more This time he screamed but when he was done the arrowhead was poking through the front of his thigh Jon pushed back his bloody breeches to get a better grip grimaced and slowly drew the shaft through his leg How he got through that without fainting he never knew

He lay on the ground afterward clutching his prize and bleeding quietly too weak to move After a while he realized that if he did not make himself move he was like to bleed to death Jon crawled to the shallow stream where the mare was drinking washed his thigh in the cold water and bound it tight with a strip of cloth torn from his cloak He washed the arrow too turning it in his hands Was the fletching grey or white Ygritte fletched her arrows with pale grey goose feathers Did she loose a shaft at me as I fled Jon could not blame her for that He wondered if she’d been aiming for him or the horse If the mare had gone down he would have been doomed A lucky thing my leg got in the way he muttered

He rested for a while to let the horse graze She did not wander far That was good Hobbled with a bad leg he could never have caught her It was all he could do to force himself back to his feet and climb onto her back How did I ever mount her before without saddle or stirrups and a sword in one hand That was another question he could not answer

Thunder rumbled softly in the distance but above him the clouds were breaking up Jon searched the sky until he found the Ice Dragon then turned the mare north for the Wall and Castle Black The throb of pain in his thigh muscle made him wince as he put his heels into the old man’s horse I am going home he told himself But if that was true why did he feel so hollow

He rode till dawn while the stars stared down like eyes





Daenerys


Her Dothraki scouts had told her how it was but Dany wanted to see for herself Ser Jorah Mormont rode with her through a birchwood forest and up a slanting sandstone ridge Near enough he warned her at the crest

Dany reined in her mare and looked across the fields to where the Yunkish host lay athwart her path Whitebeard had been teaching her how best to count the numbers of a foe Five thousand she said after a moment

I’d say so Ser Jorah pointed Those are sellswords on the flanks Lances and mounted bowmen with swords and axes for the close work The Second Sons on the left wing the Stormcrows to the right About five hundred men apiece See the banners

Yunkai’s harpy grasped a whip and iron collar in her talons instead of a length of chain But the sellswords flew their own standards beneath those of the city they served on the right four crows between crossed thunderbolts on the left a broken sword The Yunkai’i hold the center themselves Dany noted Their officers looked indistinguishable from Astapor’s at a distance tall bright helms and cloaks sewn with flashing copper disks Are those slave soldiers they lead

In large part But not the equal of Unsullied Yunkai is known for training bed slaves not warriors

What say you Can we defeat this army

Easily Ser Jorah said

But not bloodlessly Blood aplenty had soaked into the bricks of Astapor the day that city fell though little of it belonged to her or hers

We might win a battle here but at such cost we cannot take the city

That is ever a risk Khaleesi Astapor was complacent and vulnerable Yunkai is forewarned

Dany considered The slaver host seemed small compared to her own numbers but the sellswords were ahorse She’d ridden too long with Dothraki not to have a healthy respect for what mounted warriors could do to foot The Unsullied could withstand their charge but my freedmen will be slaughtered The slavers like to talk she said Send word that I will hear them this evening in my tent And invite the captains of the sellsword companies to call on me as well But not together The Stormcrows at midday the Second Sons two hours later

As you wish Ser Jorah said But if they do not come—

They’ll come They will be curious to see the dragons and hear what I might have to say and the clever ones will see it for a chance to gauge my strength She wheeled her silver mare about I’ll await them in my pavilion

Slate skies and brisk winds saw Dany back to her host The deep ditch that would encircle her camp was already half dug and the woods were full of Unsullied lopping branches off birch trees to sharpen into stakes The eunuchs could not sleep in an unfortified camp or so Grey Worm insisted He was there watching the work Dany halted a moment to speak with him Yunkai has girded up her loins for battle

This is good Your Grace These ones thirst for blood

When she had commanded the Unsullied to choose officers from amongst themselves Grey Worm had been their overwhelming choice for the highest rank Dany had put Ser Jorah over him to train him for command and the exile knight said that so far the young eunuch was hard but fair quick to learn tireless and utterly unrelenting in his attention to detail

The Wise Masters have assembled a slave army to meet us

A slave in Yunkai learns the way of seven sighs and the sixteen seats of pleasure Your Grace The Unsullied learn the way of the three spears Your Grey Worm hopes to show you

One of the first things Dany had done after the fall of Astapor was abolish the custom of giving the Unsullied new slave names every day Most of those born free had returned to their birth names those who still remembered them at least Others had called themselves after heroes or gods and sometimes weapons gems and even flowers which resulted in soldiers with some very peculiar names to Dany’s ears Grey Worm had remained Grey Worm When she asked him why he said It is a lucky name The name this one was born to was accursed That was the name he had when he was taken for a slave But Grey Worm is the name this one drew the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free

If battle is joined let Grey Worm show wisdom as well as valor Dany told him Spare any slave who runs or throws down his weapon The fewer slain the more remain to join us after

This one will remember

I know he will Be at my tent by midday I want you there with my other officers when I treat with the sellsword captains Dany spurred her silver on to camp

Within the perimeter the Unsullied had established the tents were going up in orderly rows with her own tall golden pavilion at the center A second encampment lay close beyond her own five times the size sprawling and chaotic this second camp had no ditches no tents no sentries no horselines Those who had horses or mules slept beside them for fear they might be stolen Goats sheep and half-starved dogs wandered freely amongst hordes of women children and old men Dany had left Astapor in the hands of a council of former slaves led by a healer a scholar and a priest Wise men all she thought and just Yet even so tens of thousands preferred to follow her to Yunkai rather than remain behind in Astapor I gave them the city and most of them were too frightened to take it

The raggle-taggle host of freedmen dwarfed her own but they were more burden than benefit Perhaps one in a hundred had a donkey a camel or an ox most carried weapons looted from some slaver’s armory but only one in ten was strong enough to fight and none was trained They ate the land bare as they passed like locusts in sandals Yet Dany could not bring herself to abandon them as Ser Jorah and her bloodriders urged I told them they were free I cannot tell them now they are not free to join me She gazed at the smoke rising from their cookfires and swallowed a sigh She might have the best footsoldiers in the world but she also had the worst

Arstan Whitebeard stood outside the entrance of her tent while Strong Belwas sat crosslegged on the grass nearby eating a bowl of figs On the march the duty of guarding her fell upon their shoulders She had made Jhogo Aggo and Rakharo her kos as well as her bloodriders and just now she needed them more to command her Dothraki than to protect her person Her khalasar was tiny some thirty-odd mounted warriors and most of them braidless boys and bentback old men Yet they were all the horse she had and she dared not go without them The Unsullied might be the finest infantry in all the world as Ser Jorah claimed but she needed scouts and outriders as well

Yunkai will have war Dany told Whitebeard inside the pavilion Irri and Jhiqui had covered the floor with carpets while Missandei lit a stick of incense to sweeten the dusty air Drogon and Rhaegal were asleep atop some cushions curled about each other but Viserion perched on the edge of her empty bath Missandei what language will these Yunkai’i speak Valyrian

Yes Your Grace the child said A different dialect than Astapor’s yet close enough to understand The slavers name themselves the Wise Masters

Wise Dany sat crosslegged on a cushion and Viserion spread his white-and-gold wings and flapped to her side We shall see how wise they are she said as she scratched the dragon’s scaly head behind the horns

Ser Jorah Mormont returned an hour later accompanied by three captains of the Stormcrows They wore black feathers on their polished helms and claimed to be all equal in honor and authority Dany studied them as Irri and Jhiqui poured the wine Prendahl na Ghezn was a thickset Ghiscari with a broad face and dark hair going grey Sallor the Bald had a twisting scar across his pale Qartheen cheek and Daario Naharis was flamboyant even for a Tyroshi His beard was cut into three prongs and dyed blue the same color as his eyes and the curly hair that fell to his collar His pointed mustachios were painted gold His clothes were all shades of yellow a foam of Myrish lace the color of butter spilled from his collar and cuffs his doublet was sewn with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions and ornamental goldwork crawled up his high leather boots to his thighs Gloves of soft yellow suede were tucked into a belt of gilded rings and his fingernails were enameled blue

But it was Prendahl na Ghezn who spoke for the sellswords You would do well to take your rabble elsewhere he said You took Astapor by treachery but Yunkai shall not fall so easily

Five hundred of your Stormcrows against ten thousand of my Unsullied said Dany I am only a young girl and do not understand the ways of war yet these odds seem poor to me

The Stormcrows do not stand alone said Prendahl

Stormcrows do not stand at all They fly at the first sign of thunder Perhaps you should be flying now I have heard that sellswords are notoriously unfaithful What will it avail you to be staunch when the Second Sons change sides

That will not happen Prendahl insisted unmoved And if it did it would not matter The Second Sons are nothing We fight beside the stalwart men of Yunkai

You fight beside bed-boys armed with spears When she turned her head the twin bells in her braid rang softly Once battle is joined do not think to ask for quarter Join me now however and you shall keep the gold the Yunkaii paid you and claim a share of the plunder besides with greater rewards later when I come into my kingdom Fight for the Wise Masters and your wages will be death Do you imagine that Yunkai will open its gates when my Unsullied are butchering you beneath the walls 

Woman you bray like an ass and make no more sense
