He craned his head back and cupped his hands around his mouth Ser Davos Seaworth to see His Grace

Are you drunk Go away and stop that pounding

Salladhor Saan had warned him Davos tried a different tack Send for my son then Devan the king’s squire

The guard frowned Who did you say you were

Davos he shouted The onion knight

The head vanished to return a moment later Be off with you The onion knight died on the river His ship burned

His ship burned Davos agreed but he lived and here he stands Is Jate still captain of the gate

Who

Jate Blackberry He knows me well enough

I never heard of him Most like he’s dead

Lord Chyttering then

That one I know He burned on the Blackwater

Hookface Will Hal the Hog

Dead and dead the crossbowman said but his face betrayed a sudden doubt You wait there He vanished again

Davos waited Gone all gone he thought dully remembering how fat Hal’s white belly always showed beneath his grease-stained doublet the long scar the fish hook had left across Will’s face the way Jate always doffed his cap at the women be they five or fifty highborn or low Drowned or burned with my sons and a thousand others gone to make a king in hell

Suddenly the crossbowman was back Go round to the sally port and they’ll admit you

Davos did as he was bid The guards who ushered him inside were strangers to him They carried spears and on their breasts they wore the fox-and-flowers sigil of House Florent They escorted him not to the Stone Drum as he’d expected but under the arch of the Dragon’s Tail and down to Aegon’s Garden Wait here their sergeant told him

Does His Grace know that I’ve returned asked Davos

Bugger all if I know Wait I said The man left taking his spearmen with him

Aegon’s Garden had a pleasant piney smell to it and tall dark trees rose on every side There were wild roses as well and towering thorny hedges and a boggy spot where cranberries grew

Why have they brought me here Davos wondered

Then he heard a faint ringing of bells and a child’s giggle and suddenly the fool Patchface popped from the bushes shambling along as fast as he could go with the Princess Shireen hot on his heels You come back now she was shouting after him Patches you come back

When the fool saw Davos he jerked to a sudden halt the bells on his antlered tin helmet going ting-a-ling ting-a-ling Hopping from one foot to the other he sang Fool’s blood king’s blood blood on the maiden’s thigh but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom aye aye aye Shireen almost caught him then but at the last instant he hopped over a patch of bracken and vanished among the trees The princess was right behind him The sight of them made Davos smile

He had turned to cough into his gloved hand when another small shape crashed out of the hedge and bowled right into him knocking him off his feet

The boy went down as well but he was up again almost at once What are you doing here he demanded as he brushed himself off Jet-black hair fell to his collar and his eyes were a startling blue You shouldn’t get in my way when I’m running

No Davos agreed I shouldn’t Another fit of coughing seized him as he struggled to his knees

Are you unwell The boy took him by the arm and pulled him to his feet Should I summon the maester
