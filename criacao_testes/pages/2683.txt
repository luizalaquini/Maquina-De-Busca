shekels of silver in mine hand yet would I not put forth mine hand
against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and
Abishai and Ittai saying Beware that none touch the young man
Absalom

1813 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life
for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest
have set thyself against me

1814 Then said Joab I may not tarry thus with thee And he took
three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom
while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak

1815 And ten young men that bare Joabs armour compassed about and
smote Absalom and slew him

1816 And Joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing
after Israel for Joab held back the people

1817 And they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the
wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all Israel
fled every one to his tent

1818 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said I have no son to
keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own
name and it is called unto this day Absaloms place

1819 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok Let me now run and bear the
king tidings how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies

1820 And Joab said unto him Thou shalt not bear tidings this day
but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear
no tidings because the kings son is dead

1821 Then said Joab to Cushi Go tell the king what thou hast seen
And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab and ran

1822 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab But
howsoever let me I pray thee also run after Cushi And Joab said
Wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings
ready  1823 But howsoever said he let me run And he said unto
him Run Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran Cushi

1824 And David sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and
looked and behold a man running alone

1825 And the watchman cried and told the king And the king said If
he be alone there is tidings in his mouth And he came apace and
drew near

1826 And the watchman saw another man running and the watchman
called unto the porter and said Behold another man running alone
And the king said He also bringeth tidings

1827 And the watchman said Me thinketh the running of the foremost
is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok And the king said He
is a good man and cometh with good tidings

1828 And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king All is well And he
fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said
Blessed be the LORD thy God which hath delivered up the men that
lifted up their hand against my lord the king

1829 And the king said Is the young man Absalom safe And Ahimaaz
answered When Joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant I saw
a great tumult but I knew not what it was

1830 And the king said unto him Turn aside and stand here And he
turned aside and stood still

1831 And behold Cushi came and Cushi said Tidings my lord the
king for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
against thee

1832 And the king said unto Cushi Is the young man Absalom safe And
Cushi answered The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise
against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is

1833 And the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the
gate and wept and as he went thus he said O my son Absalom my
son my son Absalom would God I had died for thee O Absalom my son
my son  191 And it was told Joab Behold the king weepeth and
mourneth for Absalom

192 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for
his son

193 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as
people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle

194 But the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud
voice O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my son  195 And Joab
came into the house to the king and said Thou hast shamed this day
the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and
the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy
wives and the lives of thy concubines 196 In that thou lovest thine
enemies and hatest thy friends For thou hast declared this day that
