What are you doing here bastard Thorne asked

Bathing But don’t let me spoil your plotting Jon climbed from the water dried dressed and left them to conspire

Outside he found he had no idea where he was going He walked past the shell of the Lord Commander’s Tower where once he’d saved the Old Bear from a dead man past the spot where Ygritte had died with that sad smile on her face past the King’s Tower where he and Satin and Deaf Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and his Thenns past the heaped and charred remains of the great wooden stair The inner gate was open so Jon went down the tunnel through the Wall He could feel the cold around him the weight of all the ice above his head He walked past the place where Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty had fought and died together through the new outer gate and back into the pale cold sunlight

Only then did he permit himself to stop to take a breath to think Othell Yarwyck was not a man of strong convictions except when it came to wood and stone and mortar The Old Bear had known that Thorne and Marsh will sway him Yarwyck will support Lord Janos and Lord Janos will be chosen Lord Commander And what does that leave me if not Winterfell

A wind swirled against the Wall tugging at his cloak He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way heat comes off a fire Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again The afternoon was growing old and the sun was low in the west A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined his wildling captives within a ring of ditches sharpened stakes and high wooden fences To his left were three great firepits where the victors had burned the bodies of all the free folk to die beneath the Wall huge pelted giants and little Hornfoot men alike The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched weeds and hardened pitch but Mance’s people had left traces of themselves everywhere a torn hide that might have been part of a tent a giant’s maul the wheel of a chariot a broken spear a pile of mammoth dung On the edge of the haunted forest where the tents had been Jon found an oakwood stump and sat

Ygritte wanted me to be a wildling Stannis wants me to be the Lord of Winterfell But what do I want The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where it curved through the western hills Jon watched as that towering expanse of ice took on the reds and pinks of sunset Would I sooner be hanged for a turncloak by Lord Janos or forswear my vows marry Val and become the Lord of Winterfell It seemed an easy choice when he thought of it in those terms    though if Ygritte had still been alive it might have been even easier Val was a stranger to him She was not hard on the eyes certainly and she had been sister to Mance Rayder’s queen but still   

I would need to steal her if I wanted her love but she might give me children I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of since he decided to live his life on the Wall I could name him Robb Val would want to keep her sister’s son but we could foster him at Winterfell and Gilly’s boy as well Sam would never need to tell his lie We’d find a place for Gilly too and Sam could come visit her once a year or so Mance’s son and Craster’s would grow up brothers as I once did with Robb

He wanted it Jon knew then He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything I have always wanted it he thought guiltily May the gods forgive me It was a hunger inside him sharp as a dragonglass blade A hunger    he could feel it It was food he needed prey a red deer that stank of fear or a great elk proud and defiant He needed to kill and fill his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood His mouth began to water with the thought

It was a long moment before he understood what was happening When he did he bolted to his feet Ghost He turned toward the wood and there he came padding silently out of the green dusk the breath coming warm and white from his open jaws Ghost he shouted and the direwolf broke into a run He was leaner than he had been but bigger as well and the only sound he made was the soft crunch of dead leaves beneath his paws When he reached Jon he leapt and they wrestled amidst brown grass and long shadows as the stars came out above them Gods wolf where have you been Jon said when Ghost stopped worrying at his forearm I thought you’d died on me like Robb and Ygritte and all the rest I’ve had no sense of you not since I climbed the Wall not even in dreams The direwolf had no answer but he licked Jon’s face with a tongue like a wet rasp and his eyes caught the last light and shone like two great red suns

Red eyes Jon realized but not like Melisandre’s He had a weirwood’s eyes Red eyes red mouth white fur Blood and bone like a heart tree He belongs to the old gods this one And he alone of all the direwolves was white Six pups they’d found in the late summer snows him and Robb five that were grey and black and brown for the five Starks and one white as white as Snow

He had his answer then

Beneath the Wall the queen’s men were kindling their nightfire He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away Come Ghost Jon told the wolf With me You’re hungry I know I could feel it They ran together for the gate circling wide around the nightfire where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night

The king’s men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black They stopped as Jon went by and gaped at him None of them had ever seen a direwolf before he realized and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods As he walked toward the armory Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window I’m sorry he thought I’m not the man to steal you out of there

In the practice yard he came upon a dozen king’s men with torches and long spears in their hands Their sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled and a couple of his men lowered their spears until the knight who led them said Move aside and let them pass To Jon he said You’re late for your supper

Then get out of my way ser Jon replied and he did

He could hear the noise even before he reached the bottom of the steps raised voices curses someone pounding on a table Jon stepped into the vault all but unnoticed His brothers crowded the benches and the tables but more were standing and shouting than were sitting and no one was eating There was no food What’s happening here Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about turncloaks and treason Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower    some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again demanding quiet but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling

Pyp was the first to see Jon He grinned at the sight of Ghost put two fingers in his mouth and whistled as only a mummer’s boy could whistle The shrill sound cut through the clamor like a sword As Jon walked toward the tables more of the brothers took note and fell quiet A hush spread across the cellar until the only sounds were Jon’s heels clicking on the stone floor and the soft crackle of the logs in the hearth

Ser Alliser Thorne shattered the silence The turncloak graces us with his presence at last

Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering The beast he gasped Look The beast that tore the life from Halfhand A warg walks among us brothers A WARG This    this creature is not fit to lead us This beastling is not fit to live

Ghost bared his teeth but Jon put a hand on his head My lord he said will you tell me what’s happened here

Maester Aemon answered from the far end of the hall Your name has been put forth as Lord Commander Jon

That was so absurd Jon had to smile By who he said looking for his friends This had to be one of Pyp’s japes surely But Pyp shrugged at him and Grenn shook his head It was Dolorous Edd Tollett who stood By me Aye it’s a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend but better you than me

Lord Janos started sputtering again This this is an outrage We ought to hang this boy Yes Hang him I say hang him for a turncloak and a warg along with his friend Mance Rayder Lord Commander I will not have it I will not suffer it

Cotter Pyke stood up You won’t suffer it Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your bloody arse but you’re wearing a black cloak now

Any brother may offer any name for our consideration so long as the man has said his vows Ser Denys Mallister said Tollett is well within his rights my lord

A dozen men started to talk at once each trying to drown out the others and before long half the hall was shouting once more This time it was Ser Alliser Thorne who leapt up on the table and raised his hands for quiet Brothers he cried this gains us naught I say we vote This king who has taken the King’s Tower has posted men at all the doors to see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice So be it We will choose and choose again all night if need be until we have our lord    but before we cast our tokens I believe our First Builder has something to say to us

Othell Yarwyck stood up slowly frowning The big builder rubbed his long lantern jaw and said Well I’m pulling my name out If you wanted me you had ten chances to choose me and you didn’t Not enough of you anyway I was going to say that those who were casting a token for me ought to choose Lord Janos   

Ser Alliser nodded Lord Slynt is the best possible—

I wasn’t done Alliser Yarwyck complained Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King’s Landing we all know and he was Lord of Harrenhal   

He’s never seen Harrenhal Cotter Pyke shouted out

Well that’s so said Yarwyck Anyway now that I’m standing here I don’t recall why I thought Slynt would be such a good choice That would be sort of kicking King Stannis in the mouth and I don’t see how that serves us Might be Snow would be better He’s been longer on the Wall he’s Ben Stark’s nephew and he served the Old Bear as squire Yarwyck shrugged Pick who you want just so it’s not me He sat down

Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple Jon saw but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale The Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again but now he was shouting for the kettle Some of his friends took up the cry Kettle they roared as one Kettle kettle KETTLE

The kettle was in the corner by the hearth a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot With a raucous scream and a clap of wings a huge raven burst out of the kettle It flapped upward seeking the rafters perhaps or a window to make its escape but there were no rafters in the vault nor windows either The raven was trapped Cawing loudly it circled the hall once twice three times And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout I know that bird That’s Lord Mormont’s raven

The raven landed on the table nearest Jon Snow it cawed It was an old bird dirty and bedraggled Snow it said again Snow snow snow It walked to the end of the table spread its wings again and flew to Jon’s shoulder

Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter Ser Piggy thinks we’re all fools brothers he said He’s taught the bird this little trick They all say snow go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves Mormont’s bird had more words than that

The raven cocked its head and looked at Jon Corn it said hopefully When it got neither corn nor answer it quorked and muttered Kettle Kettle Kettle

The rest was arrowheads a torrent of arrowheads a flood of arrowheads arrowheads enough to drown the last few stones and shells and all the copper pennies too

When the count was done Jon found himself surrounded Some clapped him on the back whilst others bent the knee to him as if he were a lord in truth Satin Owen the Oaf Halder Toad Spare Boot Giant Mully Ulmer of the Kingswood Sweet Donnel Hill and half a hundred more pressed around him Dywen clacked his wooden teeth and said Gods be good our Lord Commander’s still in swaddling clothes Iron Emmett said I hope this don’t mean I can’t beat the bloody piss out of you next time we train my lord Three-Finger Hobb wanted to know if he’d still be eating with the men or if he’d want his meals sent up to his solar Even Bowen Marsh came up to say he would be glad to continue as Lord Steward if that was Lord Snow’s wish

Lord Snow said Cotter Pyke if you muck this up I’m going to rip your liver out and eat it raw with onions

Ser Denys Mallister was more courteous It was a hard thing young Samwell asked of me the old knight confessed When Lord Qorgyle was chosen I told myself ‘No matter he has been longer on the Wall than you have your time will come’ When it was Lord Mormont I thought ‘He is strong and fierce but he is old your time may yet come’ But you are half a boy Lord Snow and now I must return to the Shadow Tower knowing that my time will never come He smiled a tired smile Do not make me die regretful Your uncle was a great man Your lord father and his father as well I shall expect full as much of you

Aye said Cotter Pyke And you can start by telling those king’s men that it’s done and we want our bloody supper

Supper screamed the raven Supper supper

The king’s men cleared the door when they told them of the choosing and Three-Finger Hobb and half a dozen helpers went trotting off to the kitchen to fetch the food Jon did not wait to eat He walked across the castle wondering if he were dreaming with the raven on his shoulder and Ghost at his heels Pyp Grenn and Sam trailed after him chattering but he hardly heard a word until Grenn whispered Sam did it and Pyp said Sam did it Pyp had brought a wineskin with him and he took a long drink and chanted Sam Sam Sam the wizard Sam the wonder Sam Sam the marvel man he did it But when did you hide the raven in the kettle Sam and how in seven hells could you be certain it would fly to Jon It would have mucked up everything if the bird had decided to perch on Janos Slynt’s fat head

I had nothing to do with the bird Sam insisted When it flew out of the kettle I almost wet myself

Jon laughed half amazed that he still remembered how You’re all a bunch of mad fools do you know that

Us said Pyp You call us fools We’re not the ones who got chosen as the nine-hundredth-and-ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch You best have some wine Lord Jon I think you’re going to need a lot of wine

So Jon Snow took the wineskin from his hand and had a swallow But only one The Wall was his the night was dark and he had a king to face
