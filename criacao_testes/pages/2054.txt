Long before the first pale fingers of light pried apart Bran’s shutters his eyes were open

There were guests in Winterfell visitors come for the harvest feast This morning they would be tilting at quintains in the yard Once that prospect would have filled him with excitement but that was before

Not now The Walders would break lances with the squires of Lord Manderly’s escort but Bran would have no part of it He must play the prince in his father’s solar Listen and it may be that you will learn something of what lordship is all about Maester Luwin had said

Bran had never asked to be a prince It was knighthood he had always dreamed of bright armor and streaming banners lance and sword a warhorse between his legs Why must he waste his days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood Because you’re broken a voice inside reminded him A lord on his cushioned chair might be crippled—the Walders said their grandfather was so feeble he had to be carried everywhere in a litter—but not a knight on his destrier Besides it was his duty You are your brother’s heir and the Stark in Winterfell Ser Rodrik said reminding him of how Robb used to sit with their lord father when his bannermen came to see him

Lord Wyman Manderly had arrived from White Harbor two days past traveling by barge and litter as he was too fat to sit a horse With him had come a long tail of retainers knights squires lesser lords and ladies heralds musicians even a juggler all aglitter with banners and surcoats in what seemed half a hundred colors Bran had welcomed them to Winterfell from his father’s high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms and afterward Ser Rodrik had said he’d done well If that had been the end of it he would not have minded But it was only the beginning

The feast makes a pleasant pretext Ser Rodrik explained but a man does not cross a hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine Only those who have matters of import to set before us are like to make the journey

Bran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above his head Robb would tell him not to play the boy he knew He could almost hear him and their lord father as well Winter is coming and you are almost a man grown Bran You have a duty

When Hodor came bustling in smiling and humming tunelessly he found the boy resigned to his fate Together they got him washed and brushed The white wool doublet today Bran commanded And the silver brooch Ser Rodrik will want me to look lordly As much as he could Bran preferred to dress himself but there were some tasks—pulling on breeches lacing his boots—that vexed him They went quicker with Hodor’s help Once he had been taught to do something he did it deftly His hands were always gentle though his strength was astonishing You could have been a knight too I bet Bran told him If the gods hadn’t taken your wits you would have been a great knight

Hodor Hodor blinked at him with guileless brown eyes eyes innocent of understanding

Yes said Bran Hodor He pointed

On the wall beside the door hung a basket stoutly made of wicker and leather with holes cut for Bran’s legs Hodor slid his arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight around his chest then knelt beside the bed Bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support himself as he swung the dead weight of his legs into the basket and through the holes

Hodor Hodor said again rising The stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by himself on his back Bran’s head almost brushed the ceiling He ducked low as they passed through the door One time Hodor smelled bread baking and ran to the kitchens and Bran got such a crack that Maester Luwin had to sew up his scalp Mikken had given him a rusty old visorless helm from the armory but Bran seldom troubled to wear it The Walders laughed whenever they saw it on his head

He rested his hands on Hodor’s shoulders as they descended the winding stair Outside the sounds of sword and shield and horse already rang through the yard It made a sweet music I’ll just have a look Bran thought a quick look that’s all

The White Harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning with their knights and men-at-arms Until then the yard belonged to their squires who ranged in age from ten to forty Bran wished he were one of them so badly that his stomach hurt with the wanting

Two quintains had been erected in the courtyard each a stout post supporting a spinning crossbeam with a shield at one end and a padded butt at the other The shields had been painted red-and-gold though the Lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen and already well scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at them

The sight of Bran in his basket drew stares from those who had not seen it before but he had learned to ignore stares At least he had a good view on Hodor’s back he towered over everyone The Walders were mounting up he saw They’d brought fine armor up from the Twins shining silver plate with enameled blue chasings Big Walder’s crest was shaped like a castle while Little Walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk Their shields and surcoats also set them apart from each other Little Walder quartered the twin towers of Frey with the brindled boar of his grandmother’s House and the plowman of his mother’s Crakehall and Darry respectively Big Walder’s quarterings were the tree-and-ravens of House Blackwood and the twining snakes of the Paeges They must be hungry for honor Bran thought as he watched them take up their lances A Stark needs only the direwolf

Their dappled grey coursers were swift strong and beautifully trained Side by side they charged the quintains Both hit the shields cleanly and were well past before the padded butts came spinning around Little Walder struck the harder blow but Bran thought Big Walder sat his horse better He would have given both his useless legs for the chance to ride against either

Little Walder cast his splintered lance aside spied Bran and reined up Now there’s an ugly horse he said of Hodor

Hodor’s no horse Bran said

Hodor said Hodor

Big Walder trotted up to join his cousin Well he’s not as smart as a horse that’s for certain A few of the White Harbor lads poked each other and laughed

Hodor Beaming genially Hodor looked from one Frey to the other oblivious to their taunting Hodor hodor

Little Walder’s mount whickered See they’re talking to each other Maybe hodor means ‘I love you’ in horse

You shut up Frey Bran could feel his color rising

Little Walder spurred his horse closer giving Hodor a bump that pushed him backward What will you do if I don’t

He’ll set his wolf on you cousin warned Big Walder

Let him I always wanted a wolfskin cloak

Summer would tear your fat head off Bran said

Little Walder banged a mailed fist against his breastplate Does your wolf have steel teeth to bite through plate and mail

Enough Maester Luwin’s voice cracked through the clangor of the yard as loud as a thunderclap How much he had overheard Bran could not say    but it was enough to anger him clearly These threats are unseemly and I’ll hear no more of them Is this how you behave at the Twins Walder Frey

If I want to Atop his courser Little Walder gave Luwin a sullen glare as if to say You are only a maester who are you to reproach a Frey of the Crossing

Well it is not how Lady Stark’s wards ought behave at Winterfell What’s at the root of this The maester looked at each boy in turn One of you will tell me I swear or—

We were having a jape with Hodor confessed Big Walder I am sorry if we offended Prince Bran We only meant to be amusing He at least had the grace to look abashed

Little Walder only looked peevish And me he said I was only being amusing too

The bald spot atop the maester’s head had turned red Bran could see if anything Luwin was more angry than before A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless he told the Freys I will not have you making Hodor the butt of cruel jests do you hear me He’s a good-hearted lad dutiful and obedient which is more than I can say for either of you The maester wagged a finger at Little Walder And you will stay out of the godswood and away from those wolves or answer for it Sleeves flapping he turned on his heels stalked off a few paces and glanced back Bran Come Lord Wyman awaits

Hodor go with the maester Bran commanded

Hodor said Hodor His long strides caught up with the maester’s furiously pumping legs on the steps of the Great Keep Maester Luwin held the door open and Bran hugged Hodor’s neck and ducked as they went through

The Walders— he began

I’ll hear no more of that it’s done Maester Luwin looked worn-out and frayed You were right to defend Hodor but you should never have been there Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman have broken their fast already while they waited for you Must I come myself to fetch you as if you were a little child

No Bran said ashamed I’m sorry I only wanted   

I know what you wanted Maester Luwin said more gently Would that it could be Bran Do you have any questions before we begin this audience

Will we talk of the war

You will talk of naught The sharpness was back in Luwin’s voice You are still a child of eight   

Almost nine

Eight the maester repeated firmly Speak nothing but courtesies unless Ser Rodrik or Lord Wyman puts you a question

Bran nodded I’ll remember

I will say nothing to Ser Rodrik of what passed between you and the Frey boys

Thank you

They put Bran in his father’s oak chair with the grey velvet cushions behind a long plank-and-trestle table Ser Rodrik sat on his right hand and Maester Luwin to his left armed with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired Bran ran a hand across the rough wood of the table and begged Lord Wyman’s pardons for being late

Why no prince is ever late the Lord of White Harbor responded amiably Those who arrive before him have come early that’s all Wyman Manderly had a great booming laugh It was small wonder he could not sit a saddle he looked as if he outweighed most horses As windy as he was vast he began by asking Winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he had appointed for White Harbor The old ones had been holding back silver for King’s Landing rather than paying it over to the new King in the North King Robb needs his own coinage as well he declared and White Harbor is the very place to mint it He offered to take charge of the matter as it please the king and went from that to speak of how he had strengthened the port’s defenses detailing the cost of every improvement
