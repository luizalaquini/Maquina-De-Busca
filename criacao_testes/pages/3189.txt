matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have
done and not to leave the other undone

2324 Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel

2325 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye make
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are
full of extortion and excess

2326 Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup
and platter that the outside of them may be clean also

2327 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye are like
unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are
within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness

2328 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within
ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity

2329 Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because ye
build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the
righteous 2330 And say If we had been in the days of our fathers
we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets

2331 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the
children of them which killed the prophets

2332 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers

2333 Ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the
damnation of hell  2334 Wherefore behold I send unto you prophets
and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify
and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute
them from city to city 2335 That upon you may come all the righteous
blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the
blood of Zacharias son of Barachias whom ye slew between the temple
and the altar

2336 Verily I say unto you All these things shall come upon this
generation

2337 O Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and
stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered
thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings and ye would not  2338 Behold your house is left unto you
desolate

2339 For I say unto you Ye shall not see me henceforth till ye
shall say Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord

241 And Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his
disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple

242 And Jesus said unto them See ye not all these things verily I
say unto you There shall not be left here one stone upon another
that shall not be thrown down

243 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives the disciples came unto
him privately saying Tell us when shall these things be and what
shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world  244
And Jesus answered and said unto them Take heed that no man deceive
you

245 For many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall
deceive many

246 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not
troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not
yet

247 For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes
in divers places

248 All these are the beginning of sorrows

249 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake

2410 And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
and shall hate one another

2411 And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many

2412 And because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax
cold

2413 But he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved

2414 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come

2415 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation
spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso
readeth let him understand 2416 Then let them which be in Judaea
flee into the mountains 2417 Let him which is on the housetop not
come down to take any thing out of his house 2418 Neither let him
which is in the field return back to take his clothes
