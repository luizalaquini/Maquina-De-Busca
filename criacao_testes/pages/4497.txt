The godswood She had to find Ser Dontos beg him to take her home now before it was too late

The halfman said you’re not to leave the woman said Pray here the gods will hear

Meekly Sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside She realized suddenly why this place seemed so familiar They’ve put me in Arya’s old bedchamber from when Father was the Hand of the King All her things are gone and the furnishings have been moved around but it’s the same   

A short time later a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives with a flagon of cold water Take it away Sansa commanded but the girl left the food on a table She was thirsty she realized Every step sent knives through her thighs but she made herself cross the room She drank two cups of water and was nibbling on an olive when the knock came

Anxiously she turned toward the door smoothed down the folds of her robe Yes

The door opened and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside My lady I trust I am not disturbing you

Am I your prisoner

My guest He was wearing his chain of office a necklace of linked golden hands I thought we might talk

As my lord commands Sansa found it hard not to stare his face was so ugly it held a queer fascination for her

The food and garments are to your satisfaction he asked If there is anything else you need you have only to ask

You are most kind And this morning    it was very good of you to help me

You have a right to know why Joffrey was so wroth Six nights gone your brother fell upon my uncle Stafford encamped with his host at a village called Oxcross not three days ride from Casterly Rock Your northerners won a crushing victory We received word only this morning

Robb will kill you all she thought exulting It’s    terrible my lord My brother is a vile traitor

The dwarf smiled wanly Well he’s no fawn he’s made that clear enough

Ser Lancel said Robb led an army of wargs   

The Imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter Ser Lancel’s a wineskin warrior who wouldn’t know a warg from a wart Your brother had his direwolf with him but I suspect that’s as far as it went The northmen crept into my uncle’s camp and cut his horse lines and Lord Stark sent his wolf among them Even war-trained destriers went mad Knights were trampled to death in their pavilions and the rabble woke in terror and fled casting aside their weapons to run the faster Ser Stafford was slain as he chased after a horse Lord Rickard Karstark drove a lance through his chest Ser Rubert Brax is also dead along with Ser Lymond Vikary Lord Crakehall and Lord Jast Half a hundred more have been taken captive including Jast’s sons and my nephew Martyn Lannister Those who survived are spreading wild tales and swearing that the old gods of the north march with your brother

Then    there was no sorcery

Lannister snorted Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence My mutton-headed uncle had not even troubled to post sentries it would seem His host was raw—apprentice boys miners fieldhands fisherfolk the sweepings of Lannisport The only mystery is how your brother reached him Our forces still hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth and they swear he did not pass The dwarf gave an irritated shrug Well Robb Stark is my father’s bane Joffrey is mine Tell me what do you feel for my kingly nephew

I love him with all my heart Sansa said at once

Truly He did not sound convinced Even now

My love for His Grace is greater than it has ever been

The Imp laughed aloud Well someone has taught you to lie well You may be grateful for that one day child You are a child still are you not Or have you flowered

Sansa blushed It was a rude question but the shame of being stripped before half the castle made it seem like nothing No my lord

That’s all to the good If it gives you any solace I do not intend that you ever wed Joffrey No marriage will reconcile Stark and Lannister after all that has happened I fear More’s the pity The match was one of King Robert’s better notions if Joffrey hadn’t mucked it up

She knew she ought to say something but the words caught in her throat

You grow very quiet Tyrion Lannister observed Is this what you want An end to your betrothal

I    Sansa did not know what to say Is it a trick Will he punish me if I tell the truth She stared at the dwarf’s brutal bulging brow the hard black eye and the shrewd green one the crooked teeth and wiry beard I only want to be loyal

Loyal the dwarf mused and far from any Lannisters I can scarce blame you for that When I was your age I wanted the same thing He smiled They tell me you visit the godswood every day What do you pray for Sansa

I pray for Robb’s victory and Joffrey’s death    and for home For Winterfell I pray for an end to the fighting

We’ll have that soon enough There will be another battle between your brother Robb and my lord father and that will settle the issue

Robb will beat him Sansa thought He beat your uncle and your brother Jaime he’ll beat your father too

It was as if her face were an open book so easily did the dwarf read her hopes Do not take Oxcross too much to heart my lady he told her not unkindly A battle is not a war and my lord father is assuredly not my uncle Stafford The next time you visit the godswood pray that your brother has the wisdom to bend the knee Once the north returns to the king’s peace I mean to send you home He hopped down off the window seat and said You may sleep here tonight I’ll give you some of my own men as a guard some Stone Crows perhaps—

No Sansa blurted out aghast If she was locked in the Tower of the Hand guarded by the dwarf’s men how would Ser Dontos ever spirit her away to freedom

Would you prefer Black Ears I’ll give you Chella if a woman would make you more at ease

Please no my lord the wildlings frighten me

He grinned Me as well But more to the point they frighten Joffrey and that nest of sly vipers and lickspittle dogs he calls a Kingsguard With Chella or Timett by your side no one would dare offer you harm

I would sooner return to my own bed A lie came to her suddenly but it seemed so right that she blurted it out at once This tower was where my father’s men were slain Their ghosts would give me terrible dreams and I would see their blood wherever I looked

Tyrion Lannister studied her face I am no stranger to nightmares Sansa Perhaps you are wiser than I knew Permit me at least to escort you safely back to your own chambers





CATELYN

It was full dark before they found the village Catelyn found herself wondering if the place had a name If so its people had taken that knowledge with them when they fled along with all they owned down to the candles in the sept Ser Wendel lit a torch and led her through the low door

Within the seven walls were cracked and crooked God is one Septon Osmynd had taught her when she was a girl with seven aspects as the sept is a single building with seven walls The wealthy septs of the cities had statues of the Seven and an altar to each In Winterfell Septon Chayle hung carved masks from each wall Here Catelyn found only rough charcoal drawings Ser Wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door and left to wait outside with Robar Royce

Catelyn studied the faces The Father was bearded as ever The Mother smiled loving and protective The Warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face the Smith his hammer The Maid was beautiful the Crone wizened and wise

And the seventh face    the Stranger was neither male nor female yet both ever the outcast the wanderer from far places less and more than human unknown and unknowable Here the face was a black oval a shadow with stars for eyes It made Catelyn uneasy She would get scant comfort there

She knelt before the Mother My lady look down on this battle with a mother’s eyes They are all sons every one Spare them if you can and spare my own sons as well Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon Would that I were with them

A crack ran down through the Mother’s left eye It made her look as if she were crying Catelyn could hear Ser Wendel’s booming voice and now and again Ser Robar’s quiet answers as they talked of the coming battle Otherwise the night was still Not even a cricket could be heard and the gods kept their silence Did your old gods ever answer you Ned she wondered When you knelt before your heart tree did they hear you

Flickering torchlight danced across the walls making the faces seem half-alive twisting them changing them The statues in the great septs of the cities wore the faces the stonemasons had given them but these charcoal scratchings were so crude they might be anyone The Father’s face made her think of her own father dying in his bed at Riverrun The Warrior was Renly and Stannis Robb and Robert Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow She even glimpsed Arya in those lines just for an instant Then a gust of wind through the door made the torch sputter and the semblance was gone washed away in orange glare

The smoke was making her eyes burn She rubbed at them with the heels of her scarred hands When she looked up at the Mother again it was her own mother she saw Lady Minisa Tully had died in childbed trying to give Lord Hoster a second son The baby had perished with her and afterward some of the life had gone out of Father She was always so calm Catelyn thought remembering her mother’s soft hands her warm smile If she had lived how different our lives might have been She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter kneeling here before her I have come so many thousands of leagues and for what Who have I served I have lost my daughters Robb does not want me and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother I was not even with Ned when he died   

Her head swam and the sept seemed to move around her The shadows swayed and shifted furtive animals racing across the cracked white walls Catelyn had not eaten today Perhaps that had been unwise She told herself that there had been no time but the truth was that food had lost its savor in a world without Ned When they took his head off they killed me too
