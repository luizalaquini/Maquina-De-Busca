Where is my brother Dany asked He ought to have come by now for the feast

I saw His Grace this morning he told her He told me he was going to the Western Market in search of wine

Wine Dany said doubtfully Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare’s milk the Dothraki drank she knew that and he was oft at the bazaars these days drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from east and west He seemed to find their company more congenial than hers

Wine Ser Jorah confirmed and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him and he attacked it with both hands

Is that wise she asked He has no gold to pay soldiers What if he’s betrayed Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor and the Usurper in King’s Landing would pay well for her brother’s head You ought to have gone with him to keep him safe You are his sworn sword

We are in Vaes Dothrak he reminded her No one may carry a blade here or shed a man’s blood

Yet men die she said Jhogo told me Some of the traders have eunuchs with them huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered

Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything Ser Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table He had planned to take your dragon’s eggs until I warned him that I’d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them

For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words My eggs… but they’re mine Magister Illyrio gave them to me a bride gift why would Viserys want… they’re only stones…

The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals Princess… and dragon’s eggs are rarer by far Those traders he’s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need

Dany had not known had not even suspected Then… he should have them He does not need to steal them He had only to ask He is my brother… and my true king

He is your brother Ser Jorah acknowledged

You do not understand ser she said My mother died giving me birth and my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys had not been there to tell me He was the only one left The only one He is all I have

Once said Ser Jorah No longer Khaleesi You belong to the Dothraki now In your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world He held out his cup and a slave filled it with fermented mare’s milk sour-smelling and thick with clots

Dany waved her away Even the smell of it made her feel ill and she would take no chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat What does it mean she asked What is this stallion Everyone was shouting it at me but I don’t understand

The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy child He will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth or so it was promised All the people of the world will be his herd

Oh Dany said in a small voice Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach I named him Rhaego

A name to make the Usurper’s blood run cold

Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow My lady the handmaid whispered urgently your brother…

Dany looked down the length of the long roofless hall and there he was striding toward her From the lurch in his step she could tell at once that Viserys had found his wine… and something that passed for courage

He was wearing his scarlet silks soiled and travel-stained His cloak and gloves were black velvet faded from the sun His boots were dry and cracked his silver-blond hair matted and tangled A longsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed Dany heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her like a tide The music died away in a nervous stammering of drums

A sense of dread closed around her heart Go to him she commanded Ser Jorah Stop him Bring him here Tell him he can have the dragon’s eggs if that is what he wants The knight rose swiftly to his feet

Where is my sister Viserys shouted his voice thick with wine I’ve come for her feast How dare you presume to eat without me No one eats before the king Where is she The whore can’t hide from the dragon

He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits peering around at the faces of the Dothraki There were five thousand men in the hall but only a handful who knew the Common Tongue Yet even if his words were incomprehensible you had only to look at him to know that he was drunk

Ser Jorah went to him swiftly whispered something in his ear and took him by the arm but Viserys wrenched free Keep your hands off me No one touches the dragon without leave

Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals beside him Khal Jommo grinned and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly

The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes Khal Drogo he said thickly his voice almost polite I’m here for the feast He staggered away from Ser Jorah making to join the three khals on the high bench

Khal Drogo rose spat out a dozen words in Dothraki faster than Dany could understand and pointed Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench Ser Jorah translated for her brother Khal Drogo says your place is there

Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing At the back of the long hall in a corner by the wall deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them sat the lowest of the low raw unblooded boys old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints the dim-witted and the maimed Far from the meat and farther from honor That is no place for a king her brother declared

Is place Khal Drogo answered in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him for Sorefoot King He clapped his hands together A cart Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat

Five thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout Ser Jorah was standing beside Viserys screaming in his ear but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could not hear what he was saying Her brother shouted back and the two men grappled until Mormont knocked Viserys bodily to the floor

Her brother drew his sword

The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits Keep away from me Viserys hissed Ser Jorah backed off a step and her brother climbed unsteadily to his feet He waved the sword over his head the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had given him to make him seem more kingly Dothraki were shrieking at him from all sides screaming vile curses

Dany gave a wordless cry of terror She knew what a drawn sword meant here even if her brother did not

Her voice made Viserys turn his head and he saw her for the first time There she is he said smiling He stalked toward her slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies though no one tried to bar his way

The blade… you must not she begged him Please Viserys It is forbidden Put down the sword and come share my cushions There’s drink food… is it the dragon’s eggs you want You can have them only throw away the sword

Do as she tells you fool Ser Jorah shouted before you get us all killed

Viserys laughed They can’t kill us They can’t shed blood here in the sacred city… but I can He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward over the curve of her belly I want what I came for he told her I want the crown he promised me He bought you but he never paid for you Tell him I want what I bargained for or I’m taking you back You and the eggs both He can keep his bloody foal I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel Viserys was weeping she saw weeping and laughing both at the same time this man who had once been her brother

Distantly as from far away Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear pleading that she dared not translate that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up the Mother of Mountains She put her arm around the girl Don’t be afraid she said I shall tell him

She did not know if she had enough words yet when she was done Khal Drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in Dothraki and she knew he understood The sun of her life stepped down from the high bench What did he say the man who had been her brother asked her flinching

It had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo’s hair chiming softly with each step he took His bloodriders followed him like three copper shadows Daenerys had gone cold all over He says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold

Viserys smiled and lowered his sword That was the saddest thing the thing that tore at her afterward… the way he smiled That was all I wanted he said What was promised

When the sun of her life reached her Dany slid an arm around his waist The khal said a word and his bloodriders leapt forward Qotho seized the man who had been her brother by the arms Haggo shattered his wrist with a single sharp twist of his huge hands Cohollo pulled the sword from his limp fingers Even now Viserys did not understand No he shouted you cannot touch me I am the dragon the dragon and I will be crowned

Khal Drogo unfastened his belt The medallions were pure gold massive and ornate each one as large as a man’s hand He shouted a command Cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit dumped the stew onto the ground and returned the pot to the flames Drogo tossed in the belt and watched without expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape She could see fires dancing in the onyx of his eyes A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens and he pulled them on never so much as looking at the man

Viserys began to scream the high wordless scream of the coward facing death He kicked and twisted whimpered like a dog and wept like a child but the Dothraki held him tight between them Ser Jorah had made his way to Dany’s side He put a hand on her shoulder Turn away my princess I beg you

No She folded her arms across the swell of her belly protectively

At the last Viserys looked at her Sister please… Dany tell them… make them… sweet sister…

When the gold was half-melted and starting to run Drogo reached into the flames snatched out the pot Crown he roared Here A crown for Cart King And upended the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother

The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was like nothing human His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor slowed stopped Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest setting the scarlet silk to smoldering… yet no drop of blood was spilled

He was no dragon Dany thought curiously calm Fire cannot kill a dragon
