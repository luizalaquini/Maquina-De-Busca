or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or
sword  836 As it is written For thy sake we are killed all the day
long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter

837 Nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us

838 For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor
principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
839 Nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord

91 I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost 92 That I have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart

93 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh 94 Who are Israelites
to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and
the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises 95
Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
came who is over all God blessed for ever Amen

96 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect For they are
not all Israel which are of Israel 97 Neither because they are the
seed of Abraham are they all children but In Isaac shall thy seed
be called

98 That is They which are the children of the flesh these are not
the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed

99 For this is the word of promise At this time will I come and
Sarah shall have a son

910 And not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one
even by our father Isaac 911 For the children being not yet born
neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God
according to election might stand not of works but of him that
calleth 912 It was said unto her The elder shall serve the
younger

913 As it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated

914 What shall we say then Is there unrighteousness with God God
forbid

915 For he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion

916 So then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth
but of God that sheweth mercy

917 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up that I might shew my power in thee and that my
name might be declared throughout all the earth

918 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he
will he hardeneth

919 Thou wilt say then unto me Why doth he yet find fault For who
hath resisted his will  920 Nay but O man who art thou that
repliest against God Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
it Why hast thou made me thus  921 Hath not the potter power over
the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another
unto dishonour  922 What if God willing to shew his wrath and to
make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction 923 And that he might make known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore
prepared unto glory 924 Even us whom he hath called not of the
Jews only but also of the Gentiles  925 As he saith also in Osee I
will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved
which was not beloved

926 And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said
unto them Ye are not my people there shall they be called the
children of the living God

927 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel Though the number of the
children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be
saved 928 For he will finish the work and cut it short in
righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth

929 And as Esaias said before Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
a seed we had been as Sodoma and been made like unto Gomorrha

930 What shall we say then That the Gentiles which followed not
after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the
righteousness which is of faith

931 But Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath
not attained to the law of righteousness

932 Wherefore Because they sought it not by faith but as it were by
the works of the law For they stumbled at that stumblingstone 933
As it is written Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed

101 Brethren my hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is that
they might be saved
