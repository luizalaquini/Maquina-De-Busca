the emptiness Theres no one left to hear you
As we stand before the lump of metal that was the
gallows Cressida asks if either of us has ever been
tortured In answer Gale pulls off his shirt and turns his
back to the camera I stare at the lash marks and again
hear the whistling of the whip see his bloody figure hanging
unconscious by his wrists
Im done I announce Ill meet you at the Victors
Village Something formy mother
I guess I walked here but the next thing Im conscious
of is sitting on the floor in front of the kitchen cabinets of our
house in the Victors Village Meticulously lining ceramic
jars and glass bottles into a box Placing clean cotton
bandages between them to prevent breaking Wrapping
bunches of dried flowers
Suddenly I remember the rose on my dresser Was it
real If so is it still up there I have to resist the temptation
to check If its there it will only frighten me all over again I
hurry with my packing
When the cabinets are empty I rise to find that Gale
has materialized in my kitchen Its disturbing how
soundlessly he can appear Hes leaning on the table his
fingers spread wide against the wood grain I set the box
between us Remember he asks This is where you
kissed me
So the heavy dose of morphling administered after the
whipping wasnt enough to erase that from his
consciousness I didnt think youd remember that I say
Have to be dead to forget Maybe even not then he
tells me Maybe Ill be like that man in The Hanging Tree
Still waiting for an answer Gale who I have never seen
cry has tears in his eyes To keep them from spilling over I
reach forward and press my lips against his We taste of
heat ashes and misery Its a surprising flavor for such a
gentle kiss He pulls away first and gives me a wry smile I
knew youd kiss me
How I say Because I didnt know myself
Because Im in pain he says Thats the only way I
get your attention He picks up the box Dont worry
Katniss Itll pass He leaves before I can answer
Im too weary to work through his latest charge I spend
the short ride back to 13 curled up in a seat trying to ignore
Plutarch going on about one of his favorite subjects--
weapons mankind no longer has at its disposal High-flying
planes military satellites cell disintegrators drones
biological weapons with expiration dates Brought down by
the destruction of the atmosphere or lack of resources or
moral squeamishness You can hear the regret of a Head
Gamemaker who can only dream of such toys who must
make do with hovercraft and land-to-land missiles and plain
old guns
After dropping off my Mockingjay suit I go straight to
bed without eating Even so Prim has to shake me to get
me up in the morning After breakfast I ignore my schedule
and take a nap in the supply closet When I come to
crawling out from between the boxes of chalk and pencils
its dinnertime again I get an extra-large portion of pea
soup and am headed back to Compartment E when Boggs
intercepts me
Theres a meeting in Command Disregard your
current schedule he says
Done I say
Did you follow it at all today he asks in
exasperation
Who knows Im mentally disoriented I hold up my
wrist to show my medical bracelet and realize its gone
See I cant even remember they took my bracelet Why
do they want me in Command Did I miss something
I think Cressida wanted to show you the Twelve
propos But I guess youll see them when they air he says
Thats what I need a schedule of When the propos
air I say He shoots me a look but doesnt comment
further
People have crowded into Command but theyve
saved me a seat between Finnick and Plutarch The
screens are already up on the table showing the regular
Capitol feed
Whats going on Arent we seeing the Twelve
propos I ask
Oh no says Plutarch I mean possibly I dont know
exactly what footage Beetee plans to use
Beetee thinks hes found a way to break into the feed
nationwide says Finnick So that our propos will air in the
Capitol too Hes down working on it in Special Defense
now Theres live programming tonight Snows making an
appearance or something I think its starting
The Capitol seal appears underscored by the anthem
Then Im staring directly into President Snows snake eyes
as he greets the nation He seems barricaded behind his
podium but the white rose in his lapel is in full view The
camera pulls back to include Peeta off to one side in front
of a projected map of Panem Hes sitting in an elevated
chair his shoes supported by a metal rung The foot of his
prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat Beads of
sweat have broken through the layer of powder on his
upper lip and forehead But its the look in his eyes--angry
yet unfocused--that frightens me the most
Hes worse I whisper Finnick grasps my hand to
give me an anchor and I try to hang on
Peeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about the
