There is nothing small about the letter I bear Theon said and the offer he makes is one I suggested to him

This wolf king heeds your counsel does he The notion seemed to amuse Lord Balon

He heeds me yes I’ve hunted with him trained with him shared meat and mead with him warred at his side I have earned his trust He looks on me as an older brother he—

No His father jabbed a finger at his face Not here not in Pyke not in my hearing you will not name him brother this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword Or have you forgotten Rodrik and Maron who were your own blood

I forget nothing Ned Stark had killed neither of his brothers in truth Rodrik had been slain by Lord Jason Mallister at Seagard Maron crushed in the collapse of the old south tower… but Stark would have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to sweep them together I remember my brothers very well Theon insisted Chiefly he remembered Rodrik’s drunken cuffs and Maron’s cruel japes and endless lies I remember when my father was a king too He took out Robb’s letter and thrust it forward Here Read it… Your Grace

Lord Balon broke the seal and unfolded the parchment His black eyes flicked back and forth So the boy would give me a crown again he said and all I need do is destroy his enemies His thin lips twisted in a smile

By now Robb is at the Golden Tooth Theon said Once it falls he’ll be through the hills in a day Lord Tywin’s host is at Harrenhal cut off from the west The Kingslayer is a captive at Riverrun Only Ser Stafford Lannister and the raw green levies he’s been gathering remain to oppose Robb in the west Ser Stafford will put himself between Robb’s army and Lannisport which means the city will be undefended when we descend on it by sea If the gods are with us even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the Lannisters so much as realize that we are upon them

Lord Balon grunted Casterly Rock has never fallen

Until now Theon smiled And how sweet that will be

His father did not return the smile So this is why Robb Stark sends you back to me after so long So you might win my consent to this plan of his

It is my plan not Robb’s Theon said proudly Mine as the victory will be mine and in time the crown I will lead the attack myself if it please you As my reward I would ask that you grant me Casterly Rock for my own seat once we have taken it from the Lannisters With the Rock he could hold Lannisport and the golden lands of the west It would mean wealth and power such as House Greyjoy had never known

You reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling His father read the letter again The pup says nothing about a reward Only that you speak for him and I am to listen and give him my sails and swords and in return he will give me a crown His flinty eyes lifted to meet his son’s He will give me a crown he repeated his voice growing sharp

A poor choice of words what is meant is—

What is meant is what is said The boy will give me a crown And what is given can be taken away Lord Balon tossed the letter onto the brazier atop the necklace The parchment curled blackened and took flame

Theon was aghast Have you gone mad

His father laid a stinging backhand across his cheek Mind your tongue You are not in Winterfell now and I am not Robb the Boy that you should speak to me so I am the Greyjoy Lord Reaper of Pyke King of Salt and Rock Son of the Sea Wind and no man gives me a crown I pay the iron price I will take my crown as Urron Redhand did five thousand years ago

Theon edged backward away from the sudden fury in his father’s tone Take it then he spat his cheek still tingling Call yourself King of the Iron islands no one will care… until the wars are over and the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off his shore with an iron crown on his head

Lord Balon laughed Well at the least you are no craven No more than I’m a fool Do you think I gather my ships to watch them rock at anchor I mean to carve out a kingdom with fire and sword… but not from the west and not at the bidding of King Robb the Boy Casterly Rock is too strong and Lord Tywin too cunning by half Aye we might take Lannisport but we should never keep it No I hunger for a different plum… not so juicy sweet to be sure yet it hangs there ripe and undefended

Where Theon might have asked but by then he knew





DAENERYS

The Dothraki named the comet shierak qiya the Bleeding Star The old men muttered that it omened ill but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned Khal Drogo the night her dragons had awakened It is the herald of my coming she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart The gods have sent it to show me the way

Yet when she put the thought into words her handmaid Doreah quailed That way lies the red lands Khaleesi A grim place and terrible the riders say

The way the comet points is the way we must go Dany insisted… though in truth it was the only way open to her

She dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the Dothraki sea The first khalasar they met would swallow up her ragged band slaying the warriors and slaving the rest The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to them They were too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk and the Lhazareen had small reason to love them She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai and Astapor but Rakharo warned her that Pono’s khalasar had ridden that way driving thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of Slaver’s Bay Why should I fear Pono Dany objected He was Drogo’s ko and always spoke me gently

Ko Pono spoke you gently Ser Jorah Mormont said Khal Pono will kill you He was the first to abandon Drogo Ten thousand warriors went with him You have a hundred

No Dany thought I have four The rest are women old sick men and boys whose hair has never been braided I have the dragons she pointed out

Hatchlings Ser Jorah said One swipe from an arakh would put an end to them though Porto is more like to seize them for himself Your dragon eggs were more precious than rubies A living dragon is beyond price In all the world there are only three Every man who sees them will want them my queen

They are mine she said fiercely They had been born from her faith and her need given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the maegi Mirri Maz Duur Dany had walked into the flames as they came forth and they had drunk milk from her swollen breasts No man will take them from me while I live

You will not live long should you meet Khal Pono Nor Khal Jhaqo nor any of the others You must go where they do not

Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard… and when Mormont’s gruff counsel and the omens agreed her course was clear She called her people together and mounted her silver mare Her hair had burned away in Drogo’s pyre so her handmaids garbed her in the skin of the hrakkar Drogo had slain the white lion of the Dothraki sea Its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion’s mane and coiled its tail around her arm while Ser Jorah took his accustomed place by her side

We follow the comet Dany told her khalasar Once it was said no word was raised against it They had been Drogo’s people but they were hers now The Unburnt they called her and Mother of Dragons Her word was their law

They rode by night and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents Soon enough Dany learned the truth of Doreah’s words This was no kindly country They left a trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went for Pono Jhaqo and the others had seized the best of Drogo’s herds leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny the sickly and the lame the broken animals and the ill-tempered It was the same with the people They are not strong she told herself so I must be their strength I must show no fear no weakness no doubt However frightened my heart when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo’s queen She felt older than her fourteen years If ever she had truly been a girl that time was done

Three days into the march the first man died A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again An hour later he was done Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living His time was past her handmaid Irri declared No man should live longer than his teeth The others agreed Dany bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands

Two nights later it was an infant girl who perished Her mother’s anguished wailing lasted all day but there was nothing to be done The child had been too young to ride poor thing Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands she must be born again

There was little forage in the red waste and less water It was a sere and desolate land of low hills and barren windswept plains The rivers they crossed were dry as dead men’s bones Their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks and dead trees Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column but they found neither wells nor springs only bitter pools shallow and stagnant shrinking in the hot sun The deeper they rode into the waste the smaller the pools became while the distance between them grew If there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay they were hard dry gods deaf to prayers for rain

Wine gave out first and soon thereafter the clotted mare’s milk the horselords loved better than mead Then their stores of flatbread and dried meat were exhausted as well Their hunters found no game and only the flesh of their dead horses filled their bellies Death followed death Weak children wrinkled old women the sick and the stupid and the heedless the cruel land claimed them all Doreah grew gaunt and hollow-eyed and her soft golden hair turned brittle as straw

Dany hungered and thirsted with the rest of them The milk in her breasts dried up her nipples cracked and bled and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and hard as a stick yet it was her dragons she feared for Her father had been slain before she was born and her splendid brother Rhaegar as well Her mother had died bringing her into the world while the storm screamed outside Gentle Ser Willem Darry who must have loved her after a fashion had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young Her brother Viserys Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars even her unborn son the gods had claimed them all They will not have my dragons Dany vowed They will not

The dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the walls of Magister Illyrio’s estate in Pentos… until they unfolded their wings Their span was three times their length each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin gorgeously colored stretched taut between long thin bones When you looked hard you could see that most of their body was neck tail and wing Such little things she thought as she fed them by hand or rather tried to feed them for the dragons would not eat They would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat steam rising from their nostrils yet they would not take the food… until Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were children

Only dragons and men eat cooked meat he had said

When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black the dragons ripped at it eagerly their heads striking like snakes So long as the meat was seared they gulped down several times their own weight every day and at last began to grow larger and stronger Dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales and the heat that poured off them so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam

Each evenfall as the khalasar set out she would choose a dragon to ride upon her shoulder Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their mounts and rode close behind her so Dany was never out of their sight It was the only way to keep them quiescent

Aegon’s dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria she told her bloodriders one morning after a long night’s journey Visenya’s dragon was Vhagar Rhaenys had Meraxes and Aegon rode Balerion the Black Dread It was said that Vhagar’s breath was so hot that it could melt a knight’s armor and cook the man inside that Meraxes swallowed horses whole and Balerion… his fire was as black as his scales his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead

The Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily The largest of her three was shiny black his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns Khaleesi Aggo murmured there sits Balerion come again

It may be as you say blood of my blood Dany replied gravely but he shall have a new name for this new life I would name them all for those the gods have taken The green one shall be Rhaegal for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the Trident The cream-and-gold I call Viserion Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened yet he was my brother still His dragon will do what he could not

And the black beast asked Ser Jorah Mormont

The black she said is Drogon

Yet even as her dragons prospered her khalasar withered and died Around them the land turned ever more desolate Even devilgrass grew scant horses dropped in their tracks leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot Doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters her hair came out in clumps and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more She gave Doreah water from her own skin cooled her brow with a damp cloth and held her hand until she died shivering Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on

They saw no sign of other travelers The Dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the comet had led them to some hell Dany went to Ser Jorah one morning as they made camp amidst a jumble of black windscoured stones Are we lost she asked him Does this waste have no end to it
