HOUSE MARTELL

Nymeria the warrior queen of the Rhoyne brought her ten thousand ships to land in Dorne the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms and took Lord Mors Martell to husband With her help he vanquished his rivals to rule all Dorne The Rhoynar influence remains strong Thus Dornish rulers style themselves Prince rather than King Under Dornish law lands and titles pass to the eldest child not the eldest male Dorne alone of the Seven Kingdoms was never conquered by Aegon the Dragon It was not permanently joined to the realm until two hundred years later and then by marriage and treaty not the sword Peaceable King Daeron II succeeded where the warriors had failed by wedding the Dornish princess Myriah and giving his own sister in marriage to the reigning Prince of Dorne The Martell banner is a red sun pierced by a golden spear Their words are Unbowed Unbent Unbroken
