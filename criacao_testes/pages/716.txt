shall be made a dunghill

26 But if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me
the dream and the interpretation thereof

27 They answered again and said Let the king tell his servants the
dream and we will shew the interpretation of it

28 The king answered and said I know of certainty that ye would gain
the time because ye see the thing is gone from me

29 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one
decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and
I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof

210 The Chaldeans answered before the king and said There is not a
man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there is
no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or
astrologer or Chaldean

211 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none
other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose
dwelling is not with flesh

212 For this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded
to destroy all the wise men of Babylon

213 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and
they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain

214 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men
of Babylon 215 He answered and said to Arioch the kings captain
Why is the decree so hasty from the king Then Arioch made the thing
known to Daniel

216 Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give
him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation

217 Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to
Hananiah Mishael and Azariah his companions 218 That they would
desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret that
Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men
of Babylon

219 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision Then
Daniel blessed the God of heaven

220 Daniel answered and said Blessed be the name of God for ever and
ever for wisdom and might are his 221 And he changeth the times and
the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom
unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding 222 He
revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the
darkness and the light dwelleth with him

223 I thank thee and praise thee O thou God of my fathers who hast
given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings
matter

224 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise men of Babylon he went and said thus unto him
Destroy not the wise men of Babylon bring me in before the king and
I will shew unto the king the interpretation

225 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said
thus unto him I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will
make known unto the king the interpretation

226 The king answered and said to Daniel whose name was
Belteshazzar Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I
have seen and the interpretation thereof  227 Daniel answered in
the presence of the king and said The secret which the king hath
demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the
soothsayers shew unto the king 228 But there is a God in heaven
that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar
what shall be in the latter days Thy dream and the visions of thy
head upon thy bed are these 229 As for thee O king thy thoughts
came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter
and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to
pass

230 But as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
that I have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make
known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the
thoughts of thy heart

231 Thou O king sawest and behold a great image This great image
whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form
thereof was terrible

232 This images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of
silver his belly and his thighs of brass 233 His legs of iron his
feet part of iron and part of clay

234 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which
smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake
them to pieces
