The slaver shrugged Tell her to consider quickly There are many other buyers Only three days past I showed these same Unsullied to a corsair king who hopes to buy them all

The corsair wanted only a hundred your worship Dany heard the slave girl say

He poked her with the end of the whip Corsairs are all liars He’ll buy them all Tell her that girl

Dany knew she would take more than a hundred if she took any at all Remind your Good Master of who I am Remind him that I am Daenerys Stormborn Mother of Dragons the Unburnt trueborn queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros My blood is the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and of old Valyria before him

Yet her words did not move the plump perfumed slaver even when rendered in his own ugly tongue Old Ghis ruled an empire when the Valyrians were still fucking sheep he growled at the poor little scribe and we are the sons of the harpy He gave a shrug My tongue is wasted wagging at women East or west it makes no matter they cannot decide until they have been pampered and flattered and stuffed with sweetmeats Well if this is my fate so be it Tell the whore that if she requires a guide to our sweet city Kraznys mo Nakloz will gladly serve her… and service her as well if she is more woman than she looks

Good Master Kraznys would be most pleased to show you Astapor while you ponder Your Grace the translator said

I will feed her jellied dog brains and a fine rich stew of red octopus and unborn puppy He wiped his lips

Many delicious dishes can be had here he says

Tell her how pretty the pyramids are at night the slaver growled Tell her I will lick honey off her breasts or allow her to lick honey off mine if she prefers

Astapor is most beautiful at dusk Your Grace said the slave girl The Good Masters light silk lanterns on every terrace so all the pyramids glow with colored lights Pleasure barges ply the Worm playing soft music and calling at the little islands for food and wine and other delights

Ask her if she wishes to view our fighting pits Kraznys added Douquor’s Pit has a fine folly scheduled for the evening A bear and three small boys One boy will be rolled in honey one in blood and one in rotting fish and she may wager on which the bear will eat first

Tap tap tap Dany heard Arstan Whitebeard’s face was still but his staff beat out his rage Tap tap tap She made herself smile I have my own bear on Balerion she told the translator and he may well eat me if I do not return to him

See said Kraznys when her words were translated It is not the woman who decides it is this man she runs to As ever

Thank the Good Master for his patient kindness Dany said and tell him that I will think on all I learned here She gave her arm to Arstan Whitebeard to lead her back across the plaza to her litter Aggo and Jhogo fell in to either side of them walking with the bowlegged swagger all the horselords affected when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals

Dany climbed into her litter frowning and beckoned Arstan to climb in beside her A man as old as him should not be walking in such heat She did not close the curtains as they got under way With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red brick every stray breeze was to be cherished even if it did come with a swirl of fine red dust Besides I need to see

Astapor was a queer city even to the eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb of the World beneath the Mother of Mountains All the streets were made of the same red brick that had paved the plaza So too were the stepped pyramids the deep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats the sulfurous fountains and gloomy wine caves and the ancient walls that encircled them So many bricks she thought and so old and crumbling Their fine red dust was everywhere dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces the brick dust stung the eyes worse than sand

Make way Jhogo shouted as he rode before her litter Make way for the Mother of Dragons But when he uncoiled the great silverhandled whip that Dany had given him and made to crack it in the air she leaned out and told him nay Not in this place blood of my blood she said in his own tongue These bricks have heard too much of the sound of whips

The streets had been largely deserted when they had set out from the port that morning and scarcely seemed more crowded now An elephant lumbered past with a latticework litter on its back A naked boy with peeling skin sat in a dry brick gutter picking his nose and staring sullenly at some ants in the street He lifted his head at the sound of hooves and gaped as a column of mounted guards trotted by in a cloud of red dust and brittle laughter The copper disks sewn to their cloaks of yellow silk glittered like so many suns but their tunics were embroidered linen and below the waist they wore sandals and pleated linen skirts Bareheaded each man had teased and oiled and twisted his stiff red-black hair into some fantastic shape horns and wings and blades and even grasping hands so they looked like some troupe of demons escaped from the seventh hell The naked boy watched them for a bit along with Dany but soon enough they were gone and he went back to his ants and a knuckle up his nose

An old city this she reflected but not so populous as it was in its glory nor near so crowded as Qarth or Pentos or Lys

Her litter came to a sudden halt at the cross street to allow a coffle of slaves to shuffle across her path urged along by the crack of an overseer’s lash These were no Unsullied Dany noted but a more common sort of men with pale brown skins and black hair There were women among them but no children All were naked Two Astapori rode behind them on white asses a man in a red silk tokar and a veiled woman in sheer blue linen decorated with flakes of lapis lazuli In her red-black hair she wore an ivory comb The man laughed as he whispered to her paying no more mind to Dany than to his slaves nor the overseer with his twisted five-thonged lash a squat broad Dothraki who had the harpy and chains tattooed proudly across his muscular chest

Bricks and blood built Astapor Whitebeard murmured at her side and bricks and blood her people

What is that Dany asked him curious

An old rhyme a maester taught me when I was a boy I never knew how true it was The bricks of Astapor are red with the blood of the slaves who make them

I can well believe that said Dany

Then leave this place before your heart turns to brick as well Sail this very night on the evening tide

Would that I could thought Dany When I leave Astapor it must be with an army Ser Jorah says

Ser Jorah was a slaver himself Your Grace the old man reminded her There are sellswords in Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh you can hire A man who kills for coin has no honor but at least they are no slaves Find your army there I beg you
