her bitter voice being strangely low -- quite that of
another woman now
I have to say that I have been a bad black-hearted
man he answered
less than she
Ah dont taunt me madam This woman is more
to me dead as she is than ever you were or are or can
be  If Satan had not tempted me with that face of
yours and those cursed coquetries I should have
He turned to Fanny then But never mind darling
wife
At these words there arose from Bathshebas lips a
long low cry of measureless despair and indignation
such a wail of anguish as had never before been heard
within those old-inhabited walls It was the 
of her union with Troy
If shes  --  that -- what -- am I   she added as a
continuation of the same cry and sobbing pitifully
and the rarity with her of such abandonment only made
the condition more dire
 You are nothing to me  --  nothing said Troy
heartlessly A ceremony before a priest doesnt make
a marriage I am not morally yours
A vehement impulse to flee from him to run from
this place hide and escape his words at any price not
stopping short of death itself mastered Bathsheba now
She waited not an instant but turned to the door and
ran out

UNDER A TREE -- REACTION
BATHSHEBA went along the dark road neither know
ing nor caring about the direction or issue of her flight
The first time that she definitely noticed her position
was when she reached a gate leading into a thicket over+
hung by some large oak and beech trees On looking
into the place it occurred to her that she had seen it
by daylight on some previous occasion and that what
appeared like an impassable thicket was in reality a
brake of fern now withering fast She could think of
nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go
in here and hide and entering she lighted on a spot
sheltered from the damp fog hy a reclining trunk where
she sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and
stems She mechanically pulled some armfuls round
her to keep off the breezes and closed her eyes
Whether she slept or not that night Bathsheba was
not clearly aware But it was with a freshened exist+
ence and a cooler brain that a long time afterwards she
became conscious of some interesting proceedings which
were going on in the trees above her head and around
A coarse-throated chatter was the first sound
It was a sparrow just waking
Next   Chee-weeze-weeze-weeze   from another
retreat
It was a finch
Third   Tink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink   from the hedge
It was a robin
 Chuck-chuck-chuck   overhead
A squirrel
Then from the road With my ra-ta-ta and my
rum-tum-tum  
It was a ploughboy Presently he came opposite
and she believed from his voice that he was one of
the boys on her own farm He was followed by a
shambling tramp of heavy feet and

looking through
the ferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light
of daybreak a team of her own horses They stopped
to drink at a pond on the other side of the way She
watched them flouncing into the pool drinking tossing
up their heads drinking again the water dribbling
from their lips in silver threads There was another
flounce and they came out of the pond and turned
back again towards the farm
She looked further around Day was just dawning
and beside its cool air and colours her heated actions
and resolves of the night stood out in lurid contrast
She perceived that in her lap and clinging to her
hair were red and yellow leaves which had come
down from the tree and settled silently upon her
during her partial sleep Bathsheba shook her dress to
get rid of them when multitudes of the same family lying
round about her rose and fiuttered away in the breeze
thus created like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing
There was an opening towards the east and the
glow from the as yet unrisen sun attracted her eyes
thither From her feet and between the beautiful
yellowing ferns with their feathery arms the ground
sloped downwards to a hollow in which was a species
of swamp dotted with fungi A morning mist hung
over it now -- a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil
full of light from the sun yet semi-opaque -- the hedge
behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy
luminousness Up the sides of this depression grew
sheaves of the common rush and here and there a
peculiar species of flag the blades of which glistened
in the enaerging sun like scythes But the general
aspect of the swamp was malignant From its moist
