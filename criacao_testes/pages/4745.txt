Think carefully then And quickly

He thought of little else that night but come morning was no closer to deciding if his father could be trusted A servant brought him porridge and honey to break his fast but all he could taste was bile at the thought of confession They will call me kinslayer till the end of my days For a thousand years or more if I am remembered at all it will be as the monstrous dwarf who poisoned his young nephew at his wedding feast The thought made him so bloody angry that he flung the bowl and spoon across the room and left a smear of porridge on the wall Ser Addam Marbrand looked at it curiously when he came to escort Tyrion to trial but had the good grace not to inquire

Lord Varys the herald said master of whisperers

Powdered primped and smelling of rosewater the Spider rubbed his hands one over the other all the time he spoke Washing my life away Tyrion thought as he listened to the eunuch’s mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the Hound’s protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tommen as king Half-truths are worth more than outright lies And unlike the others Varys had documents parchments painstakingly filled with notes details dates whole conversations So much material that its recitation took all day and so much of it damning Varys confirmed Tyrion’s midnight visit to Grand Maester Pycelle’s chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions confirmed the threat he’d made to Cersei the night of their supper confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself When Prince Oberyn asked him how he could possibly know all this not having been present at any of these events the eunuch only giggled and said My little birds told me Knowing is their purpose and mine

How do I question a little bird thought Tyrion I should have had the eunuch’s head off my first day in King’s Landing Damn him And damn me for whatever trust I put in him

Have we heard it all Lord Tywin asked his daughter as Varys left the hall

Almost said Cersei I beg your leave to bring one final witness before you on the morrow

As you wish Lord Tywin said

Oh good thought Tyrion savagely After this farce of a trial execution will almost come as a relief

That night as he sat by his window drinking he heard voices outside his door Ser Kevan come for my answer he thought at once but it was not his uncle who entered

Tyrion rose to give Prince Oberyn a mocking bow Are judges permitted to visit the accused

Princes are permitted to go where they will Or so I told your guards The Red Viper took a seat

My father will be displeased with you

The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on my list of concerns Is it Dornish wine you’re drinking

From the Arbor

Oberyn made a face Red water Did you poison him

No Did you

The prince smiled Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours Someone is going to cut it out one of these days

You are not the first to tell me that Perhaps I should cut it out myself it seems to make no end of trouble

So I’ve seen I think I may drink some of Lord Redwyne’s grape juice after all

As you like Tyrion served him a cup

The man took a sip sloshed it about in his mouth and swallowed It will serve for the moment I will send you up some strong Dornish wine on the morrow He took another sip I have turned up that golden-haired whore I was hoping for

So you found Chataya’s

At Chataya’s I bedded the black-skinned girl Alayaya I believe she is called Exquisite despite the stripes on her back But the whore I referred to is your sister

Has she seduced you yet Tyrion asked unsurprised

Oberyn laughed aloud No but she will if I meet her price The queen has even hinted at marriage Her Grace needs another husband and who better than a prince of Dorne Ellaria believes I should accept Just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes her wet the randy wench And we should not even need to pay the dwarf’s penny All your sister requires from me is one head somewhat overlarge and missing a nose

And said Tyrion waiting

By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine and said When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne so long ago he left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear This Tyrell moved with his tail from keep to keep chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent He would arrive in force take a castle for his own stay a moon’s turn and ride on to the next castle It was his custom to turn the lords out of their own chambers and take their beds for himself One night he found himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy A sash hung down near the pillows should he wish to summon a wench He had a taste for Dornish women this Lord Tyrell and who can blame him So he pulled upon the sash and when he did the canopy above him split open and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon his head His death lit a fire that soon swept across Dorne undoing all the Young Dragon’s victories in a fortnight The kneeling men stood up and we were free again

I know the tale said Tyrion What of it

Just this If I should ever find a sash beside my own bed and pull on it I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty

Tyrion grinned We have that much in common then

To be sure I have much to thank your sister for If not for her accusation at the feast it might well be you judging me instead of me judging you The prince’s eyes were dark with amusement Who knows more of poison than the Red Viper of Dorne after all Who has better reason to want to keep the Tyrells far from the crown And with Joffrey in his grave by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his sister Myrcella who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew thanks to you

Dornish law does not apply Tyrion had been so ensnared in his own troubles that he’d never stopped to consider the succession My father will crown Tommen count on that

He may indeed crown Tommen here in King’s Landing Which is not to say that my brother may not crown Myrcella down in Sunspear Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your nephew Will your sister He gave a shrug Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all on the condition that she support her daughter over her son Do you think she would

Never Tyrion wanted to say but the word caught in his throat Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of her sex If Dornish law applied in the west she would be the heir to Casterly Rock in her own right She and Jaime were twins but Cersei had come first into the world and that was all it took By championing Myrcella’s cause she would be championing her own I do not know how my sister would choose between Tommen and Myrcella he admitted It makes no matter My father will never give her that choice

Your father said Prince Oberyn may not live forever

Something about the way he said it made the hairs on the back of Tyrion’s neck bristle Suddenly he was mindful of Elia again and all that Oberyn had said as they crossed the field of ashes He wants the head that spoke the words not just the hand that swung the sword It is not wise to speak such treasons in the Red Keep my prince The little birds are listening

Let them Is it treason to say a man is mortal Valar morghulis was how they said it in Valyria of old All men must die And the Doom came and proved it true The Dornishman went to the window to gaze out into the night It is being said that you have no witnesses for us

I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be enough to persuade you all of my innocence

You are mistaken my lord The Fat Flower of Highgarden is quite convinced of your guilt and determined to see you die His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too as he has reminded us half a hundred times

And you said Tyrion

Men are seldom as they appear You look so very guilty that I am convinced of your innocence Still you will likely be condemned Justice is in short supply this side of the mountains There has been none for Elia Aegon or Rhaenys Why should there be any for you Perhaps Joffrey’s real killer was eaten by a bear That seems to happen quite often in King’s Landing Oh wait the bear was at Harrenhal now I remember

Is that the game we are playing Tyrion rubbed at his scarred nose He had nothing to lose by telling Oberyn the truth There was a bear at Harrenhal and it did kill Ser Amory Lorch

How sad for him said the Red Viper And for you Do all noseless men lie so badly I wonder

I am not lying Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her father’s bed and stabbed her to death He had some men-at-arms with him but I do not know their names He leaned forward It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon’s head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his hands

What is this now Truth from a Lannister Oberyn smiled coldly Your father gave the commands yes

No He spoke the lie without hesitation and never stopped to ask himself why he should

The Dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow Such a dutiful son And such a very feeble lie It was Lord Tywin who presented my sister’s children to King Robert all wrapped up in crimson Lannister cloaks

Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father He was there I was at the Rock and still so young that I thought the thing between my legs was only good for pissing

Yes but you are here now and in some difficulty I would say Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face but it will not save you No more than your father will The Dornish prince smiled But I might
