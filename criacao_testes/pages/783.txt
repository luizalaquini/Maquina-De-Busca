thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire

1810 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for I
say unto you That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of
my Father which is in heaven

1811 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost

1812 How think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be
gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the
mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray  1813 And if so be
that he find it verily I say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray

1814 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven
that one of these little ones should perish

1815 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell
him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou
hast gained thy brother

1816 But if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two
more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established

1817 And if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church
but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican

1818 Verily I say unto you Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven

1819 Again I say unto you That if two of you shall agree on earth as
touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of
my Father which is in heaven

1820 For where two or three are gathered together in my name there
am I in the midst of them

1821 Then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother
sin against me and I forgive him till seven times  1822 Jesus
saith unto him I say not unto thee Until seven times but Until
seventy times seven

1823 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king
which would take account of his servants

1824 And when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which
owed him ten thousand talents

1825 But forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be
sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to
be made

1826 The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying
Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all

1827 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and
loosed him and forgave him the debt

1828 But the same servant went out and found one of his
fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on
him and took him by the throat saying Pay me that thou owest

1829 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him
saying Have patience with me and I will pay thee all

1830 And he would not but went and cast him into prison till he
should pay the debt

1831 So when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very
sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done

1832 Then his lord after that he had called him said unto him O
thou wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou
desiredst me 1833 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellowservant even as I had pity on thee  1834 And his lord was
wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all
that was due unto him

1835 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you if ye
from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses

191 And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings
he departed from Galilee and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond
Jordan 192 And great multitudes followed him and he healed them
there

193 The Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto
him Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
194 And he answered and said unto them Have ye not read that he
which made them at the beginning made them male and female 195 And
said For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh  196 Wherefore
they are no more twain but one flesh What therefore God hath joined
together let not man put asunder

197 They say unto him Why did Moses then command to give a writing
