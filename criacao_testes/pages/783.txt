There was a mocking edge to his voice that Tyrion misliked but he was not about to let the Dornishman provoke him When was this my lord he asked in tones of polite interest

Oh many and many a year ago when my mother ruled in Dorne and your lord father was Hand to a different king

Not so different as you might think reflected Tyrion

It was when I visited Casterly Rock with my mother her consort and my sister Elia I was oh fourteen fifteen thereabouts Elia a year older Your brother and sister were eight or nine as I recall and you had just been born

A queer time to come visiting His mother had died giving him birth so the Martells would have found the Rock deep in mouming His father especially Lord Tywin seldom spoke of his wife but Tyrion had heard his uncles talk of the love between them In those days his father had been Aerys’s Hand and many people said that Lord Tywin Lannister ruled the Seven Kingdoms but Lady Joanna ruled Lord Tywin He was not the same man after she died imp his Uncle Gery told him once The best part of him died with her Gerion had been the youngest of Lord Tytos Lannister’s four sons and the uncle Tyrion liked best

But he was gone now lost beyond the seas and Tyrion himself had put Lady Joanna in her grave Did you find Casterly Rock to your liking my lord

Scarcely Your father ignored us the whole time we were there after commanding Ser Kevan to see to our entertainment The cell they gave me had a featherbed to sleep in and Myrish carpets on the floor but it was dark and windowless much like a dungeon when you come down to it as I told Elia at the time Your skies were too grey your wines too sweet your women too chaste your food too bland… and you yourself were the greatest disappointment of all

I had just been born What did you expect of me

Enormity the black-haired prince replied You were small but far-famed We were in Oldtown at your birth and all the city talked of was the monster that had been born to the King’s Hand and what such an omen might foretell for the realm

Famine plague and war no doubt Tyrion gave a sour smile It’s always famine plague and war Oh and winter and the long night that never ends

All that said Prince Oberyn and your father’s fall as well Lord Tywin had made himself greater than King Aerys I heard one begging brother preach but only a god is meant to stand above a king You were his curse a punishment sent by the gods to teach him that he was no better than any other man

I try but he refuses to learn Tyrion gave a sigh But do go on I pray you I love a good tale

And well you might since you were said to have one a stiff curly tail like a swine’s Your head was monstrous huge we heard half again the size of your body and you had been born with thick black hair and a beard besides an evil eye and lion’s claws Your teeth were so long you could not close your mouth and between your legs were a girl’s privates as well as a boy’s

Life would be much simpler if men could fuck themselves don’t you agree And I can think of a few times when claws and teeth might have proved useful Even so I begin to see the nature of your complaint

Bronn gave out with a chuckle but Oberyn only smiled We might never have seen you at all but for your sweet sister You were never seen at table or hall though sometimes at night we could hear a baby howling down in the depths of the Rock You did have a monstrous great voice I must grant you that You would wail for hours and nothing would quiet you but a woman’s teat

Still true as it happens

This time Prince Oberyn did laugh A taste we share Lord Gargalen once told me he hoped to die with a sword in his hand to which I replied that I would sooner go with a breast in mine

Tyrion had to grin You were speaking of my sister

Cersei promised Elia to show you to us The day before we were to sail whilst my mother and your father were closeted together she and Jaime took us down to your nursery Your wet nurse tried to send us off but your sister was having none of that ‘He’s mine’ she said ‘and you’re just a milk cow you can’t tell me what to do Be quiet or I’ll have my father cut your tongue out A cow doesn’t need a tongue only udders’

Her Grace learned charm at an early age said Tyrion amused by the notion of his sister claiming him as hers She’s never been in any rush to claim me since the gods know

Cersei even undid your swaddling clothes to give us a better look the Dornish prince continued You did have one evil eye and some black fuzz on your scalp Perhaps your head was larger than most… but there was no tail no beard neither teeth nor claws and nothing between your legs but a tiny pink cock After all the wonderful whispers Lord Tywin’s Doom turned out to be just a hideous red infant with stunted legs Elia even made the noise that young girls make at the sight of infants I’m sure you’ve heard it The same noise they make over cute kittens and playful puppies I believe she wanted to nurse you herself ugly as you were When I commented that you seemed a poor sort of monster your sister said ‘He killed my mother’ and twisted your little cock so hard I thought she was like to pull it off You shrieked but it was only when your brother Jaime said ‘Leave him be you’re hurting him’ that Cersei let go of you ‘It doesn’t matter’ she told us ‘Everyone says he’s like to die soon He shouldn’t even have lived this long’

The sun was shining bright above them and the day was pleasantly warm for autumn but Tyrion Lannister went cold all over when he heard that My sweet sister He scratched at the scar of his nose and gave the Dornishman a taste of his evil eye Now why would he tell such a tale Is he testing me or simply twisting my cock as Cersei did so he can hear me scream Be sure and tell that story to my father It will delight him as much as it did me The part about my tail especially I did have one but he had it lopped off

Prince Oberyn had a chuckle You’ve grown more amusing since last we met

Yes but I meant to grow taller

While we are speaking of amusement I heard a curious tale from Lord Buckler’s steward He claimed that you had put a tax on women’s privy purses

It is a tax on whoring said Tyrion irritated all over again And it was my bloody father’s notion Only a penny for each ah… act The King’s Hand felt it might help improve the morals of the city And pay for Joffrey’s wedding besides Needless to say as master of coin Tyrion had gotten all the blame for it Bronn said they were calling it the dwarf’s penny in the streets Spread your legs for the Halfman now they were shouting in the brothels and wine sinks if the sellsword could be believed

I will make certain to keep my pouch full of pennies Even a prince must pay his taxes
