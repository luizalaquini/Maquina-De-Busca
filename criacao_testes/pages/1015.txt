Live steel

Done Robb shot back You’ll be sorry

The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb’s shoulder to quiet him Live steel is too dangerous I will permit you tourney swords with blunted edges

Joffrey said nothing but a man strange to Arya a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face pushed forward in front of the prince This is your prince Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword ser

Master-at-arms of Winterfell Clegane and you would do well not to forget it

Are you training women here the burned man wanted to know He was muscled like a bull

I am training knights Ser Rodrik said pointedly They will have steel when they are ready When they are of an age

The burned man looked at Robb How old are you boy

Fourteen Robb said

I killed a man at twelve You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword

Arya could see Robb bristle His pride was wounded He turned on Ser Rodrik Let me do it I can beat him

Beat him with a tourney blade then Ser Rodrik said

Joffrey shrugged Come and see me when you’re older Stark If you’re not too old There was laughter from the Lannister men

Robb’s curses rang through the yard Arya covered her mouth in shock Theon Greyjoy seized Robb’s arm to keep him away from the prince Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay

Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother Come Tommen he said The hour of play is done Leave the children to their frolics

That brought more laughter from the Lannisters more curses from Robb Ser Rodrik’s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away

Jon watched them leave and Arya watched Jon His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood Finally he climbed down off the window The show is done he said He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears The white wolf rose and rubbed against him You had best run back to your room little sister Septa Mordane will surely be lurking The longer you hide the sterner the penance You’ll be sewing all through winter When the spring thaw comes they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers

Arya didn’t think it was funny I hate needlework she said with passion It’s not fair

Nothing is fair Jon said He messed up her hair again and walked away from her Ghost moving silently beside him Nymeria started to follow too then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya was not coming

Reluctantly she turned in the other direction

It was worse than Jon had thought It wasn’t Septa Mordane waiting in her room It was Septa Mordane and her mother





BRAN

The hunt left at dawn The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight Prince Joffrey rode with his father so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well Uncle Benjen Jory Theon Greyjoy Ser Rodrik and even the queen’s funny little brother had all ridden out with them It was the last hunt after all On the morrow they left for the south

Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found Bran did not look for him very hard He thought Jon was angry at him Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days Bran did not know why He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall to join the Night’s Watch That was almost as good as going south with the king Robb was the one they were leaving behind not Jon

For days Bran could scarcely wait to be off He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own not a pony but a real horse His father would be the Hand of the King and they were going to live in the red castle at King’s Landing the castle the Dragonlords had built Old Nan said there were ghosts there and dungeons where terrible things had been done and dragon heads on the walls It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it but he was not afraid How could he be afraid His father would be with him and the king with all his knights and sworn swords

Bran was going to be a knight himself someday one of the Kingsguard Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm There were only seven of them and they wore white armor and had no wives or children but lived only to serve the king Bran knew all the stories Their names were like music to him Serwyn of the Mirror Shield Ser Ryam Redwyne Prince Aemon the Dragonknight The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk who had died on one another’s swords hundreds of years ago when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons The White Bull Gerold Hightower Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning Barristan the Bold

Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert Bran had watched them with fascination never quite daring to speak to them Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories and he was of the Kingsguard too but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn’t count anymore The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy Barristan the Bold the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King’s Landing and Bran had been marking the days on his wall eager to depart to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine

Yet now that the last day was at hand suddenly Bran felt lost Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today and he had tried After the hunt had ridden out he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side intending to visit the ones who would be left behind Old Nan and Gage the cook Mikken in his smithy Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but Hodor the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit…

But it was no good He had gone to the stable first and seen his pony there in its stall except it wasn’t his pony anymore he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes That was the end of his farewells Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick and failing The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his father’s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks

He was still trying to decide on a name Robb was calling his Grey Wind because he ran so fast Sansa had named hers Lady and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs and little Rickon called his Shaggydog which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf Jon’s wolf the white one was Ghost Bran wished he had thought of that first even though his wolf wasn’t white He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight but none of them sounded right

Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing He hadn’t been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened and this might be his last chance

He raced across the godswood taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew The heart tree had always frightened him trees ought not have eyes Bran thought or leaves that looked like hands His wolf came sprinting at his heels You stay here he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall Lie down That’s right Now stay—

The wolf did as he was told Bran scratched him behind the ears then turned away jumped grabbed a low branch and pulled himself up He was halfway up the tree moving easily from limb to limb when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl

Bran looked back down His wolf fell silent staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes A strange chill went through him He began to climb again Once more the wolf howled Quiet he yelled Sit down Stay You’re worse than Mother The howling chased him all the way up the tree until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight

The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran’s second home His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk but he could not remember when he started to climb either so he supposed it must be true

To a boy Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions In the older parts of the castle the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn’t even be sure what floor you were on The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree Maester Luwin told him once and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted its roots sunk deep into the earth

When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance He liked the way it looked spread out beneath him only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep watching it all the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels the silence of the godswood the girls gossiping beside the washing well It made him feel like he was lord of the castle in a way even Robb would never know

It taught him Winterfell’s secrets too The builders had not even leveled the earth there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery Bran knew about that And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone and then come out on ground level at the north gate with a hundred feet of wall looming over you Even Maester Luwin didn’t know that Bran was convinced

His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself He told her that he wouldn’t but she never believed him Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight miserable every day until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep

He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove

As angry as he was his father could not help but laugh You’re not my son he told Bran when they fetched him down you’re a squirrel So be it If you must climb then climb but try not to let your mother see you

Bran did his best although he did not think he ever really fooled her Since his father would not forbid it she turned to others Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes Bran was not impressed There were crows’ nests atop the broken tower where no one ever went but him and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes

Later Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran’s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell That had been fun but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said I’m not made of clay And anyhow I never fall

Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs and try to haul him down That was the best time of all It was like playing a game with his brothers except that Bran always won None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran not even Jory Most of the time they never saw him anyway People never looked up That was another thing he liked about climbing it was almost like being invisible

He liked how it felt too pulling himself up a wall stone by stone fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two He liked the deep sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward He liked the way the air tasted way up high sweet and cold as a winter peach He liked the birds the crows in the broken tower the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory Bran knew them all

Most of all he liked going places that no one else could go and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it It made the whole castle Bran’s secret place

His favorite haunt was the broken tower Once it had been a watchtower the tallest in Winterfell A long time ago a hundred years before even his father had been born a lightning strike had set it afire The top third of the structure had collapsed inward and the tower had never been rebuilt Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows

He knew two ways to get there You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself but the stones were loose the mortar that held them together long gone to ash and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them
