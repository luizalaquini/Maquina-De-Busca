A sheepskin cloak said Ygritte And there’s many a night we dance beneath it too

Jarl laughed and even Harma Dogshead smirked Is that the way of it Jon Snow asked Mance Rayder mildly Her and you

It was easy to lose your way beyond the Wall Jon did not know that he could tell honor from shame anymore or right from wrong Father forgive me Yes he said

Mance nodded Good You’ll go with Jarl and Styr on the morrow then Both of you Far be it from me to separate two hearts that beat as one

Go where said Jon

Over the Wall It’s past time you proved your faith with something more than words Jon Snow

The Magnar was not pleased What do I want with a crow

He knows the Watch and he knows the Wall said Mance and he knows Castle Black better than any raider ever could You’ll find a use for him or you’re a fool

Styr scowled His heart may still be black

Then cut it out Mance turned to Rattleshirt My Lord of Bones keep the column moving at all costs If we reach the Wall before Mormont we’ve won

They’ll move Rattleshirt’s voice was thick and angry

Mance nodded and walked away Harma and Sixskins beside him Varamyr’s wolves and shadowcat followed behind Jon and Ygritte were left with Jarl Rattleshirt and the Magnar The two older wildlings looked at Jon with ill-concealed rancor as Jarl said You heard we ride at daybreak Bring all the food you can there’ll be no time to hunt And have your face seen to crow You look a bloody mess

I will said Jon

You best not be lying girl Rattleshirt said to Ygritte his eyes shiny behind the giant’s skull

Jon drew Longsclaw Get away from us unless you want what Qhorin got

You got no wolf to help you here boy Rattleshirt reached for his own sword

Sure o’ that are you Ygritte laughed

Atop the stones of the ringwall Ghost hunched with white fur bristling He made no sound but his dark red eyes spoke blood The Lord of Bones moved his hand slowly away from his sword backed off a step and left them with a curse

Ghost padded beside their garrons as Jon and Ygritte descended the Fist It was not until they were halfway across the Milkwater that Jon felt safe enough to say I never asked you to lie for me

I never did she said I left out part is all

You said—

—that we fuck beneath your cloak many a night I never said when we started though The smile she gave him was almost shy Find another place for Ghost to sleep tonight Jon Snow It’s like Mance said Deeds is truer than words





SANSA

A new gown she said as wary as she was astonished

More lovely than any you have worn my lady the old woman promised She measured Sansa’s hips with a length of knotted string All silk and Myrish lace with satin linings You will be very beautiful The queen herself has commanded it

Which queen Margaery was not yet Joff’s queen but she had been Renly’s Or did she mean the Queen of Thorns Or   

The Queen Regent to be sure

Queen Cersei

None other She has honored me with her custom for many a year The old woman laid her string along the inside of Sansa’s leg Her Grace said to me that you are a woman now and should not dress like a little girl Hold out your arm

Sansa lifted her arm She needed a new gown that was true She had grown three inches in the past year and most of her old wardrobe had been ruined by the smoke when she’d tried to burn her mattress on the day of her first flowering

Your bosom will be as lovely as the queen’s the old woman said as she looped her string around Sansa’s chest You should not hide it so

The comment made her blush Yet the last time she’d gone riding she could not lace her jerkin all the way to the top and the stableboy gaped at her as he helped her mount Sometimes she caught grown men looking at her chest as well and some of her tunics were so tight she could scarce breathe in them

What color will it be she asked the seamstress

Leave the colors to me my lady You will be pleased I know you will You shall have smallclothes and hose as well kirtles and mantles and cloaks and all else befitting a    a lovely young lady of noble birth

Will they be ready in time for the king’s wedding

Oh sooner much sooner Her Grace insists I have six seamstresses and twelve apprentice girls and we have set all our other work aside for this Many ladies will be cross with us but it was the queen’s command

Thank Her Grace kindly for her thoughtfulness Sansa said politely She is too good to me

Her Grace is most generous the seamstress agreed as she gathered up her things and took her leave

But why Sansa wondered when she was alone It made her uneasy I’ll wager this gown is Margaery’s doing somehow or her grandmother’s

Margaery’s kindness had been unfailing and her presence changed everything Her ladies welcomed Sansa as well It had been so long since she had enjoyed the company of other women she had almost forgotten how pleasant it could be Lady Leonette gave her lessons on the high harp and Lady Janna shared all the choice gossip Merry Crane always had an amusing story and little Lady Bulwer reminded her of Arya though not so fierce

Closest to Sansa’s own age were the cousins Elinor Alla and Megga Tyrells from junior branches of the House Roses from lower on the bush quipped Elinor who was witty and willowy Megga was round and loud Alla shy and pretty but Elinor ruled the three by right of womanhood she was a maiden flowered whereas Megga and Alla were mere girls

The cousins took Sansa into their company as if they had known her all their lives They spent long afternoons doing needlework and talking over lemon cakes and honeyed wine played at tiles of an evening sang together in the castle sept    and often one or two of them would be chosen to share Margaery’s bed where they would whisper half the night away Alla had a lovely voice and when coaxed would play the woodharp and sing songs of chivalry and lost loves Megga couldn’t sing but she was mad to be kissed She and Alla played a kissing game sometimes she confessed but it wasn’t the same as kissing a man much less a king Sansa wondered what Megga would think about kissing the Hound as she had He’d come to her the night of the battle stinking of wine and blood He kissed me and threatened to kill me and made me sing him a song

King Joffrey has such beautiful lips Megga gushed oblivious oh poor Sansa how your heart must have broken when you lost him Oh how you must have wept

Joffrey made me weep more often than you know she wanted to say but Butterbumps was not on hand to drown out her voice so she pressed her lips together and held her tongue

As for Elinor she was promised to a young squire a son of Lord Ambrose they would be wed as soon as he won his spurs He had worn her favor in the Battle of the Blackwater where he’d slain a Myrish crossbowman and a Mullendore man-at-arms Alyn said her favor made him fearless said Megga He says he shouted her name for his battle cry isn’t that ever so gallant Someday I want some champion to wear my favor and kill a hundred men Elinor told her to hush but looked pleased all the same

They are children Sansa thought They are silly little girls even Elinor They’ve never seen a battle they’ve never seen a man die they know nothing Their dreams were full of songs and stories the way hers had been before Joffrey cut her father’s head off Sansa pitied them Sansa envied them

Margaery was different though Sweet and gentle yet there was a little of her grandmother in her too The day before last she’d taken Sansa hawking It was the first time she had been outside the city since the battle The dead had been burned or buried but the Mud Gate was scarred and splintered where Lord Stannis’s rams had battered it and the hulls of smashed ships could be seen along both sides of the Blackwater charred masts poking from the shallows like gaunt black fingers The only traffic was the flat-bottomed ferry that took them across the river and when they reached the kingswood they found a wilderness of ash and charcoal and dead trees But the waterfowl teemed in the marshes along the bay and Sansa’s merlin brought down three ducks while Margaery’s peregrine took a heron in full flight

Willas has the best birds in the Seven Kingdoms Margaery said when the two of them were briefly alone He flies an eagle sometimes You will see Sansa She took her by the hand and gave it a squeeze Sister
