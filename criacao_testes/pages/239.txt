This one is your father he said This one here Dog turn it around so she can see him

Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer Sansa looked at it calmly not seeing it at all It did not really look like Lord Eddard she thought it did not even look real How long do I have to look

Joffrey seemed disappointed Do you want to see the rest There was a long row of them

If it please Your Grace

Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes I’m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly he explained The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father Despite the tar most were long past being recognizable The king pointed to one and said That’s your septa there but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman The jaw had rotted off her face and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek

Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane although she supposed she had known all along Why did you kill her she asked She was godsworn…

She was a traitor Joffrey looked pouty somehow she was upsetting him You haven’t said what you mean to give me for my name day Maybe I should give you something instead would you like that

If it please you my lord Sansa said

When he smiled she knew he was mocking her Your brother is a traitor too you know He turned Septa Mordane’s head back around I remember your brother from Winterfell My dog called him the lord of the wooden sword Didn’t you dog

Did I the Hound replied I don’t recall

Joffrey gave a petulant shrug Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime My mother says it was treachery and deceit She wept when she heard Women are all weak even her though she pretends she isn’t She says we need to stay in King’s Landing in case my other uncles attack but I don’t care After my name day feast I’m going to raise a host and kill your brother myself That’s what I’ll give you Lady Sansa Your brother’s head

A kind of madness took over her then and she heard herself say Maybe my brother will give me your head

Joffrey scowled You must never mock me like that A true wife does not mock her lord Ser Meryn teach her

This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her He hit her twice left to right and harder right to left Her lip split and blood ran down her chin to mingle with the salt of her tears

You shouldn’t be crying all the time Joffrey told her You’re more pretty when you smile and laugh

Sansa made herself smile afraid that he would have Ser Meryn hit her again if she did not but it was no good the king still shook his head Wipe off the blood you’re all messy

The outer parapet came up to her chin but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below All it would take was a shove she told herself He was standing right there right there smirking at her with those fat wormlips You could do it she told herself You could Do it right now It wouldn’t even matter if she went over with him It wouldn’t matter at all

Here girl Sandor Clegane knelt before her between her and Joffrey With a delicacy surprising in such a big man he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip

The moment was gone Sansa lowered her eyes Thank you she said when he was done She was a good girl and always remembered her courtesies





DAENERYS

Wings shadowed her fever dreams

You don’t want to wake the dragon do you

She was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches She could not look behind her must not look behind her There was a door ahead of her tiny with distance but even from afar she saw that it was painted red She walked faster and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone

You don’t want to wake the dragon do you

She saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea the living plain rich with the smells of earth and death Wind stirred the grasses and they rippled like water Drogo held her in strong arms and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone and the stars smiled down on them stars in a daylight sky Home she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed but suddenly the stars were gone and across the blue sky swept the great wings and the world took flame
