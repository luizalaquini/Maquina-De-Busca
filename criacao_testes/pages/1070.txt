BRAN

A light snow was falling Bran could feel the flakes on his face melting as they touched his skin like the gentlest of rains He sat straight atop his horse watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward Try as he might to keep calm his heart was fluttering in his chest

Are you ready Robb asked

Bran nodded trying not to let his fear show He had not been outside Winterfell since his fall but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight

Let’s ride then Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding and the horse walked under the portcullis

Go Bran whispered to his own horse He touched her neck lightly and the small chestnut filly started forward Bran had named her Dancer She was two years old and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be They had trained her special to respond to rein and voice and touch Up to now Bran had only ridden her around the yard At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own trotting her round and round and growing bolder with every circuit

They passed beneath the gatehouse over the drawbridge through the outer walls Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them sniffing at the wind Close behind came Theon Greyjoy with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads he had a mind to take a deer he had told them He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs and Joseth a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away Maester Luwin brought up the rear riding on a donkey Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone just the two of them but Hal Mollen would not hear of it and Maester Luwin backed him If Bran fell off his horse or injured himself the maester was determined to be with him

Beyond the castle lay the market square its wooden stalls deserted now They rode down the muddy streets of the village past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone Less than one in five were occupied thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north Old Nan said farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts loaded up their wagons and then the winter town came alive Bran had never seen it happen but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer The end of the long summer was near at hand Winter is coming

A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past and one man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight They bent the knee when they saw the boys and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod

With his legs unable to grip the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural His anxiety faded and a tremulous smile crept across his face

Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log the local alehouse When Theon Greyjoy called out to them the younger girl turned red and covered her face Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb Sweet Kyra he said with a laugh She squirms like a weasel in bed but say a word to her on the street and she blushes pink as a maid Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa—

Not where my brother can hear Theon Robb warned him with a glance at Bran

Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard but he could feel Greyjoy’s eyes on him No doubt he was smiling He smiled a lot as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company but Bran had never warmed to his father’s ward

Robb rode closer You are doing well Bran

I want to go faster Bran replied

Robb smiled As you will He sent his gelding into a trot The wolves raced after him Bran snapped the reins sharply and Dancer picked up her pace He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him

Bran’s cloak billowed out rippling in the wind and the snow seemed to rush at his face Robb was well ahead glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following He snapped the reins again Smooth as silk Dancer slid into a gallop The distance closed By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood two miles beyond the winter town they had left the others well behind I can ride Bran shouted grinning It felt almost as good as flying

I’d race you but I fear you’d win Robb’s tone was light and joking yet Bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile

I don’t want to race Bran looked around for the direwolves Both had vanished into the wood Did you hear Summer howling last night

Grey Wind was restless too Robb said His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt and a reddish stubble covered his jaw making him look older than his fifteen years Sometimes I think they know things… sense things… Robb sighed I never know how much to tell you Bran I wish you were older

I’m eight now Bran said Eight isn’t so much younger than fifteen and I’m the heir to Winterfell after you

So you are Robb sounded sad and even a little scared Bran I need to tell you something There was a bird last night From King’s Landing Maester Luwin woke me

Bran felt a sudden dread Dark wings dark words Old Nan always said and of late the messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie from Mother but that had not been good news either She did not say when she meant to return only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner Bran had sort of liked the little man yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine There was something about the Lannisters something he ought to remember but when he tried to think what he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen Afterward riders were sent out on fast horses carrying Robb’s commands throughout the north Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top of the Neck No one ever told him what was happening yet he knew it was not good

And now another raven another message Bran clung to hope Was the bird from Mother Is she coming home

The message was from Alyn in King’s Landing Jory Cassel is dead And Wyl and Heward as well Murdered by the Kingslayer Robb lifted his face to the snow and the flakes melted on his cheeks May the gods give them rest

Bran did not know what to say He felt as if he’d been punched Jory had been captain of the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born They killed Jory He remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate or sitting at his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall joking as he ate Why would anyone kill Jory

Robb shook his head numbly the pain plain in his eyes I don’t know and… Bran that’s not the worst of it Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight Alyn says his leg was shattered and… Maester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy but they aren’t sure when… when he… The sound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road to where Theon and the others were coming up When he will wake Robb finished He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord Bran I promise you whatever might happen I will not let this be forgotten

Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful What will you do he asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them

Theon thinks I should call the banners Robb said

Blood for blood For once Greyjoy did not smile His lean dark face had a hungry look to it and black hair fell down across his eyes

Only the lord can call the banners Bran said as the snow drifted down around them

If your father dies Theon said Robb will be Lord of Winterfell

He won’t die Bran screamed at him

Robb took his hand He won’t die not Father he said calmly Still… the honor of the north is in my hands now When our lord father took his leave of us he told me to be strong for you and for Rickon I’m almost a man grown Bran

Bran shivered I wish Mother was back he said miserably He looked around for Maester Luwin his donkey was visible in the far distance trotting over a rise Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too

The maester is timid as an old woman said Theon

Father always listened to his counsel Bran reminded his brother Mother too

I listen to him Robb insisted I listen to everyone

The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone melted away like the snowflakes on his face Not so long ago the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement but now he felt only dread Can we go back now he asked I’m cold

Robb glanced around We need to find the wolves Can you stand to go a bit longer

I can go as long as you can Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short for fear of saddle sores but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was

Let’s hunt down the hunters then Robb said Side by side they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood Theon dropped back and followed well behind them talking and joking with the guardsmen

It was nice under the trees Bran kept Dancer to a walk holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went He knew this wood but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time The smells filled his nostrils the sharp fresh tang of pine needles the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider

Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind until Bran could no longer hear their voices From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters It grew louder until they reached the stream Tears stung his eyes

Bran Robb asked What’s wrong

Bran shook his head I was just remembering he said Jory brought us here once to fish for trout You and me and Jon Do you remember

I remember Robb said his voice quiet and sad

I didn’t catch anything Bran said but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell Will we ever see Jon again
