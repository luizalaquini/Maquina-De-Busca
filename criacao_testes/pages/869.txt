but if I depart I will send him unto you

168 And when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of
righteousness and of judgment 169 Of sin because they believe not
on me 1610 Of righteousness because I go to my Father and ye see
me no more 1611 Of judgment because the prince of this world is
judged

1612 I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them
now

1613 Howbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come he will guide you
into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he
shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come

1614 He shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall
shew it unto you

1615 All things that the Father hath are mine therefore said I that
he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you

1616 A little while and ye shall not see me and again a little
while and ye shall see me because I go to the Father

1617 Then said some of his disciples among themselves What is this
that he saith unto us A little while and ye shall not see me and
again a little while and ye shall see me and Because I go to the
Father  1618 They said therefore What is this that he saith A
little while we cannot tell what he saith

1619 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto
them Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said A little while
and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see
me  1620 Verily verily I say unto you That ye shall weep and
lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy

1621 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is
come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no
more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world

1622 And ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and
your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you

1623 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing Verily verily I say
unto you Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he will give
it you

1624 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall
receive that your joy may be full

1625 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs but the time
cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father

1626 At that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you
that I will pray the Father for you 1627 For the Father himself
loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came
out from God

1628 I came forth from the Father and am come into the world again
I leave the world and go to the Father

1629 His disciples said unto him Lo now speakest thou plainly and
speakest no proverb

1630 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not
that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest
forth from God

1631 Jesus answered them Do ye now believe  1632 Behold the hour
cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his
own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the
Father is with me

1633 These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have
peace

In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have
overcome the world

171 These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
said Father the hour is come glorify thy Son that thy Son also may
glorify thee 172 As thou hast given him power over all flesh that
he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him

173 And this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true
God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent

174 I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do

175 And now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the
glory which I had with thee before the world was

176 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have
kept thy word

177 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
