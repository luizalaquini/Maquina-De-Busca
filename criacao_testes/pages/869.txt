The water is not hot enough Sansa lied

Her maids were dressing her when Tyrion appeared Podrick Payne in tow You look lovely Sansa He turned to his squire Pod be so good as to pour me a cup of wine

There will be wine at the breakfast my lord Sansa said

There’s wine here You don’t expect me to face my sister sober surely It’s a new century my lady The three hundredth year since Aegon’s Conquest The dwarf took a cup of red from Podrick and raised it high To Aegon What a fortunate fellow Two sisters two wives and three big dragons what more could a man ask for He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand

The Imp’s clothing was soiled and unkempt Sansa noticed it looked as though he’d slept in it Will you be changing into fresh garb my lord Your new doublet is very handsome

The doublet is handsome yes Tyrion put the cup aside Come Pod let us see if we can find some garments to make me look less dwarfish I would not want to shame my lady wife

When the Imp returned a short time later he was presentable enough and even a little taller Podrick Payne had changed as well and looked almost a proper squire for once although a rather large red pimple in the fold beside his nose spoiled the effect of his splendid purple white and gold raiment He is such a timid boy Sansa had been wary of Tyrion’s squire at first he was a Payne cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne who had taken her father’s head off However she’d soon come to realize that Pod was as frightened of her as she was of his cousin Whenever she spoke to him he turned the most alarming shade of red

Are purple gold and white the colors of House Payne Podrick she asked him politely

No I mean yes He blushed The colors Our arms are purple and white chequy my lady With gold coins In the checks Purple and white Both He studied her feet

There’s a tale behind those coins said Tyrion No doubt Pod will confide it to your toes one day Just now we are expected at the Queen’s Ballroom however Shall we

Sansa was tempted to beg off I could tell him that my tummy was upset or that my moon’s blood had come She wanted nothing more than to crawl back in bed and pull the drapes I must be brave like Robb she told herself as she took her lord husband stiffly by the arm

In the Queen’s Ballroom they broke their fast on honeycakes baked with blackberries and nuts gammon steaks bacon fingerfish crisped in breadcrumbs autumn pears and a Dornish dish of onions cheese and chopped eggs cooked up with fiery peppers Nothing like a hearty breakfast to whet one’s appetite for the seventy-seven-course feast to follow Tyrion commented as their plates were filled There were flagons of milk and flagons of mead and flagons of a light sweet golden wine to wash it down Musicians strolled among the tables piping and fluting and fiddling while Ser Dontos galloped about on his broomstick horse and Moon Boy made farting sounds with his cheeks and sang rude songs about the guests

Tyrion scarce touched his food Sansa noticed though he drank several cups of the wine For herself she tried a little of the Dornish eggs but the peppers burned her mouth Otherwise she only nibbled at the fruit and fish and honeycakes Every time Joffrey looked at her her tummy got so fluttery that she felt as though she’d swallowed a bat

When the food had been cleared away the queen solemnly presented Joff with the wife’s cloak that he would drape over Margaery’s shoulders It is the cloak I donned when Robert took me for his queen the same cloak my mother Lady Joanna wore when wed to my lord father Sansa thought it looked threadbare if truth be told but perhaps because it was so used

Then it was time for gifts It was traditional in the Reach to give presents to bride and groom on the morning of their wedding on the morrow they would receive more presents as a couple but today’s tokens were for their separate persons

From Jalabhar Xho Joffrey received a great bow of golden wood and quiver of long arrows fletched with green and scarlet feathers from Lady Tanda a pair of supple riding boots from Ser Kevan a magnificent red leather jousting saddle a red gold brooch wrought in the shape of a scorpion from the Dornishman Prince Oberyn silver spurs from Ser Addam Marbrand a red silk tourney pavilion from Lord Mathis Rowan Lord Paxter Redwyne brought forth a beautiful wooden model of the war galley of two hundred oars being built even now on the Arbor If it please Your Grace she will be called King Joffrey’s Valor he said and Joff allowed that he was very pleased indeed I will make it my flagship when I sail to Dragonstone to kill my traitor uncle Stannis he said

He plays the gracious king today Joffrey could be gallant when it suited him Sansa knew but it seemed to suit him less and less Indeed all his courtesy vanished at once when Tyrion presented him with their own gift a huge old book called Lives of Four Kings bound in leather and gorgeously illuminated The king leafed through it with no interest And what is this Uncle

A book Sansa wondered if Joffrey moved those fat wormy lips of his when he read

Grand Maester Kaeth’s history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon Baelor the Blessed Aegon the Unworthy and Daeron the Good her small husband answered

A book every king should read Your Grace said Ser Kevan

My father had no time for books Joffrey shoved the tome across the table If you read less Uncle Imp perhaps Lady Sansa would have a baby in her belly by now He laughed… and when the king laughs the court laughs with him Don’t be sad Sansa once I’ve gotten Queen Margaery with child I’ll visit your bedchamber and show my little uncle how it’s done

Sansa reddened She glanced nervously at Tyrion afraid of what he might say This could turn as nasty as the bedding had at their own feast But for once the dwarf filled his mouth with wine instead of words

Lord Mace Tyrell came forward to present his gift a golden chalice three feet tall with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones Seven faces for Your Grace’s seven kingdoms the bride’s father explained He showed them how each face bore the sigil of one of the great houses ruby lion emerald rose onyx stag silver trout blue jade falcon opal sun and pearl direwolf

A splendid cup said Joffrey but we’ll need to chip the wolf off and put a squid in its place I think

Sansa pretended that she had not heard

Margaery and I shall drink deep at the feast good father Joffrey lifted the chalice above his head for everyone to admire

The damned thing’s as tall as I am Tyrion muttered in a low voice Half a chalice and Joff will be falling down drunk
