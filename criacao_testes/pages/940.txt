Mance gave her a fond smile It’s a wise woman I’ve found A true queen He turned back to Jon Go back and tell them to open their gate and let us pass If they do I will give them the horn and the Wall will stand until the end of days

Open the gate and let them pass Easy to say but what must follow Giants camping in the ruins of Winterfell Cannibals in the wolfswood chariots sweeping across the barrowlands free folk stealing the daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwives off the Stony Shore Are you a true king Jon asked suddenly

I’ve never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne if that’s what you’re asking Mance replied My birth is as low as a man’s can get no septon’s ever smeared my head with oils I don’t own any castles and my queen wears furs and amber not silk and sapphires I am my own champion my own fool and my own harpist You don’t become King-beyond-the-Wall because your father was The free folk won’t follow a name and they don’t care which brother was born first They follow fighters When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings Tormund was one the Magnar another The other three I slew when they made it plain they’d sooner fight than follow

You can kill your enemies Jon said bluntly but can you rule your friends If we let your people pass are you strong enough to make them keep the king’s peace and obey the laws

Whose laws The laws of Winterfell and King’s Landing Mance laughed When we want laws we’ll make our own You can keep your king’s justice too and your king’s taxes I’m offering you the horn not our freedom We will not kneel to you

What if we refuse the offer Jon had no doubt that they would The Old Bear might at least have listened though he would have balked at the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on the Seven Kingdoms But Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt would dismiss the notion out of hand

If you refuse Mance Rayder said Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days hence at dawn

He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell them of the horn but if he left Mance still alive Lord Janos and Ser Alliser would seize on that as proof that he was a turncloak A thousand thoughts flickered through Jon’s head If I can destroy the horn smash it here and now… but before he could begin to think that through he heard the low moan of some other horn made faint by the tent’s hide walls Mance heard it too Frowning he went to the door Jon followed

The warhorn was louder outside Its call had stirred the wildling camp Three Hornfoot men jogged past carrying long spears Horses were whinnying and snorting giants roaring in the Old Tongue and even the mammoths were restless

Outrider’s horn Tormund told Mance

Something’s coming Varamyr sat crosslegged on the half-frozen ground his wolves circled restlessly around him A shadow swept over him and Jon looked up to see the eagle’s blue-grey wings Coming from the east

When the dead walk walls and stakes and swords mean nothing he remembered You cannot fight the dead Jon Snow No man knows that half so well as me

Harma scowled East The wights should be behind us

East the skinchanger repeated Something’s coming

The Others Jon asked

Mance shook his head The Others never come when the sun is up Chariots were rattling across the killing ground jammed with riders waving spears of sharpened bone The king groaned Where the bloody hell do they think they’re going Quenn get those fools back where they belong Someone bring my horse The mare not the stallion I’ll want my armor too Mance glanced suspiciously at the Wall Atop the icy parapets the straw soldiers stood collecting arrows but there was no sign of any other activity Harma mount up your raiders Tormund find your sons and give me a triple line of spears

Aye said Tormund striding off

The mousy little skinchanger closed his eyes and said I see them They’re coming along the streams and game trails…

Who

Men Men on horses Men in steel and men in black

Crows Mance made the word a curse He turned on Jon Did my old brothers think they’d catch me with my breeches down if they attacked while we were talking

If they planned an attack they never told me about it Jon did not believe it Lord Janos lacked the men to attack the wildling camp Besides he was on the wrong side of the Wall and the gate was sealed with rubble He had a different sort of treachery in mind this can’t be his work

If you’re lying to me again you won’t be leaving here alive Mance warned His guards brought him his horse and armor Elsewhere around the camp Jon saw people running at cross purposes some men forming up as if to storm the Wall while others slipped into the woods women driving dog carts east mammoths wandering west He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away They wore black mail black halfhelms and black cloaks Half-armored Mance drew his sword You knew nothing of this did you he said to Jon coldly

Slow as honey on a cold morning the rangers swept down on the wildling camp picking their way through clumps of gorse and stands of trees over roots and rocks Wildlings flew to meet them shouting war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint galloping headlong at their ancient enemies A shout a slash and a fine brave death Jon had heard brothers say of the free folk’s way of fighting

Believe what you will Jon told the King-beyond-the-Wall but I knew nothing of any attack

Harma thundered past before Mance could reply riding at the head of thirty raiders Her standard went before her a dead dog impaled on a spear raining blood at every stride Mance watched as she smashed into the rangers Might be you’re telling it true he said Those look like Eastwatch men Sailors on horses Cotter Pyke always had more guts than sense He took the Lord of Bones at Long Barrow he might have thought to do the same with me If so he’s a fool He doesn’t have the men he—

Mance the shout came It was a scout bursting from the trees on a lathered horse Mance there’s more they’re all around us iron men iron a host of iron men
