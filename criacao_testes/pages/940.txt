41 Now I say That the heir as long as he is a child differeth
nothing from a servant though he be lord of all 42 But is under
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father

43 Even so we when we were children were in bondage under the
elements of the world 44 But when the fulness of the time was come
God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law 45 To
redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the
adoption of sons

46 And because ye are sons God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts crying Abba Father

47 Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son
then an heir of God through Christ

48 Howbeit then when ye knew not God ye did service unto them which
by nature are no gods

49 But now after that ye have known God or rather are known of God
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye
desire again to be in bondage  410 Ye observe days and months and
times and years

411 I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain

412 Brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as ye are ye have
not injured me at all

413 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
unto you at the first

414 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor
rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus

415 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of for I bear you record
that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own
eyes and have given them to me

416 Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth
417 They zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude
you that ye might affect them

418 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing
and not only when I am present with you

419 My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
be formed in you 420 I desire to be present with you now and to
change my voice for I stand in doubt of you

421 Tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the
law  422 For it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a
bondmaid the other by a freewoman

423 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he
of the freewoman was by promise

424 Which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants
the one from the mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage which is
Agar

425 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to
Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children

426 But Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us
all

427 For it is written Rejoice thou barren that bearest not break
forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband

428 Now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise

429 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit even so it is now

430 Nevertheless what saith the scripture Cast out the bondwoman and
her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman

431 So then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of
the free

51 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage

52 Behold I Paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ
shall profit you nothing

53 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a
debtor to do the whole law

54 Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are
justified by the law ye are fallen from grace

55 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
faith

56 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love
