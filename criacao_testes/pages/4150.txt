She went out when the horse was heard and looked
up A mounted figure passed between her and the
sky and drew on towards the fleld of sheep the rider
turning his face in receding Gabriel looked at her
It was a moment when a womans eyes and tongue tell
distinctly opposite tales Bathsheba looked full of
gratitude and she said --
  O Gabriel how could you serve me so unkindly
Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous
delay was the one speech in the language that he could
pardon for not being commendation of his readiness
now
Gabriel murmured a confused reply and hastened
on She knew from the look which sentence in her
note had brought him Bathsheba followed to the
field
Gabriel was already among the turgid prostrate forms
He had flung off his coat rolled up his shirt-sleeves
and taken from his pocket the instrument of salvation
It was a small tube or trochar with a lance passing
down the inside and Gabriel began to use it with a
dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon
Passing his hand over the sheeps left flank and
selecting the proper point he punctured the skin and
rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube then he
suddenly withdrew the lance retaining the tube in its
place A current of air rushed up the tube forcible
enough to have extinguished a candle held at the
orifice
It has been said that mere ease after torment is de+
light for a time and the countenances of these poor
creatures expressed it now Forty-nine operations were
successfully performed Owing to the great hurry
necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock
Gabriel missed his aim in one case and in one only --
striking wide of the mark and inflicting a mortal blow
at once upon the suffering ewe Four had died three
recovered without an operation The total number of
sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves
so dangerously was fifty-seven
When the love-led man had ceased from his labours
Bathsheba came and looked him in the face
Gabriel will you stay on with me she said
smiling winningly and not troubling to bring her lips
quite together again at the end because there was going
to be another smile soon
I will said Gabriel
And she smiled on him again

THE GREAT BARN AnD THE SHEEP-SHEARERS
MEN thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as
often by not making the most of good spirits when they
have them as by lacking good spirits when they are
indispensable Gabriel lately for the first time since
his prostration by misfortune had been independent in
thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent --
conditions which powerless without an opportunity as
an opportunity without them is barren would have
given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable-con+
junction should have occurred But this incurable
loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time
ruinously The spring tides were going by without
floating him off and the neap might soon come which
could not
It was the first day of June and the sheep-shearing
season culminated the landscape even to the leanest
pasture being all health and colour Every green was
young every pore was open and every stalk was swollen
with racing currents of juice God was palpably present
in the country and the devil had gone with the world
to town Flossy catkins of the later kinds fern-sprouts
like bishops croziers the square-headed moschatel the
odd cuckoo-pint -- like an apoplectic saint in a niche
of malachite -- snow-white ladies-smocks the toothwort
approximating to human flesh the enchanters night+
shade and the black-petaled doleful-bells were among
the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
Weatherbury at this teeming time and of the animal
the metamorphosed figures of Mr Jan Coggan the
master-shearer the second and third shearers who
travelled in the exercise of their calling and do not re+
quire definition by name Henery Fray the fourth
shearer Susan Talls husband the fifth Joseph Poorgrass
the sixth young Cain Ball as assistant-shearer and
Gabriel Oak as general supervisor None of these were
clothed

to any extent worth mentioning each appearing
to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean
between a high and low caste Hindoo An angularity
of lineament and a fixity of facial machinery in general
proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day
They sheared in the great barn called for the nonce
the Shearing-barn which on ground-plan resembled a
church with transepts It not only emulated the form
of the neighbouring church of the parish but vied with
it in antiquity Whether the barn had ever formed one
of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to be
aware no trace of such surroundings remained The
