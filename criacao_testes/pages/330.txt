answered It is If it be give me thine hand And he gave him his
hand and he took him up to him into the chariot

1016 And he said Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD So they
made him ride in his chariot

1017 And when he came to Samaria he slew all that remained unto Ahab
in Samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the
LORD which he spake to Elijah

1018 And Jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them
Ahab served Baal a little but Jehu shall serve him much

1019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal all his
servants and all his priests let none be wanting for I have a great
sacrifice to do to Baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not
live But Jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy
the worshippers of Baal

1020 And Jehu said Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal And they
proclaimed it

1021 And Jehu sent through all Israel and all the worshippers of
Baal came so that there was not a man left that came not And they
came into the house of Baal and the house of Baal was full from one
end to another

1022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry Bring forth
vestments for all the worshippers of Baal And he brought them forth
vestments

1023 And Jehu went and Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house
of Baal and said unto the worshippers of Baal Search and look that
there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD but the
worshippers of Baal only

1024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings
Jehu appointed fourscore men without and said If any of the men whom
I have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his
life shall be for the life of him

1025 And it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering
the burnt offering that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains
Go in and slay them let none come forth And they smote them with
the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out
and went to the city of the house of Baal

1026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal and
burned them

1027 And they brake down the image of Baal and brake down the house
of Baal and made it a draught house unto this day

1028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel

1029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made
Israel to sin Jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden
calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan

1030 And the LORD said unto Jehu Because thou hast done well in
executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the
house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of
the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel

1031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
Israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of
Jeroboam which made Israel to sin

1032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short and Hazael
smote them in all the coasts of Israel 1033 From Jordan eastward
all the land of Gilead the Gadites and the Reubenites and the
Manassites from Aroer which is by the river Arnon even Gilead and
Bashan

1034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all
his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel  1035 And Jehu slept with his fathers and they
buried him in Samaria And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead

1036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty
and eight years

111 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal

112 But Jehosheba the daughter of king Joram sister of Ahaziah
took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the kings
sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in
the bedchamber from Athaliah so that he was not slain

113 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years And
Athaliah did reign over the land

114 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him
into the house of the LORD and made a covenant with them and took an
oath of them in the house of the LORD and shewed them the kings son

115 And he commanded them saying This is the thing that ye shall
do A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be
