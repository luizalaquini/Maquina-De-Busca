Catelyn knew Ser Gregor’s evil reputation yet still    Don’t speak to me of heads Uncle Cersei has mounted Ned’s on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep and left it for the crows and flies Even now it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone Some nights she would wake in darkness half-asleep and for an instant expect to find him there beside her Clegane is no more than Lord Tywin’s catspaw For Tywin Lannister—Lord of Casterly Rock Warden of the West father to Queen Cersei Ser Jaime the Kingslayer and Tyrion the Imp and grandfather to Joffrey Baratheon the new-crowned boy king—was the true danger Catelyn believed

True enough Ser Brynden admitted And Tywin Lannister is no man’s fool He sits safe behind the walls of Harrenhal feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take Gregor is not the only dog he’s loosed Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well and some sellsword out of Qohor who’d sooner maim a man than kill him I’ve seen what they leave behind them Whole villages put to the torch women raped and mutilated butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs    it would sicken even the dead

When Edmure hears this he will rage

And that will be just as Lord Tywin desires Even terror has its purpose Cat Lannister wants to provoke us to battle

Robb is like to give him that wish Catelyn said fretful He is restless as a cat sitting here and Edmure and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on Her son had won two great victories smashing Jaime Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing his leaderless host outside the walls of Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps but from the way some of his bannermen spoke of him he might have been Aegon the Conqueror reborn

Brynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow More fool they My first rule of war Cat—never give the enemy his wish Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing He wants us to march on Harrenhal

Harrenhal Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal the vast fortress that King Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past when the Seven Kingdoms had been seven kingdoms and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands In his pride Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all Westeros Forty years it had taken rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake while Harren’s armies plundered his neighbors for stone lumber gold and workers Thousands of captives died in his quarries chained to his sledges or laboring on his five colossal towers Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer Weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream And when at last Harrenhal stood complete on the very day King Harren took up residence Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at King’s Landing

Catelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to her own children back at Winterfell And King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons the tale always ended For dragons fly Harren and all his line had perished in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress and every house that held Harrenhal since had come to misfortune Strong it might be but it was a dark place and cursed

I would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep Catelyn admitted Yet we must do something Uncle

And soon her uncle agreed I have not told you the worst of it child The men I sent west have brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock

Another Lannister army The thought made her ill Robb must be told at once Who will command

Ser Stafford Lannister it’s said He turned to gaze out over the rivers his red-and-blue cloak stirring in the breeze

Another nephew The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile house

Cousin Ser Brynden corrected Brother to Lord Tywin’s late wife so twice related An old man and a bit of a dullard but he has a son Ser Daven who is more formidable

Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field

We have some time yet before we must face them This lot will be sellswords freeriders and green boys from the stews of Lannisport Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle    and make no mistake Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer He will not rush in heedless He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal

Unless    said Catelyn

Yes Ser Brynden prompted

Unless he must leave Harrenhal she said to face some other threat

Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully Lord Renly

King Renly If she would ask help from the man she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself

Perhaps The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile He’ll want something though

He’ll want what kings always want she said Homage





TYRION

Janos Slynt was a butcher’s son and he laughed like a man chopping meat More wine Tyrion asked him

I should not object Lord Janos said holding out his cup He was built like a keg and had a similar capacity I should not object at all That’s a fine red From the Arbor

Dornish Tyrion gestured and his serving man poured But for the servants he and Lord Janos were alone in the Small Hall at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness Quite the find Dornish wines are not often so rich

Rich said the big frog-faced man taking a healthy gulp He was not a man for sipping Janos Slynt Tyrion had made note of that at once Yes rich that’s the very word I was searching for the very word You have a gift for words Lord Tyrion if I might say so And you tell a droll tale Droll yes

I’m pleased you think so    but I’m not a lord as you are A simple Tyrion will suffice for me Lord Janos

As you wish He took another swallow dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear its point enameled in dark red And he was well and truly drunk

Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine but he was very full The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service This evening they had supped on oxtail soup summer greens tossed with pecans grapes red fennel and crumbled cheese hot crab pie spiced squash and quails drowned in butter Each dish had come with its own wine Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal Tyrion said

For a certainty Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service what do you say

Wars have been fought over less he said and they both had a good long laugh You’re a bold man to take Harrenhal for your seat Such a grim place and huge    costly to maintain And some say cursed as well

Should I fear a pile of stone He hooted at the notion A bold man you said You must be bold to rise As I have To Harrenhal yes And why not You know You are a bold man too I sense Small mayhap but bold

You are too kind More wine

No No truly I    oh gods be damned yes Why not A bold man drinks his fill

Truly Tyrion filled Lord Slynt’s cup to the brim I have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch

Good men Fine men Any of the six will do but I’d choose Allar Deem My right arm Good good man Loyal Pick him and you won’t be sorry If he pleases the king

To be sure Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater He’s been captain on the Mud Gate for three years and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion King Robert knighted him at Pyke And yet his name does not appear on your list

Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before swallowing Bywater Well Brave man to be sure yet    he’s rigid that one A queer dog The men don’t like him A cripple too lost his hand at Pyke that’s what got him knighted A poor trade if you ask me a hand for a ser He laughed Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor as I see it You’ll do better leaving that one where he is my lor—Tyrion Allar Deem’s the man for you

Deem is little loved in the streets I am told

He’s feared That’s better

What was it I heard of him Some trouble in a brothel

That Not his fault my lo—Tyrion No He never meant to kill the woman that was her own doing He warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty

Still    mothers and children he might have expected she’d try to save the babe Tyrion smiled Have some of this cheese it goes splendidly with the wine Tell me why did you choose Deem for that unhappy task

A good commander knows his men Tyrion Some are good for one job some for another Doing for a babe and her still on the tit that takes a certain sort Not every man’d do it Even if it was only some whore and her whelp

I suppose that’s so said Tyrion hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae and Tysha long ago and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years

Slynt went on oblivious A hard man for a hard job is Deem Does as he’s told and never a word afterward He cut a slice off the cheese This is fine Sharp Give me a good sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and I’m a happy man
