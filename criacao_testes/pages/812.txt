Southron gods the man said but it’s a southron peace we need to get you safe to your father

My father Jaime wondered whether Lord Tywin had received the goat’s demand for ransom with or without his rotted hand What is a swordsman worth without his sword hand Half the gold in Casterly Rock Three hundred dragons Or nothing His father had never been unduly swayed by sentiment Tywin Lannister’s own father Lord Tytos had once imprisoned an unruly bannerman Lord Tarbeck The redoubtable Lady Tarbeck responded by capturing three Lannisters including young Stafford whose sister was betrothed to cousin Tywin Send back my lord and love or these three shall answer for any harm that comes him she had written to Casterly Rock Young Tywin suggested his father oblige by sending back Lord Tarbeck in three pieces Lord Tytos was a gentler sort of lion however so Lady Tarbeck won a few more years for her muttonheaded lord and Stafford wed and bred and blundered on till Oxcross But Tywin Lannister endured eternal as Casterly Rock And now you have a cripple for a son as well as a dwarf my lord How you will hate that…

The road led them through a burned village It must have been a year or more since the place had been put to torch The hovels stood blackened and roofless but weeds were growing waist high in all the surrounding fields Steelshanks called a halt to allow them to water the horses I know this place too Jaime thought as he waited by the well There had been a small inn where only a few foundation stones and a chimney now stood and he had gone in for a cup of ale A dark-eyed serving wench brought him cheese and apples but the innkeep had refused his coin It’s an honor to have a knight of the Kingsguard under my roof ser the man had said It’s a tale I’ll tell my grandchildren Jaime looked at the chimney poking out of the weeds and wondered whether he had ever gotten those grandchildren Did he tell them the Kingslayer once drank his ale and ate his cheese and apples or was he ashamed to admit he fed the likes of me Not that he would ever know whoever burned the inn had likely killed the grandchildren as well

He could feel his phantom fingers clench When Steelshanks said that perhaps they should have a fire and a bit of food Jaime shook his head I mislike this place We’ll ride on

By evenfall they had left the lake to follow a rutted track through a wood of oak and elm Jaime’s stump was throbbing dully when Steelshanks decided to make camp Qyburn had brought a skin of dreamwine thankfully While Walton set the watches Jaime stretched out near the fire and propped a rolled-up bearskin against a stump as a pillow for his head The wench would have told him he had to eat before he slept to keep his strength up but he was more tired than hungry He closed his eyes and hoped to dream of Cersei The fever dreams were all so vivid…

Naked and alone he stood surrounded by enemies with stone walls all around him pressing close The Rock he knew He could feel the immense weight of it above his head He was home He was home and whole

He held his right hand up and flexed his fingers to feel the strength in them It felt as good as sex As good as swordplay Four fingers and a thumb He had dreamed that he was maimed but it wasn’t so Relief made him dizzy My hand my good hand Nothing could hurt him so long as he was whole

Around him stood a dozen tall dark figures in cowled robes that hid their faces In their hands were spears Who are you he demanded of them What business do you have in Casterly Rock

They gave no answer only prodded him with the points of their spears He had no choice but to descend Down a twisting passageway he went narrow steps carved from the living rock down and down I must go up he told himself Up not down Why am I going down Below the earth his doom awaited he knew with the certainty of dream something dark and terrible lurked there something that wanted him Jaime tried to halt but their spears prodded him on If only I had my sword nothing could harm me

The steps ended abruptly on echoing darkness Jaime had the sense of vast space before him He jerked to a halt teetering on the edge of nothingness A spearpoint jabbed at the small of the back shoving him into the abyss He shouted but the fall was short He landed on his hands and knees upon soft sand and shallow water There were watery caverns deep below Casterly Rock but this one was strange to him What place is this

Your place The voice echoed it was a hundred voices a thousand the voices of all the Lannisters since Lann the Clever who’d lived at the dawn of days But most of all it was his father’s voice and beside Lord Tywin stood his sister pale and beautiful a torch burning in her hand Joffrey was there as well the son they’d made together and behind them a dozen more dark shapes with golden hair

Sister why has Father brought us here

Us This is your place Brother This is your darkness Her torch was the only light in the cavern Her torch was the only light in the world She turned to go

Stay with me Jaime pleaded Don’t leave me here alone But they were leaving Don’t leave me in the dark Something terrible lived down here Give me a sword at least

I gave you a sword Lord Tywin said

It was at his feet Jaime groped under the water until his hand closed upon the hilt Nothing can hurt me so long as I have a sword As he raised the sword a finger of pale flame flickered at the point and crept up along the edge stopping a hand’s breath from the hilt The fire took on the color of the steel itself so it burned with a silvery-blue light and the gloom pulled back Crouching listening Jaime moved in a circle ready for anything that might come out of the darkness The water flowed into his boots ankle deep and bitterly cold Beware the water he told himself There may be creatures living in it hidden deeps…

From behind came a great splash Jaime whirled toward the sound… but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth her hands bound in heavy chains I swore to keep you safe the wench said stubbornly I swore an oath Naked she raised her hands to Jaime Ser Please If you would be so good

The steel links parted like silk A sword Brienne begged and there it was scabbard belt and all She buckled it around her thick waist The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her though they stood a scant few feet apart In this light she could almost be a beauty he thought In this light she could almost be a knight Brienne’s sword took flame as well burning silvery blue The darkness retreated a little more

The flames will burn so long as you live he heard Cersei call When they die so must you

Sister he shouted Stay with me Stay There was no reply but the soft sound of retreating footsteps

Brienne moved her longsword back and forth watching the silvery flames shift and shimmer Beneath her feet a reflection of the burning blade shone on the surface of the flat black water She was as tall and strong as he remembered yet it seemed to Jaime that she had more of a woman’s shape now

Do they keep a bear down here Brienne was moving slow and wary sword to hand step turn and listen Each step made a little splash A cave lion Direwolves Some bear Tell me Jaime What lives here What lives in the darkness

Doom No bear he knew No lion Only doom

In the cool silvery-blue light of the swords the big wench looked pale and fierce I mislike this place

I’m not fond of it myself Their blades made a little island of light but all around them stretched a sea of darkness unending My feet are wet

We could go back the way they brought us If you climbed on my shoulders you’d have no trouble reaching that tunnel mouth

Then I could follow Cersei He could feel himself growing hard at the thought and turned away so Brienne would not see
