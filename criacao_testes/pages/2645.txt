saying Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel so
shall it be done unto his oxen And the fear of the LORD fell on the
people and they came out with one consent

118 And when he numbered them in Bezek the children of Israel were
three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand

119 And they said unto the messengers that came Thus shall ye say
unto the men of Jabeshgilead To morrow by that time the sun be hot
ye shall have help And the messengers came and shewed it to the men
of Jabesh and they were glad

1110 Therefore the men of Jabesh said To morrow we will come out
unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you

1111 And it was so on the morrow that Saul put the people in three
companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning
watch and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day and it came
to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them
were not left together

1112 And the people said unto Samuel Who is he that said Shall Saul
reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death

1113 And Saul said There shall not a man be put to death this day
for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel

1114 Then said Samuel to the people Come and let us go to Gilgal
and renew the kingdom there

1115 And all the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king
before the LORD in Gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of
peace offerings before the LORD and there Saul and all the men of
Israel rejoiced greatly

121 And Samuel said unto all Israel Behold I have hearkened unto
your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you

122 And now behold the king walketh before you and I am old and
grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and I have walked
before you from my childhood unto this day

123 Behold here I am witness against me before the LORD and before
his anointed whose ox have I taken or whose ass have I taken or
whom have I defrauded whom have I oppressed or of whose hand have I
received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and I will restore it
you

124 And they said Thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us
neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand

125 And he said unto them The LORD is witness against you and his
anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand
And they answered He is witness

126 And Samuel said unto the people It is the LORD that advanced
Moses and Aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of
Egypt

127 Now therefore stand still that I may reason with you before the
LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD which he did to you and to
your fathers

128 When Jacob was come into Egypt and your fathers cried unto the
LORD then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron which brought forth your
fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place

129 And when they forgat the LORD their God he sold them into the
hand of Sisera captain of the host of Hazor and into the hand of the
Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab and they fought
against them

1210 And they cried unto the LORD and said We have sinned because
we have forsaken the LORD and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth but
now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee

1211 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and
Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every
side and ye dwelled safe

1212 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
came against you ye said unto me Nay but a king shall reign over
us when the LORD your God was your king

1213 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye
have desired and behold the LORD hath set a king over you

1214 If ye will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and
not rebel against the commandment of the LORD then shall both ye and
also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your
God 1215 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD but rebel
against the commandment of the LORD then shall the hand of the LORD
be against you as it was against your fathers

1216 Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the LORD
will do before your eyes

1217 Is it not wheat harvest to day I will call unto the LORD and
he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the LORD in
