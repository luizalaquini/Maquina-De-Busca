Well the one is done and the other forever beyond our reach I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days but I must think of the living I want my daughters back and the queen holds them still If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks I will call that a bargain and thank the gods I want you safe Robb ruling at Winterfell from your father’s seat I want you to live your life to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son I want to write an end to this I want to go home my lords and weep for my husband

The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking

Peace said her uncle Brynden Peace is sweet my lady… but on what terms It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow

What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones asked Rickard Karstark

Aye said Lord Bracken Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields slaughtered my smallfolk and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him What have we fought for if we are to put all back as it was before

Lord Blackwood agreed to Catelyn’s surprise and dismay And if we do make peace with King Joffrey are we not then traitors to King Renly What if the stag should prevail against the lion where would that leave us

Whatever you may decide for yourselves I shall never call a Lannister my king declared Marq Piper

Nor I yelled the little Darry boy I never will

Again the shouting began Catelyn sat despairing She had come so close she thought They had almost listened almost… but the moment was gone There would be no peace no chance to heal no safety She looked at her son watched him as he listened to the lords debate frowning troubled yet wedded to his war He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey but she saw his true bride plain before her now the sword he had laid on the table

Catelyn was thinking of her girls wondering if she would ever see them again when the Greatjon lurched to his feet

MY LORDS he shouted his voice booming off the rafters Here is what I say to these two kings He spat Renly Baratheon is nothing to me nor Stannis neither Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men Even their gods are wrong The Others take the Lannisters too I’ve had a bellyful of them He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again It was the dragons we married and the dragons are all dead He pointed at Robb with the blade There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to m’lords he thundered The King in the North

And he knelt and laid his sword at her son’s feet

I’ll have peace on those terms Lord Karstark said They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well He eased his longsword from its scabbard The King in the North he said kneeling beside the Greatjon

Maege Mormont stood The King of Winter she declared and laid her spiked mace beside the swords And the river lords were rising too Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one… yet now were heard again ringing from the timbers of her father’s hall

The King in the North

The King in the North

THE KING IN THE NORTH





DAENERYS

The land was red and dead and parched and good wood was hard to come by Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods purple brush sheaves of brown grass They took the two straightest trees hacked the limbs and branches from them skinned off their bark and split them laying the logs in a square Its center they filled with straw brush bark shavings and bundles of dry grass Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them he was not the equal of Khal Drogo’s red but few horses were In the center of the square Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes

Bound hand and foot Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes It is not enough to kill a horse she told Dany By itself the blood is nothing You do not have the words to make a spell nor the wisdom to find them Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children You call me maegi as if it were a curse but all it means is wise You are a child with a child’s ignorance Whatever you mean to do it will not work Loose me from these bonds and I will help you

I am tired of the maegi’s braying Dany told Jhogo He took his whip to her and after that the godswife kept silent

Over the carcass of the horse they built a platform of hewn logs trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater and the thickest straightest branches they could find They laid the wood east to west from sunrise to sunset On the platform they piled Khal Drogo’s treasures his great tent his painted vests his saddles and harness the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son a mighty dragonbone bow Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo’s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well but she forbade it Those are mine she told him and I mean to keep them Another layer of brush was piled about the khal’s treasures and bundles of dried grass scattered over them

Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith Princess… he began

Why do you call me that Dany challenged him My brother Viserys was your king was he not

He was my lady
