429 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as
one goeth into them from the utter court

4210 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
toward the east over against the separate place and over against the
building

4211 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
which were toward the north as long as they and as broad as they
and all their goings out were both according to their fashions and
according to their doors

4212 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the way even the way directly before
the wall toward the east as one entereth into them

4213 Then said he unto me The north chambers and the south chambers
which are before the separate place they be holy chambers where the
priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things
there shall they lay the most holy things and the meat offering and
the sin offering and the trespass offering for the place is holy

4214 When the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of
the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their
garments wherein they minister for they are holy and shall put on
other garments and shall approach to those things which are for the
people

4215 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he
brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east
and measured it round about

4216 He measured the east side with the measuring reed five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed round about

4217 He measured the north side five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about

4218 He measured the south side five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed

4219 He turned about to the west side and measured five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed

4220 He measured it by the four sides it had a wall round about
five hundred reeds long and five hundred broad to make a separation
between the sanctuary and the profane place

431 Afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looketh
toward the east 432 And behold the glory of the God of Israel came
from the way of the east and his voice was like a noise of many
waters and the earth shined with his glory

433 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw
even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the
city and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river
Chebar and I fell upon my face

434 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the
gate whose prospect is toward the east

435 So the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court
and behold the glory of the LORD filled the house

436 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man
stood by me

437 And he said unto me Son of man the place of my throne and the
place of the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the
children of Israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of
Israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their
whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places

438 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their
post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even
defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed
wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger

439 Now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their
kings far from me and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever

4310 Thou son of man shew the house to the house of Israel that
they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the
pattern

4311 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the
form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out
thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and
all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the
laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the
whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them

4312 This is the law of the house Upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy Behold this is
the law of the house

4313 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits The
cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth even the bottom shall be a
cubit and the breadth a cubit and the border thereof by the edge
