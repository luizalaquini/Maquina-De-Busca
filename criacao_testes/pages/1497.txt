I don’t need—

You do I want you rested Go on I’m not going to let you sleep through the fight He made himself smile You’re the only one who can move those bloody barrels

Grenn went off muttering and Jon returned to the far eye searching the wildling camp From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead but he had learned to ignore those The range was long and the angle was bad the chances of being hit were small He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle The sons were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger Varamyr Sixskins walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging his heels

When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening he knew it would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning The sight of Mance’s turtle had robbed Jon of his appetite Their oil was all but gone and the last barrel of pitch had been rolled off the Wall two nights ago They would soon run short of arrows as well and there were no fletchers making more And the night before last a raven had come from the west from Ser Denys Mallister Bowen Marsh had chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower it seemed and then farther down into the gloom of the Gorge At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle But the victory had been a costly one More than a hundred brothers slain among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded Maester Mullin was tending him but it would be some time before he was fit to return to Castle Black

When he had read that Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole’s Town on their best horse to plead with the villagers to help man the Wall She never returned When he sent Mully after her he came back to report the whole village deserted even the brothel Most likely Zei had followed them straight down the kingsroad Maybe we should all do the same Jon reflected glumly

He made himself eat hungry or no Bad enough he could not sleep he could not go on without food as well Besides this might be my last meal It might be the last meal for all of us So it was that Jon had a belly full of bread bacon onions and cheese when he heard Horse shout IT’S COMING

No one needed to ask what it was Nor did Jon need the maester’s Myrish eye to see it creeping out from amongst the tents and trees It doesn’t really look much like a turtle Satin commented Turtles don’t have fur

Most of them don’t have wheels either said Pyp

Sound the warhorn Jon commanded and Kegs blew two long blasts to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who’d had the watch during the night If the wildlings were coming the Wall would need every man Gods know we have few enough Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin Horse and Owen the Oaf Tim Tangletongue Mully Spare Boot and the rest and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in the freezing darkness of that tunnel with only a few iron bars between them That was what it would come down to unless they could stop the turtle before the gate was breached

It’s big Horse said

Pyp smacked his lips Think of all the soup it will make The jape was stillborn Even Pyp sounded tired He looks half dead thought Jon but so do we all The King-beyond-the-Wall had so many men that he could throw fresh attackers at them every time but the same handful of black brothers had to meet every assault and it had worn them ragged

The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard Jon knew putting their shoulders into it straining to keep the wheels turning but once the turtle was flush against the gate they would exchange their ropes for axes At least Mance was not sending his mammoths today Jon was glad of that Their awesome strength was wasted on the Wall and their size only made them easy targets The last had been a day and a half in the dying its mournful trumpetings terrible to hear

The turtle crept slowly through stones and stumps and brush The earlier attacks had cost the free folk a hundred lives or more Most still lay where they had fallen In the lulls the crows would come and pay them court but now the birds fled screeching They liked the look of that turtle no more than he did

Satin Horse and the others were looking to him Jon knew waiting for his orders He was so tired he hardly knew any more The Wall is mine he reminded himself Owen Horse to the catapults Kegs you and Spare Boot on the scorpions The rest of you string your bows Fire arrows Let’s see if we can burn it It was likely to be a futile gesture Jon knew but it had to be better than standing helpless

Cumbersome and slow-moving the turtle made for an easy shot and his archers and crossbowmen soon turned it into a lumbering wooden hedgehog… but the wet hides protected it just as they had the mantlets and the flaming arrows guttered out almost as soon as they struck Jon cursed under his breath Scorpions he commanded Catapults

The scorpions bolts punched deep into the pelts but did no more damage than the fire arrows The rocks went bouncing off the turtle’s roof leaving dimples in the thick layers of hides A stone from one of the trebuchets might have crushed it but the one machine was still broken and the wildlings had gone wide around the area where the other dropped its loads

Jon it’s still coming said Owen the Oaf

He could see that for himself Inch by inch yard by yard the turtle crept closer rolling rumbling and rocking as it crossed the killing ground Once the wildlings got it flush against the Wall it would give them all the shelter they needed while their axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates Inside under the ice they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours and then there would be nothing to stop them but two iron gates a few half-frozen corpses and whatever brothers Jon cared to throw in their path to fight and die down in the dark

To his left the catapult made a thunk and filled the air with spinning stones They plonked down on the turtle like hail and caromed harmlessly aside The wildling archers were still loosing arrows from behind their mantlets One thudded into the face of a straw man and Pyp said Four for Watt of Long Lake We have a tie The next shaft whistled past his own ear however Fie he shouted down I’m not in the tourney

The hides won’t burn Jon said as much to himself as to the others Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it reached the Wall For that they needed boulders No matter how stoutly built the turtle was a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of it from seven hundred feet was bound to do some damage Grenn Owen Kegs it’s time

Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were lined up in a row They were full of crushed rock the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give themselves better footing atop the Wall Yesterday after he’d seen the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins Jon told Grenn to pour water into the barrels as much as they would take The water would seep down through the crushed stone and overnight the whole thing would freeze solid It was the nearest thing to a boulder they were going to get

Why do we need to freeze it Grenn had asked him Why don’t we just roll the barrels off the way they are

Jon answered If they crash against the Wall on the way down they’ll burst and loose gravel will spray everywhere We don’t want to rain pebbles on the whoresons

He put his shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn while Kegs and Owen were wrestling with another Together they rocked it back and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around its bottom The bugger weighs a ton said Grenn

Tip it over and roll it Jon said Careful if it rolls over your foot you’ll end up like Spare Boot

Once the barrel was on its side Jon grabbed a torch and waved it above the surface of the Wall back and forth just enough to melt the ice a little The thin film of water helped the barrel roll more easily Too easily in fact they almost lost it But finally with four of them pooling their efforts they rolled their boulder to the edge and stood it up again

They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted There’s a turtle at our door Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look Hoardings Marsh should have built hoardings So many things they should have done The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away from the gate Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them and Jon thought he saw one man go down but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path but then he saw The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall so they simply pushed it over the carcass His leg twitched but Horse caught his arm and drew him back to safety You shouldn’t lean out like that the boy said

We should have built hoardings Jon thought he could hear the crash of axes on wood but that was probably just fear ringing in his ears He looked to Grenn Do it

Grenn got behind a barrel put his shoulder against it grunted and began to push Owen and Mully moved to help him They shoved the barrel out a foot and then another And suddenly it was gone

They heard the thump as it struck the Wall on the way down and then much louder the crash and crack of splintering wood followed by shouts and screams Satin whooped and Owen the Oaf danced in circles while Pyp leaned out and called The turtle was stuffed full of rabbits Look at them hop away

Again Jon barked and Grenn and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel and sent it tottering out into empty air

By the time they were done the front of Mance’s turtle was a crushed and splintered ruin and wildlings were spilling out the other end and scrambling for their camp Satin scooped up his crossbow and sent a few quarrels after them as they ran to see them off the faster Grenn was grinning through his beard Pyp was making japes and none of them would die today

On the morrow though… Jon glanced toward the shed Eight barrels of gravel remained where twelve had stood a few moments before He realized how tired he was then and how much his wound was hurting I need to sleep A few hours at least He could go to Maester Aemon for some dreamwine that would help I am going down to the King’s Tower he told them Call me if Mance gets up to anything Pyp you have the Wall

Me said Pyp

Him said Grenn

Smiling he left them to it and rode down in the cage

A cup of dreamwine did help as it happened No sooner had he stretched out on the narrow bed in his cell than sleep took him His dreams were strange and formless full of strange voices shouts and cries and the sound of a warhorn blowing low and loud a single deep booming note that lingered in the air

When he awoke the sky was black outside the arrow slit that served him for a window and four men he did not know were standing over him One held a lantern Jon Snow the tallest of them said brusquely pull on your boots and come with us

His first groggy thought was that somehow the Wall had fallen whilst he slept that Mance Rayder had sent more giants or another turtle and broken through the gate But when he rubbed his eyes he saw that the strangers were all in black They’re men of the Night’s Watch Jon realized Come where Who are you

The tall man gestured and two of the others pulled Jon from the bed With the lantern leading the way they marched him from his cell and up a half turn of stair to the Old Bear’s solar He saw Maester Aemon standing by the fire his hands folded around the head of a blackthorn cane Septon Cellador was half drunk as usual and Ser Wynton Stout was asleep in a window seat The other brothers were strangers to him All but one

Immaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say Here’s the turncloak now my lord Ned Stark’s bastard of Winterfell

I’m no turncloak Thorne Jon said coldly

We shall see In the leather chair behind the table where the Old Bear wrote his letters sat a big broad jowly man Jon did not know Yes we shall see he said again You will not deny that you are Jon Snow I hope Stark’s bastard

Lord Snow he likes to call himself Ser Alliser was a spare slim man compact and sinewy and just now his flinty eyes were dark with amusement

You’re the one who named me Lord Snow said Jon Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys he trained during his time as Castle Black’s master-at-arms The Old Bear had sent Thorne to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea These others must be Eastwatch men The bird reached Cotter Pyke and he’s sent us help How many men have you brought he asked the man behind the table

It’s me who’ll ask the questions the jowly man replied You’ve been charged with oathbreaking cowardice and desertion Jon Snow Do you deny that you abandoned your brothers to die on the Fist of the First Men and joined the wildling Mance Rayder this self-styled King-beyond-the-Wall

Abandoned… Jon almost choked on the word

Maester Aemon spoke up then My lord Donal Noye and I discussed these issues when Jon Snow first returned to us and were satisfied by Jon’s explanations

Well I am not satisfied Maester said the jowly man I will hear these explanations for myself Yes I will

Jon swallowed his anger I abandoned no one I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling Pass I joined the wildlings under orders The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of Winter…
