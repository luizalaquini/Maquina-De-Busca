911 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
LORD and to the kings palace and harps and psalteries for singers
and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah

912 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire
whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king
So she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants

913 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred and threescore and six talents of gold 914 Beside that which
chapmen and merchants brought And all the kings of Arabia and
governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon

915 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six
hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target

916 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield And the king put them in the house
of the forest of Lebanon

917 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it
with pure gold

918 And there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold
which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the
sitting place and two lions standing by the stays 919 And twelve
lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps
There was not the like made in any kingdom

920 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold and
all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the
days of Solomon

921 For the kings ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram
every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold and
silver ivory and apes and peacocks

922 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
wisdom

923 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to
hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart

924 And they brought every man his present vessels of silver and
vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules
a rate year by year

925 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and
twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and
with the king at Jerusalem

926 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt

927 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones and cedar trees
made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance

928 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all
lands

929 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are they not
written in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of
Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer against
Jeroboam the son of Nebat  930 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over
all Israel forty years

931 And Solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city
of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead

101 And Rehoboam went to Shechem for to Shechem were all Israel come
to make him king

102 And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat who was in
Egypt whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king heard
it that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt

103 And they sent and called him So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
spake to Rehoboam saying 104 Thy father made our yoke grievous now
therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and
his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee

105 And he said unto them Come again unto me after three days And
the people departed

106 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
before Solomon his father while he yet lived saying What counsel
give ye me to return answer to this people  107 And they spake unto
him saying If thou be kind to this people and please them and
speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever

108 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took
counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood
before him

109 And he said unto them What advice give ye that we may return
answer to this people which have spoken to me saying Ease somewhat
the yoke that thy father did put upon us  1010 And the young men
that were brought up with him spake unto him saying Thus shalt thou
