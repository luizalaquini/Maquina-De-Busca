Jaime watched from the foot of the table thinking of all those lords who aspired to a seat on the king’s small council They can bloody well have mine If this was power why did it taste like tedium He did not feel especially powerful watching Tommen dip his quill in the inkpot again He felt bored

And sore Every muscle in his body ached and his ribs and shoulders were bruised from the battering they’d gotten courtesy of Ser Addam Marbrand Just thinking of it made him wince He could only hope the man would keep his mouth shut Jaime had known Marbrand since he was a boy serving as a page at Casterly Rock he trusted him as much as he trusted anyone Enough to ask him to take up shields and tourney swords He had wanted to know if he could fight with his left hand

And now I do The knowledge was more painful than the beating that Ser Addam had given him and the beating was so bad he could hardly dress himself this morning If they had been fighting in earnest Jaime would have died two dozen deaths It seemed so simple changing hands It wasn’t Every instinct he had was wrong He had to think about everything where once he’d just moved And while he was thinking Marbrand was thumping him His left hand couldn’t even seem to hold a longsword properly Ser Addam had disarmed him thrice sending his blade spinning

This grants said lands incomes and castle to Ser Emmon Frey and his lady wife Lady Genna Ser Kevan presented another sheaf of parchments to the king Tommen dipped and signed This is a decree of legitimacy for a natural son of Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort And this names Lord Bolton your Warden of the North Tommen dipped signed dipped signed This grants Ser Rolph Spicer title to the castle Castamere and raises him to the rank of lord Tommen scrawled his name

I should have gone to Ser Ilyn Payne Jaime reflected The King’s Justice was not a friend as Marbrand was and might well have beat him bloody    but without a tongue he was not like to boast of it afterward All it would take would be one chance remark by Ser Addam in his cups and the whole world would soon know how useless he’d become Lord Commander of the Kingsguard It was a cruel jape that    though not quite so cruel as the gift his father had sent him

This is your royal pardon for Lord Gawen Westerling his lady wife and his daughter Jeyne welcoming them back into the king’s peace Ser Kevan said This is a pardon for Lord Jonos Bracken of Stone Hedge This is a pardon for Lord Vance This for Lord Goodbrook This for Lord Mooton of Maidenpool

Jaime pushed himself to his feet You seem to have these matters well in hand Uncle I shall leave His Grace to you

As you wish Ser Kevan rose as well Jaime you should go to your father This breach between you—

—is his doing Nor will he mend it by sending me mocking gifts Tell him that if you can pry him away from the Tyrells long enough

His uncle looked distressed The gift was heartfelt We thought that it might encourage you—

—to grow a new hand Jaime turned to Tommen Though he had Joffrey’s golden curls and green eyes the new king shared little else with his late brother He inclined to plumpness his face was pink and round and he even liked to read He is still shy of nine this son of mine The boy is not the man It would be seven years before Tommen was ruling in his own right Until then the realm would remain firmly in the hands of his lord grandfather Sire he asked do I have your leave to go

As you like Ser Uncle Tommen looked back to Ser Kevan Can I seal them now Great-Uncle Pressing his royal seal into the hot wax was his favorite part of being king so far

Jaime strode from the council chamber Outside the door he found Ser Meryn Trant standing stiff at guard in white scale armor and snowy cloak If this one should learn how feeble I am or Kettleblack or Blount should hear of it    Remain here until His Grace is done he said then escort him back to Maegor’s

Trant inclined his head As you say my lord

The outer ward was crowded and noisy that morning Jaime made for the stables where a large group of men were saddling their horses Steelshanks he called Are you off then

As soon as m’lady is mounted said Steelshanks Walton My lord of Bolton expects us Here she is now

A groom led a fine grey mare out the stable door On her back was mounted a skinny hollow-eyed girl wrapped in a heavy cloak Grey it was like the dress beneath it and trimmed with white satin The clasp that pinned it to her breast was wrought in the shape of a wolf’s head with slitted opal eyes The girl’s long brown hair blew wild in the wind She had a pretty face he thought but her eyes were sad and wary

When she saw him she inclined her head Ser Jaime she said in a thin anxious voice You are kind to see me off

Jaime studied her closely You know me then

She bit her lip You may not recall my lord as I was littler then    but I had the honor to meet you at Winterfell when King Robert came to visit my father Lord Eddard She lowered her big brown eyes and mumbled I’m Arya Stark

Jaime had never paid much attention to Arya Stark but it seemed to him that this girl was older I understand you’re to be married

I am to wed Lord Bolton’s son Ramsay He used to be a Snow but His Grace has made him a Bolton They say he’s very brave I am so happy

Then why do you sound so frightened I wish you joy my lady Jaime turned back to Steelshanks You have the coin you were promised

Aye and we’ve shared it out You have my thanks The northman grinned A Lannister always pays his debts

Always said Jaime with a last glance at the girl He wondered if there was much resemblance Not that it mattered The real Arya Stark was buried in some unmarked grave in Flea Bottom in all likelihood With her brothers dead and both parents who would dare name this one a fraud Good speed he told Steelshanks Nage raised his peace banner and the northmen formed a column as ragged as their fur cloaks and trotted out the castle gate The thin girl on the grey mare looked small and forlorn in their midst

A few of the horses still shied away from the dark splotch on the hard-packed ground where the earth had drunk the life’s blood of the stableboy Gregor Clegane had killed so clumsily The sight of it made Jaime angry all over again He had told his Kingsguard to keep the crowd out of the way but that oaf Ser Boros had let himself be distracted by the duel The fool boy himself shared some of the blame to be sure the dead Dornishman as well And Clegane most of all The blow that took the boy’s arm off had been mischance but that second cut   

Well Gregor is paying for it now Grand Maester Pycelle was tending to the man’s wounds but the howls heard ringing from the maester’s chambers suggested that the healing was not going as well as it might The flesh mortifies and the wounds ooze pus Pycelle told the council Even maggots will not touch such foulness His convulsions are so violent that I have had to gag him to prevent him from biting off his tongue I have cut away as much tissue as I dare and treated the rot with boiling wine and bread mold to no avail The veins in his arm are turning black When I leeched him all the leeches died My lords I must know what malignant substance Prince Oberyn used on his spear Let us detain these other Dornishmen until they are more forthcoming

Lord Tywin had refused him There will be trouble enough with Sunspear over Prince Oberyn’s death I do not mean to make matters worse by holding his companions captive

Then I fear Ser Gregor may die

Undoubtedly I swore as much in the letter I sent to Prince Doran with his brother’s body But it must be seen to be the sword of the King’s Justice that slays him not a poisoned spear Heal him

Grand Maester Pycelle blinked in dismay My lord—

Heal him Lord Tywin said again vexed You are aware that Lord Varys has sent fishermen into the waters around Dragonstone They report that only a token force remains to defend the island The Lyseni are gone from the bay and the great part of Lord Stannis’s strength with them

Well and good announced Pycelle Let Stannis rot in Lys I say We are well rid of the man and his ambitions

Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard This is Stannis Baratheon The man will fight to the bitter end and then some If he is gone it can only mean he intends to resume the war Most likely he will land at Storm’s End and try and rouse the storm lords If so he’s finished But a bolder man might roll the dice for Dorne If he should win Sunspear to his cause he might prolong this war for years So we will not offend the Martells any further for any reason The Dornishmen are free to go and you will heal Ser Gregor

And so the Mountain screamed day and night Lord Tywin Lannister could cow even the Stranger it would seem

As Jaime climbed the winding steps of White Sword Tower he could hear Ser Boros snoring in his cell Ser Balon’s door was shut as well he had the king tonight and would sleep all day Aside from Blount’s snores the tower was very quiet That suited Jaime well enough I ought to rest myself Last night after his dance with Ser Addam he’d been too sore to sleep

But when he stepped into his bedchamber he found his sister waiting for him

She stood beside the open window looking over the curtain walls and out to sea The bay wind swirled around her flattening her gown against her body in a way that quickened Jaime’s pulse It was white that gown like the hangings on the wall and the draperies on his bed Swirls of tiny emeralds brightened the ends of her wide sleeves and spiraled down her bodice Larger emeralds were set in the golden spiderweb that bound her golden hair The gown was cut low to bare her shoulders and the tops of her breasts She is so beautiful He wanted nothing more than to take her in his arms

Cersei He closed the door softly Why are you here

Where else could I go When she turned to him there were tears in her eyes Father’s made it clear that I am no longer wanted on the council Jaime won’t you talk to him

Jaime took off his cloak and hung it from a peg on the wall I talk to Lord Tywin every day

Must you be so stubborn All he wants   

   is to force me from the Kingsguard and send me back to Casterly Rock

That need not be so terrible He is sending me back to Casterly Rock as well He wants me far away so he’ll have a free hand with Tommen Tommen is my son not his

Tommen is the king

He is a boy A frightened little boy who saw his brother murdered at his own wedding And now they are telling him that he must marry The girl is twice his age and twice a widow

He eased himself into a chair trying to ignore the ache of bruised muscles The Tyrells are insisting I see no harm in it Tommen’s been lonely since Myrcella went to Dorne He likes having Margaery and her ladies about Let them wed

He is your son   

He is my seed He’s never called me Father No more than Joffrey ever did You warned me a thousand times never to show any undue interest in them

To keep them safe You as well How would it have looked if my brother had played the father to the king’s children Even Robert might have grown suspicious
