Sandor Clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride Sansa’s chestnut courser The girl was seated behind both arms tight around the Hound’s chest

Tyrion called to her Are you hurt Lady Sansa

Blood was trickling down Sansa’s brow from a deep gash on her scalp They… they were throwing things… rocks and filth eggs… I tried to tell them I had no bread to give them A man tried to pull me from the saddle The Hound killed him I think… his arm… Her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth He cut off his arm

Clegane lifted her to the ground His white cloak was torn and stained and blood seeped through a jagged tear in his left sleeve The little bird’s bleeding Someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut Maester Frenken scurried forward to obey They did for Santagar the Hound continued Four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone I gutted one not that it did Ser Aron much good

Lady Tanda approached him My daughter—

Never saw her The Hound glanced around the yard scowling Where’s my horse If anything’s happened to that horse someone’s going to pay

He was running with us for a time Tyrion said but I don’t know what became of him after that

Fire a voice screamed down from atop the barbican My lords there’s smoke in the city Flea Bottom’s afire

Tyrion was inutterably weary but there was no time for despair Bronn take as many men as you need and see that the water wagons are not molested Gods be good the wildfire if any blaze should reach that…We can lose all of Flea Bottom if we must but on no account must the fire reach the Guildhall of the Alchemists is that understood Clegane you’ll go with him

For half a heartbeat Tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the Hound’s dark eyes Fire he realized The Others take me of course he hates flre he’s tasted it too well The look was gone in an instant replaced by Clegane’s familiar scowl I’ll go he said though not by your command I need to find that horse

Tyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the Kingsguard Each of you will ride escort to a herald Command the people to return to their homes Any man found on the streets after the last peal of the evenfall bell will be killed

Our place is beside the king Ser Meryn said complacent

Cersei reared up like a viper Your place is where my brother says it is she spit The Hand speaks with the king’s own voice and disobedience is treason

Boros and Meryn exchanged a look Should we wear our cloaks Your Grace Ser Boros asked

Go naked for all I care It might remind the mob that you’re men They’re like to have forgotten after seeing the way you behaved out there in the street

Tyrion let his sister rage His head was throbbing He thought he could smell smoke though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying

Two of the Stone Crows guarded the door of the Tower of the Hand Find me Timett son of Timett

Stone Crows do not run squeaking after Burned Men one of the wildlings informed him haughtily

For a moment Tyrion had forgotten who he was dealing with Then find me Shagga

Shagga sleeps

It was an effort not to scream Wake Him

It is no easy thing to wake Shagga son of Dolf the man complained His wrath is fearsome He went off grumbling

The clansman wandered in yawning and scratching Half the city is rioting the other half is burning and Shagga lies snoring Tyrion said

Shagga mislikes your muddy water here so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine and after his head hurts

I have Shae in a manse near the Iron Gate I want you to go to her and keep her safe whatever may come

The huge man smiled his teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of his beard Shagga will fetch her here

Just see that no harm comes to her Tell her I will come to her as soon as I may This very night perhaps or on the morrow for a certainty

Yet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil though Bronn reported that the fires were quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of Shae’s arms he realized he would go nowhere that night

Ser Jacelyn Bywater delivered the butcher’s bill as he was supping on a cold capon and brown bread in the gloom of his solar Dusk had faded to darkness by then but when his servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth Tyrion had roared at them and sent them running His mood was as black as the chamber and Bywater said nothing to lighten it

The list of the slain was topped by the High Septon ripped apart as he squealed to his gods for mercy Starving men take a hard view of priests too fat to walk Tyrion reflected

Ser Preston’s corpse had been overlooked at first the gold cloaks had been searching for a knight in white armor and he had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was red-brown from head to heel

Ser Aron Santagar had been found in a gutter his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm

Lady Tanda’s daughter had surrendered her maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men behind a tanner’s shop The gold cloaks found her wandering naked on Sowbelly Row

Tyrek was still missing as was the High Septon’s crystal crown Nine gold cloaks had been slain two score wounded No one had troubled to count how many of the mob had died

I want Tyrek found alive or dead Tyrion said curtly when Bywater was done He’s no more than a boy Son to my late uncle Tygett His father was always kind to me

We’ll find him The septon’s crown as well

The Others can bugger each other with the septon’s crown for all I care

When you named me to command the Watch you told me you wanted plain truth always

Somehow I have a feeling I am not going to like whatever you’re about to say Tyrion said gloomily

We held the city today my lord but I make no promises for the morrow The kettle is close to boiling So many thieves and murderers are abroad that no man’s house is safe the bloody flux is spreading in the stews along Pisswater Bend there’s no food to be had for copper nor silver Where before you heard only mutterings from the gutter now there’s open talk of treason in guildhalls and markets

Do you need more men

I do not trust half the men I have now Slynt tripled the size of the Watch but it takes more than a gold cloak to make a watchman There are good men and loyal among the new recruits but also more brutes sots cravens and traitors than you’d care to know They’re half-trained and undisciplined and what loyalty they have is to their own skins If it comes to battle they’ll not hold I fear

I never expected them to said Tyrion Once our walls are breeched we are lost I’ve known that from the start

My men are largely drawn from the smallfolk They walk the same streets drink in the same winesinks spoon down their bowls of brown in the same pot-shops Your eunuch must have told you there is small love for the Lannisters in King’s Landing Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city when Aerys opened the gates to him They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House—for your brother’s murder of King Aerys for the butchery of Rhaegar’s children for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey’s justice Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne In pot-shops and winesinks and brothels you hear these things—and in the barracks and guardhalls as well I fear

They hate my family is that what you are telling me

Aye… and will turn on them if the chance comes

Me as well

Ask your eunuch

I’m asking you

Bywater’s deep-set eyes met the dwarf’s mismatched ones and did not blink You most of all my lord
