with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands 2016 Because
they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but
polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols

2017 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither
did I make an end of them in the wilderness

2018 But I said unto their children in the wilderness Walk ye not in
the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor
defile yourselves with their idols 2019 I am the LORD your God walk
in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them 2020 And hallow
my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may
know that I am the LORD your God

2021 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked
not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a
man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then I
said I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger
against them in the wilderness

2022 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names
sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in
whose sight I brought them forth

2023 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that I
would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the
countries 2024 Because they had not executed my judgments but had
despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes
were after their fathers idols

2025 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good and
judgments whereby they should not live 2026 And I polluted them in
their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that
openeth the womb that I might make them desolate to the end that
they might know that I am the LORD

2027 Therefore son of man speak unto the house of Israel and say
unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD Yet in this your fathers have
blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me

2028 For when I had brought them into the land for the which I
lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill
and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and
there they presented the provocation of their offering there also
they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink
offerings

2029 Then I said unto them What is the high place whereunto ye go
And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day

2030 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel Thus saith the Lord GOD
Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye
whoredom after their abominations  2031 For when ye offer your
gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute
yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall I be
enquired of by you O house of Israel As I live saith the Lord GOD
I will not be enquired of by you

2032 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that
ye say We will be as the heathen as the families of the countries
to serve wood and stone

2033 As I live saith the Lord GOD surely with a mighty hand and
with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will I rule over
you 2034 And I will bring you out from the people and will gather
you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand
and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out

2035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people and
there will I plead with you face to face

2036 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
land of Egypt so will I plead with you saith the Lord GOD

2037 And I will cause you to pass under the rod and I will bring you
into the bond of the covenant 2038 And I will purge out from among
you the rebels and them that transgress against me I will bring them
forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter
into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the LORD

2039 As for you O house of Israel thus saith the Lord GOD Go ye
serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not
hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts
and with your idols

2040 For in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of
Israel saith the Lord GOD there shall all the house of Israel all
of them in the land serve me there will I accept them and there
will I require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations
with all your holy things

2041 I will accept you with your sweet savour when I bring you out
from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have
been scattered and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen

2042 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I shall bring you
into the land of Israel into the country for the which I lifted up
mine hand to give it to your fathers

2043 And there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings
