none else

440 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments
which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with
thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon
the earth which the LORD thy God giveth thee for ever

441 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
sunrising 442 That the slayer might flee thither which should kill
his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live 443 Namely Bezer in
the wilderness in the plain country of the Reubenites and Ramoth in
Gilead of the Gadites and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites

444 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
Israel 445 These are the testimonies and the statutes and the
judgments which Moses spake unto the children of Israel after they
came forth out of Egypt

446 On this side Jordan in the valley over against Bethpeor in the
land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt at Heshbon whom Moses
and the children of Israel smote after they were come forth out of
Egypt 447 And they possessed his land and the land of Og king of
Bashan two kings of the Amorites which were on this side Jordan
toward the sunrising 448 From Aroer which is by the bank of the
river Arnon even unto mount Sion which is Hermon 449 And all the
plain on this side Jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain
under the springs of Pisgah

51 And Moses called all Israel and said unto them Hear O Israel
the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day that
ye may learn them and keep and do them

52 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb

53 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers but with us
even us who are all of us here alive this day

54 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
midst of the fire 55 I stood between the LORD and you at that time
to shew you the word of the LORD for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire and went not up into the mount saying 56 I am the LORD thy
God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of
bondage

57 Thou shalt have none other gods before me

58 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or
that is in the waters beneath the earth 59 Thou shalt not bow down
thyself unto them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous
God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me 510 And shewing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments

511 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the
LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain

512 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee

513 Six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work 514 But the
seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God in it thou shalt not
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant
nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy
cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou

515 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt and
that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand
and by a stretched out arm therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee
to keep the sabbath day

516 Honour thy father and thy mother as the LORD thy God hath
commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go
well with thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee

517 Thou shalt not kill

518 Neither shalt thou commit adultery

519 Neither shalt thou steal

520 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour

521 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shalt
thou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or his
maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbours

522 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness
with a great voice and he added no more And he wrote them in two
tables of stone and delivered them unto me

523 And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near
unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders 524 And
ye said Behold the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire
we have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth
