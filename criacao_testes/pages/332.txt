The next day dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop A city Khaleesi they cried A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid An hour’s ride no more

Show me she said

When the city appeared before her its walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil of heat it looked so beautiful that Dany was certain it must be a mirage Do you know what place this might be Ser Jorah

The exile knight gave a weary shake of the head No my queen I have never traveled this far east

The distant white walls promised rest and safety a chance to heal and grow strong and Dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward them Instead she turned to her bloodriders Blood of my blood go ahead of us and learn the name of this city and what manner of welcome we should expect

Ai Khaleesi said Aggo

Her riders were not long in returning Rakharo swung down from his saddle From his medallion belt hung the great curving arakh that Dany had bestowed on him when she named him bloodrider This city is dead Khaleesi Nameless and godless we found it the gates broken only wind and flies moving through the streets

Jhiqui shuddered When the gods are gone the evil ghosts feast by night Such places are best shunned It is known

It is known Irri agreed

Not to me Dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way trotting beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street Ser Jorah and her bloodriders followed and then more slowly the rest of the Dothraki

How long the city had been deserted she could not know but the white walls so beautiful from afar were cracked and crumbling when seen up close Inside was a maze of narrow crooked alleys The buildings pressed close their facades blank chalky windowless Everything was white as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color They rode past heaps of sun-washed rubble where houses had fallen in and elsewhere saw the faded scars of fire At a place where six alleys came together Dany passed an empty marble plinth Dothraki had visited this place before it would seem Perhaps even now the missing statue stood among the other stolen gods in Vaes Dothrak She might have ridden past it a hundred times never knowing On her shoulder Viserion hissed

They made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace on a windswept plaza where devilgrass grew between the paving stones Dany sent out men to search the ruins Some went reluctantly yet they went… and one scarred old man returned a brief time later hopping and grinning his hands overflowing with figs They were small withered things yet her people grabbed for them greedily jostling and pushing at each other stuffing the fruit into their cheeks and chewing blissfully

Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees hidden behind closed doors in secret gardens Aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold Yet they found bones too the skulls of the unburied dead bleached and broken Ghosts Irri muttered Terrible ghosts We must not stay here Khaleesi this is their place

I fear no ghosts Dragons are more powerful than ghosts And figs are more important Go with Jhiqui and find me some clean sand for a bath and trouble me no more with silly talk

In the coolness of her tent Dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her choices There was food and water here to sustain them and enough grass for the horses to regain their strength How pleasant it would be to wake every day in the same place to linger among shady gardens eat figs and drink cool water as much as she might desire

When Irri and Jhiqui returned with pots of white sand Dany stripped and let them scrub her clean Your hair is coming back Khaleesi Jhiqui said as she scraped sand off her back Dany ran a hand over the top of her head feeling the new growth Dothraki men wore their hair in long oiled braids and cut them only when defeated Perhaps I should do the same she thought to remind them that Drogo’s strength lives within me now Khal Drogo had died with his hair uncut a boast few men could make

Across the tent Rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half foot before thumping to the carpet When he landed his tail lashed back and forth in fury and he raised his head and screamed If I had wings I would want to fly too Dany thought The Targaryens of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war She tried to imagine what it would feel like to straddle a dragon’s neck and soar high into the air It would be like standing on a mountaintop only better The whole world would be spread out below If I flew high enough I could even see the Seven Kingdoms and reach up and touch the comet

Irri broke her reverie to tell her that Ser Jorah Mormont was outside awaiting her pleasure Send him in Dany commanded sand-scrubbed skin tingling She wrapped herself in the lionskin The hrakkar had been much bigger than Dany so the pelt covered everything that wanted covering

I’ve brought you a peach Ser Jorah said kneeling It was so small she could almost hide it in her palm and overripe too but when she took the first bite the flesh was so sweet she almost cried She ate it slowly savoring every mouthful while Ser Jorah told her of the tree it had been plucked from in a garden near the western wall

Fruit and water and shade Dany said her cheeks sticky with peach juice The gods were good to bring us to this place

We should rest here until we are stronger the knight urged The red lands are not kind to the weak

My handmaids say there are ghosts here

There are ghosts everywhere Ser Jorah said softly We carry them with us wherever we go

Yes she thought Viserys Khal Drogo my son Rhaego they are with me always Tell me the name of your ghost Jorah You know all of mine

His face grew very still Her name was Lynesse

Your wife

My second wife
