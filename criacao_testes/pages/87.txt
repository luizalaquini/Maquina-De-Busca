Even then Ser Alliser would not call an end On your feet Ser Piggy he called Pick up your sword When the boy continued to cling to the ground Thorne gestured to Halder Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe’s upraised cheeks You can hit harder than that Thorne taunted Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather even on the flat The new boy screeched in pain

Jon Snow took a step forward Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm Jon no the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne

On your feet Thorne repeated The fat boy struggled to rise slipped and fell heavily again Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion Ser Alliser observed Again

Halder lifted the sword for another blow Cut us off a ham Rast urged laughing

Jon shook off Pyp’s hand Halder enough

Halder looked to Ser Alliser

The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble the master-at-arms said in that sharp cold voice of his I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here Lord Snow

Look at him Halder Jon urged ignoring Thorne as best he could There’s no honor in beating a fallen foe He yielded He knelt beside the fat boy

Halder lowered his sword He yielded he echoed

Ser Alliser’s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow It would seem our Bastard is in love he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet Show me your steel Lord Snow

Jon drew his longsword He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point and he feared he was well beyond it now

Thorne smiled The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love so we shall make an exercise of it Rat Pimple help our Stone Head here Rast and Albett moved to join Halder Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal All you need do is get past the Bastard

Stay behind me Jon said to the fat boy Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him but never three He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight He braced himself for the assault

Suddenly Pyp was beside him Three to two will make for better sport the small boy said cheerfully He dropped his visor and slid out his sword Before Jon could even think to protest Grenn had stepped up to make a third

The yard had grown deathly quiet Jon could feel Ser Alliser’s eyes Why are you waiting he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft but it was Jon who moved first Halder barely got his sword up in time

Jon drove him backward attacking with every blow keeping the older boy on the heels Know your foe Ser Rodrik had taught him once Jon knew Halder brutally strong but short of patience with no taste for defense Frustrate him and he would leave himself open as certain as sunset

The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him Jon blocked a savage cut at his head the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together He slammed a sidestroke into Halder’s ribs and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder Chainmail crunched and pain flared up his neck but for an instant Halder was unbalanced Jon cut his left leg from under him and he fell with a curse and a crash

Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him giving Albett more than he cared for but Pyp was hard-pressed Rast had two years and forty pounds on him Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper’s helm like a bell As Rast went reeling Pyp slid in under his guard knocked him down and leveled a blade at his throat By then Jon had moved on Facing two swords Albett backed away I yield he shouted

Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust The mummer’s farce has gone on long enough for today He walked away The session was at an end

Dareon helped Halder to his feet The quarryman’s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard For an instant I thought I finally had you Snow

For an instant you did Jon replied Under his mail and leather his shoulder was throbbing He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm but when he raised his arm the pain made him grit his teeth

Let me a voice said Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently Did he hurt you

I’ve been bruised before He touched his shoulder and winced The yard was emptying around them

Blood matted the fat boy’s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder My name is Samwell Tarly of Horn… He stopped and licked his lips I mean I was of Horn Hill until I… left I’ve come to take the black My father is Lord Randyll a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden I used to be his heir only… His voice trailed off

I’m Jon Snow Ned Stark’s bastard of Winterfell

Samwell Tarly nodded I… if you want you can call me Sam My mother calls me Sam

You can call him Lord Snow Pyp said as he came up to join them You don’t want to know what his mother calls him
