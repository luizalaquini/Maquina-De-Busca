granular noise condition
LE nnnn
Despite these adaptive equations the step size should be constrained to
lie between a predetermined fixed maximum and minimum to prevent it from
becoming so large or so small that rapid accomodation to changing input signals is
impossible
Then in a period of potential slope overload the step size will grow preventing
overload possibly to its maximum value when overload may resume  In a quiet
period it will decrease to its minimum value which determines the granular
noise in the idle condition  Note that the step size need not be stored for
it can be deduced from the bit changes in the digitized data  Although
adaptation improves the performance of delta modulation it is still inferior to
PCM at telephone qualities
rh Summary
It seems that ADPCM with
adaptive quantization and adaptive prediction can provide a worthwhile
advantage for speech storage reducing the number of bits needed per sample of
telephone-quality speech from 7 for logarithmic PCM to perhaps 5 and the data
rate from 56 Kbits to 40 Kbits  Disadvantages are additional complexity
in the encoding and decoding processes and the fact that byte-oriented storage
with 8 bitssample in logarithmic PCM is more convenient for computer use
For low quality speech where hardware complexity is to be minimized
adaptive delta modulation could provide worthwhile em although the ready
availability of PCM codec chips reduces the cost advantage

Probably the best single reference on time-domain coding of speech is
the book by Rabiner and Schafer 1978 cited above
However this does not contain a great deal of information on practical
aspects of the analogue-to-digital conversion process this is
covered by Blesser 1978 above who is especially interested in
high-quality conversion for digital audio applications
and Garrett 1978 below
There are many textbooks in the telecommunications area which
are relevant to the subject of the chapter
although they concentrate primarily on fundamental theoretical aspects rather
than the practical application of the technology
