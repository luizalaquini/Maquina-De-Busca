The third big advantage of speech output is that it is potentially very cheap
Being all-electronic except for the loudspeaker speech systems are well
suited to high-volume low-cost LSI manufacture  Other computer output
devices are at present tied either to mechanical moving parts or to the CRT
This was realized quickly by the computer hobbies market where speech output
peripherals have been selling like hot cakes since the mid 1970s
pp
A further point in favour of speech is that it is natural-seeming and
somehow cuddly when compared with printers or VDUs  It would have been much
more difficult to make this point before the advent of talking toys like
Texas Instruments Speak n Spell in 1978 but now it is an accepted fact that friendly
computer-based gadgets can speak em there are talking pocket-watches
that really do tell the time talking microwave ovens talking pinball machines and
of course talking calculators
It is however difficult to assess whether the appeal stems from
mechanical speechs novelty em it
is still a gimmick em and also to what extent it is tied up with
economic factors
After all most of the population dont use high-quality VDUs and their major
experience of real-time interactive computing is through the very limited displays
and keypads provided on video games and teletext systems

Articles on speech communication with computers often list many more advantages of voice output

can be used in the dark
NP
can be varied from a confidential whisper to a loud shout
NP
requires very little energy
NP
is not appreciably affected by weightlessness or vibration

However these either derive from the three advantages we have discussed above
or relate
mainly to exotic applications in space modules and divers helmets

Useful as it is at present speech output would be even more attractive if it could
be coupled with speech input  In many ways speech input is its big brother
Many of the benefits of speech output are even more striking for speech input
Although people can assimilate information faster through the eyes than the
ears the majority of us can generate information faster with the mouth than
with the hands  Rapid typing is a relatively uncommon skill and even high
typing rates are much slower than speaking rates although whether we can
originate ideas quickly enough to keep up with fast speech is another matter  To
take full advantage of the telephone for interaction with machines machine
recognition of speech is obviously necessary  A microwave oven calculator
pinball machine or alarm clock that responds to spoken commands is certainly
more attractive than one that just generates spoken status messages  A book
that told you how to recognize speech by machine would undoubtedly be more
useful than one like this that just discusses how to synthesize it  But the
technology of speech recognition is nowhere near as advanced as that of
synthesis em its a much more difficult problem  However because speech input
is obviously complementary to speech output and even very limited input
capabilities will greatly enhance many speech output systems it is worth
summarizing the present state of the art of speech recognition
pp
Commercial speech recognizers do exist  Almost invariably they accept
words spoken in isolation with gaps of silence between them rather than
connected utterances
It is not difficult to discriminate with high accuracy up to a hundred
different words spoken by the same speaker especially if the vocabulary
is carefully selected to avoid words which sound similar  If several
different speakers are to be comprehended performance can be greatly improved
if the machine is given an opportunity to calibrate their voices in a training
session and is informed at recognition time which one is to speak
With a large population of unknown speakers accurate recognition is difficult
for vocabularies of more than a few carefully-chosen words
pp
A half-way house between isolated word discrimination and recognition of connected
speech is the problem of spotting known words in continuous speech  This
allows much more natural input if the dialogue is structured as keywords
which may be
interspersed by unimportant noise words  To speak in truly isolated
words requires a great deal of self-discipline and concentration em it is
surprising how much of ordinary speech is accounted for by vague sounds
like ums and aahs and false starts  Word spotting disregards these and so
permits a more relaxed style of speech  Some progress has been made on it in
research laboratories but the vocabularies that can be accomodated are still
very small
pp
The difficulty of recognizing connected speech depends crucially on what is
known in advance about the dialogue  its pragmatic semantic and syntactic
constraints  Highly structured dialogues constrain very heavily the choice of
the next word  Recognizers which can deal with vocabularies of over 1000 words
have been built in research laboratories but the structure of the input has
been such that the average branching factor em the size of the set out of
which the next word must be selected em is only around 10 Lea 1980
