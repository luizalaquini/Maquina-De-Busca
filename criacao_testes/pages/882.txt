Jaime looked at the long line of wayns carts and laden horses Yet they still line up to pay

There’s good coin to be made here now that the fighting’s done the miller in the nearest wagon told them cheerfully It’s the Lannisters hold the city now old Lord Tywin of the Rock They say he shits silver

Gold Jaime corrected dryly And Littlefinger mints the stuff from goldenrod I vow

The Imp is master of coin now said the captain of the gate Or was till they arrested him for murdering the king The man looked the northmen over suspiciously Who are you lot

Lord Bolton’s men come to see the King’s Hand

The captain glanced at Nage with his peace banner Come to bend the knee you mean You’re not the first Go straight up to the castle and see you make no trouble He waved them through and turned back to the wagons

If King’s Landing mourned its dead boy king Jaime would never have known it On the Street of Seeds a begging brother in threadbare robes was praying loudly for Joffrey’s soul but the passersby paid him no more heed than they would a loose shutter banging in the wind Elsewhere milled the usual crowds gold cloaks in their black mail bakers’ boys selling tarts and breads and hot pies whores leaning out of windows with their bodices half unlaced gutters redolent of nightsoil They passed five men trying to drag a dead horse from the mouth of an alley and elsewhere a juggler spinning knives through the air to delight a throng of drunken Tyrell soldiers and small children

Riding down familiar streets with two hundred northmen a chainless maester and an ugly freak of a woman at his side Jaime found he scarcely drew a second look He did not know whether he ought to be amused or annoyed They do not know me he said to Steelshanks as they rode through Cobbler’s Square

Your face is changed and your arms as well the northman said and they have a new Kingslayer now

The gates to the Red Keep were open but a dozen gold cloaks armed with pikes barred the way They lowered their points as Steelshanks came trotting up but Jaime recognized the white knight commanding them Ser Meryn

Ser Meryn Trant’s droopy eyes went wide Ser Jaime

How nice to be remembered Move these men aside

It had been a long time since anyone had leapt to obey him quite so fast Jaime had forgotten how well he liked it

They found two more Kingsguard in the outer ward two who had not worn white cloaks when Jaime last served here How like Cersei to name me Lord Commander and then choose my colleagues without consulting me Someone has given me two new brothers I see he said as he dismounted

We have that honor ser The Knight of Flowers shone so fine and pure in his white scales and silk that Jaime felt a tattered and tawdry thing by contrast

Jaime turned to Meryn Trant Ser you’ve been remiss in teaching our new brothers their duties

What duties said Meryn Trant defensively

Keeping the king alive How many monarchs have you lost since I left the city Two is it

Then Ser Balon saw the stump Your hand…

Jaime made himself smile I fight with my left now It makes for more of a contest Where will I find my lord father

In the solar with Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn

Mace Tyrell and the Red Viper breaking bread together Strange and stranger Is the queen with them as well

No my lord Ser Balon answered You’ll find her in the sept praying over King Joff—

You

The last of the northmen had dismounted Jaime saw and now Loras Tyrell had seen Brienne

Ser Loras She stood stupidly holding her bridle

Loras Tyrell strode toward her Why he said You will tell me why He treated you kindly gave you a rainbow cloak Why would you kill him
