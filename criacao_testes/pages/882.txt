and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob

747 But Solomon built him an house

748 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands as
saith the prophet 749 Heaven is my throne and earth is my
footstool what house will ye build me saith the Lord or what is the
place of my rest  750 Hath not my hand made all these things  751
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye

752 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they
have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One of
whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers 753 Who have
received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it

754 When they heard these things they were cut to the heart and
they gnashed on him with their teeth

755 But he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up stedfastly into
heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand
of God 756 And said Behold I see the heavens opened and the Son
of man standing on the right hand of God

757 Then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears
and ran upon him with one accord 758 And cast him out of the city
and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young
mans feet whose name was Saul

759 And they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord
Jesus receive my spirit

760 And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not
this sin to their charge And when he had said this he fell asleep

81 And Saul was consenting unto his death And at that time there was
a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and
they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and
Samaria except the apostles

82 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great
lamentation over him

83 As for Saul he made havock of the church entering into every
house and haling men and women committed them to prison

84 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word

85 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ
unto them

86 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did

87 For unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that
were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were
lame were healed

88 And there was great joy in that city

89 But there was a certain man called Simon which beforetime in the
same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving
out that himself was some great one 810 To whom they all gave heed
from the least to the greatest saying This man is the great power of
God

811 And to him they had regard because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries

812 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both
men and women

813 Then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he
continued with Philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs
which were done

814 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John 815
Who when they were come down prayed for them that they might
receive the Holy Ghost 816 For as yet he was fallen upon none of
them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus  817
Then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost

818 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands
the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money 819 Saying Give me
also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the
Holy Ghost

820 But Peter said unto him Thy money perish with thee because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money

821 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is
not right in the sight of God

822 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee

823 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in
