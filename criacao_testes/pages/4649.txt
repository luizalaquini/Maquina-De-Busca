Perhaps they did The mystery knight dipped his lance before the king and rode to the end of the lists where the five champions had their pavilions You know the three he challenged

The porcupine knight the pitchfork knight and the knight of the twin towers Bran had heard enough stories to know that He was the little crannogman I told you

Whoever he was the old gods gave strength to his arm The porcupine knight fell first then the pitchfork knight and lastly the knight of the two towers None were well loved so the common folk cheered lustily for the Knight of the Laughing Tree as the new champion soon was called When his fallen foes sought to ransom horse and armor the Knight of the Laughing Tree spoke in a booming voice through his helm saying ‘Teach your squires honor that shall be ransom enough’ Once the defeated knights chastised their squires sharply their horses and armor were returned And so the little crannogman’s prayer was answered    by the green men or the old gods or the children of the forest who can say

It was a good story Bran decided after thinking about it a moment or two Then what happened Did the Knight of the Laughing Tree win the tourney and marry a princess

No said Meera That night at the great castle the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore they would unmask him and the king himself urged men to challenge him declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his But the next morning when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat only two champions appeared The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished The king was wroth and even sent his son the dragon prince to seek the man but all they ever found was his painted shield hanging abandoned in a tree It was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end

Oh Bran thought about the tale awhile That was a good story But it should have been the three bad knights who hurt him not their squires Then the little crannogman could have killed them all The part about the ransoms was stupid And the mystery knight should win the tourney defeating every challenger and name the wolf maid the queen of love and beauty

She was said Meera but that’s a sadder story

Are you certain you never heard this tale before Bran asked Jojen Your lord father never told it to you

Bran shook his head The day was growing old by then and long shadows were creeping down the mountainsides to send black fingers through the pines If the little crannogman could visit the Isle of Faces maybe I could too All the tales agreed that the green men had strange magic powers Maybe they could help him walk again even turn him into a knight They turned the little crannogman into a knight even if it was only for a day he thought A day would be enough





DAVOS

The cell was warmer than any cell had a right to be

It was dark yes Flickering orange light fell through the ancient iron bars from the torch in the sconce on the wall outside but the back half of the cell remained drenched in gloom It was dank as well as might be expected on an isle such as Dragonstone where the sea was never far And there were rats as many as any dungeon could expect to have and a few more besides

But Davos could not complain of chill The smooth stony passages beneath the great mass of Dragonstone were always warm and Davos had often heard it said they grew warmer the farther down one went He was well below the castle he judged and the wall of his cell often felt warm to his touch when he pressed a palm against it Perhaps the old tales were true and Dragonstone was built with the stones of hell

He was sick when they first brought him here The cough that had plagued him since the battle grew worse and a fever took hold of him as well His lips broke with blood blisters and the warmth of the cell did not stop his shivering I will not linger long he remembered thinking I will die soon here in the dark

Davos soon found that he was wrong about that as about so much else Dimly he remembered gentle hands and a firm voice and young Maester Pylos looking down on him He was given hot garlic broth to drink and milk of the poppy to take away his aches and shivers The poppy made him sleep and while he slept they leeched him to drain off the bad blood Or so he surmised by the leech marks on his arms when he woke Before very long the coughing stopped the blisters vanished and his broth had chunks of whitefish in it and carrots and onions as well And one day he realized that he felt stronger than he had since Black Betha shattered beneath him and flung him in the river

He had two gaolers to tend him One was broad and squat with thick shoulders and huge strong hands He wore a leather brigantine dotted with iron studs and once a day brought Davos a bowl of oaten porridge Sometimes he sweetened it with honey or poured in a bit of milk The other gaoler was older stooped and sallow with greasy unwashed hair and pebbled skin He wore a doublet of white velvet with a ring of stars worked upon the breast in golden thread It fit him badly being both too short and too loose and was soiled and torn besides He would bring Davos plates of meat and mash or fish stew and once even half a lamprey pie The lamprey was so rich he could not keep it down but even so it was a rare treat for a prisoner in a dungeon

Neither sun nor moon shone in the dungeons no windows pierced the thick stone walls The only way to tell day from night was by his gaolers Neither man would speak to him though he knew they were no mutes sometimes he heard them exchange a few brusque words as the watch was changing They would not even tell him their names so he gave them names of his own The short strong one he called Porridge the stooped sallow one Lamprey for the pie He marked the passage of days by the meals they brought and by the changing of the torches in the sconce outside his cell

A man grows lonely in the dark and hungers for the sound of a human voice Davos would talk to the gaolers whenever they came to his cell whether to bring him food or change his slops pail He knew they would be deaf to pleas for freedom or mercy instead he asked them questions hoping perhaps one day one might answer What news of the war he asked and Is the king well He asked after his son Devan and the Princess Shireen and Salladhor Saan What is the weather like he asked and Have the autumn storms begun yet Do ships still sail the narrow sea

It made no matter what he asked they never answered though sometimes Porridge gave him a look and for half a heartbeat Davos would think that he was about to speak With Lamprey there was not even that much I am not a man to him Davos thought only a stone that eats and shits and speaks He decided after a while that he liked Porridge much the better Porridge at least seemed to know he was alive and there was a queer sort of kindness to the man Davos suspected that he fed the rats that was why there were so many Once he thought he heard the gaoler talking to them as if they were children but perhaps he’d only dreamed that

They do not mean to let me die he realized They are keeping me alive for some purpose of their own He did not like to think what that might be Lord Sunglass had been confined in the cells beneath Dragonstone for a time as had Ser Hubard Rambton’s sons all of them had ended on the pyre I should have given myself to the sea Davos thought as he sat staring at the torch beyond the bars Or let the sail pass me by to perish on my rock I would sooner feed crabs than flames

Then one night as he was finishing his supper Davos felt a queer flush come over him He glanced up through the bars and there she stood in shimmering scarlet with her great ruby at her throat her red eyes gleaming as bright as the torch that bathed her Melisandre he said with a calm he did not feel

Onion Knight she replied just as calmly as if the two of them had met on a stair or in the yard and were exchanging polite greetings Are you well

Better than I was

Do you lack for anything

My king My son I lack for them He pushed the bowl aside and stood Have you come to burn me

Her strange red eyes studied him through the bars This is a bad place is it not A dark place and foul The good sun does not shine here nor the bright moon She lifted a hand toward the torch in the wall sconce This is all that stands between you and the darkness Onion Knight This little fire this gift of R’hllor Shall I put it out

No He moved toward the bars Please He did not think he could bear that to be left alone in utter blackness with no one but the rats for company

The red woman’s lips curved upward in a smile So you have come to love the fire it would seem

I need the torch His hands opened and closed I will not beg her I will not

I am like this torch Ser Davos We are both instruments of R’hllor We were made for a single purpose—to keep the darkness at bay Do you believe that

No Perhaps he should have lied and told her what she wanted to hear but Davos was too accustomed to speaking truth You are the mother of darkness I saw that under Storm’s End when you gave birth before my eyes

Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow Take heart then Shadows only live when given birth by light and the king’s fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son It might well kill him Melisandre moved closer With another man though    a man whose flames still burn hot and high    if you truly wish to serve your king’s cause come to my chamber one night I could give you pleasure such as you have never known and with your life-fire I could make   

   a horror Davos retreated from her I want no part of you my lady Or your god May the Seven protect me

Melisandre sighed They did not protect Guncer Sunglass He prayed thrice each day and bore seven seven-pointed stars upon his shield but when R’hllor reached out his hand his prayers turned to screams and he burned Why cling to these false gods

I have worshiped them all my life

All your life Davos Seaworth As well say it was so yesterday She shook her head sadly You have never feared to speak the truth to kings why do you lie to yourself Open your eyes ser knight

What is it you would have me see

The way the world is made The truth is all around you plain to behold The night is dark and full of terrors the day bright and beautiful and full of hope One is black the other white There is ice and there is fire Hate and love Bitter and sweet Male and female Pain and pleasure Winter and summer Evil and good She took a step toward him Death and life Everywhere opposites Everywhere the war

The war asked Davos

The war she affirmed There are two Onion Knight Not seven not one not a hundred or a thousand Two Do you think I crossed half the world to put yet another vain king on yet another empty throne The war has been waged since time began and before it is done all men must choose where they will stand On one side is R’hllor the Lord of Light the Heart of Fire the God of Flame and Shadow Against him stands the Great Other whose name may not be spoken the Lord of Darkness the Soul of Ice the God of Night and Terror Ours is not a choice between Baratheon and Lannister between Greyjoy and Stark It is death we choose or life Darkness or light She clasped the bars of his cell with her slender white hands The great ruby at her throat seemed to pulse with its own radiance So tell me Ser Davos Seaworth and tell me truly—does your heart burn with the shining light of R’hllor Or is it black and cold and full of worms She reached through the bars and laid three fingers upon his breast as if to feel the truth of him through flesh and wool and leather

My heart Davos said slowly is full of doubts

Melisandre sighed Ahhhh Davos The good knight is honest to the last even in his day of darkness It is well you did not lie to me I would have known The Other’s servants oft hide black hearts in gaudy light so R’hllor gives his priests the power to see through falsehoods She stepped lightly away from the cell Why did you mean to kill me

I will tell you said Davos if you will tell me who betrayed me It could only have been Salladhor Saan and yet even now he prayed it was not so

The red woman laughed No one betrayed you onion knight I saw your purpose in my flames

The flames If you can see the future in these flames how is it that we burned upon the Blackwater You gave my sons to the fire    my sons my ship my men all burning   

Melisandre shook her head You wrong me onion knight Those were no fires of mine Had I been with you your battle would have had a different ending But His Grace was surrounded by unbelievers and his pride proved stronger than his faith His punishment was grievous but he has learned from his mistake

Were my sons no more than a lesson for a king then Davos felt his mouth tighten

It is night in your Seven Kingdoms now the red woman went on but soon the sun will rise again The war continues Davos Seaworth and some will soon learn that even an ember in the ashes can still ignite a great blaze The old maester looked at Stannis and saw only a man You see a king You are both wrong He is the Lord’s chosen the warrior of fire I have seen him leading the fight against the dark I have seen it in the flames The flames do not lie else you would not be here It is written in prophecy as well When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone The bleeding star has come and gone and Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai reborn Her red eyes blazed like twin fires and seemed to stare deep into his soul You do not believe me You doubt the truth of R’hllor even now    yet have served him all the same and will serve him again I shall leave you here to think on all that I have told you And because R’hllor is the source of all good I shall leave the torch as well
