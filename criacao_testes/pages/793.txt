Grey gloom filled the tower and slowly changed to darkness Hodor grew restless and walked awhile striding round and round the walls and stopping to peer into the privy on every circuit as if he had forgotten what was in there Jojen stood by the north balcony hidden by the shadows looking out at the night and the rain Somewhere to the north a lightning bolt crackled across the sky brightening the inside of the tower for an instant Hodor jumped and made a frightened noise Bran counted to eight waiting for the thunder When it came Hodor shouted Hodor

I hope Summer isn’t scared too Bran thought The dogs in Winterfell’s kennels had always been spooked by thunderstorms just like Hodor I should go see to calm him…

The lightning flashed again and this time the thunder came at six Hodor Hodor yelled again HODOR HODOR He snatched up his sword as if to fight the storm

Jojen said Be quiet Hodor Bran tell him not to shout Can you get the sword away from him Meera

I can try

Hodor hush said Bran Be quiet now No more stupid hodoring Sit down

Hodor He gave the longsword to Meera meekly enough but his face was a mask of confusion

Jojen turned back to the darkness and they all heard him suck in his breath What is it Meera asked

Men in the village

The man we saw before

Other men Armed I saw an axe and spears as well Joien had never sounded so much like the boy he was I saw them when the lightning flashed moving under the trees

How many

Many and more Too many to count

Mounted

No

Hodor Hodor sounded frightened Hodor Hodor

Bran felt a little scared himself though he didn’t want to say so in front of Meera What if they come out here

They won’t She sat down beside him Why should they

For shelter Jojen’s voice was grim Unless the storm lets up Meera could you go down and bar the door

I couldn’t even close it The wood’s too warped They won’t get past those iron gates though

They might They could break the lock or the hinges Or climb up through the murder hole as we did

Lightning slashed the sky and Hodor whimpered Then a clap of thunder rolled across the lake HODOR he roared clapping his hands over his ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness HODOR HODOR HODOR

NO Bran shouted back NO HODORING

It did no good HOOOODOR moaned Hodor Meera tried to catch him and calm him but he was too strong He flung her aside with no more than a shrug HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again and even Jojen was shouting now shouting at Bran and Meera to shut him up

Be quiet Bran said in a shrill scared voice reaching up uselessly for Hodor’s leg as he crashed past reaching reaching

Hodor staggered and closed his mouth He shook his head slowly from side to side sank back to the floor and sat crosslegged When the thunder boomed he scarcely seemed to hear it The four of them sat in the dark tower scarce daring to breathe

Bran what did you do Meera whispered
