The singer rose to his feet I’m Mance Rayder he said as he put aside the lute And you are Ned Stark’s bastard the Snow of Winterfell 

Stunned Jon stood speechless for a moment before he recovered enough to say How… how could you know…

That’s a tale for later said Mance Rayder How did you like the song lad

Well enough I’d heard it before

But what does it matter for all men must die the King-beyond-the-Wall said lightly and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife Tell me does my Lord of Bones speak truly Did you slay my old friend the Halffiand

I did Though it was his doing more than mine

The Shadow Tower will never again seem as fearsome the king said with sadness in his voice Qhorin was my enemy But also my brother once So… shall I thank you for killing him Jon Snow Or curse you He gave Jon a mocking smile

The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king nor even much a wildling He was of middling height slender sharp-faced with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey There was no crown on his head no gold rings on his arms no jewels at his throat not even a gleam of silver He wore wool and leather and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak its long tears patched with faded red silk

You ought to thank me for killing your enemy Jon said finally and curse me for killing your friend

Har boomed the white-bearded man Well answered

Agreed Mance Rayder beckoned Jon closer If you would join us you’d best know us The man you took for me is Styr Magnar of Thenn Magnar means ‘lord’ in the Old Tongue The earless man stared at Jon coldly as Mance turned to the white-bearded one Our ferocious chicken-eater here is my loyal Tormund The woman—

Tormund rose to his feet Hold You gave Styr his style give me mine

Mance Rayder laughed As you wish Jon Snow before you stands Tormund Giantsbane Tall-talker Horn-blower and Breaker of Ice And here also Tormund Thunderfist Husband to Bears the Mead-king of Ruddy Hall Speaker to Gods and Father of Hosts

That sounds more like me said Tormund Well met Jon Snow I am fond o’ wargs as it happens though not o’ Starks

The good woman at the brazier Mance Rayder went on is Dalla The pregnant woman smiled shyly Treat her like you would any queen she is carrying my child He turned to the last two This beauty is her sister Val Young Jarl beside her is her latest pet

I am no man’s pet said Jarl dark and fierce

And Val’s no man white-bearded Tormund snorted You ought to have noticed that by now lad

So there you have us Jon Snow said Mance Rayder The King-beyond-the-Wall and his court such as it is And now some words from you I think Where did you come from

Winterfell he said by way of Castle Black

And what brings you up the Milkwater so far from the fires of home He did not wait for Jon’s answer but looked at once to Rattleshirt How many were they

Five Three’s dead and the boy’s here T’other went up a mountainside where no horse could follow

Rayder’s eyes met Jon’s again Was it only the five of you Or are more of your brothers skulking about

We were four and the Halfhand Qhorin was worth twenty common men

The King-beyond-the-Wall smiled at that Some thought so Still… a boy from Castle Black with rangers from the Shadow Tower How did that come to be

Jon had his lie all ready The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning so he took me on his ranging

Styr the Magnar frowned at that Ranging you call it… why would crows come ranging up the Skirling Pass

The villages were deserted Jon said truthfully It was as if all the free folk had vanished
