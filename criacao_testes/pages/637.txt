lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the
ground

2534 Howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes
ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your
dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant
vessel

2535 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal
of the flock to escape

2536 A voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the
principal of the flock shall be heard for the LORD hath spoiled
their pasture

2537 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
anger of the LORD

2538 He hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is
desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of
his fierce anger

261 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of Judah came this word from the LORD saying 262 Thus saith the
LORD Stand in the court of the LORDs house and speak unto all the
cities of Judah which come to worship in the LORDs house all the
words that I command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word
263 If so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way
that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them
because of the evil of their doings

264 And thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD If ye will not
hearken to me to walk in my law which I have set before you 265 To
hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto
you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not
hearkened 266 Then will I make this house like Shiloh and will make
this city a curse to all the nations of the earth

267 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the LORD

268 Now it came to pass when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people that
the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying Thou
shalt surely die

269 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD saying This
house shall be like Shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an
inhabitant  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the
house of the LORD

2610 When the princes of Judah heard these things then they came up
from the kings house unto the house of the LORD and sat down in the
entry of the new gate of the LORDs house

2611 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to
all the people saying This man is worthy to die for he hath
prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears

2612 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people
saying The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against
this city all the words that ye have heard

2613 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the
voice of the LORD your God and the LORD will repent him of the evil
that he hath pronounced against you

2614 As for me behold I am in your hand do with me as seemeth good
and meet unto you

2615 But know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall
surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and
upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the LORD hath sent me
unto you to speak all these words in your ears

2616 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
the prophets This man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us
in the name of the LORD our God

2617 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all
the assembly of the people saying 2618 Micah the Morasthite
prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and spake to all the
people of Judah saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts Zion shall be
plowed like a field and Jerusalem shall become heaps and the
mountain of the house as the high places of a forest

2619 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
death  did he not fear the LORD and besought the LORD and the LORD
repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them Thus
might we procure great evil against our souls

2620 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
LORD Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim who prophesied
against this city and against this land according to all the words of
Jeremiah

2621 And when Jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all
the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but
when Urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into Egypt
2622 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt namely Elnathan the
