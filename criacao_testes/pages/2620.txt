sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the
men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech 924 That the
cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come
and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother which slew them
and upon the men of Shechem which aided him in the killing of his
brethren

925 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them
and it was told Abimelech

926 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren and went over to
Shechem and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him

927 And they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards
and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their
god and did eat and drink and cursed Abimelech

928 And Gaal the son of Ebed said Who is Abimelech and who is
Shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of Jerubbaal and
Zebul his officer serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem for
why should we serve him  929 And would to God this people were under
my hand then would I remove Abimelech And he said to Abimelech
Increase thine army and come out

930 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the
son of Ebed his anger was kindled

931 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily saying Behold
Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem and behold
they fortify the city against thee

932 Now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee
and lie in wait in the field 933 And it shall be that in the
morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon
the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come
out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find
occasion

934 And Abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by
night and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies

935 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entering of
the gate of the city and Abimelech rose up and the people that were
with him from lying in wait

936 And when Gaal saw the people he said to Zebul Behold there
come people down from the top of the mountains And Zebul said unto
him Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men

937 And Gaal spake again and said See there come people down by the
middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of
Meonenim

938 Then said Zebul unto him Where is now thy mouth wherewith thou
saidst Who is Abimelech that we should serve him is not this the
people that thou hast despised go out I pray now and fight with
them

939 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem and fought with
Abimelech

940 And Abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were
overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate

941 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
brethren that they should not dwell in Shechem

942 And it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into
the field and they told Abimelech

943 And he took the people and divided them into three companies
and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were
come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote
them

944 And Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward
and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other
companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew
them

945 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took
the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the
city and sowed it with salt

946 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that they
entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith

947 And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of
Shechem were gathered together

948 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon he and all the people
that were with him and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut
down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder
and said unto the people that were with him What ye have seen me do
make haste and do as I have done

949 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and
followed Abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire
upon them so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also
