Abner which brought him again from the well of Sirah but David knew
it not

327 And when Abner was returned to Hebron Joab took him aside in the
gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth
rib that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother

328 And afterward when David heard it he said I and my kingdom are
guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of
Ner 329 Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his fathers
house and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an
issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth
on the sword or that lacketh bread

330 So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because he had slain
their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle

331 And David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him
Rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before
Abner And king David himself followed the bier

332 And they buried Abner in Hebron and the king lifted up his
voice and wept at the grave of Abner and all the people wept

333 And the king lamented over Abner and said Died Abner as a fool
dieth  334 Thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters
as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou And all the
people wept again over him

335 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it
was yet day David sware saying So do God to me and more also if I
taste bread or ought else till the sun be down

336 And all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as
whatsoever the king did pleased all the people

337 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner

338 And the king said unto his servants Know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel  339 And I am this
day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of Zeruiah be
too hard for me the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to
his wickedness

41 And when Sauls son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron his hands
were feeble and all the Israelites were troubled

42 And Sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name
of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab the sons of
Rimmon a Beerothite of the children of Benjamin for Beeroth also
was reckoned to Benjamin

43 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and were sojourners there
until this day  44 And Jonathan Sauls son had a son that was
lame of his feet He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul
and Jonathan out of Jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and
it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became
lame And his name was Mephibosheth

45 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite Rechab and Baanah went
and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth who lay
on a bed at noon

46 And they came thither into the midst of the house as though they
would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and
Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped

47 For when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his
bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and
took his head and gat them away through the plain all night

48 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron and
said to the king Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine
enemy which sought thy life and the LORD hath avenged my lord the
king this day of Saul and of his seed

49 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother the sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite and said unto them As the LORD liveth who
hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity 410 When one told me
saying Behold Saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings I
took hold of him and slew him in Ziklag who thought that I would
have given him a reward for his tidings 411 How much more when
wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his
bed shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand and
take you away from the earth  412 And David commanded his young men
and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged
them up over the pool in Hebron But they took the head of Ishbosheth
and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron

51 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron and
spake saying Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh

52 Also in time past when Saul was king over us thou wast he that
leddest out and broughtest in Israel and the LORD said to thee Thou
shalt feed my people Israel and thou shalt be a captain over Israel

53 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron and king
David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD and they
anointed David king over Israel
