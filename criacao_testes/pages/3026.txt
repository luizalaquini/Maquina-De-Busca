124 How long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field
wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are
consumed and the birds because they said He shall not see our last
end

125 If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee
then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace
wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in
the swelling of Jordan  126 For even thy brethren and the house of
thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they
have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they
speak fair words unto thee

127 I have forsaken mine house I have left mine heritage I have
given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies

128 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out
against me therefore have I hated it

129 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round
about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field
come to devour

1210 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my
portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate
wilderness

1211 They have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto
me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to
heart

1212 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the
wilderness for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of
the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace

1213 They have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put
themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of
your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD

1214 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours that touch
the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit
Behold I will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house
of Judah from among them

1215 And it shall come to pass after that I have plucked them out I
will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again
every man to his heritage and every man to his land

1216 And it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the
ways of my people to swear by my name The LORD liveth as they
taught my people to swear by Baal then shall they be built in the
midst of my people

1217 But if they will not obey I will utterly pluck up and destroy
that nation saith the LORD

131 Thus saith the LORD unto me Go and get thee a linen girdle and
put it upon thy loins and put it not in water

132 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD and put it
on my loins

133 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time saying
134 Take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and
arise go to Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock

135 So I went and hid it by Euphrates as the LORD commanded me

136 And it came to pass after many days that the LORD said unto me
Arise go to Euphrates and take the girdle from thence which I
commanded thee to hide there

137 Then I went to Euphrates and digged and took the girdle from
the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it
was profitable for nothing

138 Then the word of the LORD came unto me saying 139 Thus saith
the LORD After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah and the
great pride of Jerusalem

1310 This evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in
the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve
them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good
for nothing

1311 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have I
caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house
of Judah saith the LORD that they might be unto me for a people and
for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not
hear

1312 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel Every bottle shall be filled with wine and they
shall say unto thee Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall
be filled with wine  1313 Then shalt thou say unto them Thus saith
the LORD Behold I will fill all the inhabitants of this land even
the kings that sit upon Davids throne and the priests and the
prophets and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness

1314 And I will dash them one against another even the fathers and
