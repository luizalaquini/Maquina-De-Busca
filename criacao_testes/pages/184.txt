from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee and from thence will he
fetch thee 305 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land
which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do
thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers

306 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart
of thy seed to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with
all thy soul that thou mayest live

307 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee

308 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD and do all
his commandments which I command thee this day

309 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle
and in the fruit of thy land for good for the LORD will again
rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers 3010 If
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God to keep his
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
law and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart and
with all thy soul

3011 For this commandment which I command thee this day it is not
hidden from thee neither is it far off

3012 It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say Who shall go up
for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do
it  3013 Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say Who
shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear
it and do it  3014 But the word is very nigh unto thee in thy
mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it

3015 See I have set before thee this day life and good and death
and evil 3016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy
God to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and
the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
possess it

3017 But if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but
shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them 3018 I
denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye
shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over
Jordan to go to possess it

3019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I
have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore
choose life that both thou and thy seed may live 3020 That thou
mayest love the LORD thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and
that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length
of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware
unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give them

311 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel

312 And he said unto them I am an hundred and twenty years old this
day I can no more go out and come in also the LORD hath said unto
me Thou shalt not go over this Jordan

313 The LORD thy God he will go over before thee and he will
destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them
and Joshua he shall go over before thee as the LORD hath said

314 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og
kings of the Amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed

315 And the LORD shall give them up before your face that ye may do
unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded
you

316 Be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them
for the LORD thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not
fail thee nor forsake thee

317 And Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of
all Israel Be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with
this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers
to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it

318 And the LORD he it is that doth go before thee he will be with
thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither
be dismayed

319 And Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the
sons of Levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD and unto
all the elders of Israel

3110 And Moses commanded them saying At the end of every seven
years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of
tabernacles 3111 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD
thy God in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law
before all Israel in their hearing

3112 Gather the people together men and women and children and thy
stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they
may learn and fear the LORD your God and observe to do all the words
of this law 3113 And that their children which have not known any
thing may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as ye
