BRAN

The Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from their castle at Karhold The steel points of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as the column approached A man went before them pounding out a slow deep-throated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than he was boom boom boom

Bran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall peering through Maester Luwin’s bronze far-eye while perched on Hodor’s shoulders Lord Rickard himself led them his sons Harrion and Eddard and Torrhen riding beside him beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of their House Old Nan said they had Stark blood in them going back hundreds of years but they did not look like Starks to Bran They were big men and fierce faces covered with thick beards hair worn loose past the shoulders Their cloaks were made of skins the pelts of bear and seal and wolf

They were the last he knew The other lords were already here with their hosts Bran yearned to ride out among them to see the winter houses full to bursting the jostling crowds in the market square every morning the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle We have no men to spare to guard you his brother had explained

I’ll take Summer Bran argued

Don’t act the boy with me Bran Robb said You know better than that Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton’s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn’s at the Smoking Log Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when he said it Bran knew that meant there was no appeal

It was because of what had happened in the wolfswood he knew The memory still gave him bad dreams He had been as helpless as a baby no more able to defend himself than Rickon would have been Less even… Rickon would have kicked them at the least It shamed him He was only a few years younger than Robb if his brother was almost a man grown so was he He should have been able to protect himself

A year ago before he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the walls by himself In those days he could run down stairs get on and off his pony by himself and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt Now he could only watch peering out through Maester Luwin’s lens tube The maester had taught him all the banners the mailed fist of the Glovers silver on scarlet Lady Mormont’s black bear the hideous flayed man that went before Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort a bull moose for the Hornwoods a battle-axe for the Cerwyns three sentinel trees for the Tallharts and the fearsome sigil of House Umber a roaring giant in shattered chains

And soon enough he learned the faces too when the lords and their sons and knights retainer came to Winterfell to feast Even the Great Hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once so Robb hosted each of the principal bannermen in turn Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother’s right hand Some of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there as if they wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them and him a cripple too

How many is it now Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his sons rode through the gates in the outer wall

Twelve thousand men or near enough as makes no matter

How many knights

Few enough the maester said with a touch of impatience To be a knight you must stand your vigil in a sept and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows In the north only a few of the great houses worship the Seven The rest honor the old gods and name no knights… but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable A man’s worth is not marked by a ser before his name As I have told you a hundred times before

Still said Bran how many knights

Maester Luwin sighed Three hundred perhaps four… among three thousand armored lances who are not knights

Lord Karstark is the last Bran said thoughtfully Robb will feast him tonight

No doubt he will

How long before… before they go

He must march soon or not at all Maester Luwin said The winter town is full to bursting and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint The fighting has begun in the riverlands and your brother has many leagues to go

I know Bran felt as miserable as he sounded He handed the bronze tube back to the maester and noticed how thin Luwin’s hair had grown on top He could see the pink of scalp showing through It felt queer to look down on him this way when he’d spent his whole life looking up at him but when you sat on Hodor’s back you looked down on everyone I don’t want to watch anymore Hodor take me back to the keep

Hodor said Hodor

Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve Bran your lord brother will not have time to see you now He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome

I won’t trouble Robb I want to visit the godswood He put his hand on Hodor’s shoulder Hodor

A series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower’s inner wall Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for him Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran’s weight more evenly It was not as good as riding Dancer but there were places Dancer could not go and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby Hodor seemed to like it too though with Hodor it was hard to tell The only tricky part was doors Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back and that could be painful when he went through a door

For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them even in the dead of night A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower Karstark men following their lords into the castle They wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst Hodor trotted along beside them smiling to himself his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge The riders gave them queer looks as they went by and once Bran heard someone guffaw He refused to let it trouble him Men will look at you Maester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor’s chest They will look and they will talk and some will mock you Let them mock Bran thought No one mocked him in his bedchamber but he would not live his life in bed

As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled Summer came loping across the yard Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay One stallion reared screaming his rider cursing and hanging on desperately The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it but they’d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone The godswood Bran reminded Hodor

Even Winterfell itself was crowded The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe the rumble of wagons and the barking of dogs The armory doors were open and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his years not even when King Robert had come to visit Father
