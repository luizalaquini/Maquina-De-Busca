As Arya began her story Ned heard the door open behind him He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into the middle of the Trident Renly Baratheon began to laugh The king bristled Ser Barristan escort my brother from the hall before he chokes

Lord Renly stifled his laughter My brother is too kind I can find the door myself He bowed to Joffrey Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river As the door swung shut behind him Ned heard him say Lion’s Tooth and guffaw once more

Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events When his son was done talking the king rose heavily from his seat looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this He says one thing she says another

They were not the only ones present Ned said Sansa come here Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished He knew the truth Tell us what happened

His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white a silver chain around her neck Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone She blinked at her sister then at the young prince I don’t know she said tearfully looking as though she wanted to bolt I don’t remember Everything happened so fast I didn’t see…

You rotten Arya shrieked She flew at her sister like an arrow knocking Sansa down to the ground pummeling her Liar liar liar liar

Arya stop it Ned shouted Jory pulled her off her sister kicking Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned lifted her back to her feet Are you hurt he asked but she was staring at Arya and she did not seem to hear

The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers Cersei Lannister said Robert I want her punished

Seven hells Robert swore Cersei look at her She’s a child What would you have me do whip her through the streets Damn it children fight It’s over No lasting harm was done

The queen was furious Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life

Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son So he will Perhaps they will teach him a lesson Ned see that your daughter is disciplined I will do the same with my son

Gladly Your Grace Ned said with vast relief

Robert started to walk away but the queen was not done And what of the direwolf she called after him What of the beast that savaged your son

The king stopped turned back frowned I’d forgotten about the damned wolf

Ned could see Arya tense in Jory’s arms Jory spoke up quickly We found no trace of the direwolf Your Grace

Robert did not look unhappy No So be it

The queen raised her voice A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin

A costly pelt Robert grumbled I want no part of this woman You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold

The queen regarded him coolly I had not thought you so niggardly The king I’d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down

Robert’s face darkened with anger That would be a fine trick without a wolf

We have a wolf Cersei Lannister said Her voice was very quiet but her green eyes shone with triumph

It took them all a moment to comprehend her words but when they did the king shrugged irritably As you will Have Ser Ilyn see to it

Robert you cannot mean this Ned protested

The king was in no mood for more argument Enough Ned I will hear no more A direwolf is a savage beast Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son Get her a dog she’ll be happier for it

That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father He doesn’t mean Lady does he She saw the truth on his face No she said No not Lady Lady didn’t bite anybody she’s good…

Lady wasn’t there Arya shouted angrily You leave her alone

Stop them Sansa pleaded don’t let them do it please please it wasn’t Lady it was Nymeria Arya did it you can’t it wasn’t Lady don’t let them hurt Lady I’ll make her be good I promise I promise… She started to cry
