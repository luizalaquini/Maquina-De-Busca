But prosodics and segmentals are closely intertwined
I have chosen to
treat them in separate chapters in order to split the material up into
manageable chunks rather than to enforce a deep division between them
It is also true that synthesis of prosodic features is an uncharted and
controversial area which gives this chapter rather a different
flavour from the last
It is hard to be as definite about alternative strategies
and methods as you can for segment concatenation
In order to make the treatment as concrete and down-to-earth as possible
I will describe in some detail two example projects in prosodic synthesis
The first treats the problem of transferring pitch from one utterance to
another while the second considers how artificial timing and pitch can be
assigned to synthetic speech
These examples illustrate quite different problems and are reasonably
representative of current research activity
Other systems are described by Mattingly 1966 Rabiner

looking at the two examples we will discuss
a feature which is certainly prosodic but does not appear in the
list given earlier em stress
sh 81  Stress
pp
Stress is an everyday notion and when
listening to natural speech people can usually agree on which syllables
are stressed  But it is difficult to characterize in acoustic terms
From the speakers point of view a stressed syllable is produced by
pushing more air out of the lungs  For a listener the points of stress
are obvious
You may think that stressed syllables are louder than the others  however
instrumental studies show that this is not necessarily nor even usually
so eg Lehiste and Peterson 1959

Lehiste Peterson 1959

Stressed syllables frequently have a longer vowel than unstressed
ones but this is by no means universally true em if you say little
or bigger you will find that the vowel in the first stressed syllable
is short and shows little sign of lengthening as you increase the emphasis
Moreover experiments using bisyllabic nonsense words have indicated
that some people consistently judge the
ul
shorter
syllable to be stressed in the absence of other clues Morton and Jassem
1965

Pitch often helps to indicate stress
It is not that stressed syllables are always higher- or lower-pitched
than neighbouring ones or even that they are uttered with a rising or
falling pitch  It is the
ul
rate of change
of pitch that tends to be greater
for stressed syllables  a sharp rise or fall
or a reversal of direction helps to give emphasis
pp
Stress is acoustically manifested in timing and pitch
and to a much lesser extent in loudness
However it is a rather subtle feature and does
ul
not
correspond simply to duration increases or pitch rises
It seems that listeners unconsciously put together all the clues
that are present in an utterance in order to deduce which syllables are
stressed
It may be that speech is perceived by a listener with reference to how
he would have produced it himself and that this is how he detects which syllables
were given greater vocal effort
pp
The situation is confused by the fact that certain syllables in words are
often said in ordinary language to be stressed on account of their
position in the word  For example the words
diplomat diplomacy and diplomatic have stress on the first
second and third syllables respectively
But here we are talking about the word itself rather than
any particular utterance of it  The stress is really
ul
latent
in the indicated syllables and only made manifest upon uttering them
and then to a greater or lesser degree depending on exactly how
they are uttered
pp
Some linguists draw a careful distinction between salient syllables
accented syllables and stressed syllables
although the words are sometimes used differently by different authorities
I will not adopt a precise terminology here
but it is as well to be aware of the subtle distinctions involved
The term salience is applied to actual utterances and salient
syllables are those that are perceived as being more prominent than their
neighbours
