depths  I might gird at a certain shepherd brain to
brain But no -- O no 
 A strange old piece ye say   interposed the maltster
in a querulous voice At the same time ye be no old
man worth naming -- no old man at all Yer teeth
baint  half  gone  yet  and whats a old  mans standing
if se be his teeth baint gone Werent I stale in
wedlock afore ye were out  of arms  Tis a poor thing
to be sixty when theres people far past four-score -- a
boastweak as water
It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to
sink minor differences when the maltster had to be
pacified
 Weak as-water  yes said Jan Coggan- Malter
we feel ye to be a wonderful veteran man and nobody
can gainsay it
 Nobody said Joseph Poorgrass Ye be a very
rare old  spectacle malter and we all admire ye for that
gift 
Ay and as a young man when my senses were in
prosperity I was likewise liked by a good-few who
knowed me said the maltster
 Ithout doubt you was -- ithout doubt
The bent and hoary man was satisfied and so
apparently was Henery Frag That matters should
continue pleasant Maryann

spoke who what with her
brown complexion and the working wrapper of rusty
linsey had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch
in oils -- notably some of Nicholas Poussins --
 Do anybody know of a crooked man or a lame or
any second-hand fellow at all that would do for poor
me  said Maryann A perfect one I dont expect to
 at my time of life If I could hear of such a thing
twould do me more good thantoast and ale
 Coggan furnished a suitable reply Oak went on
with his shearing and said not another word Pestilent
moods had come and teased away his quiet Bathsheba
had shown indications of anointing him above his
fellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm
imperatively required He did not covet the post
relatively to the farm  in relation to herself as beloved
by him and unmarried to another he had coveted it
His readings of her seemed now to be vapoury and
indistinct His lecture to her was he thought one of
the absurdest mistakes Far from coquetting with
Boldwood she had trifled with himself in thus feigning
that she had trifled with another He was inwardly
convinced that in accordance with the anticipations of
his easy-going and worse-educated comrades that day
would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss
Everdene Gabriel at this time of his life had out+
grown the instinctive dislike which every Christian
boy has for reading the Bible perusing it now quite
frequently and he inwardly said  I find more bitter
than death the woman whose heart is snares and
nets    This was mere exclamation -- the froth of the
storm He adored Bathsheba just the same
 We workfolk shall have some lordly- junketing
to-night said Cainy Ball casting forth his thoughts in
a new direction This morning I seeem making the
great puddens in the milking-pails -- lumps of fat as big
as yer thumb Mister Oak  Ive never seed such
splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my
life -- they never used to be bigger then a horse-bean
And there was a great black crock upon the brandise
with his legs a-sticking out but I dont know what was
in within
And theres two bushels of biffins for apple-pies
said Maryann
P 204
Well I hope to do my duty by it all said Joseph
Poorgrass in a pleasant masticating manner of anticipa+
tion  Yes  victuals and drink is a cheerful thing
and gives nerves to the nerveless if the form of words
may be used Tis the gospel of the body without
which we perish so to speak it

EVENTIDE -- A SECOND DECLARATION
FOR the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the
grass-plot beside the house the end of the table being
thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a
foot or two into the room Miss Everdene sat inside
the window facing down the table She was thus at
the head without mingling with the men
This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited her
red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
skeins of her shadowy hair She seemed to expect
assistance and the seat at the bottom of the table was
at her request left vacant until after they had begun
and the duties appertaining to that end which he did
with great readiness
At this moment Mr Boldwood came in at the gate
and crossed the green to Bathsheba at the window
He apologized for his lateness  his arrival was evidently
by arrangement
 Gabriel said she  will you move again please
and let Mr Boldwood come there
