The Red Keep is overcrowded with wedding guests Once they depart we will find you more suitable accommodations

I rather liked these accommodations Have you set a date for this great wedding

Joffrey and Margaery shall marry on the first day of the new year which as it happens is also the first day of the new century The ceremony will herald the dawn of a new era

A new Lannister era thought Tyrion Oh bother I fear I’ve made other plans for that day

Did you come here just to complain of your bedchamber and make your lame japes I have important letters to finish

Important letters To be sure

Some battles are won with swords and spears others with quills and ravens Spare me these coy reproaches Tyrion I visited your sickbed as often as Maester Ballabar would allow it when you seemed like to die He steepled his fingers under his chin Why did you dismiss Ballabar

Tyrion shrugged Maester Frenken is not so determined to keep me insensate

Ballabar came to the city in Lord Redwyne’s retinue A gifted healer it’s said It was kind of Cersei to ask him to look after you She feared for your life

Feared that I might keep it you mean Doubtless that’s why she’s never once left my bedside

Don’t be impertinent Cersei has a royal wedding to plan I am waging a war and you have been out of danger for at least a fortnight Lord Tywin studied his son’s disfigured face his pale green eyes unflinching Though the wound is ghastly enough I’ll grant you What madness possessed you

The foe was at the gates with a battering ram If Jaime had led the sortie you’d call it valor

Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle I trust you killed the man who cut you

Oh the wretch is dead enough Though it had been Podrick Payne who’d killed Ser Mandon shoving him into the river to drown beneath the weight of his armor A dead enemy is a joy forever Tyrion said blithely though Ser Mandon was not his true enemy The man had no reason to want him dead He was only a catspaw and I believe I know the cat She told him to make certain I did not survive the battle But without proof Lord Tywin would never listen to such a charge Why are you here in the city Father he asked Shouldn’t you be off fighting Lord Stannis or Robb Stark or someone And the sooner the better

Until Lord Redwyne brings his fleet up we lack the ships to assail Dragonstone It makes no matter Stannis Baratheon’s sun set on the Blackwater As for Stark the boy is still in the west but a large force of northmen under Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are descending toward Duskendale I’ve sent Lord Tarly to meet them while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off their retreat Tallhart and Glover will be caught between them with a third of Stark’s strength

Duskendale There was nothing at Duskendale worth such a risk Had the Young Wolf finally blundered

It’s nothing you need trouble yourself with Your face is pale as death and there’s blood seeping through your dressings Say what you want and take yourself back to bed

What I want… His throat felt raw and tight What did he want More than you can ever give me Father Pod tells me that Littlefinger’s been made Lord of Harrenhal

An empty title so long as Roose Bolton holds the castle for Robb Stark yet Lord Baelish was desirous of the honor He did us good service in the matter of the Tyrell marriage A Lannister pays his debts

The Tyrell marriage had been Tyrion’s notion in point of fact but it would seem churlish to try to claim that now That title may not be as empty as you think he warned Littlefinger does nothing without good reason But be that as it may You said something about paying debts I believe

And you want your own reward is that it Very well What is it you would have of me Lands castle some office

A little bloody gratitude would make a nice start

Lord Tywin stared at him unblinking Mummers and monkeys require applause So did Aerys for that matter You did as you were commanded and I am sure it was to the best of your ability No one denies the part you played

The part I played What nostrils Tyrion had left must surely have flared I saved your bloody city it seems to me

Most people seem to feel that it was my attack on Lord Stannis’s flank that turned the tide of battle Lords Tyrell Rowan Redwyne and Tarly fought nobly as well and I’m told it was your sister Cersei who set the pyromancers to making the wildfire that destroyed the Baratheon fleet

While all I did was get my nosehairs trimmed is that it Tyrion could not keep the bitterness out of his voice

Your chain was a clever stroke and crucial to our victory Is that what you wanted to hear I am told we have you to thank for our Dornish alliance as well You may be pleased to learn that Myrcella has arrived safely at Sunspear Ser Arys Oakheart writes that she has taken a great liking to Princess Arianne and that Prince Trystane is enchanted with her I mislike giving House Martell a hostage but I suppose that could not be helped
