Ser Alliser Thorne shattered the silence The turncloak graces us with his presence at last

Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering The beast he gasped Look The beast that tore the life from Halfhand A warg walks among us brothers A WARG This… this creature is not fit to lead us This beastling is not fit to live

Ghost bared his teeth but Jon put a hand on his head My lord he said will you tell me what’s happened here

Maester Aemon answered from the far end of the hall Your name has been put forth as Lord Commander Jon

That was so absurd Jon had to smile By who he said looking for his friends This had to be one of Pyp’s japes surely But Pyp shrugged at him and Grenn shook his head It was Dolorous Edd Tollett who stood By me Aye it’s a terrible cruel thing to do to a friend but better you than me

Lord Janos started sputtering again This this is an outrage We ought to hang this boy Yes Hang him I say hang him for a turncloak and a warg along with his friend Mance Rayder Lord Commander I will not have it I will not suffer it

Cotter Pyke stood up You won’t suffer it Might be you had those gold cloaks trained to lick your bloody arse but you’re wearing a black cloak now

Any brother may offer any name for our consideration so long as the man has said his vows Ser Denys Mallister said Tollett is well within his rights my lord

A dozen men started to talk at once each trying to drown out the others and before long half the hall was shouting once more This time it was Ser Alliser Thorne who leapt up on the table and raised his hands for quiet Brothers he cried this gains us naught I say we vote This king who has taken the King’s Tower has posted men at all the doors to see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice So be it We will choose and choose again all night if need be until we have our lord… but before we cast our tokens I believe our First Builder has something to say to us

Othell Yarwyck stood up slowly frowning The big builder rubbed his long lantern jaw and said Well I’m pulling my name out If you wanted me you had ten chances to choose me and you didn’t Not enough of you anyway I was going to say that those who were casting a token for me ought to choose Lord Janos…

Ser Alliser nodded Lord Slynt is the best possible—

I wasn’t done Alliser Yarwyck complained Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King’s Landing we all know and he was Lord of Harrenhal…

He’s never seen Harrenhal Cotter Pyke shouted out

Well that’s so said Yarwyck Anyway now that I’m standing here I don’t recall why I thought Slynt would be such a good choice That would be sort of kicking King Stannis in the mouth and I don’t see how that serves us Might be Snow would be better He’s been longer on the Wall he’s Ben Stark’s nephew and he served the Old Bear as squire Yarwyck shrugged Pick who you want just so it’s not me He sat down

Janos Slynt had turned from red to purple Jon saw but Ser Alliser Thorne had gone pale The Eastwatch man was pounding his fist on the table again but now he was shouting for the kettle Some of his friends took up the cry Kettle they roared as one Kettle kettle KETTLE

The kettle was in the corner by the hearth a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot With a raucous scream and a clap of wings a huge raven burst out of the kettle It flapped upward seeking the rafters perhaps or a window to make its escape but there were no rafters in the vault nor windows either The raven was trapped Cawing loudly it circled the hall once twice three times And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout I know that bird That’s Lord Mormont’s raven

The raven landed on the table nearest Jon Snow it cawed It was an old bird dirty and bedraggled Snow it said again Snow snow snow It walked to the end of the table spread its wings again and flew to Jon’s shoulder

Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter Ser Piggy thinks we’re all fools brothers he said He’s taught the bird this little trick They all say snow go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves Mormont’s bird had more words than that

The raven cocked its head and looked at Jon Corn it said hopefully When it got neither corn nor answer it quorked and muttered Kettle Kettle Kettle

The rest was arrowheads a torrent of arrowheads a flood of arrowheads arrowheads enough to drown the last few stones and shells and all the copper pennies too

When the count was done Jon found himself surrounded Some clapped him on the back whilst others bent the knee to him as if he were a lord in truth Satin Owen the Oaf Halder Toad Spare Boot Giant Mully Ulmer of the Kingswood Sweet Donnel Hill and half a hundred more pressed around him Dywen clacked his wooden teeth and said Gods be good our Lord Commander’s still in swaddling clothes Iron Emmett said I hope this don’t mean I can’t beat the bloody piss out of you next time we train my lord Three-Finger Hobb wanted to know if he’d still be eating with the men or if he’d want his meals sent up to his solar Even Bowen Marsh came up to say he would be glad to continue as Lord Steward if that was Lord Snow’s wish

Lord Snow said Cotter Pyke if you muck this up I’m going to rip your liver out and eat it raw with onions

Ser Denys Mallister was more courteous It was a hard thing young Samwell asked of me the old knight confessed When Lord Qorgyle was chosen I told myself ‘No matter he has been longer on the Wall than you have your time will come’ When it was Lord Mormont I thought ‘He is strong and fierce but he is old your time may yet come’ But you are half a boy Lord Snow and now I must return to the Shadow Tower knowing that my time will never come He smiled a tired smile Do not make me die regretful Your uncle was a great man Your lord father and his father as well I shall expect full as much of you

Aye said Cotter Pyke And you can start by telling those king’s men that it’s done and we want our bloody supper

Supper screamed the raven Supper supper

The king’s men cleared the door when they told them of the choosing and Three-Finger Hobb and half a dozen helpers went trotting off to the kitchen to fetch the food Jon did not wait to eat He walked across the castle wondering if he were dreaming with the raven on his shoulder and Ghost at his heels Pyp Grenn and Sam trailed after him chattering but he hardly heard a word until Grenn whispered Sam did it and Pyp said Sam did it Pyp had brought a wineskin with him and he took a long drink and chanted Sam Sam Sam the wizard Sam the wonder Sam Sam the marvel man he did it But when did you hide the raven in the kettle Sam and how in seven hells could you be certain it would fly to Jon It would have mucked up everything if the bird had decided to perch on Janos Slynt’s fat head

I had nothing to do with the bird Sam insisted When it flew out of the kettle I almost wet myself

Jon laughed half amazed that he still remembered how You’re all a bunch of mad fools do you know that

Us said Pyp You call us fools We’re not the ones who got chosen as the nine-hundredth-and-ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch You best have some wine Lord Jon I think you’re going to need a lot of wine

So Jon Snow took the wineskin from his hand and had a swallow But only one The Wall was his the night was dark and he had a king to face





Sansa


She awoke all at once every nerve atingle For a moment she did not remember where she was She had dreamt that she was little still sharing a bedchamber with her sister Arya But it was her maid she heard tossing in sleep not her sister and this was not Winterfell but the Eyrie And I am Alayne Stone a bastard girl The room was cold and black though she was warm beneath the blankets Dawn had not yet come Sometimes she dreamed of Ser Ilyn Payne and woke with her heart thumping but this dream had not been like that Home It was a dream of home

The Eyrie was no home It was no bigger than Maegor’s Holdfast and outside its sheer white walls was only the mountain and the long treacherous descent past Sky and Snow and Stone to the Gates of the Moon on the valley floor There was no place to go and little to do The older servants said these halls rang with laughter when her father and Robert Baratheon had been Jon Arryn’s wards but those days were many years gone Her aunt kept a small household and seldom permitted any guests to ascend past the Gates of the Moon Aside from her aged maid Sansa’s only companion was the Lord Robert eight going on three

And Marillion There is always Marillion When he played for them at supper the young singer often seemed to be singing directly at her Her aunt was far from pleased Lady Lysa doted on Marillion and had banished two serving girls and even a page for telling lies about him

Lysa was as lonely as she was Her new husband seemed to spend more time at the foot of the mountain than he did atop it He was gone now had been gone the past four days meeting with the Corbrays From bits and pieces of overheard conversations Sansa knew that Jon Arryn’s bannermen resented Lysa’s marriage and begrudged Petyr his authority as Lord Protector of the Vale The senior branch of House Royce was close to open revolt over her aunt’s failure to aid Robb in his war and the Waynwoods Redforts Belmores and Templetons were giving them every support The mountain clans were being troublesome as well and old Lord Hunter had died so suddenly that his two younger sons were accusing their elder brother of having murdered him The Vale of Arryn might have been spared the worst of the war but it was hardly the idyllic place that Lady Lysa had made it out to be

I am not going back to sleep Sansa realized My head is all a tumult She pushed her pillow away reluctantly threw back the blankets went to her window and opened the shutters

Snow was falling on the Eyrie

Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory Was this what woke me Already the snowfall lay thick upon the garden below blanketing the grass dusting the shrubs and statues with white and weighing down the branches of the trees The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago in the long summer of her childhood

She had last seen snow the day she’d left Winterfell That was a lighter fall than this she remembered Robb had melting flakes in his hair when he hugged me and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in her hands It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning Hullen had helped her mount and she’d ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her off to see the great wide world I thought my song was beginning that day but it was almost done

Sansa left the shutters open as she dressed It would be cold she knew though the Eyrie’s towers encircled the garden and protected it from the worst of the mountain winds She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift and over that a warm dress of blue lambswool Two pairs of hose for her legs boots that laced up to her knees heavy leather gloves and finally a hooded cloak of soft white fox fur

Her maid rolled herself more tightly in her blanket as the snow began to drift in the window Sansa eased open the door and made her way down the winding stair When she opened the door to the garden it was so lovely that she held her breath unwilling to disturb such perfect beauty The snow drifted down and down all in ghostly silence and lay thick and unbroken on the ground All color had fled the world outside It was a place of whites and blacks and greys White towers and white snow and white statues black shadows and black trees the dark grey sky above A pure world Sansa thought I do not belong here

Yet she stepped out all the same Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow yet made no sound Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees and wondered if she were still dreaming Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover’s kisses and melted on her cheeks At the center of the garden beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes She could feel the snow on her lashes taste it on her lips It was the taste of Winterfell The taste of innocence The taste of dreams

When Sansa opened her eyes again she was on her knees She did not remember falling It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey Dawn she thought Another day Another new day It was the old days she hungered for Prayed for But who could she pray to The garden had been meant for a godswood once she knew but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root A godswood without gods as empty as me

She scooped up a handful of snow and squeezed it between her fingers Heavy and wet the snow packed easily Sansa began to make snowballs shaping and smoothing them until they were round and white and perfect She remembered a summer’s snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed her as she emerged from the keep one morning They’d each had a dozen snowballs to hand and she’d had none Bran had been perched on the roof of the covered bridge out of reach but Sansa had chased Arya through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were breathless She might even have caught her but she’d slipped on some ice Her sister came back to see if she was hurt When she said she wasn’t Arya hit her in the face with another snowball but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart laughing

What do I want with snowballs She looked at her sad little arsenal There’s no one to throw them at She let the one she was making drop from her hand I could build a snow knight instead she thought Or even…

She pushed two of her snowballs together added a third packed more snow in around them and patted the whole thing into the shape of a cylinder When it was done she stood it on end and used the tip of her little finger to poke holes in it for windows The crenellations around the top took a little more care but when they were done she had a tower I need some walls now Sansa thought and then a keep She set to work

The snow fell and the castle rose Two walls ankle-high the inner taller than the outer Towers and turrets keeps and stairs a round kitchen a square armory the stables along the inside of the west wall It was only a castle when she began but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell She found twigs and fallen branches beneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white her hands were tingling and her feet were soaked and cold but she did not care The castle was all that mattered Some things were hard to remember but most came back to her easily as if she had been there only yesterday The Library Tower with the steep stonework stair twisting about its exterior The gatehouse two huge bulwarks the arched gate between them crenellations all along the top…

And all the while the snow kept falling piling up in drifts around her buildings as fast as she raised them She was patting down the pitched roof of the Great Hall when she heard a voice and looked up to see her maid calling from her window Was my lady well Did she wish to break her fast Sansa shook her head and went back to shaping snow adding a chimney to one end of the Great Hall where the hearth would stand inside
