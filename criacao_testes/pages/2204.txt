Would that I were I will not deny that Bael’s exploit inspired mine own    but I did not steal either of your sisters that I recall Bael wrote his own songs and lived them I only sing the songs that better men have made More mead

No said Jon If you had been discovered    taken   

Your father would have had my head off The king gave a shrug Though once I had eaten at his board I was protected by guest right The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men and sacred as a heart tree He gestured at the board between them the broken bread and chicken bones Here you are the guest and safe from harm at my hands    this night at least So tell me truly Jon Snow Are you a craven who turned your cloak from fear or is there another reason that brings you to my tent

Guest right or no Jon Snow knew he walked on rotten ice here One false step and he might plunge through into water cold enough to stop his heart Weigh every word before you speak it he told himself He took a long draught of mead to buy time for his answer When he set the horn aside he said Tell me why you turned your cloak and I’ll tell you why I turned mine

Mance Rayder smiled as Jon had hoped he would The king was plainly a man who liked the sound of his own voice You will have heard stories of my desertion I have no doubt

Some say it was for a crown Some say for a woman Others that you had the wildling blood

The wildling blood is the blood of the First Men the same blood that flows in the veins of the Starks As to a crown do you see one

I see a woman He glanced at Dalla

Mance took her by the hand and pulled her close My lady is blameless I met her on my return from your father’s castle The Halfhand was carved of old oak but I am made of flesh and I have a great fondness for the charms of women    which makes me no different from three-quarters of the Watch There are men still wearing black who have had ten times as many women as this poor king You must guess again Jon Snow

Jon considered a moment The Halfhand said you had a passion for wildling music

I did I do That’s closer to the mark yes But not a hit Mance Rayder rose unfastened the clasp that held his cloak and swept it over the bench It was for this

A cloak

The black wool cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch said the King-beyond-the-Wall One day on a ranging we brought down a fine big elk We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadow-cat out of its lair I drove it off but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons Do you see Here here and here He chuckled It shredded my arm and back as well and I bled worse than the elk My brothers feared I might die before they got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower so they carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing She was dead as it happened but her daughter saw to me Cleaned my wounds sewed me up and fed me porridge and potions until I was strong enough to ride again And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well with some scarlet silk from Asshai that her grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore It was the greatest treasure she had and her gift to me He swept the cloak back over his shoulders But at the Shadow Tower I was given a new wool cloak from stores black and black and trimmed with black to go with my black breeches and black boots my black doublet and black mail The new cloak had no frays nor rips nor tears    and most of all no red The men of the Night’s Watch dressed in black Ser Denys Mallister reminded me sternly as if I had forgotten My old cloak was fit for burning now he said

I left the next morning    for a place where a kiss was not a crime and a man could wear any cloak he chose He closed the clasp and sat back down again And you Jon Snow

Jon took another swallow of mead There is only one tale that he might believe You say you were at Winterfell the night my father feasted King Robert

I did say it for I was

Then you saw us all Prince Joffrey and Prince Tommen Princess Myrcella my brothers Robb and Bran and Rickon my sisters Arya and Sansa You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon them and take their seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated

I remember

And did you see where I was seated Mance He leaned forward Did you see where they put the bastard

Mance Rayder looked at Jon’s face for a long moment I think we had best find you a new cloak the king said holding out his hand





DAENERYS

Across the still blue water came the slow steady beat of drums and the soft swish of oars from the galleys The great cog groaned in their wake the heavy lines stretched taut between Balerion’s sails hung limp drooping forlorn from the masts Yet even so as she stood upon the forecastle watching her dragons chase each other across a cloudless blue sky Daenerys Targaryen was as happy as she could ever remember being

Her Dothraki called the sea the poison water distrusting any liquid that their horses could not drink On the day the three ships had lifted anchor at Quarth you would have thought they were sailing to hell instead of Pentos Her brave young bloodriders had stared off at the dwindling coastline with huge white eyes each of the three determined to show no fear before the other two while her handmaids Irri and Jhiqui clutched the rail desperately and retched over the side at every little swell The rest of Dany’s tiny khalasar remained below decks preferring the company of their nervous horses to the terrifying landless world about the ships When a sudden squall had enveloped them six days into the voyage she heard them through the hatches the horses kicking and screaming the riders praying in thin quavery voices each time Balerion heaved or swayed

No squall could frighten Dany though Daenerys Stormborn she was called for she had come howling into the world on distant Dragonstone as the greatest storm in the memory of Westeros howled outside a storm so fierce that it ripped gargoyles from the castle walls and smashed her father’s fleet to kindling

The narrow sea was often stormy and Dany had crossed it half a hundred times as a girl running from one Free City to the next half a step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives She loved the sea She liked the sharp salty smell of the air and the vastness of horizons bounded only by a vault of azure sky above It made her feel small but free as well She liked the dolphins that sometimes swam along beside Balerion slicing through the waves like silvery spears and the flying fish they glimpsed now and again She even liked the sailors with all their songs and stories Once on a voyage to Braavos as she’d watched the crew wrestle down a great green sail in a rising gale she had even thought how fine it would be to be a sailor But when she told her brother Viserys had twisted her hair until she cried You are blood of the dragon he had screamed at her A dragon not some smelly fish

He was a fool about that and so much else Dany thought If he had been wiser and more patient it would be him sailing west to take the throne that was his by rights Viserys had been stupid and vicious she had come to realize yet sometimes she missed him all the same Not the cruel weak man he had become by the end but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into his bed the boy who told her tales of the Seven Kingdoms and talked of how much better their lives would be once he claimed his crown

The captain appeared at her elbow Would that this Balerion could soar as her namesake did Your Grace he said in bastard Valyrian heavily flavored with accents of Pentos Then we should not need to row nor tow nor pray for wind

Just so Captain she answered with a smile pleased to have won the man over Captain Groleo was an old Pentoshi like his master Illyrio Mopatis and he had been nervous as a maiden about carrying three dragons on his ship Half a hundred buckets of seawater still hung from the gunwales in case of fires At first Groleo had wanted the dragons caged and Dany had consented to put his fears at ease but their misery was so palpable that she soon changed her mind and insisted they be freed

Even Captain Groleo was glad of that now There had been one small fire easily extinguished against that Balerion suddenly seemed to have far fewer rats than she’d had before when she sailed under the name Saduleon And her crew once as fearful as they were curious had begun to take a queer fierce pride in their dragons Every man of them from captain to cook’s boy loved to watch the three fly    though none so much as Dany

They are my children she told herself and if the maegi spoke truly they are the only children I am ever like to have

Viserion’s scales were the color of fresh cream his horns wing bones and spinal crest a dark gold that flashed bright as metal in the sun Rhaegal was made of the green of summer and the bronze of fall They soared above the ships in wide circles higher and higher each trying to climb above the other

Dragons always preferred to attack from above Dany had learned Should either get between the other and the sun he would fold his wings and dive screaming and they would tumble from the sky locked together in a tangled scaly ball jaws snapping and tails lashing The first time they had done it she feared that they meant to kill each other but it was only sport No sooner would they splash into the sea than they would break apart and rise again shrieking and hissing the salt water steaming off them as their wings clawed at the air Drogon was aloft as well though not in sight he would be miles ahead or miles behind hunting

He was always hungry her Drogon Hungry and growing fast Another year or perhaps two and he may be large enough to ride Then I shall have no need of ships to cross the great salt sea

But that time was not yet come Rhaegal and Viserion were the size of small dogs Drogon only a little larger and any dog would have out-weighed them they were all wings and neck and tail lighter than they looked And so Daenerys Targaryen must rely on wood and wind and canvas to bear her home

The wood and the canvas had served her well enough so far but the fickle wind had turned traitor For six days and six nights they had been becalmed and now a seventh day had come and still no breath of air to fill their sails Fortunately two of the ships that Magister Illyrio had sent after her were trading galleys with two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen to row them But the great cog Balerion was a song of a different key a ponderous broad-beamed sow of a ship with immense holds and huge sails but helpless in a calm Vhagar and Meraxes had let out lines to tow her but it made for painfully slow going All three ships were crowded and heavily laden

I cannot see Drogon said Ser Jorah Mormont as he joined her on the forecastle Is he lost again

We are the ones who are lost ser Drogon has no taste for this wet creeping no more than I do Bolder than the other two her black dragon had been the first to try his wings above the water the first to flutter from ship to ship the first to lose himself in a passing cloud    and the first to kill The flying fish no sooner broke the surface of the water than they were enveloped in a lance of flame snatched up and swallowed How big will he grow Dany asked curiously Do you know

In the Seven Kingdoms there are tales of dragons who grew so huge that they could pluck giant krakens from the seas

Dany laughed That would be a wondrous sight to see

It is only a tale Khaleesi said her exile knight They talk of wise old dragons living a thousand years as well

Well how long does a dragon live She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship his wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails

Ser Jorah shrugged A dragon’s natural span of days is many times as long as a man’s or so the songs would have us believe    but the dragons the Seven Kingdoms knew best were those of House Targaryen They were bred for war and in war they died It is no easy thing to slay a dragon but it can be done

The squire Whitebeard standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about his tall hardwood staff turned toward them and said Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator He was so large he could swallow an aurochs whole A dragon never stops growing Your Grace so long as he has food and freedom His name was Arstan but Strong Belwas had named him Whitebeard for his pale whiskers and most everyone called him that now He was taller than Ser Jorah though not so muscular his eyes were a pale blue his long beard as white as snow and as fine as silk

Freedom asked Dany curious What do you mean

In King’s Landing your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for their dragons The Dragonpit it is called It still stands atop the Hill of Rhaenys though all in ruins now That was where the royal dragons dwelt in days of yore and a cavernous dwelling it was with iron doors so wide that thirty knights could ride through them abreast Yet even so it was noted that none of the pit dragons ever reached the size of their ancestors The maesters say it was because of the walls around them and the great dome above their heads

If walls could keep us small peasants would all be tiny and kings as large as giants said Ser Jorah I’ve seen huge men born in hovels and dwarfs who dwelt in castles

Men are men Whitebeard replied Dragons are dragons

Ser Jorah snorted his disdain How profound The exile knight had no love for the old man he’d made that plain from the first What do you know of dragons anyway
