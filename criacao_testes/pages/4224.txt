effort of his new-born solicitousness A man who has
spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction
has not much spirit left for reversing his course Troy
had since yesterday faintly reversed his  but the merest
opposition had disheartened him To turn about would
have been hard enough under the greatest providential
encouragement but to find that Providence far from
helping him into a new course or showing any wish
that he might adopt one actuallyjeered his first trembling
and critical attempt in that kind was more than nature
could bear
He slowly withdrew from the grave He did not
attempt to fill up the hole replace the flowers or do
anything at all He simply threw up his cards and
forswore his game for that time and always Going out
of the churchyard silently and unobserved -- none of the
villagers having yet risen -- he passed down some fields
at the back and emerged just as secretly upon the high
road Shortly afterwards he had gone from the village
Meanwhile Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner
in the attic The door was kept locked except during
the entries and exits of Liddy for whom a bed had
been arranged in a small adjoining room The light
of Troys lantern in the churchyard was noticed about
ten oclock by the maid-servant who casually glanced
from the window in that direction whilst taking her
supper and she called Bathshebas attention to it
They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time
until Liddy was sent to bed
bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night
When her attendant was unconscious and softly breath+
ing in the next room the mistress of the house was
still looking out of the window at the faint gleam
spreading from among the trees --

not in a steady shine
but blinking like a revolving coastiight though this
appearance failed to suggest to her that a person was
passing and repassing in front of it Bathsheba sat
here till it began to rain and the light vanished when
she withdrew to lie restlessly in her bed and re-enact
in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight
Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared
she arose again and opened the window to obtain a full
breathing of the new morning air the panes being now
wet with trembling tears left by the night rain each
one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose+
hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awaken+
ing sky From the trees came the sound of steady
dripping upon the drifted leaves under them and from
the direction of the church she could hear another noise
 -- peculiar and not intermittent like the rest the purl
of water falling into a pool
Liddy knocked at eight oclock and Bathsheba un+
locked the door
 What a heavy rain weve had in the night maam
said Liddy when her inquiries about breakfast had been
made
 Yes  very heavy
Did you hear the strange noise from the church
yard
I heard one strange noise Ive been thinking it
must have been the water from the tower spouts
Well thats what the shepherd was saying maam
Hes now gone on to see
Oh Gabriel has been here this morning
Only just looked in in passing -- quite in his old way
which I thought he had left off lately But the tower
spouts used to spatter on the stones and we are puzzled
for this was like the boiling of a pot
Not being able to read think or work Bathsheba asked
Liddy to stay and breakfast with her The tongue of the
more childish womian still ran upon recent events Are
you going across to the church maam she asked
Not that I know of said Bathsheba
I thought you might like to go and see where they
have put Fanny The trees hide the place from your
window

Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her
husband Has Mr Troy been in to-night she said
 No maam  I think hes gone to Budmouth
Budmouth The sound of the word carried with
it a much diminished perspective of him and his deeds
there were thirteen miles interval betwixt them now
She hated questioning Liddy about her husbands
movements and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided
doing so but now all the house knew that there had
been some dreadful disagreement between them and
it was futile to attempt disguise Bathsheba had
reached a stage at which people cease to have any
appreciative regard for public opinion
What makes you think he has gone there she said
Laban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this
morning before breakfast
Bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward
heaviness of the past twenty-four hours which had
quenched the vitality of youth in her without sub+
stituting the philosophy of maturer years and the
resolved to go out and walk a little way So when
