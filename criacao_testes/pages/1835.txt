was relieved when it was got through
There a second performance in the evening and
the tent was lighted up Troy had taken his part very
quietly this time venturing to indroduce a few speeches
on occasion  and was just concluding it when whilst
standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first
row of spectators he observed within a yard of him the
eye of a man darted keenly into his side features Troy
hastily shifted his position after having recognized in
sworn enemy who still hung about the outskirts of
At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide
by circumstances That he had been recongnized by
this man was highly probable yet there was room for
a doubt Then the great objection he had felt to
allowing news of his proximity to precede him to
Weatherbury in the event of his return based on a
feeling that knowledge of his present occupation would
discredit him still further in his wifes eyes returned
in full force Moreover should he resolve not to
return at all a tale of his being alive and being in
the neighbourhood would be

awkward  and he was
anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wifes temporal
affairs before deciding which to do
In this dilemma Troy at once went out to recon+
noitre It occurred to him that to find Pennyways and
make a friend of him if possible would be a very wise
act He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the
establishment and this he wandered about the fair+
field It was now almost dark and respectable people
were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home
The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided
by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town This was
considered an unexceptionable place for obtaining the
necessary food and rest Host Trencher as he was
jauntily called by the local newspaper being a sub+
stantial man of high repute for catering through all the
county round The tent was divided into first and
second-class compartments and at the end of the first+
class division was a yet further enclosure for the most
exclusive fenced of from the body of the tent by a
luncheon-bar behind which the host himself stood
bustling about in white apron and shirt-sleeves and look+
ing as if he had never lived anywhere but under canvas
all his life In these penetralia were chairs and a table
which on candles being lighted made quite a cozy and
luxurious show with an urn plated tea and coffee pots
china teacups and plum cakes
Troy stood at the entrance to the booth where a
gipsy-woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of
sticks and selling them at a penny a-piece and looked
over the heads of the people within He could see
nothing of Pennyways but he soon discerned Bathsheba
through an opening into the reserved space at the
further end Troy thereupon retreated went round the
tent into the darkness and listened He could hear
Bathshebas voice immediately inside the canvas  she
was conversing with a man A warmth overspread his
face surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in
a fair He wondered if then she reckoned upon his
death as an absolute certainty To get at the root of
the matter Troy took a penknife from his pocket and
softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth which
by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a
P 407
wafer Close to this he placed his face withdrawing
it again in a movement of surprise for his eye had
been within twelve inches of the top of Bathshebas
head lt was too near to be convenient He made
another hole a little to one side and lower down in a
shaded place beside her chair from which it was easy
and safe to survey her by looking horizontally
Troy took in the scene completely now She was
leaning back sipping a cup of tea that she held in her
hand and the owner of the male voice was Boldwood
who had apparently just brought the cup to her
Bathsheba being in a negligent mood leant so idly
against the canvas that it was pressed to the shape of
her shoulder and she was in fact as good as in rioys
arms and he was obliged to keep his breast carefully
backward that she might not feel its warmth through the
cloth as he gazed in
Troy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred
again within him as they had been stirred earlier in the
day She was handsome as ever and she was his It
was some minutes before he could counteract his sudden
wish to go in and claim her Then he thought how
the proud girl who had always looked down upon him
even whilst it was to love him would hate him on dis+
covering him to be a strolling player Were he to make
himself known that chapter of his life must at all risks
be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury
people or his name would be a byword throughout the
parish He would be nicknamed Turpin as long as
he lived Assuredly before he could claim her these few
past months of his existence must be entirely blotted out
Shall I get you another cup before you start
maam said Farmer Boldwood
I thank you said Bathsheba  But I must be going
