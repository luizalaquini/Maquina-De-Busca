Only the blind ones priest

The outlaws hooted none so loud as Thoros Just so Yet I am not the false priest you knew The Lord of Light has woken in my heart Many powers long asleep are waking and there are forces moving in the land I have seen them in my flames

The Hound was unimpressed Bugger your flames And you as well He looked around at the others You keep queer company for a holy man

These are my brothers Thoros said simply

Lem Lemoncloak pushed forward He and Greenbeard were the only men there tall enough to look the Hound in the eye Be careful how you bark dog We hold your life in our hands

Best wipe the shit off your fingers then The Hound laughed How long have you been hiding in this hole

Anguy the Archer bristled at the suggestion of cowardice Ask the goat if we’ve hidden Hound Ask your brother Ask the lord of leeches We’ve bloodied them all

You lot Don’t make me laugh You look more swineherds than soldiers

Some of us was swineherds said a short man Arya did not know And some was tanners or singers or masons But that was before the war come

When we left King’s Landing we were men of Winterfell and men of Darry and men of Blackhaven Mallery men and Wylde men We were knights and squires and men-at-arms lords and commoners bound together only by our purpose The voice came from the man seated amongst the weirwood roots halfway up the wall Six score of us set out to bring the king’s justice to your brother The speaker was descending the tangle of steps toward the floor Six score brave men and true led by a fool in a starry cloak A scarecrow of a man he wore a ragged black cloak speckled with stars and an iron breastplate dinted by a hundred battles A thicket of red-gold hair hid most of his face save for a bald spot above his left ear where his head had been smashed in More than eighty of our company are dead now but others have taken up the swords that fell from their hands When he reached the floor the outlaws moved aside to let him pass One of his eyes was gone Arya saw the flesh about the socket scarred and puckered and he had a dark black ring all around his neck With their help we fight on as best we can for Robert and the realm

Robert rasped Sandor Clegane incredulous

Ned Stark sent us out said pothelmed Jack-Be-Lucky but he was sitting the Iron Throne when he gave us our commands so we were never truly his men but Robert’s

Robert is the king of the worms now Is that why you’re down in the earth to keep his court for him

The king is dead the scarecrow knight admitted but we are still king’s men though the royal banner we bore was lost at the Mummer’s Ford when your brother’s butchers fell upon us He touched his breast with a fist Robert is slain but his realm remains And we defend her

Her The Hound snorted Is she your mother Dondarrion Or your whore

Dondarrion Beric Dondarrion had been handsome Sansa’s friend Jeyne had fallen in love with him Even Jeyne Poole was not so blind as to think this man was fair Yet when Arya looked at him again she saw it the remains of a forked purple lightning bolt on the cracked enamel of his breastplate

Rocks and trees and rivers that’s what your realm is made of the Hound was saying Do the rocks need defending Robert wouldn’t have thought so If he couldn’t fuck it fight it or drink it it bored him and so would you… you brave companions

Outrage swept the hollow hill Call us that name again dog and you’ll swallow that tongue Lem drew his longsword

The Hound stared at the blade with contempt Here’s a brave man baring steel on a bound captive Untie me why don’t you We’ll see how brave you are then He glanced at the Mad Huntsman behind him How about you Or did you leave all your courage in your kennels

No but I should have left you in a crow cage The Huntsman drew a knife I might still

The Hound laughed in his face

We are brothers here Thoros of Myr declared Holy brothers sworn to the realm to our god and to each other

The brotherhood without banners Tom Sevenstrings plucked a string The knights of the hollow hill

Knights Clegane made the word a sneer Dondarrion’s a knight but the rest of you are the sorriest lot of outlaws and broken men I’ve ever seen I shit better men than you

Any knight can make a knight said the scarecrow that was Beric Dondarrion and every man you see before you has felt a sword upon his shoulder We are the forgotten fellowship

Send me on my way and I’ll forget you too Clegane rasped But if you mean to murder me then bloody well get on with it You took my sword my horse and my gold so take my life and be done with it… but spare me this pious bleating

You will die soon enough dog promised Thoros but it shan’t be murder only justice
