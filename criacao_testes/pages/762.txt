up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened

121 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel saith the LORD
which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the
earth and formeth the spirit of man within him

122 Behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
people round about when they shall be in the siege both against Judah
and against Jerusalem

123 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces
though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it

124 In that day saith the LORD I will smite every horse with
astonishment and his rider with madness and I will open mine eyes
upon the house of Judah and will smite every horse of the people with
blindness

125 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart The
inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts
their God

126 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of
fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they
shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the
left and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in
Jerusalem

127 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first that the glory
of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do
not magnify themselves against Judah

128 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David and
the house of David shall be as God as the angel of the LORD before
them

129 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to
destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem

1210 And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall
mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in
bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn

1211 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the
mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon

1212 And the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the
house of David apart and their wives apart the family of the house
of Nathan apart and their wives apart 1213 The family of the house
of Levi apart and their wives apart the family of Shimei apart and
their wives apart 1214 All the families that remain every family
apart and their wives apart

131 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness

132 And it shall come to pass in that day saith the LORD of hosts
that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they
shall no more be remembered and also I will cause the prophets and
the unclean spirit to pass out of the land

133 And it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then
his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him Thou
shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD and
his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when
he prophesieth

134 And it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be
ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither
shall they wear a rough garment to deceive 135 But he shall say I
am no prophet I am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle
from my youth

136 And one shall say unto him What are these wounds in thine hands
Then he shall answer Those with which I was wounded in the house of
my friends

137 Awake O sword against my shepherd and against the man that is
my fellow saith the LORD of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep
shall be scattered and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones

138 And it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the LORD
two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be
left therein

139 And I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine
them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they
shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say It is my
people and they shall say The LORD is my God

141 Behold the day of the LORD cometh and thy spoil shall be
divided in the midst of thee

142 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle and
the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women
ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the
