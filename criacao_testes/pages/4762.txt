Brienne glanced down at herself flustered Septa Donyse padded out the bodice to give it that shape She said you sent her to me She lingered by the door as if she meant to flee at any second You look   

Different He managed a half-smile More meat on the ribs and fewer lice in my hair that’s all The stump’s the same Close the door and come here

She did as he bid her The white cloak   

   is new but I’m sure I’ll soil it soon enough

That wasn’t    I was about to say that it becomes you

She came closer hesitant Jaime did you mean what you told Ser Loras About    about King Renly and the shadow

Jaime shrugged I would have killed Renly myself if we’d met in battle what do I care who cut his throat

You said I had honor   

I’m the bloody Kingslayer remember When I say you have honor that’s like a whore vouchsafing your maidenhood He leaned back and looked up at her Steelshanks is on his way back north to deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton

You gave her to him she cried dismayed You swore an oath to Lady Catelyn   

With a sword at my throat but never mind Lady Catelyn’s dead I could not give her back her daughters even if I had them And the girl my father sent with Steelshanks was not Arya Stark

Not Arya Stark

You heard me My lord father found some skinny northern girl more or less the same age with more or less the same coloring He dressed her up in white and grey gave her a silver wolf to pin her cloak and sent her off to wed Bolton’s bastard He lifted his stump to point at her I wanted to tell you that before you went galloping off to rescue her and got yourself killed for no good purpose You’re not half bad with a sword but you’re not good enough to take on two hundred men by yourself

Brienne shook her head When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid him with false coin   

Oh he knows Lannisters lie remember It makes no matter this girl serves his purpose just as well Who is going to say that she isn’t Arya Stark Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for her sister who has disappeared

Why would you tell me all this if it’s true You are betraying your father’s secrets

The Hand’s secrets he thought I no longer have a father I pay my debts like every good little lion I did promise Lady Stark her daughters    and one of them is still alive My brother may know where she is but if so he isn’t saying Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped him murder Joffrey

The wench’s mouth got stubborn I will not believe that gentle girl a poisoner Lady Catelyn said that she had a loving heart It was your brother There was a trial Ser Loras said

Two trials actually Words and swords both failed him A bloody mess Did you watch from your window

My cell faces the sea I heard the shouting though

Prince Oberyn of Dorne is dead Ser Gregor Clegane lies dying and Tyrion stands condemned before the eyes of gods and men They’re keeping him in a black cell till they kill him

Brienne looked at him You do not believe he did it

Jaime gave her a hard smile See wench We know each other too well Tyrion’s wanted to be me since he took his first step but he’d never follow me in kingslaying Sansa Stark killed Joffrey My brother’s kept silent to protect her He gets these fits of gallantry from time to time The last one cost him a nose This time it will mean his head

No Brienne said It was not my lady’s daughter It could not have been her

There’s the stubborn stupid wench that I remember

She reddened My name is   

Brienne of Tarth Jaime sighed I have a gift for you He reached down under the Lord Commander’s chair and brought it out wrapped in folds of crimson velvet

Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite her reached out a huge freckled hand and flipped back a fold of cloth Rubies glimmered in the light She picked the treasure up gingerly curled her fingers around the leather grip and slowly slid the sword free of its scabbard Blood and black the ripples shone A finger of reflected light ran red along the edge Is this Valyrian steel I have never seen such colors

Nor I There was a time that I would have given my right hand to wield a sword like that Now it appears I have so the blade is wasted on me Take it Before she could think to refuse he went on A sword so fine must bear a name It would please me if you would call this one Oathkeeper One more thing The blade comes with a price

Her face darkened I told you I will never serve   

   such foul creatures as us Yes I recall Hear me out Brienne Both of us swore oaths concerning Sansa Stark Cersei means to see that the girl is found and killed wherever she has gone to ground   

Brienne’s homely face twisted in fury If you believe that I would harm my lady’s daughter for a sword you—

Just listen he snapped angered by her assumption I want you to find Sansa first and get her somewhere safe How else are the two of us going to make good our stupid vows to your precious dead Lady Catelyn

The wench blinked I    I thought   

I know what you thought Suddenly Jaime was sick of the sight of her She bleats like a bloody sheep When Ned Stark died his greatsword was given to the King’s Justice he told her But my father felt that such a fine blade was wasted on a mere headsman He gave Ser Ilyn a new sword and had Ice melted down and reforged There was enough metal for two new blades You’re holding one So you’ll be defending Ned Stark’s daughter with Ned Stark’s own steel if that makes any difference to you

Ser I    I owe you an apolo   

He cut her off Take the bloody sword and go before I change my mind There’s a bay mare in the stables as homely as you are but somewhat better trained Chase after Steelshanks search for Sansa or ride home to your isle of sapphires it’s naught to me I don’t want to look at you anymore

Jaime   

Kingslayer he reminded her Best use that sword to clean the wax out of your ears wench We’re done

Stubbornly she persisted Joffrey was your   

My king Leave it at that

You say Sansa killed him Why protect her

Because Joff was no more to me than a squirt of seed in Cersei’s cunt And because he deserved to die I have made kings and unmade them Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor Jaime smiled thinly Besides kingslayers should band together Are you ever going to go

Her big hand wrapped tight around Oathkeeper I will And I will find the girl and keep her safe For her lady mother’s sake And for yours She bowed stiffly whirled and went

Jaime sat alone at the table while the shadows crept across the room As dusk began to settle he lit a candle and opened the White Book to his own page Quill and ink he found in a drawer Beneath the last line Ser Barristan had entered he wrote in an awkward hand that might have done credit to a six-year-old being taught his first letters by a maester

Defeated in the Whispering Wood by the Young Wolf Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings Held captive at Riverrun and ransomed for a promise unfulfilled Captured again by the Brave Companions and maimed at the word of Vargo Hoat their captain losing his sword hand to the blade of Zollo the Fat Returned safely to King’s Landing by Brienne the Maid of Tarth

When he was done more than three-quarters of his page still remained to be filled between the gold lion on the crimson shield on top and the blank white shield at the bottom Ser Gerold Hightower had begun his history and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it but the rest Jaime Lannister would need to write for himself He could write whatever he chose henceforth

Whatever he chose
