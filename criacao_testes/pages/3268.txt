the Father for my Father is greater than I

1429 And now I have told you before it come to pass that when it is
come to pass ye might believe

1430 Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this
world cometh and hath nothing in me

1431 But that the world may know that I love the Father and as the
Father gave me commandment even so I do Arise let us go hence

151 I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman

152 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and
every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring
forth more fruit

153 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you

154 Abide in me and I in you As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide
in me

155 I am the vine ye are the branches He that abideth in me and I
in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do
nothing

156 If a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is
withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they
are burned

157 If ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what
ye will and it shall be done unto you

158 Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall
ye be my disciples

159 As the Father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in
my love

1510 If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as I
have kept my Fathers commandments and abide in his love

1511 These things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in
you and that your joy might be full

1512 This is my commandment That ye love one another as I have
loved you

1513 Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life
for his friends

1514 Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you

1515 Henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things
that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you

1516 Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you
that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should
remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may
give it you

1517 These things I command you that ye love one another

1518 If the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated
you

1519 If ye were of the world the world would love his own but
because ye are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the
world therefore the world hateth you

1520 Remember the word that I said unto you The servant is not
greater than his lord If they have persecuted me they will also
persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also

1521 But all these things will they do unto you for my names sake
because they know not him that sent me

1522 If I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin
but now they have no cloak for their sin

1523 He that hateth me hateth my Father also

1524 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did
they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me
and my Father

1525 But this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law They hated me without a cause

1526 But when the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from
the Father even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the
Father he shall testify of me 1527 And ye also shall bear witness
because ye have been with me from the beginning

161 These things have I spoken unto you that ye should not be
offended

162 They shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh
