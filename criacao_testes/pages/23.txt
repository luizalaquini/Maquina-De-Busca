It wasn’t fair Sansa had everything Sansa was two years older maybe by the time Arya had been born there had been nothing left Often it felt that way Sansa could sew and dance and sing She wrote poetry She knew how to dress She played the high harp and the bells Worse she was beautiful Sansa had gotten their mother’s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys Arya took after their lord father Her hair was a lusterless brown and her face was long and solemn Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface and neigh whenever she came near It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse Well that and manage a household Sansa had never had much of a head for figures If she did marry Prince Joff Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward

Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs She bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya Arya grinned The wolf pup loved her even if no one else did They went everywhere together and Nymeria slept in her room at the foot of her bed If Mother had not forbidden it Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then

Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her She had yellow eyes When they caught the sunlight they gleamed like two golden coins Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne who had led her people across the narrow sea That had been a great scandal too Sansa of course had named her pup Lady Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight Nymeria licked her ear and she giggled

By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother If she went to her room they would find her Arya did not care to be found She had a better notion The boys were at practice in the yard She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back Come she whispered to Nymeria She got up and ran the wolf coming hard at her heels

There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard That was where they headed

They arrived flushed and breathless to find Jon seated on the sill one leg drawn up languidly to his chin He was watching the action so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet Ghost already larger than his litter mates smelled her gave her ear a careful nip and settled back down

Jon gave her a curious look Shouldn’t you be working on your stitches little sister

Arya made a face at him I wanted to see them fight

He smiled Come here then

Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below

To her disappointment it was the younger boys drilling Bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed and Prince Tommen who was plump to begin with seemed positively round They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel the master-at-arms a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers A dozen spectators man and boy were calling out encouragement Robb’s voice the loudest among them She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House a look of wry contempt on his face Both of the combatants were staggering Arya judged that they had been at it awhile

A shade more exhausting than needlework Jon observed

A shade more fun than needlework Arya gave back at him Jon grinned reached over and messed up her hair Arya flushed They had always been close Jon had their father’s face as she did They were the only ones Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys with easy smiles and fire in their hair When Arya had been little she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too It been Jon she had gone to in her fear and Jon who had reassured her

Why aren’t you down in the yard Arya asked him

He gave her a half smile Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes he said Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords

Oh Arya felt abashed She should have realized For the second time today Arya reflected that life was not fair

She watched her little brother whack at Tommen I could do just as good as Bran she said He’s only seven I’m nine

Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom You’re too skinny he said He took her arm to feel her muscle Then he sighed and shook his head I doubt you could even lift a longsword little sister never mind swing one

Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him Jon messed up her hair again They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other

You see Prince Joffrey Jon asked

She hadn’t not at first glance but when she looked again she found him to the back under the shade of the high stone wall He was surrounded by men she did not recognize young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon strangers all There were a few older men among them knights she surmised

Look at the arms on his surcoat Jon suggested

Arya looked An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince’s padded surcoat No doubt the needlework was exquisite The arms were divided down the middle on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House on the other the lion of Lannister

The Lannisters are proud Jon observed You’d think the royal sigil would be sufficient but no He makes his mother’s House equal in honor to the king’s

The woman is important too Arya protested

Jon chuckled Perhaps you should do the same thing little sister Wed Tully to Stark in your arms

A wolf with a fish in its mouth It made her laugh That would look silly Besides if a girl can’t fight why should she have a coat of arms
