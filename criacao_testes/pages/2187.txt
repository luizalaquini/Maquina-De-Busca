What bloody bird The last thing he needed now was some mutton-head going on about a bird

The Old Bear’s raven Small Paul said If we kill him who’s going to feed his bird

Who bloody well cares Kill the bird too if you like

I don’t want to hurt no bird the big man said But that’s a talking bird What if it tells what we did

Lark the Sisterman laughed Small Paul thick as a castle wall he mocked

You shut up with that said Small Paul dangerously

Paul said Chett before the big man got too angry when they find the old man lying in a pool of blood with his throat slit they won’t need no bird to tell them someone killed him

Small Paul chewed on that a moment That’s true he allowed Can I keep the bird then I like that bird

He’s yours said Chett just to shut him up

We can always eat him if we get hungry offered Lark

Small Paul clouded up again Best not try and eat my bird Lark Best not

Chett could hear voices drifting through the trees Close your bloody mouths both of you We’re almost to the Fist

They emerged near the west face of the hill and walked around south where the slope was gentler Near the edge of the forest a dozen men were taking archery practice They had carved outlines on the trunks of trees and were loosing shafts at them Look said Lark A pig with a bow

Sure enough the nearest bowman was Ser Piggy himself the fat boy who had stolen his place with Maester Aemon Just the sight of Samwell Tarly filled him with anger Stewarding for Maester Aemon had been as good a life as he’d ever known The old blind man was undemanding and Clydas had taken care of most of his wants anyway Chett’s duties were easy cleaning the rookery a few fires to build a few meals to fetch    and Aemon never once hit him Thinks he can just walk in and shove me out on account of being highborn and knowing how to read Might be I’ll ask him to read my knife before I open his throat with it You go on he told the others I want to watch this The dogs were pulling anxious to go with them to the food they thought would be waiting at the top Chett kicked the bitch with the toe of his boot and that settled them down some

He watched from the trees as the fat boy wrestled with a longbow as tall as he was his red moon face screwed up with concentration Three arrows stood in the ground before him Tarly nocked and drew held the draw a long moment as he tried to aim and let fly The shaft vanished into the greenery Chett laughed loudly a snort of sweet disgust

We’ll never find that one and I’ll be blamed announced Edd Tollett the dour grey-haired squire everyone called Dolorous Edd Nothing ever goes missing that they don’t look at me ever since that time I lost my horse As if that could be helped He was white and it was snowing what did they expect

The wind took that one said Grenn another friend of Lord Snow’s Try to hold the bow steady Sam

It’s heavy the fat boy complained but he pulled the second arrow all the same This one went high sailing through the branches ten feet above the target

I believe you knocked a leaf off that tree said Dolorous Edd Fall is falling fast enough there’s no need to help it He sighed And we all know what follows fall Gods but I am cold Shoot the last arrow Samwell I believe my tongue is freezing to the roof of my mouth

Ser Piggy lowered the bow and Chett thought he was going to start bawling It’s too hard

Notch draw and loose said Grenn Go on

Dutifully the fat boy plucked his final arrow from the earth notched it to his longbow drew and released He did it quickly without squinting along the shaft painstakingly as he had the first two times The arrow struck the charcoal outline low in the chest and hung quivering I hit him Ser Piggy sounded shocked Grenn did you see Edd look I hit him

Put it between his ribs I’d say said Grenn

Did I kill him the fat boy wanted to know

Tollett shrugged Might have punctured a lung if he had a lung Most trees don’t as a rule He took the bow from Sam’s hand I’ve seen worse shots though Aye and made a few

Ser Piggy was beaming To look at him you’d think he’d actually done something But when he saw Chett and the dogs his smile curled up and died squeaking

You hit a tree Chett said Let’s see how you shoot when it’s Mance Rayder’s lads They won’t stand there with their arms out and their leaves rustling oh no They’ll come right at you screaming in your face and I bet you’ll piss those breeches One o’ them will plant his axe right between those little pig eyes The last thing you’ll hear will be the thunk it makes when it bites into your skull

The fat boy was shaking Dolorous Edd put a hand on his shoulder Brother he said solemnly just because it happened that way for you doesn’t mean Samwell will suffer the same

What are you talking about Tollett

The axe that split your skull Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate them

The big lout Grenn laughed and even Samwell Tarly managed a weak little smile Chett kicked the nearest dog yanked on their leashes and started up the hill Smile all you want Ser Piggy We’ll see who laughs tonight He only wished he had time to kill Tollett as well Gloomy horsefaced fool that’s what he is

The climb was steep even on this side of the Fist which had the gentlest slope Partway up the dogs started barking and pulling at him figuring that they’d get fed soon He gave them a taste of his boot instead and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that snapped at him Once they were tied up he went to report The prints were there like Giant said but the dogs wouldn’t track he told Mormont in front of his big black tent Down by the river like that could be old prints

A pity Lord Commander Mormont had a bald head and a great shaggy grey beard and sounded as tired as he looked We might all have been better for a bit of fresh meat The raven on his shoulder bobbed its head and echoed Meat Meat Meat

We could cook the bloody dogs Chett thought but he kept his mouth shut until the Old Bear sent him on his way And that’s the last time I’ll need to bow my head to that one he thought to himself with satisfaction It seemed to him that it was growing even colder which he would have sworn wasn’t possible The dogs huddled together miserably in the hard frozen mud and Chett was half tempted to crawl in with them Instead he wrapped a black wool scarf round the lower part of his face leaving a slit for his mouth between the winds It was warmer if he kept moving he found so he made a slow circuit of the perimeter with a wad of sourleaf sharing a chew or two with the black brothers on guard and hearing what they had to say None of the men on the day watch were part of his scheme even so he figured it was good to have some sense of what they were thinking

Mostly what they were thinking was that it was bloody cold

The wind was rising as the shadows lengthened It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall I hate that sound little Giant said It sounds like a babe in the brush wailing away for milk

When he finished the circuit and returned to the dogs he found Lark waiting for him The officers are in the Old Bear’s tent again talking something fierce

That’s what they do said Chett They’re highborn all but Blane they get drunk on words instead of wine

Lark sidled closer Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird he warned glancing about to make certain no one was close Now he’s asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing

It’s a raven said Chett It eats corpses

Lark grinned His might be

Or yours It seemed to Chett that they needed the big man more than they needed Lark Stop fretting about Small Paul You do your part he’ll do his

Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid himself of the Sisterman and sat down to edge his sword It was bloody hard work with his gloves on but he wasn’t about to take them off Cold as it was any fool that touched steel with a bare hand was going to lose a patch of skin

The dogs whimpered when the sun went down He gave them water and curses Half a night more and you can find your own feast By then he could smell supper

Dywen was holding forth at the cookfire as Chett got his heel of hardbread and a bowl of bean and bacon soup from Hake the cook The wood’s too silent the old forester was saying No frogs near that river no owls in the dark I never heard no deader wood than this

Them teeth of yours sound pretty dead said Hake

Dywen clacked his wooden teeth No wolves neither There was before but no more Where’d they go you figure

Someplace warm said Chett

Of the dozen odd brothers who sat by the fire four were his He gave each one a hard squinty look as he ate to see if any showed signs of breaking Dirk seemed calm enough sitting silent and sharpening his blade the way he did every night And Sweet Donnel Hill was all easy japes He had white teeth and fat red lips and yellow locks that he wore in an artful tumble about his shoulders and he claimed to be the bastard of some Lannister Maybe he was at that Chett had no use for pretty boys nor for bastards neither but Sweet Donnel seemed like to hold his own

He was less certain about the forester the brothers called Sawwood more for his snoring than for anything to do with trees Just now he looked so restless he might never snore again And Maslyn was worse Chett could see sweat trickling down his face despite the frigid wind The beads of moisture sparkled in the firelight like so many little wet jewels Maslyn wasn’t eating neither only staring at his soup as if the smell of it was about to make him sick I’ll need to watch that one Chett thought
