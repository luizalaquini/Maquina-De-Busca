Because of the rather small vocabulary the number of messages that can be
stored in their entirety rather than being formed by concatenation of
smaller units and the short time which was available for development
System X stores speech as a time waveform slightly compressed by a time-domain
encoding operation such techniques are described in Chapter 3
Utterances which contain variable parts like the time of alarm in the messages
above are formed by inserting separately-recorded digits in a fixed 
carrier message  No attempt is made to apply uniform intonation
contours to the synthetic utterances  The resulting speech is of excellent
quality being a slightly compressed recording of a human voice but sometimes
exhibits somewhat anomalous pitch contours
For example the digits comprising numbers often sound rather jerky and
out-of-context em which indeed they are

Even more advanced facilities can be expected on telephone exchanges in
the future  A message storage capability is one example  Although
automatic call recording machines have been available for years a centralized
facility could time and date a message collect the callers identity
using the telephone keypad and allow the recipient to select messages left
for him through an interactive dialogue so that he could control the order
in which he listens to them  He could choose to leave certain messages to be
dealt with later or re-route them to a colleague  He may even wish to leave
reminders for himself to be dialled automatically at specified times like
alarm calls with user-defined information attached  The sender of a message
could be informed automatically by the system when it is delivered  None of
this requires speech recognition but it does need economical speech

Some current research in speech communication with computers is aimed at
embedding the dialogue in a task environment which provides it with an overall
contextual framework
This in fact was the motivation for the experimental telephone enquiry service
described above and it was observed that people are able to tolerate rather
low quality speech if they feel that the interaction is worthwhile  One step
further is the use of speech
ul
input
as well as output and here the context of the conversation which is provided
by the task environment can be used to improve recognition accuracy
significantly
