The Spider was right Tyrion groped through the dragon-haunted darkness for his smallclothes feeling wretched The risk he was taking left him tight as a drumhead and there was guilt as well The Others can take my guilt he thought as he slipped his tunic over his head Why should I be guilty My wife wants no part of me and most especially not the part that seems to want her Perhaps he ought to tell her about Shae It was not as though he was the first man ever to keep a concubine Sansa’s own oh-so-honorable father had given her a bastard brother For all he knew his wife might be thrilled to learn that he was fucking Shae so long as it spared her his unwelcome touch

No I dare not Vows or no his wife could not be trusted She might be maiden between the legs but she was hardly innocent of betrayal she had once spilled her own father’s plans to Cersei And girls her age were not known for keeping secrets

The only safe course was to rid himself of Shae I might send her to Chataya Tyrion reflected reluctantly In Chataya’s brothel Shae would have all the silks and gems she could wish for and the gentlest highborn patrons It would be a better life by far than the one she had been living when he’d found her

Or if she was tired of earning her bread on her back he might arrange a marriage for her Bronn perhaps The sellsword had never balked at eating off his master’s plate and he was a knight now a better match than she could elsewise hope for Or Ser Tallad Tyrion had noticed that one gazing wistfully at Shae more than once Why not He’s tall strong not hard to look upon every inch the gifted young knight Of course Tallad knew Shae only as a pretty young lady’s maid in service at the castle If he wed her and then learned she was a whore…

M’lord where are you Did the dragons eat you up

No Here He groped at a dragon skull I have found a shoe but I believe it’s yours

M’lord sounds very solemn Have I displeased you

No he said too curtly You always please me And therein is our danger He might dream of sending her away at times like this but that never lasted long Tyrion saw her dimly through the gloom pulling a woolen sock up a slender leg I can see A vague light was leaking through the row of long narrow windows set high in the cellar wall The skulls of the Targaryen dragons were emerging from the darkness around them black amidst grey Day comes too soon A new day A new year A new century I survived the Green Fork and the Blackwater I can bloody well survive King Joffrey’s wedding

Shae snatched her dress down off the dragon’s tooth and slipped it over her head I’ll go up first Brella will want help with the bathwater She bent over to give him one last kiss upon the brow My giant of Lannister I love you so

And I love you as well sweetling A whore she might well be but she deserved better than what he had to give her I will wed her to Ser Tallad He seems a decent man And tall…





Sansa


That was such a sweet dream Sansa thought drowsily She had been back in Winterfell running through the godswood with her Lady Her father had been there and her brothers all of them warm and safe If only dreaming could make it so…

She threw back the coverlets I must be brave Her torments would soon be ended one way or the other If Lady was here I would not be afraid Lady was dead though Robb Bran Rickon Arya her father her mother even Septa Mordane All of them are dead but me She was alone in the world now

Her lord husband was not beside her but she was used to that Tyrion was a bad sleeper and often rose before the dawn Usually she found him in the solar hunched beside a candle lost in some old scroll or leatherbound book Sometimes the smell of the morning bread from the ovens took him to the kitchens and sometimes he would climb up to the roof garden or wander all alone down Traitor’s Walk

She threw back the shutters and shivered as gooseprickles rose along her arms There were clouds massing in the eastern sky pierced by shafts of sunlight They look like two huge castles afloat in the morning sky Sansa could see their walls of tumbled stone their mighty keeps and barbicans Wispy banners swirled from atop their towers and reached for the fast-fading stars The sun was coming up behind them and she watched them go from black to grey to a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson Soon the wind mushed them together and there was only one castle where there had been two

She heard the door open as her maids brought the hot water for her bath They were both new to her service Tyrion said the women who’d tended to her previously had all been Cersei’s spies just as Sansa had always suspected Come see she told them There’s a castle in the sky

They came to have a look It’s made of gold Shae had short dark hair and bold eyes She did all that was asked of her but sometimes she gave Sansa the most insolent looks A castle all of gold there’s a sight I’d like to see

A castle is it Brella had to squint That tower’s tumbling over looks like It’s all ruins that is

Sansa did not want to hear about falling towers and ruined castles She closed the shutters and said We are expected at the queen’s breakfast Is my lord husband in the solar

No m’lady said Brella I have not seen him

Might be he went to see his father Shae declared Might be the King’s Hand had need of his counsel

Brella gave a sniff Lady Sansa you’ll be wanting to get into the tub before the water gets too cool

Sansa let Shae pull her shift up over her head and climbed into the big wooden tub She was tempted to ask for a cup of wine to calm her nerves The wedding was to be at midday in the Great Sept of Baelor across the city And come evenfall the feast would be held in the throne room a thousand guests and seventy-seven courses with singers and jugglers and mummers But first came breakfast in the Queen’s Ballroom for the Lannisters and the Tyrell men—the Tyrell women would be breaking their fast with Margaery—and a hundred odd knights and lordlings They have made me a Lannister Sansa thought bitterly

Brella sent Shae to fetch more hot water while she washed Sansa’s back You are trembling m’lady
