One of each would serve But if you want me to kill Gregor Clegane for you it had best be a damned big castle

The Seven Kingdoms were full of highborn maidens but even the oldest poorest and ugliest spinster in the realm would balk at wedding such lowborn scum as Bronn Unless she was soft of body and soft of head with a fatherless child in her belly from having been raped half a hundred times Lady Tanda had been so desperate to find a husband for Lollys that she had even pursued Tyrion for a time and that had been before half of King’s Landing enjoyed her No doubt Cersei had sweetened the offer somehow and Bronn was a knight now which made him a suitable match for a younger daughter of a minor house

I find myself woefully short of both castles and highborn maidens at the moment Tyrion admitted But I can offer you gold and gratitude as before

I have gold What can I buy with gratitude

You might be surprised A Lannister pays his debts

Your sister is a Lannister too

My lady wife is heir to Winterfell Should I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders I may one day rule the north in her name I could carve you out a big piece of it

If and when and might be said Bronn And it’s bloody cold up there Lollys is soft warm and close I could be poking her two nights hence

Not a prospect I would relish

Is that so Bronn grinned Admit it Imp Given a choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain you’d have your breeches down and cock up before a man could blink

He knows me too bloody well Tyrion tried a different tack I’d heard that Ser Gregor was wounded on the Red Fork and again at Duskendale The wounds are bound to slow him

Bronn looked annoyed He was never fast Only freakish big and freakish strong I’ll grant you he’s quicker than you’d expect for a man that size He has a monstrous long reach and doesn’t seem to feel blows the way a normal man would

Does he frighten you so much asked Tyrion hoping to provoke him

If he didn’t frighten me I’d be a bloody fool Bronn gave a shrug Might be I could take him Dance around him until he was so tired of hacking at me that he couldn’t lift his sword Get him off his feet somehow When they’re flat on their backs it don’t matter how tall they are Even so it’s chancy One misstep and I’m dead Why should I risk it I like you well enough ugly little whoreson that you are… but if I fight your battle I lose either way Either the Mountain spills my guts or I kill him and lose Stokeworth I sell my sword I don’t give it away I’m not your bloody brother

No said Tyrion sadly You’re not He waved a hand Begone then Run to Stokeworth and Lady Lollys May you find more joy in your marriage bed than I ever found in mine

Bronn hesitated at the door What will you do Imp

Kill Gregor myself Won’t that make for a jolly song

I hope I hear them sing it Bronn grinned one last time and walked out of the door the castle and his life

Pod shuffled his feet I’m sorry

Why Is it your fault that Bronn’s an insolent black-hearted rogue He’s always been an insolent black-hearted rogue That’s what I liked about him Tyrion poured himself a cup of wine and took it to the window seat Outside the day was grey and rainy but the prospect was still more cheerful than his He could send Podrick Payne questing after Shagga he supposed but there were so many hiding places in the deep of the kingswood that outlaws often evaded capture for decades And Pod sometimes has difficulty finding the kitchens when I send him down for cheese Timett son of Timett would likely be back in the Mountains of the Moon by now And despite what he’d told Bronn going up against Ser Gregor Clegane in his own person would be a bigger farce than Joffrey’s jousting dwarfs He did not intend to die with gales of laughter ringing in his ears So much for trial by combat

Ser Kevan paid him another call later that day and again the day after Sansa had not been found his uncle informed him politely Nor the fool Ser Dontos who’d vanished the same night Did Tyrion have any more witnesses he wished to summon He did not How do I bloody well prove I didn’t poison the wine when a thousand people saw me fill Joff’s cup

He did not sleep at all that night

Instead he lay in the dark staring up at the canopy and counting his ghosts He saw Tysha smiling as she kissed him saw Sansa naked and shivering in fear He saw Joffrey clawing his throat the blood running down his neck as his face turned black He saw Cersei’s eyes Bronn’s wolfish smile Shae’s wicked grin Even thought of Shae could not arouse him He fondled himself thinking that perhaps if he woke his cock and satisfied it he might rest more easily afterward but it was no good

And then it was dawn and time for his trial to begin

It was not Ser Kevan who came for him that morning but Ser Addam Marbrand with a dozen gold cloaks Tyrion had broken his fast on boiled eggs burned bacon and fried bread and dressed in his finest Ser Addam he said I had thought my father might send the Kingsguard to escort me to trial I am still a member of the royal family am I not

You are my lord but I fear that most of the Kingsguard stand witness against you Lord Tywin felt it would not be proper for them to serve as your guards

Gods forbid we do anything improper Please lead on
