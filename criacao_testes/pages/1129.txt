Obsidian Maester Luwin insisted holding out his wounded arm Forged in the fires of the gods far below the earth The children of the forest hunted with that thousands of years ago The children worked no metal In place of mail they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark so they seemed to melt into the wood In place of swords they carried blades of obsidian

And still do Osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maester’s forearm and bound them tight with long strips of linen

Bran held the arrowhead up close The black glass was slick and shiny He thought it beautiful Can I keep one

As you wish the maester said

I want one too Rickon said I want four I’m four

Luwin made him count them out Careful they’re still sharp Don’t cut yourself

Tell me about the children Bran said It was important

What do you wish to know

Everything

Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck They were people of the Dawn Age the very first before kings and kingdoms he said In those days there were no castles or holdfasts no cities not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne There were no men at all Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms

They were a people dark and beautiful small of stature no taller than children even when grown to manhood They lived in the depths of the wood in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns Slight as they were the children were quick and graceful Male and female hunted together with weirwood bows and flying snares Their gods were the gods of the forest stream and stone the old gods whose names are secret Their wise men were called greenseers and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods How long the children reigned here or where they came from no man can know

But some twelve thousand years ago the First Men appeared from the east crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields riding horses No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire Horror-struck the children went to war The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land shattering the Arm but it was too late to close the door The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both but more children than men for men were bigger and stronger and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze Finally the wise of both races prevailed and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called Gods Eye

There they forged the Pact The First Men were given the coastlands the high plains and bright meadows the mountains and bogs but the deep woods were to remain forever the children’s and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm So the gods might bear witness to the signing every tree on the island was given a face and afterward the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces

The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children In time the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age and began the Age of Heroes

Bran’s fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead But the children of the forest are all gone now you said

Here they are said Osha as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth North of the Wall things are different That’s where the children went and the giants and the other old races

Maester Luwin sighed Woman by rights you ought to be dead or in chains The Starks have treated you more gently than you deserve It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys’ heads with folly

Tell me where they went Bran said I want to know

Me too Rickon echoed

Oh very well Luwin muttered So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway the Pact endured all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms yet finally there came a time many centuries later when other peoples crossed the narrow sea

The Andals were the first a race of tall fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests The wars lasted hundreds of years but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before them Only here where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck did the rule of the First Men endure The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves hacked down the faces slaughtered the children where they found them and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods So the children fled north—

Summer began to howl

Maester Luwin broke off startled When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brother’s dread clutched at Bran’s heart It’s coming he whispered with the certainty of despair He had known it since last night he realized since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell He had known it but he had not believed He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right The crow he thought the three-eyed crow…

The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun Summer padded across the tower floor to Shaggydog and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother’s neck From the window came a flutter of wings

A raven landed on the grey stone sill opened its beak and gave a harsh raucous rattle of distress

Rickon began to cry His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor Bran pulled him close and hugged him

Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers He rose slow as a sleepwalker and moved to the window When he whistled the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm There was dried blood on its wings A hawk Luwin murmured perhaps an owl Poor thing a wonder it got through He took the letter from its leg

Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper What is it he said holding his brother all the harder

You know what it is boy Osha said not unkindly She put her hand on his head

Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes My lords he said to the sons in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken we… we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well…





SANSA

In the tower room at the heart of Maegor’s Holdfast Sansa gave herself to the darkness

She drew the curtains around her bed slept woke weeping and slept again When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief Servants came and went bringing meals but the sight of food was more than she could bear The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window untouched and spoiling until the servants took them away again

Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes Yet those were the best times for when she dreamed she dreamed of Father Waking or sleeping she saw him saw the gold cloaks fling him down saw Ser Ilyn striding forward unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on his back saw the moment… the moment when… she had wanted to look away she had wanted to her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees yet somehow she could not turn her head and all the people were screaming and shouting and her prince had smiled at her he’d smiled and she’d felt safe but only for a heartbeat until he said those words and her father’s legs… that was what she remembered his legs the way they’d jerked when Ser Ilyn… when the sword…

Perhaps I will die too she told herself and the thought did not seem so terrible to her If she flung herself from the window she could put an end to her suffering and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief Her body would lie on the stones below broken and innocent shaming all those who had betrayed her Sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the shutters… but then her courage left her and she ran back to her bed sobbing

The serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals but she never answered them Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles to ask if she was ill He felt her brow made her undress and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night She drank it all right then and went back to sleep

She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber step by step All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen trembling as he came closer and closer It was Ser Ilyn Payne she knew coming for her with Ice in his hand coming to take her head There was no place to run no place to hide no way to bar the door Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside standing there silent with his dead eyes and his long pocked face That was when she realized she was naked She crouched down trying to cover herself with her hands as her door began to swing open creaking the point of the greatsword poking through…

She woke murmuring Please please I’ll be good I’ll be good please don’t but there was no one to hear

When they finally came for her in truth Sansa never heard their footsteps It was Joffrey who opened her door not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince She was in bed curled up tight her curtains drawn and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight The first thing she heard was the slam of the door Then her bed hangings were yanked back and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her

You will attend me in court this afternoon Joffrey said See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle his burned face hideous in the morning light Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks

Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself No she whimpered please… leave me be

If you won’t rise and dress yourself my Hound will do it for you Joffrey said

I beg of you my prince…

I’m king now Dog get her out of bed

Sandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly Her blanket fell to the floor Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness Do as you’re bid child Clegane said Dress He pushed her toward her wardrobe almost gently

Sansa backed away from them I did as the queen asked I wrote the letters I wrote what she told me You promised you’d be merciful Please let me go home I won’t do any treason I’ll be good I swear it I don’t have traitor’s blood I don’t I only want to go home Remembering her courtesies she lowered her head As it please you she finished weakly

It does not please me Joffrey said Mother says I’m still to marry you so you’ll stay here and you’ll obey

I don’t want to marry you Sansa wailed You chopped off my father’s head
