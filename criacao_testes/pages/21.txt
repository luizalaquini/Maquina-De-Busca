I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie Ned said Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey That is not healthy Bran can bridge that distance He is a sweet boy quick to laugh easy to love Let him grow up with the young princes let him become their friend as Robert became mine Our House will be the safer for it

He was right Catelyn knew it It did not make the pain any easier to bear She would lose all four of them then Ned and both girls and her sweet loving Bran Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her She felt lonely already Winterfell was such a vast place Keep him off the walls then she said bravely You know how Bran loves to climb

Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall Thank you my lady he whispered This is hard I know

What of Jon Snow my lord Maester Luwin asked

Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name Ned felt the anger in her and pulled away

Many men fathered bastards Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge It came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign He had a man’s needs after all and they had spent that year apart Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun Her thoughts were more of Robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles And if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the child’s needs

He did more than that The Starks were not like other men Ned brought his bastard home with him and called him son for all the north to see When the wars were over at last and Catelyn rode to Winterfell Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence

That cut deep Ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband’s soldiers They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur’s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea The Lady Ashara Dayne tall and fair with haunting violet eyes It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage but finally in bed one night Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it asked him to his face

That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her Never ask me about Jon he said cold as ice He is my blood and that is all you need to know And now I will learn where you heard that name my lady She had pledged to obey she told him and from that day on the whispering had stopped and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again

Whoever Jon’s mother had been Ned must have loved her fiercely for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away It was the one thing she could never forgive him She had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love Jon She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned’s sake so long as they were out of sight Jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him Somehow that made it worse Jon must go she said now

He and Robb are close Ned said I had hoped…

He cannot stay here Catelyn said cutting him off He is your son not mine I will not have him It was hard she knew but no less the truth Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell

The look Ned gave her was anguished You know I cannot take him south There will be no place for him at court A boy with a bastard’s name… you know what they will say of him He will be shunned

Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband’s eyes They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself

And none of them has ever been seen at court Ned blazed The Lannister woman has seen to that How can you be so damnably cruel Catelyn He is only a boy He—

His fury was on him He might have said more and worse but Maester Luwin cut in Another solution presents itself he said his voice quiet Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago It seems the boy aspires to take the black

Ned looked shocked He asked to join the Night’s Watch

Catelyn said nothing Let Ned work it out in his own mind her voice would not be welcome now Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then His was the perfect solution Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother Jon would be a son to him the child he would never have And in time the boy would take the oath as well He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own grandchildren for Winterfell

Maester Luwin said There is great honor in service on the Wall my lord

And even a bastard may rise high in the Night’s Watch Ned reflected Still his voice was troubled Jon is so young If he asked this when he was a man grown that would be one thing but a boy of fourteen…

A hard sacrifice Maester Luwin agreed Yet these are hard times my lord His road is no crueler than yours or your lady’s

Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose It was not easy keeping silent then

Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window his long face silent and thoughtful Finally he sighed and turned back Very well he said to Maester Luwin I suppose it is for the best I will speak to Ben

When shall we tell Jon the maester asked

When I must Preparations must be made It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days Summer will end soon enough and childhood as well When the time comes I will tell him myself
