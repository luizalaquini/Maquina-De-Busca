ninth day of the month the city was broken up

393 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in
the middle gate even Nergalsharezer Samgarnebo Sarsechim Rabsaris
Nergalsharezer Rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the
king of Babylon

394 And it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of
the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate
betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain

395 But the Chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah
in the plains of Jericho and when they had taken him they brought
him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of
Hamath where he gave judgment upon him

396 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
before his eyes also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of
Judah

397 Moreover he put out Zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains
to carry him to Babylon

398 And the Chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the
people with fire and brake down the walls of Jerusalem

399 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and
those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people
that remained

3910 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
people which had nothing in the land of Judah and gave them
vineyards and fields at the same time

3911 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying 3912 Take
him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as
he shall say unto thee

3913 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and Nebushasban
Rabsaris and Nergalsharezer Rabmag and all the king of Babylons
princes 3914 Even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of
the prison and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son
of Shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the
people

3915 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah while he was shut
up in the court of the prison saying 3916 Go and speak to
Ebedmelech the Ethiopian saying Thus saith the LORD of hosts the
God of Israel Behold I will bring my words upon this city for evil
and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before
thee

3917 But I will deliver thee in that day saith the LORD and thou
shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid

3918 For I will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the
sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast
put thy trust in me saith the LORD

401 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after that
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah when
he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried
away captive of Jerusalem and Judah which were carried away captive
unto Babylon

402 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said unto him
The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place

403 Now the LORD hath brought it and done according as he hath said
because ye have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed his
voice therefore this thing is come upon you

404 And now behold I loose thee this day from the chains which were
upon thine hand If it seem good unto thee to come with me into
Babylon come and I will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto
thee to come with me into Babylon forbear behold all the land is
before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go
thither go

405 Now while he was not yet gone back he said Go back also to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan whom the king of
Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah and dwell with
him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto
thee to go So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward and let him go

406 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land

407 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields
even they and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed
unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of
them that were not carried away captive to Babylon 408 Then they
came to Gedaliah to Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and
Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah and Seraiah the son of
Tanhumeth and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah the
