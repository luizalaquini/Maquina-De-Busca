Mord grunted and opened his thick fingers The wind took the plate flipping it over as it fell A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight The turnkey laughed his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding

Tyrion felt a pang of rage You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass he spat I hope you die of a bloody flux

For that Mord gave him a kick driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion’s ribs on the way out I take it back he gasped as he doubled over on the straw I’ll kill you myself I swear it The heavy iron-bound door slammed shut Tyrion heard the rattle of keys

For a small man he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth he reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he’d won from Marillion at dice after the singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief The skin had smelled of blood and mold but it was warm and thick Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it

The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons His cell was miserably small even for a dwarf Not five feet away where a wall ought to have been where a wall would be in a proper dungeon the floor ended and the sky began He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine and the moon and stars by night but Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock

You fly Mord had promised him when he’d shoved him into the cell Twenty day thirty fifty maybe Then you fly

The Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will That first day after girding up his courage for hours Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge to poke out his head and look down Sky was six hundred feet below with nothing between but empty air If he craned his neck out as far as it could go he could see other cells to his right and left and above him He was a bee in a stone honeycomb and someone had torn off his wings

It was cold in the cell the wind screamed night and day and worst of all the floor sloped Ever so slightly yet it was enough He was afraid to close his eyes afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad

Gods save me some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood the blue is calling At first Tyrion wondered who he’d been and what had become of him later he decided that he would rather not know

If only he had shut his mouth…

The wretched boy had started it looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man Is he the bad man the boy had asked clutching his doll

He is the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him She was all in blue powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court

He’s so small the Lord of the Eyrie said giggling

This is Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister who murdered your father She raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars so every man could hear it He slew the Hand of the King

Oh did I kill him too Tyrion had said like a fool

That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed He could see that now seven hells he had seen it then The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble but the faces around him had been colder by far The power of Casterly Rock was far away and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn Submission and silence would have been his best defenses

But Tyrion’s mood had been too foul for sense To his shame he had faltered during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie his stunted legs unable to take him any higher Bronn had carried him the rest of the way and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger It would seem I’ve been a busy little fellow he said with bitter sarcasm I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering

He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit especially when it was directed at them

Imp Lysa said coldly you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely or I promise you will have cause to regret it Remember where you are This is the Eyrie and these are knights of the Vale you see around you true men who loved Jon Arryn well Every one of them would die for me

Lady Arryn should any harm come to me my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do Even as he spat out the words Tyrion knew they were folly

Can you fly my lord of Lannister Lady Lysa asked Does a dwarf have wings If not you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind

I made no threats Tyrion said That was a promise

Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that so upset he dropped his doll You can’t hurt us he screamed No one can hurt us here Tell him Mother tell him he can’t hurt us here The boy began to twitch

The Eyrie is impregnable Lysa Arryn declared calmly She drew her son close holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms The Imp is trying to frighten us sweet baby The Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my sweet boy

The hell of it was she was no doubt right Having seen what it took to get here Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for every step Nightmare did not begin to describe it Small wonder the Eyrie had never been taken

Still Tyrion had been unable to silence himself Not impregnable he said merely inconvenient

Young Robert pointed down his hand trembling You’re a liar Mother I want to see him fly Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms lifting him off his floor

The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark Sister she called out from where she stood below the thrones I beg you to remember this man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed

Lysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment then rose and swept down on Tyrion her long skirts trailing after her For an instant he feared she would strike him but instead she commanded them to release him Her men shoved him to the floor his legs went out from under him and Tyrion fell

He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees only to feel his right leg spasm sending him sprawling once more Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall of the Arryns

My sister’s little guest is too weary to stand Lady Lysa announced Ser Vardis take him down to the dungeon A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good

The guardsmen jerked him upright Tyrion Lannister dangled between them kicking feebly his face red with shame I will remember this he told them all as they carried him off

And so he did for all the good it did him

At first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long Lysa Arryn wanted to humble him that was all She would send for him again and soon If not her then Catelyn Stark would want to question him This time he would guard his tongue more closely They dare not kill him out of hand he was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock and if they shed his blood it would mean war Or so he had told himself

Now he was not so certain

Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long He was growing weaker every day and it was only a matter of time until Mord’s kicks and blows did him serious harm provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first A few more nights of cold and hunger and the blue would start calling to him too

He wondered what was happening beyond the walls such as they were of his cell Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now… unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard The king could order him freed but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand Tyrion had no illusions about the king’s love for his sister

If Cersei kept her wits about her she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that not without impugning the honor of the king And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial Whatever murders they might lay at his door the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land It would be the end of them If only Cersei were clever enough to see that…

Tyrion Lannister sighed His sister was not without a certain low cunning but her pride blinded her She would see the insult in this not the opportunity And Jaime was even worse rash and headstrong and quick to anger His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword

He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy and whether they had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn If the old Hand had been murdered it was deftly and subtly done Men of his age died of sudden illness all the time In contrast sending some oaf with a stolen knife after Brandon Stark struck him as unbelievably clumsy And wasn’t that peculiar come to think on it…

Tyrion shivered Now there was a nasty suspicion Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods and if that was true someone was using him as a catspaw Tyrion Lannister hated being used

He would have to get out of here and soon His chances of overpowering Mord were small to none and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope so he would have to talk himself free His mouth had gotten him into this cell it could damn well get him out

Tyrion pushed himself to his feet doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge He hammered on the door with a fist Mord he shouted Turnkey Mord I want you He had to keep it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps Tyrion stepped back an instant before the door opened with a crash

Making noise Mord growled with blood in his eyes Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap wide and thick doubled over in his fist

Never show them you’re afraid Tyrion reminded himself How would you like to be rich he asked

Mord hit him He swung the strap backhand lazily but the leather caught Tyrion high on the arm The force of it staggered him and the pain made him grit his teeth No mouth dwarf man Mord warned him

Gold Tyrion said miming a smile Casterly Rock is full of gold… ahhhh… This time the blow was a forehand and Mord put more of his arm into the swing making the leather crack and jump It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees wimpering He forced himself to look up at the gaoler As rich as the Lannisters he wheezed That’s what they say Mord—

Mord grunted The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face The pain was so bad he did not remember falling but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell His ear was ringing and his mouth was full of blood He groped for purchase to push himself up and his fingers brushed against… nothing Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded and tried his best to stop breathing He had fallen right on the edge inches from the blue

More to say Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull The snap made Tyrion jump The turnkey laughed

He won’t push me over Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge Catelyn Stark wants me alive he doesn’t dare kill me He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand grinned and said That was a stiff one Mord The gaoler squinted at him trying to decide if he was being mocked I could make good use of a strong man like you The strap flew at him but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away from it He took a glancing blow to the shoulder nothing more Gold he repeated scrambling backward like a crab more gold than you’ll see here in a lifetime Enough to buy land women horses… you could be a lord Lord Mord Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky
