1391 O lord thou hast searched me and known me

1392 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou
understandest my thought afar off

1393 Thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted
with all my ways

1394 For there is not a word in my tongue but lo O LORD thou
knowest it altogether

1395 Thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon
me

1396 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot
attain unto it

1397 Whither shall I go from thy spirit or whither shall I flee from
thy presence

1398 If I ascend up into heaven thou art there if I make my bed in
hell behold thou art there

1399 If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea

13910 Even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall
hold me

13911 If I say Surely the darkness shall cover me even the night
shall be light about me

13912 Yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth
as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee

13913 For thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my
mothers womb

13914 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well

13915 My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth

13916 Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in
thy book all my members were written which in continuance were
fashioned when as yet there was none of them

13917 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is
the sum of them

13918 If I should count them they are more in number than the sand
when I awake I am still with thee

13919 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked O God depart from me
therefore ye bloody men

13920 For they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take
thy name in vain

13921 Do not I hate them O LORD that hate thee and am not I
grieved with those that rise up against thee

13922 I hate them with perfect hatred I count them mine enemies

13923 Search me O God and know my heart try me and know my
thoughts

13924 And see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the
way everlasting



1401 Deliver me O LORD from the evil man preserve me from the
violent man

1402 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they
gathered together for war

1403 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison
is under their lips Selah

1404 Keep me O LORD from the hands of the wicked preserve me from
the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings

1405 The proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a
net by the wayside they have set gins for me Selah

1406 I said unto the LORD Thou art my God hear the voice of my
supplications O LORD

1407 O GOD the Lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle

1408 Grant not O LORD the desires of the wicked further not his
wicked device lest they exalt themselves Selah

1409 As for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief
of their own lips cover them
