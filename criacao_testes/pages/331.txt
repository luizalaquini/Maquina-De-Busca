Hatchlings Ser Jorah said One swipe from an arakh would put an end to them though Porto is more like to seize them for himself Your dragon eggs were more precious than rubies A living dragon is beyond price In all the world there are only three Every man who sees them will want them my queen

They are mine she said fiercely They had been born from her faith and her need given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the maegi Mirri Maz Duur Dany had walked into the flames as they came forth and they had drunk milk from her swollen breasts No man will take them from me while I live

You will not live long should you meet Khal Pono Nor Khal Jhaqo nor any of the others You must go where they do not

Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard… and when Mormont’s gruff counsel and the omens agreed her course was clear She called her people together and mounted her silver mare Her hair had burned away in Drogo’s pyre so her handmaids garbed her in the skin of the hrakkar Drogo had slain the white lion of the Dothraki sea Its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion’s mane and coiled its tail around her arm while Ser Jorah took his accustomed place by her side

We follow the comet Dany told her khalasar Once it was said no word was raised against it They had been Drogo’s people but they were hers now The Unburnt they called her and Mother of Dragons Her word was their law

They rode by night and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents Soon enough Dany learned the truth of Doreah’s words This was no kindly country They left a trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went for Pono Jhaqo and the others had seized the best of Drogo’s herds leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny the sickly and the lame the broken animals and the ill-tempered It was the same with the people They are not strong she told herself so I must be their strength I must show no fear no weakness no doubt However frightened my heart when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo’s queen She felt older than her fourteen years If ever she had truly been a girl that time was done

Three days into the march the first man died A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again An hour later he was done Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living His time was past her handmaid Irri declared No man should live longer than his teeth The others agreed Dany bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands

Two nights later it was an infant girl who perished Her mother’s anguished wailing lasted all day but there was nothing to be done The child had been too young to ride poor thing Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands she must be born again

There was little forage in the red waste and less water It was a sere and desolate land of low hills and barren windswept plains The rivers they crossed were dry as dead men’s bones Their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks and dead trees Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column but they found neither wells nor springs only bitter pools shallow and stagnant shrinking in the hot sun The deeper they rode into the waste the smaller the pools became while the distance between them grew If there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay they were hard dry gods deaf to prayers for rain

Wine gave out first and soon thereafter the clotted mare’s milk the horselords loved better than mead Then their stores of flatbread and dried meat were exhausted as well Their hunters found no game and only the flesh of their dead horses filled their bellies Death followed death Weak children wrinkled old women the sick and the stupid and the heedless the cruel land claimed them all Doreah grew gaunt and hollow-eyed and her soft golden hair turned brittle as straw

Dany hungered and thirsted with the rest of them The milk in her breasts dried up her nipples cracked and bled and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and hard as a stick yet it was her dragons she feared for Her father had been slain before she was born and her splendid brother Rhaegar as well Her mother had died bringing her into the world while the storm screamed outside Gentle Ser Willem Darry who must have loved her after a fashion had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young Her brother Viserys Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars even her unborn son the gods had claimed them all They will not have my dragons Dany vowed They will not

The dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the walls of Magister Illyrio’s estate in Pentos… until they unfolded their wings Their span was three times their length each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin gorgeously colored stretched taut between long thin bones When you looked hard you could see that most of their body was neck tail and wing Such little things she thought as she fed them by hand or rather tried to feed them for the dragons would not eat They would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat steam rising from their nostrils yet they would not take the food… until Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were children

Only dragons and men eat cooked meat he had said

When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black the dragons ripped at it eagerly their heads striking like snakes So long as the meat was seared they gulped down several times their own weight every day and at last began to grow larger and stronger Dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales and the heat that poured off them so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam

Each evenfall as the khalasar set out she would choose a dragon to ride upon her shoulder Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their mounts and rode close behind her so Dany was never out of their sight It was the only way to keep them quiescent

Aegon’s dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria she told her bloodriders one morning after a long night’s journey Visenya’s dragon was Vhagar Rhaenys had Meraxes and Aegon rode Balerion the Black Dread It was said that Vhagar’s breath was so hot that it could melt a knight’s armor and cook the man inside that Meraxes swallowed horses whole and Balerion… his fire was as black as his scales his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead

The Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily The largest of her three was shiny black his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns Khaleesi Aggo murmured there sits Balerion come again

It may be as you say blood of my blood Dany replied gravely but he shall have a new name for this new life I would name them all for those the gods have taken The green one shall be Rhaegal for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the Trident The cream-and-gold I call Viserion Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened yet he was my brother still His dragon will do what he could not

And the black beast asked Ser Jorah Mormont

The black she said is Drogon

Yet even as her dragons prospered her khalasar withered and died Around them the land turned ever more desolate Even devilgrass grew scant horses dropped in their tracks leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot Doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters her hair came out in clumps and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more She gave Doreah water from her own skin cooled her brow with a damp cloth and held her hand until she died shivering Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on

They saw no sign of other travelers The Dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the comet had led them to some hell Dany went to Ser Jorah one morning as they made camp amidst a jumble of black windscoured stones Are we lost she asked him Does this waste have no end to it

It has an end he answered wearily I have seen the maps the traders draw my queen Few caravans come this way that is so yet there are great kingdoms to the east and cities full of wonders Yi Ti Qarth Asshai by the Shadow…

Will we live to see them

I will not lie to you The way is harder than I dared think The knight’s face was grey and exhausted The wound he had taken to his hip the night he fought Khal Drogo’s bloodriders had never fully healed she could see how he grimaced when he mounted his horse and he seemed to slump in his saddle as they rode Perhaps we are doomed if we press on… but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back

Dany kissed him lightly on the cheek It heartened her to see him smile I must be strong for him as well she thought grimly A knight he may be but I am the blood of the dragon

The next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone but their skins were almost empty The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid The taste was no less foul but water was water and all of them thirsted Dany looked at the horizon with despair They had lost a third of their number and still the waste stretched before them bleak and red and endless The comet mocks my hopes she thought lifting her eyes to where it scored the sky Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with them in this hard hot desert She would not believe it
