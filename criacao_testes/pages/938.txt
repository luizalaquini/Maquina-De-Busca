Christ

18 But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be
accursed

19 As we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed

110 For do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men
for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ

111 But I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man

112 For I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by
the revelation of Jesus Christ

113 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews
religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and
wasted it 114 And profited in the Jews religion above many my
equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers

115 But when it pleased God who separated me from my mothers womb
and called me by his grace 116 To reveal his Son in me that I might
preach him among the heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh
and blood 117 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were
apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto
Damascus

118 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and
abode with him fifteen days

119 But other of the apostles saw I none save James the Lords
brother

120 Now the things which I write unto you behold before God I lie
not

121 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia 122 And
was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ
123 But they had heard only That he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed

124 And they glorified God in me

21 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
Barnabas and took Titus with me also

22 And I went up by revelation and communicated unto them that
gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately to them which
were of reputation lest by any means I should run or had run in
vain

23 But neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled
to be circumcised 24 And that because of false brethren unawares
brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage 25 To whom we
gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the
gospel might continue with you

26 But of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it
maketh no matter to me God accepteth no mans person for they who
seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me 27 But
contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was
committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter
28 For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles 29
And when James Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars perceived
the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and
they unto the circumcision

210 Only they would that we should remember the poor the same which
I also was forward to do

211 But when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face
because he was to be blamed

212 For before that certain came from James he did eat with the
Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself
fearing them which were of the circumcision

213 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that
Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation

214 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
truth of the gospel I said unto Peter before them all If thou being
a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews
why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews  215 We who
are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles 216 Knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of
Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be
justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for
by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified

217 But if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves
also are found sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God
forbid
