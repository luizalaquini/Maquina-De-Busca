A blacksmith He only had one arm

A one-armed smith slew Mag the Mighty Har That must o’ been a fight to see Mance will make a song of it see if he don’t Tormund took a waterskin off his saddle and pulled the cork This will warm us some To Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty He took a swig and handed it down to Jon

To Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty The skin was full of mead but a mead so potent that it made Jon’s eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through his chest After the ice cell and the cold ride down in the cage the warmth was welcome

Tormund took the skin back and downed another swig then wiped his mouth The Magnar of Thenn swore t’us that he’d have the gate wide open so all we’d need to do was stroll through singing He was going to bring the whole Wall down

He brought down part Jon said On his head

Har said Tormund Well I never had much use for Styr When a man’s got no beard nor hair nor ears you can’t get a good grip on him when you fight He kept his horse at a slow walk so Jon could limp beside him What happened to that leg

An arrow One of Ygritte’s I think

That’s a woman for you One day she’s kissing you the next she’s filling you with arrows

She’s dead

Aye Tormund gave a sad shake of the head A waste If I’d been ten years younger I’d have stolen her meself That hair she had Well the hottest fires burn out quickest He lifted the skin of mead To Ygritte kissed by fire He drank deep

To Ygritte kissed by fire Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin He drank even deeper

Was it you killed her

My brother Jon had never learned which one and hoped he never would

You bloody crows Tormund’s tone was gruff yet strangely gentle That Longspear stole me daughter Munda me little autumn apple Took her right out o’ my tent with all four o’ her brothers about Toregg slept through it the great lout and Torwynd… well Torwynd the Tame that says all that needs saying don’t it The young ones gave the lad a fight though

And Munda asked Jon

She’s my own blood said Tormund proudly She broke his lip for him and bit one ear half off and I hear he’s got so many scratches on his back he can’t wear a cloak She likes him well enough though And why not He don’t fight with no spear you know Never has So where do you think he got that name Har

Jon had to laugh Even now even here Ygritte had been fond of Longspear Ryk He hoped he found some joy with Tormund’s Munda Someone needed to find some joy somewhere

You know nothing Jon Snow Ygritte would have told him I know that I am going to die he thought I know that much at least All men die he could almost hear her say and women too and every beast that flies or swims or runs It’s not the when o’ dying that matters it’s the how of it Jon Snow Easy for you to say he thought back You died brave in battle storming the castle of a foe I’m going to die a turncloak and a killer Nor would his death be quick unless it came on the end of Mance’s sword

Soon they were among the tents It was the usual wildling camp a sprawling jumble of cookfires and piss pits children and goats wandering freely sheep bleating among the trees horse hides pegged up to dry There was no plan to it no order no defenses But there were men and women and animals everywhere

Many ignored him but for every one who went about his business there were ten who stopped to stare children squatting by the fires old women in dog carts cave dwellers with painted faces raiders with claws and snakes and severed heads painted on their shields all turned to have a look Jon saw spearwives too their long hair streaming in the piney wind that sighed between the trees

There were no true hills here but Mance Rayder’s white fur tent had been raised on a spot of high stony ground right on the edge of the trees The King-beyond-the-Wall was waiting outside his ragged red-and-black cloak blowing in the wind Harma Dogshead was with him Jon saw back from her raids and feints along the Wall and Varamyr Sixskins as well attended by his shadowcat and two lean grey wolves

When they saw who the Watch had sent Harma turned her head and spat and one of Varamyr’s wolves bared its teeth and growled You must be very brave or very stupid Jon Snow Mance Rayder said to come back to us wearing a black cloak

What else would a man of the Night’s Watch wear

Kill him urged Harma Send his body back up in that cage o’ theirs and tell them to send us someone else I’ll keep his head for my standard A turncloak’s worse than a dog

I warned you he was false Varamyr’s tone was mild but his shadowcat was staring at Jon hungrily through slitted grey eyes I never did like the smell o’ him

Pull in your claws beastling Tormund Giantsbane swung down off his horse The lad’s here to hear You lay a paw on him might be I’ll take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting

Tormund Crowlover Harma sneered You are a great sack o’ wind old man
