415 And the LORD discomfited Sisera and all his chariots and all
his host with the edge of the sword before Barak so that Sisera
lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet

416 But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
edge of the sword and there was not a man left

417 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife
of Heber the Kenite for there was peace between Jabin the king of
Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite

418 And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him Turn in my
lord turn in to me fear not And when he had turned in unto her into
the tent she covered him with a mantle

419 And he said unto her Give me I pray thee a little water to
drink for I am thirsty And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him
drink and covered him

420 Again he said unto her Stand in the door of the tent and it
shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say Is
there any man here that thou shalt say No

421 Then Jael Hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took an
hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into
his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep
and weary So he died

422 And behold as Barak pursued Sisera Jael came out to meet him
and said unto him Come and I will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest And when he came into her tent behold Sisera lay dead and
the nail was in his temples

423 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
children of Israel

424 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered and prevailed
against Jabin the king of Canaan until they had destroyed Jabin king
of Canaan

51 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day
saying 52 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel when the
people willingly offered themselves

53 Hear O ye kings give ear O ye princes I even I will sing
unto the LORD I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel

54 LORD when thou wentest out of Seir when thou marchedst out of
the field of Edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the
clouds also dropped water

55 The mountains melted from before the LORD even that Sinai from
before the LORD God of Israel

56 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath in the days of Jael the
highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways

57 The inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in Israel
until that I Deborah arose that I arose a mother in Israel

58 They chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield
or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel  59 My heart is toward
the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the
people Bless ye the LORD

510 Speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and
walk by the way

511 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the
LORD even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages
in Israel then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates

512 Awake awake Deborah awake awake utter a song arise Barak
and lead thy captivity captive thou son of Abinoam

513 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
among the people the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty

514 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek after
thee Benjamin among thy people out of Machir came down governors
and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer

515 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah even Issachar and
also Barak he was sent on foot into the valley For the divisions of
Reuben there were great thoughts of heart

516 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of
the flocks For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of
heart

517 Gilead abode beyond Jordan and why did Dan remain in ships
Asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches

518 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
unto the death in the high places of the field

519 The kings came and fought then fought the kings of Canaan in
Taanach by the waters of Megiddo they took no gain of money
