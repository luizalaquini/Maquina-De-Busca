The girl who wore no riding-habit looked around for
a moment as if to assure herself that all humanity was
out of view then dexterously dropped backwards flat
upon the ponys back her head over its tail her feet
against its shoulders and her eyes to the sky The
rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a
kingfisher -- its noiselessness that of a hawk Gabriels
eyes had scarcely been able to follow her The tall lank
pony seemed used to such doings and ambled

along unconcerned Thus she passed under the level boughs
The performer seemed quite at home anywhere
between a horses head and its tail and the necessity
for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the
passage of the plantation she began to adopt another
even more obviously convenient than the first She had
no side-saddle and it was very apparent that a firm
seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was un+
attainable sideways Springing to her accustomed
perpendicular like a bowed sapling and satisfying her
self that nobody was in sight she seated herself in the
manner demanded by the saddle though hardly expected
of the woman and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell
Mill
Oak was amused perhaps a little astonished and
hanging up the hat in his hut went again among his
ewes An hour passed the girl returned properly
seated now with a bag of bran in front of her On
nearing the cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing
a milking-pail who held the reins of the pony whilst
she slid off The boy led away the horse leaving the
pail with the young woman
Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came
in regular succession from within the shed the obvious
sounds of a person milking a cow Gabriel took the
lost hat in his hand and waited beside the path she
would follow in leaving the hill
She came the pail in one hand hanging against her
knee The left arm was extended as a balance enough
of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event
ha happened in the summer when the whole would
have been revealed There was a bright air and manner
about her now by which she seemed to imply that the
desirability of her existence could not be questioned
and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive
because a beholder felt it to be upon the whole true
Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius that
which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an
addition to recognised power It was with some
surprise that she saw Gabriels face rising like the
moon behind the hedge
The adjustment of the farmers hazy conceptions of

charms to the portrait of herself she now presented
him with was less a diminuition than a difference The
starting-point selected by the judgment was her height
She seemed tall but the pail was a small one and the
hedge diminutive hence making allowance for error
by comparison with these she could have been not
above the height to be chosen by women as best All
features of consequence were severe and regular It
may have been observed by persons who go about the
shires with eyes for beauty that in Englishwoman a
classically-formed face is seldom found to be united
with a figure of the same pattern the highly-finished
features being generally too large for the remainder of
the frame  that a graceful and proportionate figure of
eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves
Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid
let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out
of place and looked at her proportions with a long
consciousness of pleasure From the contours of her
figure in its upper part she must have had a beautiful
neek and shoulders  but since her infancy nobody had
ever seen them Had she been put into a low dress
she would have run and thrust her head into a bush
Yet she was not a shy girl by any means it was merely
her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the
unseen higher than they do it in towns
That the girls thoughts hovered about her face
and form as soon as she caught Oaks eyes conning the
same page was natural and almost certain The self+
consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little
more pronounced dignity if a little less Rays of male
vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces
in rural districts  she brushed hers with her hand as if
Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual
touch and the free air of her previous movements was
reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of
itself Yet it was the man who blushed the maid not
at all
 I found a hat said Oak
 It is mine said she and from a sense of proportion
kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis+
tinctly  it flew away last night
 One oclock this morning  
P 68
 Well -- it was She was surprised  How did you
know   she said
