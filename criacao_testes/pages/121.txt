Not in front of the baby Lysa said He has a delicate temper don’t you sweet one

The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale Catelyn reminded her and these are no times for delicacy Ned thinks it may come to war

Quiet Lysa snapped at her You’re scaring the boy Little Robert took a quick peek over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble His doll fell to the rushes and he pressed himself against his mother Don’t be afraid my sweet baby Lysa whispered Mother’s here nothing will hurt you She opened her robe and drew out a pale heavy breast tipped with red The boy grabbed for it eagerly buried his face against her chest and began to suck Lysa stroked his hair

Catelyn was at a loss for words Jon Arryn’s son she thought incredulously She remembered her own baby three-year-old Rickon half the age of this boy and five times as fierce Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters…

We’re safe here Lysa was saying Whether to her or to the boy Catelyn was not sure

Don’t be a fool Catelyn said the anger rising in her No one is safe If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you you are sadly mistaken

Lysa covered her boy’s ear with her hand Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate the Eyrie is impregnable You saw for yourself No enemy could ever reach us up here

Catelyn wanted to slap her Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her she realized No castle is impregnable

This one is Lysa insisted Everyone says so The only thing is what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me

Is he a bad man the Lord of the Eyrie asked his mother’s breast popping from his mouth the nipple wet and red

A very bad man Lysa told him as she covered herself but Mother won’t let him harm my little baby

Make him fly Robert said eagerly

Lysa stroked her son’s hair Perhaps we will she murmured Perhaps that is just what we will do





EDDARD

He found Littlefinger in the brothel’s common room chatting amiably with a tall elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink By the hearth Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits From the look of it he’d lost his belt his cloak his mail shirt and his right boot so far while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on his face watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view

Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves It’s time we took our leave My business here is done

Heward lurched to his feet hurriedly gathering up his things As you will my lord Jory said I’ll help Wyl bring round the horses He strode to the door

Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells He kissed the black woman’s hand whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud and sauntered over to Ned Your business he said lightly or Robert’s They say the Hand dreams the king’s dreams speaks with the king’s voice and rules with the king’s sword Does that also mean you fuck with the king’s—

Lord Baelish Ned interrupted you presume too much I am not ungrateful for your help It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery And I am no longer the King’s Hand

The direwolf must be a prickly beast said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth

A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables Ned drew up the hood of his cloak Jory brought out his horse Young Wyl came right behind him leading Littlefinger’s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door giggling at him

Will we be going back to the castle now my lord Jory asked Ned nodded and swung into the saddle Littlefinger mounted up beside him Jory and the others followed

Chataya runs a choice establishment Littlefinger said as they rode I’ve half a mind to buy it Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships I’ve found Whores seldom sink and when they are boarded by pirates why the pirates pay good coin like everyone else Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit

Ned let him prattle on After a time he quieted and they rode in silence The streets of King’s Landing were dark and deserted The rain had driven everyone under their roofs It beat down on Ned’s head warm as blood and relentless as old guilts Fat drops of water ran down his face

Robert will never keep to one bed Lyanna had told him at Winterfell on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm’s End I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale Ned had held the babe in his arms he could scarcely deny her nor would he lie to his sister but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart Lyanna had only smiled Love is sweet dearest Ned but it cannot change a man’s nature
