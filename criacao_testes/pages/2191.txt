A flight of arrows answered him One thudded into the mast two pierced the sail and the fourth missed Jaime by a foot

Another of the Red Fork’s broad loops loomed before them Brienne angled the skiff across the bend The yard swung as they turned their sail cracking as it filled with wind Ahead a large island sat in midstream The main channel flowed right To the left a cutoff ran between the island and the high bluffs of the north shore Brienne moved the tiller and the skiff sheared left sail rippling Jaime watched her eyes Pretty eyes he thought and calm He knew how to read a man’s eyes He knew what fear looked like She is determined not desperate

Thirty yards behind the galley was entering the bend Ser Cleos take the tiller the wench commanded Kingslayer take an oar and keep us off the rocks

As my lady commands An oar was not a sword but the blade could break a man’s face if well swung and the shaft could be used to parry

Ser Cleos shoved the oar into Jaime’s hand and scrambled aft They crossed the head of the island and turned sharply down the cutoff sending a wash of water against the face of the bluff as the boat tilted The island was densely wooded a tangle of willows oaks and tall pines that cast deep shadows across the rushing water hiding snags and the rotted trunks of drowned trees To their left the bluff rose sheer and rocky and at its foot the river foamed whitely around broken boulders and tumbles of rock fallen from the cliff face

They passed from sunlight into shadow hidden from the galley’s view between the green wall of the trees and the stony grey-brown bluff A few moments’ respite from the arrows Jaime thought pushing them off a half-submerged boulder

The skiff rocked He heard a soft splash and when he glanced around Brienne was gone A moment later he spied her again pulling herself from the water at the base of the bluff She waded through a shallow pool scrambled over some rocks and began to climb Ser Cleos goggled mouth open Fool thought Jaime Ignore the wench he snapped at his cousin Steer

They could see the sail moving behind the trees The river galley came into full view at the top of the cutoff twenty-five yards behind Her bow swung hard as she came around and a half-dozen arrows took flight but all went well wide The motion of the two boats was giving the archers difficulty but Jaime knew they’d soon enough learn to compensate Brienne was halfway up the cliff face pulling herself from handhold to handhold Ryger’s sure to see her and once he does he’ll have those bowmen bring her down Jaime decided to see if the old man’s pride would make him stupid Ser Robin he shouted hear me for a moment

Ser Robin raised a hand and his archers lowered their bows Say what you will Kingslayer but say it quickly

The skiff swung through a litter of broken stones as Jaime called out I know a better way to settle this—single combat You and I

I was not born this morning Lannister

No but you’re like to die this afternoon Jaime raised his hands so the other could see the manacles I’ll fight you in chains What could you fear

Not you ser If the choice were mine I’d like nothing better but I am commanded to bring you back alive if possible Bowmen He signaled them on Notch Draw Loo—

The range was less than twenty yards The archers could scarcely have missed but as they pulled on their longbows a rain of pebbles cascaded down around them Small stones rattled on their deck bounced off their helms and made splashes on both sides of the bow Those who had wits enough to understand raised their eyes just as a boulder the size of a cow detached itself from the top of the bluff Ser Robin shouted in dismay The stone tumbled through the air struck the face of the cliff cracked in two and smashed down on them The larger piece snapped the mast tore through the sail sent two of the archers flying into the river and crushed the leg of a rower as he bent over his oar The rapidity with which the galley began to fill with water suggested that the smaller fragment had punched right through her hull The oarsman’s screams echoed off the bluff while the archers flailed wildly in the current From the way they were splashing neither man could swim Jaime laughed

By the time they emerged from the cutoff the galley was foundering amongst pools eddies and snags and Jaime Lannister had decided that the gods were good Ser Robin and his thrice-damned archers would have a long wet walk back to Riverrun and he was rid of the big homely wench as well I could not have planned it better myself Once I’m free of these irons   

Ser Cleos raised a shout When Jaime looked up Brienne was lumbering along the clifftop well ahead of them having cut across a finger of land while they were following the bend in the river She threw herself off the rock and looked almost graceful as she folded into a dive It would have been ungracious to hope that she would smash her head on a stone Ser Cleos turned the skiff toward her Thankfully Jaime still had his oar One good swing when she comes paddling up and I’ll be free of her

Instead he found himself stretching the oar out over the water Brienne grabbed hold and Jaime pulled her in As he helped her into the skiff water ran from her hair and dripped from her sodden clothing to pool on the deck She’s even uglier wet Who would have thought it possible You’re a bloody stupid wench he told her We could have sailed on without you I suppose you expect me to thank you

I want none of your thanks Kingslayer I swore an oath to bring you safe to King’s Landing

And you actually mean to keep it Jaime gave her his brightest smile Now there’s a wonder





CATELYN

Ser Desmond Grell had served House Tully all his life He had been a squire when Catelyn was born a knight when she learned to walk and ride and swim master-at-arms by the day that she was wed He had seen Lord Hoster’s little Cat become a young woman a great lord’s lady mother to a king And now he has seen me become a traitor as well

Her brother Edmure had named Ser Desmond castellan of Riverrun when he rode off to battle so it fell to him to deal with her crime To ease his discomfort he brought her father’s steward with him dour Utherydes Wayn The two men stood and looked at her Ser Desmond stout red-faced embarrassed Utherydes grave gaunt melancholy Each waited for the other to speak They have given their lives to my father’s service and I have repaid them with disgrace Catelyn thought wearily

Your sons Ser Desmond said at last Maester Vyman told us The poor lads Terrible Terrible But   

We share your grief my lady said Utherydes Wayn All Riverrun mourns with you but   

The news must have driven you mad Ser Desmond broke in a madness of grief a mother’s madness men will understand You did not know   

I did Catelyn said firmly I understood what I was doing and knew it was treasonous If you fail to punish me men will believe that we connived together to free Jaime Lannister It was mine own act and mine alone and I alone must answer for it Put me in the Kingslayer’s empty irons and I will wear them proudly if that is how it must be

Fetters The very word seemed to shock poor Ser Desmond For the king’s mother my lord’s own daughter Impossible

Mayhaps said the steward Utherydes Wayn my lady would consent to be confined to her chambers until Ser Edmure returns A time alone to pray for her murdered sons

Confined aye Ser Desmond said Confined to a tower cell that would serve

If I am to be confined let it be in my father’s chambers so I might comfort him in his last days

Ser Desmond considered a moment Very well You shall lack no comfort nor courtesy but freedom of the castle is denied you Visit the sept as you need but elsewise remain in Lord Hoster’s chambers until Lord Edmure returns

As you wish Her brother was no lord while their father lived but Catelyn did not correct him Set a guard on me if you must but I give you my pledge that I shall attempt no escape

Ser Desmond nodded plainly glad to be done with his distasteful task but sad-eyed Utherydes Wayn lingered a moment after the castellan took his leave It was a grave thing you did my lady but for naught Ser Desmond has sent Ser Robin Ryger after them to bring back the Kingslayer    or failing that his head

Catelyn had expected no less May the Warrior give strength to your sword arm Brienne she prayed She had done all she could nothing remained but to hope

Her things were moved into her father’s bedchamber dominated by the great canopied bed she had been born in its pillars carved in the shapes of leaping trout Her father himself had been moved half a turn down the stair his sickbed placed to face the triangular balcony that opened off his solar from whence he could see the rivers that he had always loved so well

Lord Hoster was sleeping when Catelyn entered She went out to the balcony and stood with one hand on the rough stone balustrade Beyond the point of the castle the swift Tumblestone joined the placid Red Fork and she could see a long way downriver If a striped sail comes from the east it will be Ser Robin returning For the moment the surface of the waters was empty She thanked the gods for that and went back inside to sit with her father

Catelyn could not say if Lord Hoster knew that she was there or if her presence brought him any comfort but it gave her solace to be with him What would you say if you knew my crime Father she wondered Would you have done as I did if it were Lysa and me in the hands of our enemies Or would you condemn me too and call it mother’s madness

There was a smell of death about that room a heavy smell sweet and foul clinging It reminded her of the sons that she had lost her sweet Bran and her little Rickon slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy who had been Ned’s ward She still grieved for Ned she would always grieve for Ned but to have her babies taken as well    It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child she whispered softly more to herself than to her father

Lord Hoster’s eyes opened Tansy he husked in a voice thick with pain

He does not know me Catelyn had grown accustomed to him taking her for her mother or her sister Lysa but Tansy was a name strange to her It’s Catelyn she said It’s Cat Father

Forgive me    the blood    oh please    Tansy   

Could there have been another woman in her father’s life Some village maiden he had wronged when he was young perhaps Could he have found comfort in some serving wench’s arms after Mother died It was a queer thought unsettling Suddenly she felt as though she had not known her father at all Who is Tansy my lord Do you want me to send for her Father Where would I find the woman Does she still live

Lord Hoster groaned Dead His hand groped for hers You’ll have others    sweet babes and trueborn

Others Catelyn thought Has he forgotten that Ned is gone Is he still talking to Tansy or is it me now or Lysa or Mother

When he coughed the sputum came up bloody He clutched her fingers    be a good wife and the gods will bless you    sons    trueborn sons    aaahhh The sudden spasm of pain made Lord Hoster’s hand tighten His nails dug into her hand and he gave a muffled scream

Maester Vyman came quickly to mix another dose of milk of the poppy and help his lord swallow it down Soon enough Lord Hoster Tully had fallen back into a heavy sleep

He was asking after a woman said Cat Tansy

Tansy The maester looked at her blankly
