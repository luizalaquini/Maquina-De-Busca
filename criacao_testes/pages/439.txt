Five hundred

Three hundred

And forty more—twenty knights with as many squires If I arrive without a knightly tail the Tyrells will think me of small account

That was true enough Agreed

I’ll include Horror and Slobber in my party and send them on to their lord father afterward A gesture of goodwill We need Paxter Redwyne he’s Mace Tyrell’s oldest friend and a great power in his own right

And a traitor the queen said balking The Arbor would have declared for Renly with all the rest except that Redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it

Renly is dead Your Grace Littlefinger pointed out and neither Stannis nor Lord Paxter will have forgotten how Redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of Storm’s End Restore the twins and perchance we may win Redwyne’s love

Cersei remained unconvinced The Others can keep his love I want his swords and sails Holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that we’ll have them

Tyrion had the answer Then let us send Ser Hobber back to the Arbor and keep Ser Horas here Lord Paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that I should think

The suggestion was carried without protest but Littlefinger was not done We’ll want horses Swift and strong The fighting will make remounts hard to come by A goodly supply of gold will also be needed for those gifts we spoke of earlier

Take as much as you require If the city falls Stannis will steal it all anyway

I’ll want my commission in writing A document that will leave Mace Tyrell in no doubt as to my authority granting me full power to treat with him concerning this match and any other arrangements that might be required and to make binding pledges in the king’s name It should be signed by Joffrey and every member of this council and bear all our seals

Tyrion shifted uncomfortably Done Will that be all I remind you there’s a long road between here and Bitterbridge

I’ll be riding it before dawn breaks Littlefinger rose I trust that on my return the king will see that I am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause

Varys giggled Joffrey is such a grateful sovereign I’m certain you will have no cause to complain my good brave lord

The queen was more direct What do you want Petyr

Littlefinger glanced at Tyrion with a sly smile I shall need to give that some consideration No doubt I’ll think of something He sketched an airy bow and took his leave as casual as if he were off to one of his brothels

Tyrion glanced out the window The fog was so thick that he could not even see the curtain wall across the yard A few dim lights shone indistinct through that greyness A foul day for travel he thought He did not envy Petyr Baelish We had best see to drawing up those documents Lord Varys send for parchment and quill And someone will need to wake Joffrey

It was still grey and dark when the meeting finally ended Varys scurried off alone his soft slippers whisking along the floor The Lannisters lingered a moment by the door How comes your chain brother the queen asked as Ser Preston fastened a vair-lined cloth-of-silver cloak about her shoulders

Link by link it grows longer We should thank the gods that Ser Cortnay Penrose is as stubborn as he is Stannis will never march north with Storm’s End untaken in his rear

Tyrion I know we do not always agree on policy but it seems to me that I was wrong about you You are not so big a fool as I imagined In truth I realize now that you have been a great help For that I thank you You must forgive me if I have spoken to you harshly in the past

Must I He gave her a shrug a smile Sweet sister you have said nothing that requires forgiveness

Today you mean They both laughed… and Cersei leaned over and planted a quick soft kiss on his brow

Too astonished for words Tyrion could only watch her stride off down the hall Ser Preston at her side Have I lost my wits or did my sister just kiss me he asked Bronn when she was gone

Was it so sweet

It was… unanticipated Cersei had been behaving queerly of late Tyrion found it very unsettling I am trying to recall the last time she kissed me I could not have been more than six or seven Jaime had dared her to do it

The woman’s finally taken note of your charms
