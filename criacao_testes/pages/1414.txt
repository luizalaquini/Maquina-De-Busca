Enough The Hound’s face was tight with anger You’re making noise These names mean nothing Who were they

People said Lord Beric People great and small young and old Good people and bad people who died on the points of Lannister spears or saw their bellies opened by Lannister swords

It wasn’t my sword in their bellies Any man who says it was is a bloody liar

You serve the Lannisters of Casterly Rock said Thoros

Once Me and thousands more Is each of us guilty of the crimes of the others Clegane spat Might be you are knights after all You lie like knights maybe you murder like knights

Lem and Jack-Be-Lucky began to shout at him but Dondarrion raised a hand for silence Say what you mean Clegane

A knight’s a sword with a horse The rest the vows and the sacred oils and the lady’s favors they’re silk ribbons tied round the sword Maybe the sword’s prettier with ribbons hanging off it but it will kill you just as dead Well bugger your ribbons and shove your swords up your arses I’m the same as you The only difference is I don’t lie about what I am So kill me but don’t call me a murderer while you stand there telling each other that your shit don’t stink You hear me

Arya squirted past Greenbeard so fast he never saw her You are a murderer she screamed You killed Mycah don’t say you never did You murdered him

The Hound stared at her with no flicker of recognition And who was this Mycah boy

I’m not a boy But Mycah was He was a butcher’s boy and you killed him Jory said you cut him near in half and he never even had a sword She could feel them looking at her now the women and the children and the men who called themselves the knights of the hollow hill Who’s this now someone asked

The Hound answered Seven hells The little sister The brat who tossed Joff’s pretty sword in the river He gave a bark of laughter Don’t you know you’re dead

No you’re dead she threw back at him

Harwin took her arm to draw her back as Lord Beric said The girl has named you a murderer Do you deny killing this butcher’s boy Mycah

The big man shrugged I was Joffrey’s sworn shield The butcher’s boy attacked a prince of the blood

That’s a lie Arya squirmed in Harwin’s grip It was me I hit Joffrey and threw Lion’s Paw in the river Mycah just ran away like I told him

Did you see the boy attack Prince Joffrey Lord Beric Dondarrion asked the Hound

I heard it from the royal lips It’s not my place to question princes Clegane jerked his hands toward Arya This one’s own sister told the same tale when she stood before your precious Robert

Sansa’s just a liar Arya said furious at her sister all over again It wasn’t like she said It wasn’t

Thoros drew Lord Beric aside The two men stood talking in low whispers while Arya seethed They have to kill him I prayed for him to die hundreds and hundreds of times

Beric Dondarrion turned back to the Hound You stand accused of murder but no one here knows the truth or falsehood of the charge so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by battle

The Hound frowned suspiciously as if he did not trust his ears Are you a fool or a madman

Neither I am a just lord Prove your innocence with a blade and you shall be free to go

No Arya cried before Harwin covered her mouth No they can’t he’ll go free The Hound was deadly with a sword everyone knew that He’ll laugh at them she thought

And so he did a long rasping laugh that echoed off the cave walls a laugh choking with contempt So who will it be He looked at Lem Lemoncloak The brave man in the piss-yellow cloak No How about you Huntsman You’ve kicked dogs before try me He saw Greenbeard You’re big enough Tyrosh step forward Or do you mean to make the little girl fight me herself He laughed again Come on who wants to die

It’s me you’ll face said Lord Beric Dondarrion

Arya remembered all the tales He can’t be killed she thought hoping against hope The Mad Huntsman sliced apart the ropes that bound Sandor Clegane’s hands together I’ll need sword and armor The Hound rubbed a torn wrist

Your sword you shall have declared Lord Beric but your innocence must be your armor

Clegane’s mouth twitched My innocence against your breastplate is that the way of it

Ned help me remove my breastplate

Arya got goosebumps when Lord Beric said her father’s name but this Ned was only a boy a fair-haired squire no more than ten or twelve He stepped up quickly to undo the clasps that fastened the battered steel about the Marcher lord The quilting beneath was rotten with age and sweat and fell away when the metal was pulled loose Gendry sucked in his breath Mother have mercy

Lord Beric’s ribs were outlined starkly beneath his skin A puckered crater scarred his breast just above his left nipple and when he turned to call for sword and shield Arya saw a matching scar upon his back The lance went through him The Hound had seen it too Is he scared Arya wanted him to be scared before he died as scared as Mycah must have been

Ned fetched Lord Beric his swordbelt and a long black surcoat It was meant to be worn over armor so it draped his body loosely but across it crackled the forked purple lightning of his House He unsheathed his sword and gave the belt back to his squire

Thoros brought the Hound his swordbelt Does a dog have honor the priest asked Lest you think to cut your way free of here or seize some child for a hostage… Anguy Dennet Kyle feather him at the first sign of treachery Only when the three bowmen had notched their shafts did Thoros hand Clegane the belt

The Hound ripped the sword free and threw away the scabbard The Mad Huntsman gave him his oaken shield all studded with iron and painted yellow the three black dogs of Clegane emblazoned upon it The boy Ned helped Lord Beric with his own shield so hacked and battered that the purple lightning and the scatter of stars upon it had almost been obliterated

But when the Hound made to step toward his foe Thoros of Myr stopped him First we pray He turned toward the fire and lifted his arms Lord of Light look down upon us

All around the cave the brotherhood without banners lifted their own voices in response Lord of Light defend us

Lord of Light protect us in the darkness

Lord of Light shine your face upon us

Light your flame among us R’hllor said the red priest Show us the truth or falseness of this man Strike him down if he is guilty and give strength to his sword if he is true Lord of Light give us wisdom

For the night is dark the others chanted Harwin and Anguy loud as all the rest and full of terrors

This cave is dark too said the Hound but I’m the terror here I hope your god’s a sweet one Dondarrion You’re going to meet him shortly

Unsmiling Lord Beric laid the edge of his longsword against the palm of his left hand and drew it slowly down Blood ran dark from the gash he made and washed over the steel

And then the sword took fire

Arya heard Gendry whisper a prayer
