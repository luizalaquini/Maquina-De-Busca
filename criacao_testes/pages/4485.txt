Every night Arya would say their names Ser Gregor she’d whisper to her stone pillow Dunsen Polliver Chiswyck Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Amory Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei Back in Winterfell Arya had prayed with her mother in the sept and with her father in the godswood but there were no gods on the road to Harrenhal and her names were the only prayer she cared to remember

Every day they marched and every night she said her names until finally the trees thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling hills meandering streams and sunlit fields where the husks of burnt holdfasts thrust up black as rotten teeth It was another long day’s march before they glimpsed the towers of Harrenhal in the distance hard beside the blue waters of the lake

It would be better once they got to Harrenhal the captives told each other but Arya was not so certain She remembered Old Nan’s stories of the castle built on fear Harren the Black had mixed human blood in the mortar Nan used to say dropping her voice so the children would need to lean close to hear but Aegon’s dragons had roasted Harren and all his sons within their great walls of stone Arya chewed her lip as she walked along on feet grown hard with callus It would not be much longer she told herself those towers could not be more than a few miles off

Yet they walked all that day and most of the next before at last they reached the fringes of Lord Tywin’s army encamped west of the castle amidst the scorched remains of a town Harrenhal was deceptive from afar because it was so huge Its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs while atop their battlements the rows of wood-and-iron scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named

The stink of the Lannister host reached Arya well before she could make out the devices on the banners that sprouted along the lakeshore atop the pavilions of the westermen From the smell Arya could tell that Lord Tywin had been here some time The latrines that ringed the encampment were overflowing and swarming with flies and she saw faint greenish fuzz on many of the sharpened stakes that protected the perimeters

Harrenhal’s gatehouse itself as large as Winterfell’s Great Keep was as scarred as it was massive its stones fissured and discolored From outside only the tops of five immense towers could be seen beyond the walls The shortest of them was half again as tall as the highest tower in Winterfell but they did not soar the way a proper tower did Arya thought they looked like some old man’s gnarled knuckly fingers groping after a passing cloud She remembered Nan telling how the stone had melted and flowed like candlewax down the steps and in the windows glowing a sullen searing red as it sought out Harren where he hid Arya could believe every word each tower was more grotesque and misshapen than the last lumpy and runneled and cracked

I don’t want to go there Hot Pie squeaked as Harrenhal opened its gates to them There’s ghosts in there

Chiswyck heard him but for once he only smiled Baker boy here’s your choice Come join the ghosts or be one

Hot Pie went in with the rest of them

In the echoing stone-and-timber bathhouse the captives were stripped and made to scrub and scrape themselves raw in tubs of scalding hot water Two fierce old women supervised the process discussing them as bluntly as if they were newly acquired donkeys When Arya’s turn came round Goodwife Amabel clucked in dismay at the sight of her feet while Goodwife Harra felt the callus on her fingers that long hours of practice with Needle had earned her Got those churning butter I’ll wager she said Some farmer’s whelp are you Well never you mind girl you have a chance to win a higher place in this world if you work hard If you won’t work hard you’ll be beaten And what do they call you

Arya dared not say her true name but Arry was no good either it was a boy’s name and they could see she was no boy Weasel she said naming the first girl she could think of Lommy called me Weasel

I can see why sniffed Goodwife Amabel That hair is a fright and a nest for lice as well We’ll have it off and then you’re for the kitchens

I’d sooner tend the horses Arya liked horses and maybe if she was in the stables she’d be able to steal one and escape

Goodwife Harra slapped her so hard that her swollen lip broke open all over again And keep that tongue to yourself or you’ll get worse No one asked your views

The blood in her mouth had a salty metal tang to it Arya dropped her gaze and said nothing If I still had Needle she wouldn’t dare hit me she thought sullenly

Lord Tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend their horses they don’t need the likes of you Goodwife Amabel said The kitchens are snug and clean and there’s always a warm fire to sleep by and plenty to eat You might have done well there but I can see you’re not a clever girl Harra I believe we should give this one to Weese

If you think so Amabel They gave her a shift of grey roughspun wool and a pair of ill-fitting shoes and sent her off

Weese was understeward for the Wailing Tower a squat man with a fleshy carbuncle of a nose and a nest of angry red boils near one corner of his plump lips Arya was one of six sent to him He looked them all over with a gimlet eye The Lannisters are generous to those as serve them well an honor none of your sort deserve but in war a man makes do with what’s to hand Work hard and mind your place and might be one day you’ll rise as high as me If you think to presume on his lordship’s kindness though you’ll find me waiting after m’lord has gone y’see He strutted up and down before them telling them how they must never look the highborn in the eye nor speak until spoken to nor get in his lordship’s way My nose never lies he boasted I can smell defiance I can smell pride I can smell disobedience I catch a whiff of any such stinks you’ll answer for it When I sniff you all I want to smell is fear





DAENERYS

On the walls of Qarth men beat gongs to herald her coming while others blew curious horns that encircled their bodies like great bronze snakes A column of camelry emerged from the city as her honor guards The riders wore scaled copper armor and snouted helms with copper tusks and long black silk plumes and sat high on saddles inlaid with rubies and garnets Their camels were dressed in blankets of a hundred different hues

Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be Pyat Pree had told her back amongst the bones of Vaes Tolorro It is the center of the world the gate between north and south the bridge between east and west ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that Saathos the Wise put out his eyes after gazing upon Qarth for the first time because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison

Dany took the warlock’s words well salted but the magnificence of the great city was not to be denied Three thick walls encircled Qarth elaborately carved The outer was red sandstone thirty feet high and decorated with animals snakes slithering kites flying fish swimming intermingled with wolves of the red waste and striped zorses and monstrous elephants The middle wall forty feet high was grey granite alive with scenes of war the clash of sword and shield and spear arrows in flight heroes at battle and babes being butchered pyres of the dead The innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble with carvings that made Dany blush until she told herself that she was being a fool She was no maid if she could look on the grey wall’s scenes of slaughter why should she avert her eyes from the sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another

The outer gates were banded with copper the middle with iron the innermost were studded with golden eyes All opened at Dany’s approach As she rode her silver into the city small children rushed out to scatter flowers in her path They wore golden sandals and bright paint no more

All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose violet and umber She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating their scales delicate flakes of jade obsidian and lapis lazuli Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had ever seen and elaborate fountains filled every square wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores

The Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support their weight They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur every one a lord or lady to her eyes The women wore gowns that left one breast bare while the men favored beaded silk skirts Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin robe with black Drogon on one shoulder Her Dothraki called the Qartheen Milk Men for their paleness and Khal Drogo had dreamed of the day when he might sack the great cities of the east She glanced at her bloodriders their dark almond-shaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts Is it only the plunder they see she wondered How savage we must seem to these Qartheen

Pyrat Pree conducted her little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the city’s ancient heroes stood thrice life-size on columns of white and green marble They passed through a bazaar in a cavernous building whose latticework ceiling was home to a thousand gaily colored birds Trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls while below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale

Her silver shied as the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos rode up to her the horses could not abide the close presence of camels she had found If you see here anything that you would desire O most beautiful of women you have only to speak and it is yours Xaro called down from his ornate horned saddle

Qarth itself is hers she has no need of baubles blue-lipped Pyat Pree sang out from her other side It shall be as I promised Khaleesi Come with me to the House of the Undying and you shall drink of truth and wisdom

Why should she need your Palace of Dust when I can give her sunlight and sweet water and silks to sleep in Xaro said to the warlock The Thirteen shall set a crown of black jade and fire opals upon her lovely head

The only palace I desire is the red castle at King’s Landing my lord Pyat Dany was wary of the warlock the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had soured her on those who played at sorcery And if the great of Qarth would give me gifts Xaro let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine

Pyat’s blue lips curled upward in a gracious smile It shall be as you command Khaleesi He moved away swaying with his camel’s motion his long beaded robes trailing behind

The young queen is wise beyond her years Xaro Xhoan Daxos murmured down at her from his high saddle There is a saying in Qarth A warlock’s house is built of bones and lies

Then why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of Qarth All across the east their power and wisdom are revered

Once they were mighty Xaro agreed but now they are as ludicrous as those feeble old soldiers who boast of their prowess long after strength and skill have left them They read their crumbling scrolls drink shade-of-the-evening until their lips turn blue and hint of dread powers but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before Pyat Pree’s gifts will turn to dust in your hands I warn you He gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away

The crow calls the raven black muttered Ser Jorah in the Common Tongue of Westeros The exile knight rode at her right hand as ever For their entrance into Qarth he had put away his Dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the Seven Kingdoms half a world away You would do well to avoid both those men Your Grace

Those men will help me to my crown she said Xaro has vast wealth and Pyat Pree—

—pretends to power the knight said brusquely On his dark green surcoat the bear of House Mormont stood on its hind legs black and fierce Jorah looked no less ferocious as he scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar I would not linger here long my queen I mislike the very smell of this place

Dany smiled Perhaps it’s the camels you’re smelling The Qartheen themselves seem sweet enough to my nose

Sweet smells are sometimes used to cover foul ones

My great bear Dany thought I am his queen but I will always be his cub as well and he will always guard me It made her feel safe but sad as well She wished she could love him better than she did

Xaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the city She had expected something grand She had not expected a palace larger than many a market town It makes Magister Illyrio’s manse in Pentos look like a swineherd’s hovel she thought Xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides indeed it swallowed them An entire wing was given over to her She would have her own gardens a marble bathing pool a scrying tower and warlock’s maze Slaves would tend her every need In her private chambers the floors were green marble the walls draped with colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air You are too generous she told Xaro Xhoan Daxos

For the Mother of Dragons no gift is too great Xaro was a languid elegant man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose crusted with rubies opals and flakes of jade On the morrow you shall feast upon peacock and lark’s tongue and hear music worthy of the most beautiful of women The Thirteen will come to do you homage and all the great of Qarth

All the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons Dany thought yet she thanked Xaro for his kindness before she sent him on his way Pyat Pree took his leave as well vowing to petition the Undying Ones for an audience A honor rare as summer snows Before he left he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air Last of the three seekers to depart was Quaithe the shadowbinder From her Dany received only a warning Beware the woman in the red lacquer mask said

Of whom

Of all They shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into the world and when they see they shall lust For dragons are fire made flesh and fire is power

When Quaithe too was gone Ser Jorah said She speaks truly my queen    though I like her no more than the others

I do not understand her Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons declaring themselves her loyal servants in all things but from Quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word And it disturbed her that she had never seen the woman’s face Remember Mirri Maz Duur she told herself Remember treachery She turned to her bloodriders We will keep our own watch so long as we are here See that no one enters this wing of the palace without my leave and take care that the dragons are always well guarded

It shall be done Khaleesi Aggo said
