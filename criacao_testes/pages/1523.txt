Dawn stole into her garden like a thief The grey of the sky grew lighter still and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath their stoles of snow A few servants came out and watched her for a time but she paid them no mind and they soon went back inside where it was warmer Sansa saw Lady Lysa gazing down from her balcony wrapped up in a blue velvet robe trimmed with fox fur but when she looked again her aunt was gone Maester Colemon popped out of the rookery and peered down for a while skinny and shivering but curious

Her bridges kept falling down There was a covered bridge between the armory and the main keep and another that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower to the second floor of the rookery but no matter how carefully she shaped them they would not hold together The third time one collapsed on her she cursed aloud and sat back in helpless frustration

Pack the snow around a stick Sansa

She did not know how long he had been watching her or when he had returned from the Vale A stick she asked

That will give it strength enough to stand I’d think Petyr said May I come into your castle my lady

Sansa was wary Don’t break it Be…

…gentle He smiled Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me It is Winterfell is it not

Yes Sansa admitted

He walked along outside the walls I used to dream of it in those years after Cat went north with Eddard Stark In my dreams it was ever a dark place and cold

No It was always warm even when it snowed Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls to warm them and inside the glass gardens it was always like the hottest day of summer She stood towering over the great white castle I can’t think how to do the glass roof over the gardens

Littlefinger stroked his chin where his beard had been before Lysa had asked him to shave it off The glass was locked in frames no Twigs are your answer Peel them and cross them and use bark to tie them together into frames I’ll show you He moved through the garden gathering up twigs and sticks and shaking the snow from them When he had enough he stepped over both walls with a single long stride and squatted on his heels in the middle of the yard Sansa came closer to watch what he was doing His hands were deft and sure and before long he had a crisscrossing latticework of twigs very like the one that roofed the glass gardens of Winterfell We will need to imagine the glass to be sure he said when he gave it to her

This is just right she said

He touched her face And so is that

Sansa did not understand And so is what

Your smile my lady Shall I make another for you

If you would

Nothing could please me more

She raised the walls of the glass gardens while Littlefinger roofed them over and when they were done with that he helped her extend the walls and build the guardshall When she used sticks for the covered bridges they stood just as he had said they would The First Keep was simple enough an old round drum tower but Sansa was stymied again when it came to putting the gargoyles around the top Again he had the answer It’s been snowing on your castle my lady he pointed out What do the gargoyles look like when they’re covered with snow

Sansa closed her eyes to see them in memory They’re just white lumps

Well then Gargoyles are hard but white lumps should be easy And they were

The Broken Tower was easier still They made a tall tower together kneeling side by side to roll it smooth and when they’d raised it Sansa stuck her fingers through the top grabbed a handful of snow and flung it full in his face Petyr yelped as the snow slid down under his collar That was unchivalrously done my lady

As was bringing me here when you swore to take me home

She wondered where this courage had come from to speak to him so frankly From Winterfell she thought I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell

His face grew serious Yes I played you false in that… and in one other thing as well

Sansa’s stomach was aflutter What other thing

I told you that nothing could please me more than to help you with your castle I fear that was a lie as well Something else would please me more He stepped closer This

Sansa tried to step back but he pulled her into his arms and suddenly he was kissing her Feebly she tried to squirm but only succeeded in pressing herself more tightly against him His mouth was on hers swallowing her words He tasted of mint For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss… before she turned her face away and wrenched free What are you doing

Petyr straightened his cloak Kissing a snow maid

You’re supposed to kiss her Sansa glanced up at Lysa’s balcony but it was empty now Your lady wife

I do Lysa has no cause for complaint He smiled I wish you could see yourself my lady You are so beautiful You’re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe How long have you been out here You must be very cold Let me warm you Sansa Take off those gloves give me your hands

I won’t He sounded almost like Marillion the night he’d gotten so drunk at the wedding Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her Ser Lothor was Petyr’s man You shouldn’t kiss me I might have been your own daughter…

Might have been he admitted with a rueful smile But you’re not are you You are Eddard Stark’s daughter and Cat’s But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was when she was your age

Petyr please Her voice sounded so weak Please…

A castle

The voice was loud shrill and childish Littleflnger turned away from her Lord Robert He sketched a bow Should you be out in the snow without your gloves

Did you make the snow castle Lord Littlefinger

Alayne did most of it my lord

Sansa said It’s meant to be Winterfell

Winterfell Robert was small for eight a stick of a boy with splotchy skin and eyes that were always runny Under one arm he clutched the threadbare cloth doll he carried everywhere

Winterfell is the seat of House Stark Sansa told her husband-to-be The great castle of the north

It’s not so great The boy knelt before the gatehouse Look here comes a giant to knock it down He stood his doll in the snow and moved it jerkily Tromp tromp I’m a giant I’m a giant he chanted Ho ho ho open your gates or I’ll mash them and smash them Swinging the doll by the legs he knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other

It was more than Sansa could stand Robert stop that Instead he swung the doll again and a foot of wall exploded She grabbed for his hand but she caught the doll instead There was a loud ripping sound as the thin cloth tore Suddenly she had the doll’s head Robert had the legs and body and the rag-and-sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow

Lord Robert’s mouth trembled You killlllllllllled him he wailed Then he began to shake It started with no more than a little shivering but within a few short heartbeats he had collapsed across the castle his limbs flailing about violently White towers and snowy bridges shattered and fell on all sides Sansa stood horrified but Petyr Baelish seized her cousin’s wrists and shouted for the maester

Guards and serving girls arrived within instants to help restrain the boy Maester Colemon a short time later Robert Arryn’s shaking sickness was nothing new to the people of the Eyrie and Lady Lysa had trained them all to come rushing at the boy’s first cry The maester held the little lord’s head and gave him half a cup of dreamwine murmuring soothing words Slowly the violence of the fit seemed to ebb away till nothing remained but a small shaking of the hands Help him to my chambers Colemon told the guards A leeching will help calm him

It was my fault Sansa showed them the doll’s head I ripped his doll in two I never meant to but…

His lordship was destroying the castle said Petyr

A giant the boy whispered weeping It wasn’t me it was a giant hurt the castle She killed him I hate her She’s a bastard and I hate her I don’t want to be leeched

My lord your blood needs thinning said Maester Colemon It is the bad blood that makes you angry and the rage that brings on the shaking Come now

They led the boy away My lord husband Sansa thought as she contemplated the ruins of Winterfell The snow had stopped and it was colder than before She wondered if Lord Robert would shake all through their wedding At least Joffrey was sound of body A mad rage seized hold of her She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn doll’s head down on top of it then pushed it down atop the shattered gatehouse of her snow castle The servants looked aghast but when Littlefinger saw what she’d done he laughed If the tales be true that’s not the first giant to end up with his head on Winterfell’s walls

Those are only stories she said and left him there
