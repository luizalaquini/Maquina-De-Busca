matter of timing Or is Plutarch right Are these people
modeling their behavior on mine
Back at our space I open one of the packs to find a
thin mattress bedding two sets of gray clothing a
toothbrush a comb and a flashlight On examining the
contents of the other packs I find the only discernible
difference is that they contain both gray and white outfits
The latter will be for my mother and Prim in case they have
medical duties After I make up the beds store the clothes
and return the backpacks Ive got nothing to do but observe
the last rule
3 Await further instructions
I sit cross-legged on the floor to await A steady flow of
people begins to fill the room claiming spaces collecting
supplies It wont take long until the place is full up I wonder
if my mother and Prim are going to stay the night at
wherever the hospital patients have been taken But no I
dont think so They were on the list here Im starting to get
anxious when my mother appears I look behind her into a
sea of strangers Wheres Prim I ask
Isnt she here she replies She was supposed to
come straight down from the hospital She left ten minutes
before I did Where is she Where could she have gone
I squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment to track her
as I would prey on a hunt See her react to the sirens rush
to help the patients nod as they gesture for her to descend
to the bunker and then hesitate with her on the stairs Torn
for a moment But why
My eyes fly open The cat She went back for him
Oh no my mother says We both know Im right
Were pushing against the incoming tide trying to get out of
the bunker Up ahead I can see them preparing to shut the
thick metal doors Slowly rotating the metal wheels on
either side inward Somehow I know that once they have
been sealed nothing in the world will convince the soldiers
to open them Perhaps it will even be beyond their control
Im indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout for
them to wait The space between the doors shrinks to a
yard a foot there are only a few inches left when I jam my
hand through the crack
Open it Let me out I cry
Consternation shows on the soldiers faces as they
reverse the wheels a bit Not enough to let me pass but
enough to avoid crushing my fingers I take the opportunity
to wedge my shoulder into the opening Prim I holler up
the stairs My mother pleads with the guards as I try to
wriggle my way out Prim
Then I hear it The faint sound of footsteps on the
stairs Were coming I hear my sister call
Hold the door That was Gale
Theyre coming I tell the guards and they slide the
doors open about a foot But I dont dare move--afraid
theyll lock us all out--until Prim appears her cheeks flushed
with running hauling Buttercup I pull her inside and Gale
follows twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get it
into the bunker The doors are closed with a loud and final
clank
What were you thinking I give Prim an angry shake
and then hug her squashing Buttercup between us
Prims explanation is already on her lips I couldnt
leave him behind Katniss Not twice You should have seen
him pacing the room and howling Hed come back to
protect us
Okay Okay I take a few breaths to calm myself step
back and lift Buttercup by the scruff of the neck I shouldve
drowned you when I had the chance His ears flatten and
he raises a paw I hiss before he gets a chance which
seems to annoy him a little since he considers hissing his
own personal sound of contempt In retaliation he gives a
helpless kitten mew that brings my sister immediately to his
defense
Oh Katniss dont tease him she says folding him
back in her arms Hes already so upset
The idea that Ive wounded the brutes tiny cat feelings
just invites further taunting But Prims genuinely distressed
for him So instead I visualize Buttercups fur lining a pair of
gloves an image that has helped me deal with him over the
years Okay sorry Were under the big E on the wall
Better get him settled in before he loses it Prim hurries
off and I find myself face-to-face with Gale Hes holding the
box of medical supplies from our kitchen in 12 Site of our
last conversation kiss fallout whatever My game bags
slung across his shoulder
If Peetas right these didnt stand a chance he says
Peeta Blood like raindrops on the window Like wet
mud on boots
Thanks foreverything I take our stuff What were
you doing up in our rooms
Just double-checking he says Were in Forty-
Seven if you need me
Practically everyone withdrew to their spaces when the
doors shut so I get to cross to our new home with at least
five hundred people watching me I try to appear extra calm
to make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd Like
thats fooling anyone So much for setting an example Oh
who cares They all think Im nuts anyway One man who I
think I knocked to the floor catches my eye and rubs his
elbow resentfully I almost hiss at him too
Prim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk draped
in a blanket so that only his face pokes out This is how he
