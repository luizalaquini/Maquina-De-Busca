The lowest formant called formant one varies from around 200 Hz
to 1000 Hz during speech the exact range depending on the size
of the vocal tract
Formant two varies from around 500 to 2500 Hz and formant three
from around 1500 to 3500 Hz

You can easily hear the lowest formant by whispering the vowels in
the words heed hid head had hod hawed and whod
They appear to have a steadily descending pitch yet since you are
whispering there is no fundamental frequency
What you hear is the lowest resonance of the vocal tract em formant one
Some masochistic people can play simple tunes with this formant by putting
their mouth in successive vowel shapes and knocking the top of their head
with their knuckles em hard
pp
A difficulty occurs when trying to identify the lower formants for speakers
with high-pitched voices
When a formant frequency falls below the fundamental excitation frequency
of the voice its effect is diminished em although it is still present
The vibrato used by opera singers provides a very low-frequency excitation
at the vibrato rate which helps to illuminate the lower formants even
when the pitch of the voice is very high

Of course speech is not a static phenomenon
The organ-pipe model describes the speech spectrum during a continuously
held vowel with the mouth in a neutral position such as for aaah
But in real speech the tongue and lips are in continuous motion
altering the shape of the vocal tract and hence the positions of the resonances
It is as if the organ-pipe were being squeezed and expanded in
different places all the time
Say
ul
ee
as in heed and feel how close your tongue is to the roof of your mouth
causing a constriction near the front of the vocal cavity
pp
Linguists and speech engineers use a special frequency analyser called a
sound spectrograph to make a three-dimensional plot of the variation
of the speech energy spectrum with time
Figure 23 shows a spectrogram of the
utterance go away
FC Figure 23
Frequency is given on the vertical axis
and bands are shown at the beginning to indicate the scale
Time is plotted horizontally
and energy is given by the darkness of any particular area
The lower few formants can be seen as dark bands extending horizontally
and they are in continuous motion
In the neutral first vowel of away the formant frequencies
pass through
approximately the 500 Hz 1500 Hz and 2500 Hz that we calculated earlier
In fact formants two and three are somewhat lower than these values
pp
The
fine vertical striations in the spectrogram correspond to single openings of the vocal cords
Pitch changes continuously throughout an utterance
and this can be seen on the spectrogram by the differences in spacing
of the striations
Pitch change or
ul
intonation
is singularly important in
lending naturalness to speech
pp
On a spectrogram a continuously held vowel shows up as a static energy spectrum
But beware em what we call a vowel in everyday language is not the same thing as a
vowel in phonetic terms
Say I and feel how the tongue moves continuously while youre speaking
Technically this is a
ul
diphthong
or slide between two vowel positions
and not a single vowel
If you say
ul
ar
as in hard
and change slowly to
ul
ee
as in heed you will obtain a diphthong not unlike that in I
And there are many more phonetically different vowel sounds
than the a e i o and u that we normally think of
The words hood and mood have different vowels for example as do head and mead
The principal acoustic difference between the various vowel sounds
is in the frequencies of the first two formants
pp
A further complication is introduced by the nasal tract  This is
a large cavity which is coupled to the oral tract by a passage at the
back of the mouth
The passage is guarded by a flap of skin called the velum
You know about this because inadvertent opening of the velum while
swallowing causes food or drink to go up your nose
The nasal cavity is switched in and out of the vocal tract
by the velum during speech
It is used for consonants
