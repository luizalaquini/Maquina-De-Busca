Not all I bought these boots and this excellent dagger

You ought t’have bought some land and made one o’ them roast swan girls an honest woman said Jack-Be-Lucky Raised yourself a crop o’ turnips and a crop o’ sons

Warrior defend me What a waste that would have been to turn my gold to turnips

I like turnips said Jack aggrieved I could do with some mashed turnips right now

Thoros of Myr paid no heed to the banter The Hound has lost more than a few bags of coin he mused He has lost his master and kennel as well He cannot go back to the Lannisters the Young Wolf would never have him nor would his brother be like to welcome him That gold was all he had left it seems to me

Bloody hell said Watty the Miller He’ll come murder us in our sleep for sure then

No Lord Beric had sheathed his sword Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly but not in our sleep Anguy on the morrow take the rear with Beardless Dick If you see Clegane still sniffing after us kill his horse

That’s a good horse Anguy protested

Aye said Lem It’s the bloody rider we should be killing We could use that horse

I’m with Lem Notch said Let me feather the dog a few times discourage him some

Lord Beric shook his head Clegane won his life beneath the hollow hill I will not rob him of it

My lord is wise Thoros told the others Brothers a trial by battle is a holy thing You heard me ask R’hllor to take a hand and you saw his fiery finger snap Lord Beric’s sword just as he was about to make an end of it The Lord of Light is not yet done with Joffrey’s Hound it would seem

Harwin soon returned to the brewhouse Puddingfoot was sound asleep but unharmed

Wait till I get hold of him said Lem I’ll cut him a new bunghole He could have gotten every one of us killed

No one rested very comfortably that night knowing that Sandor Clegane was out there in the dark somewhere close Arya curled up near the fire warm and snug yet sleep would not come She took out the coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her and curled her fingers around it as she lay beneath her cloak It made her feel strong to hold it remembering how she’d been the ghost in Harrenhal She could kill with a whisper then

Jaqen was gone though He’d left her Hot Pie left me too and now Gendry is leaving Lommy had died Yoren had died Syrio Forel had died even her father had died and Jaqen had given her a stupid iron penny and vanished Valar morghulis she whispered softly tightening her fist so the hard edges of the coin dug into her palm Ser Gregor Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei Arya tried to imagine how they would look when they were dead but it was hard to bring their faces to mind The Hound she could see and his brother the Mountain and she would never forget Joffrey’s face or his mother’s… but Raff and Dunsen and Polliver were all fading and even the Tickler whose looks had been so commonplace

Sleep took her at last but in the black of night Arya woke again tingling The fire had burned down to embers Mudge stood by the door and another guard was pacing outside The rain had stopped and she could hear wolves howling So close she thought and so many They sounded as if they were all around the stable dozens of them maybe hundreds I hope they eat the Hound She remembered what he’d said about wolves and dogs

Come morning Septon Utt still swung beneath the tree but the brown brothers were out in the rain with spades digging shallow graves for the other dead Lord Beric thanked them for the night’s lodging and the meal and gave them a bag of silver stags to help rebuild Harwin Likely Luke and Watty the Miller went out scouting but neither wolves nor hounds were found

As Arya was cinching her saddle girth Gendry came up to say that he was sorry She put a foot in the stirrup and swung up into her saddle so she could look down on him instead of up You could have made swords at Riverrun for my brother she thought but what she said was If you want to be some stupid outlaw knight and get hanged why should I care I’ll be at Riverrun ransomed with my brother

There was no rain that day thankfully and for once they made good time





Bran


The tower stood upon an island its twin reflected on the still blue waters When the wind blew ripples moved across the surface of the lake chasing one another like boys at play Oak trees grew thick along the lakeshore a dense stand of them with a litter of fallen acorns on the ground beneath Beyond them was the village or what remained of it

It was the first village they had seen since leaving the foothills Meera had scouted ahead to make certain there was no one lurking amongst the ruins Sliding in and amongst oaks and apple trees with her net and spear in hand she startled three red deer and sent them bounding away through the brush Summer saw the flash of motion and was after them at once Bran watched the direwolf lope off and for a moment wanted nothing so much as to slip his skin and run with him but Meera was waving for them to come ahead Reluctantly he turned away from Summer and urged Hodor on into the village Jojen walked with them

The ground from here to the Wall was grasslands Bran knew fallow fields and low rolling hills high meadows and lowland bogs It would be much easier going than the mountains behind but so much open space made Meera uneasy I feel naked she confessed There’s no place to hide

Who holds this land Jojen asked Bran
