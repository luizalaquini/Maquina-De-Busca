He took his cup and went to the window seat where he sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over Pyke I have no place here he thought and Asha is the reason may the Others take her The water below turned from green to grey to black By then he could hear distant music and he knew it was time to change for the feast

Theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes somber shades of black and grey to fit his mood No ornament he had nothing bought with iron I might have taken something off that wildling I killed to save Bran Stark but he had nothing worth the taking That’s my cursed luck I kill the poor

The long smoky hall was crowded with his father’s lords and captains when Theon entered near four hundred of them Dagmer Cleftjaw had not yet returned from Old Wyk with the Stonehouses and Drumms but all the rest were there—Harlaws from Harlaw Blacktydes from Blacktyde Sparrs Merlyns and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk Saltcliffes and Sunderlies from Saltcliffe and Botleys and Wynches from the other side of Pyke The thralls were pouring ale and there was music fiddles and skins and drums Three burly men were doing the finger dance spinning short-hafted axes at each other The trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step It was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one… or two or five

Neither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of Theon Greyjoy as he strode to the dais Lord Balon occupied the Seastone Chair carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when they came to the Iron Islands To the left of the high seat were Theon’s uncles Asha was ensconced at his right hand in the place of honor You come late Theon Lord Balon observed

I ask your pardon Theon took the empty seat beside Asha Leaning close he hissed in her ear You’re in my place

She turned to him with innocent eyes Brother surely you are mistaken Your place is at Winterfell Her smile cut And where are all your pretty clothes I heard you fancied silk and velvet against your skin She was in soft green wool herself simply cut the fabric clinging to the slender lines of her body

Your hauberk must have rusted away sister he threw back A great pity I’d like to see you all in iron

Asha only laughed You may yet little brother… if you think your Sea Bitch can keep up with my Black Wind One of their father’s thralls came near bearing a flagon of wine Are you drinking ale or wine tonight Theon She leaned over close Or is it still a taste of my mother’s milk you thirst for

He flushed Wine he told the thrall Asha turned away and banged on the table shouting for ale

Theon hacked a loaf of bread in half hollowed out a trencher and summoned a cook to fill it with fish stew The smell of the thick cream made him a little ill but he forced himself to eat some He’d drunk enough wine to float him through two meals If I retch it will be on her Does Father know that you’ve married his shipwright he asked his sister

No more than Sigrin does She gave a shrug Esgred was the first ship he built He named her after his mother I would be hard-pressed to say which he loves best

Every word you spoke to me was a lie

Not every word Remember when I told you I like to be on top Asha grinned

That only made him angrier All that about being a woman wed and new with child…

Oh that part was true enough Asha leapt to her feet Rolfe here she shouted down at one of the finger dancers holding up a hand He saw her spun and suddenly an axe came flying from his hand the blade gleaming as it tumbled end over end through the torchlight Theon had time for a choked gasp before Asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed it down into the table splitting his trencher in two and splattering his mantle with drippings There’s my lord husband His sister reached down inside her gown and drew a dirk from between her breasts And here’s my sweet suckling babe

He could not imagine how he looked at that moment but suddenly Theon Greyjoy realized that the Great Hall was ringing with laughter all of it at him Even his father was smiling gods be damned and his uncle Victarion chuckled aloud The best response he could summon was a queasy grin We shall see who is laughing when all this is done bitch

Asha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung it back down at the dancers to whistles and loud cheers You’d do well to heed what I told you about choosing a crew A thrall offered them a platter and she stabbed a salted fish and ate it off the end of her dirk If you had troubled to learn the first thing of Sigrin I could never have fooled you Ten years a wolf and you land here and think to prince about the islands but you know nothing and no one Why should men fight and die for you 

I am their lawful prince Theon said stiffly

By the laws of the green lands you might be But we make our own laws here or have you forgotten

Scowling Theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before him He would have stew in his lap before long He shouted for a thrall to clean it up Half my life I have waited to come home and for what Mockery and disregard This was not the Pyke he remembered Or did he remember He had been so young when they took him away to hold hostage

The feast was a meager enough thing a succession of fish stews black bread and spiceless goat The tastiest thing Theon found to eat was an onion pie Ale and wine continued to flow well after the last of the courses had been cleared away

Lord Balon Greyjoy rose from the Seastone Chair Have done with your drink and come to my solar he commanded his companions on the dais We have plans to lay He left them with no other word flanked by two of his guards His brothers followed in short order Theon rose to go after them

My little brother is in a rush to be off Asha raised her drinking horn and beckoned for more ale

Our lord father is waiting

And has for many a year It will do him no harm to wait a little longer… but if you fear his wrath scurry after him by all means You ought to have no trouble catching our uncles She smiled One is drunk on seawater after all and the other is a great grey bullock so dim he’ll probably get lost

Theon sat back down annoyed I run after no man

No man but every woman
