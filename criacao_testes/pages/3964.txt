unchanged A rough rocky tangle of trees and wildlife A
natural fortress to protect them from their enemies
By the other districts standards the Capitol babied
the inhabitants here Just by looking at the District 2 rebels
you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in
childhood Some did end up as quarry and mine workers
Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into
the ranks of Peacekeepers Trained young and hard for
combat The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth
and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere Of course the
people of 2 swallowed the Capitols propaganda more
easily than the rest of us Embraced their ways But for all
that at the end of the day they were still slaves And if that
was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or
worked in the Nut it was not lost on the stonecutters who
formed the backbone of the resistance here
Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks
ago The outer villages are in rebel hands the town divided
and the Nut is as untouchable as ever Its few entrances
heavily fortified its heart safely enfolded in the mountain
While every other district has now wrested control from the
Capitol 2 remains in its pocket
Each day I do whatever I can to help Visit the
wounded Tape short propos with my camera crew Im not
allowed in actual combat but they invite me to the meetings
on the status of the war which is a lot more than they did in
13 Its much better here Freer no schedules on my arm
fewer demands on my time I live aboveground in the rebel
villages or surrounding caves For safetys sake Im
relocated often During the day Ive been given clearance
to hunt as long as I take a guard along and dont stray too
far In the thin cold mountain air I feel some physical
strength returning my mind clearing away the rest of the
fogginess But with this mental clarity comes an even
sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta
Snow has stolen him from me twisted him beyond
recognition and made me a present of him Boggs who
came to 2 when I did told me that even with all the plotting
it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta He believes if 13
hadnt made the effort Peeta wouldve been delivered to
me anyway Dropped off in an actively warring district or
perhaps 13 itself Tied up with ribbons and tagged with my
name Programmed to murder me
Its only now that hes been corrupted that I can fully
appreciate the real Peeta Even more than I wouldve if hed
died The kindness the steadiness the warmth that had an
unexpected heat behind it Outside of Prim my mother and
Gale how many people in the world love me
unconditionally I think in my case the answer may now be
none Sometimes when Im alone I take the pearl from
where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with
the bread the strong arms that warded off nightmares on
the train the kisses in the arena To make myself put a
name to the thing Ive lost But whats the use Its gone
Hes gone Whatever existed between us is gone All thats
left is my promise to kill Snow I tell myself this ten times a
day
Back in 13 Peetas rehabilitation continues Even
though I dont ask Plutarch gives me cheerful updates on
the phone like Good news Katniss I think weve almost
got him convinced youre not a mutt Or Today he was
allowed to feed himself pudding
When Haymitch gets on after he admits Peetas no
better The only dubious ray of hope has come from my
sister Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack him
back Haymitch tells me Bring up the distorted memories
of you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug like
morphling Weve only tried it on one memory The tape of
the two of you in the cave when you told him that story
about getting Prim the goat
Any improvement I ask
Well if extreme confusion is an improvement over
extreme terror then yes says Haymitch But Im not sure it
is He lost the ability to speak for several hours Went into
some sort of stupor When he came out the only thing he
asked about was the goat
Right I say
Hows it out there he asks
No forward motion I tell him
Were sending out a team to help with the mountain
Beetee and some of the others he says You know the
brains
When the brains are selected Im not surprised to see
Gales name on the list I thought Beetee would bring him
not for his technological expertise but in the hopes that he
could somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountain
Originally Gale offered to come with me to 2 but I could
see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee I told
him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed I didnt
tell him his presence would make it even more difficult for
me to mourn Peeta
Gale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon Im
sitting on a log at the edge of my current village plucking a
goose A dozen or so of the birds are piled at my feet
Great flocks of them have been migrating through here
since Ive arrived and the pickings are easy Without a
word Gale settles beside me and begins to relieve a bird
of its feathers Were through about half when he says Any
chance well get to eat these
Yeah Most go to the camp kitchen but they expect
