Arya took a step forward but Syrio Forel held her by the arm And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own I am wondering

Mind your place dancing master Ser Meryn said This is no concern of yours

My father wouldn’t send you Arya said She snatched up her stick sword The Lannisters laughed

Put down the stick girl Ser Meryn told her I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard the White Swords

So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king Arya said I don’t have to go with you if I don’t want

Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience Take her he said to his men He lowered the visor of his helm

Three of them started forward chainmail clinking softly with each step Arya was suddenly afraid Fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself to slow the racing of her heart

Syrio Forel stepped between them tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot You will be stopping there Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child

Out of the way old man one of the red cloaks said

Syrio’s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm I am Syrio Forel and you will now be speaking to me with more respect

Bald bastard The man yanked free his longsword The stick moved again blindingly fast Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor My hand the guardsman yelped cradling his broken fingers

You are quick for a dancing master said Ser Meryn

You are slow for a knight Syrio replied

Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl the knight in the white armor commanded

Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords The fifth with the broken fingers spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand

Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together sliding into his water dancer’s stance presenting only his side to the foe Arya child he called out never looking never taking his eyes off the Lannisters we are done with dancing for the day Best you are going now Run to your father

Arya did not want to leave him but he had taught her to do as he said Swift as a deer she whispered

Just so said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed

Arya retreated her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand Watching him now she realized that Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled The red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands They had chainmail over their chest and arms and steel codpieces sewn into their pants but only leather on their legs Their hands were bare and the caps they wore had noseguards but no visor over the eyes

Syrio did not wait for them to reach him but spun to his left Arya had never seen a man move as fast He checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second Off balance the second man lurched into the first Syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together The third guard came leaping over them slashing at the water dancer’s head Syrio ducked under his blade and thrust upward The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had been

The fallen men were getting up Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the other’s head The dagger man stabbed at him Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man’s kneecap with his stick The last red cloak shouted a curse and charged hacking down with both hands on his sword Syrio rolled right and the butcher’s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled to his knees The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh The man on his knees shrieked Before his killer could wrench free his blade Syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back clutching at his neck his face blackening

Five men were down dead or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened on the kitchen She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse Bloody oafs he swore drawing his longsword from its scabbard

Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together Arya child he called out never looking at her be gone now

Look with your eyes he had said She saw the knight in his pale armor head to foot legs throat and hands sheathed in metal eyes hidden behind his high white helm and in his hand cruel steel Against that Syrio in a leather vest with a wooden sword in his hand Syrio run she screamed

The first sword of Braavos does not run he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him Syrio danced away from his cut his stick a blur In a heartbeat he had bounced blows off the knight’s temple elbow and throat the wood ringing against the metal of helm gauntlet and gorget Arya stood frozen Ser Meryn advanced Syrio backed away He checked the next blow spun away from the second deflected the third

The fourth sliced his stick in two splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core

Sobbing Arya spun and ran

She plunged through the kitchens and buttery blind with panic weaving between cooks and potboys A baker’s helper stepped in front of her holding a wooden tray Arya bowled her over scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor She heard shouting behind her as she spun around a portly butcher who stood gaping at her with a cleaver in his hands His arms were red to the elbow

All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head Swift as a deer Quiet as a shadow Fear cuts deeper than swords Quick as a snake Calm as still water Fear cuts deeper than swords Strong as a bear Fierce as a wolverine Fear cuts deeper than swords The man who fears losing has already lost Fear cuts deeper than swords Fear cuts deeper than swords Fear cuts deeper than swords The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat and Arya was breathing hard when she reached the turret stair For an instant she froze Up or down Up would take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand but that would be the way they’d expect her to go for certain Never do what they expect Syrio once said Arya went down around and around leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall The only light came through narrow slanting windows high in the wall

The cellar was a dead end There was no way out but the way she had come in She dare not go back up those steps but she couldn’t stay here either She had to find her father and tell him what had happened Her father would protect her

Arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb leaping from cask to cask until she could reach the window Grasping the stone with both hands she pulled herself up The wall was three feet thick the window a tunnel slanting up and out Arya wriggled toward daylight When her head reached ground level she peered across the bailey to the Tower of the Hand

The stout wooden door hung splintered and broken as if by axes A dead man sprawled facedown on the steps his cloak tangled beneath him the back of his mailed shirt soaked red The corpse’s cloak was grey wool trimmed with white satin she saw with sudden terror She could not tell who he was

No she whispered What was happening Where was her father Why had the red cloaks come for her She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said the day she had found the monsters If one Hand can die why not a second Arya felt tears in her eyes She held her breath to listen She heard the sounds of fighting shouts screams the clang of steel on steel coming through the windows of the Tower of the Hand

She could not go back Her father…

Arya closed her eyes For a moment she was too frightened to move They had killed Jory and Wyl and Heward and that guardsman on the step whoever he had been They could kill her father too and her if they caught her Fear cuts deeper than swords she said aloud but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick alone and afraid

She squirmed out into the yard glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet The castle seemed deserted The Red Keep was never deserted All the people must be hiding inside their doors barred Arya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber then moved away from the Tower of the Hand keeping close to the wall as she slid from shadow to shadow She pretended she was chasing cats… except she was the cat now and if they caught her they would kill her

Moving between buildings and over walls keeping stone to her back wherever possible so no one could surprise her Arya reached the stables almost without incident A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was edging across the inner bailey but without knowing whose side they were on she hunched down low in the shadows and let them pass

Hullen who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long as Arya could remember was slumped on the ground by the stable door He had been stabbed so many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers Arya was certain he was dead but when she crept closer his eyes opened Arya Underfoot he whispered You must… warn your… your lord father… Frothy red spittle bubbled from his mouth The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more

Inside were more bodies a groom she had played with and three of her father’s household guard A wagon laden with crates and chests stood abandoned near the door of the stable The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they were attacked Arya snuck closer One of the corpses was Desmond who’d shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father He lay on his back staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes Close to him was a dead man in the red cloak and lion-crest helm of the Lannisters Only one though Every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords Desmond had told her You liar she said kicking his body in a sudden fury

The animals were restless in their stalls whickering and snorting at the scent of blood Arya’s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee away from the castle and the city All she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell She took a bridle and harness off the wall

As she crossed in back of the wagon a fallen chest caught her eye It must have been knocked down in the fight or dropped as it was being loaded The wood had split the lid opening to spill the chest’s contents across the ground Arya recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore She might need warm clothes on the kingsroad though… and besides…

Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes She found a heavy woolen cloak a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes a dress her mother had embroidered for her a silver baby bracelet she might sell Shoving the broken lid out of the way she groped inside the chest for Needle She had hidden it way down at the bottom under everything but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it Then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown

There she is a voice hissed close behind her

Startled Arya whirled A stableboy stood behind her a smirk on his face his filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin His boots were covered with manure and he had a pitchfork in one hand Who are you she asked

She don’t know me he said but I knows her oh yes The wolf girl

Help me saddle a horse Arya pleaded reaching back into the chest groping for Needle My father’s the Hand of the King he’ll reward you

Father’s dead the boy said He shuffled toward her It’s the queen who’ll be rewarding me Come here girl

Stay away Her fingers closed around Needle’s hilt

I says come He grabbed her arm hard

Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat In that instant of sudden terror the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her the very first
