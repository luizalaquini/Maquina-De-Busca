11 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai
saying 12 Arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it
for their wickedness is come up before me

13 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the
LORD and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to Tarshish
so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them
unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD

14 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a
mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken

15 Then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god
and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to
lighten it of them But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the
ship and he lay and was fast asleep

16 So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him What meanest
thou O sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be that God will
think upon us that we perish not

17 And they said every one to his fellow Come and let us cast lots
that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us So they cast
lots and the lot fell upon Jonah

18 Then said they unto him Tell us we pray thee for whose cause
this evil is upon us What is thine occupation and whence comest
thou what is thy country and of what people art thou  19 And he
said unto them I am an Hebrew and I fear the LORD the God of
heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land

110 Then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him Why hast
thou done this For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the
LORD because he had told them

111 Then said they unto him What shall we do unto thee that the sea
may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous

112 And he said unto them Take me up and cast me forth into the
sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake
this great tempest is upon you

113 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but they
could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them

114 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD and said We beseech thee O
LORD we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay
not upon us innocent blood for thou O LORD hast done as it pleased
thee

115 So they look up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the
sea ceased from her raging

116 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly and offered a sacrifice
unto the LORD and made vows

117 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah And
Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights

21 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fishs belly
22 And said I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD and
he heard me out of the belly of hell cried I and thou heardest my
voice

23 For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas
and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves
passed over me

24 Then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again
toward thy holy temple

25 The waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed
me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head

26 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her
bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from
corruption O LORD my God

27 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD and my
prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple

28 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy

29 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving I
will pay that that I have vowed Salvation is of the LORD

210 And the LORD spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry land

31 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time saying
32 Arise go unto Nineveh that great city and preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee

33 So Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh according to the word of
the LORD Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days
journey

34 And Jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he
cried and said Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown
