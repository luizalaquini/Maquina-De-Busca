They found Jarl in a tree impaled upon a splintered branch and still roped to the three men who lay broken beneath him One was still alive but his legs and spine were shattered and most of his ribs as well Mercy he said when they came upon him One of the Thenns smashed his head in with a big stone mace The Magnar gave orders and his men began to gather fuel for a pyre

The dead were burning when Grigg the Goat reached the top of the Wall By the time Errok’s four had joined them nothing remained of Jarl and his team but bone and ash

The sun had begun to sink by then so the climbers wasted little time They unwound the long coils of hemp they’d had looped around their chests tied them all together and tossed down one end The thought of trying to climb five hundred feet up that rope filled Jon with dread but Mance had planned better than that The raiders Jarl had left below uncasked a huge ladder with rungs of woven hemp as thick as a man’s arm and tied it to the climbers’ rope Errok and Grigg and their men grunted and heaved pulled it up staked it to the top then lowered the rope again to haul up a second ladder There were five altogether

When all of them were in place the Magnar shouted a brusque command in the Old Tongue and five of his Thenns started up together Even with the ladders it was no easy climb Ygritte watched them struggle for a while I hate this Wall she said in a low angry voice Can you feel how cold it is

It’s made of ice Jon pointed out

You know nothing Jon Snow This wall is made o’ blood

Nor had it drunk its fill By sunset two of the Thenns had fallen from the ladder to their deaths but they were the last It was near midnight before Jon reached the top The stars were out again and Ygritte was trembling from the climb I almost fell she said with tears in her eyes Twice Thrice The Wall was trying t’ shake me off I could feel it One of the tears broke free and trickled slowly down her cheek

The worst is behind us Jon tried to sound confident Don’t be frightened He tried to put an arm around her

Ygritte slammed the heel of her hand into his chest so hard it stung even through his layers of wool mail and boiled leather I wasn’t frightened You know nothing Jon Snow

Why are you crying then

Not for fear She kicked savagely at the ice beneath her with a heel chopping out a chunk I’m crying because we never found the Horn of Winter We opened half a hundred graves and let all those shades loose in the world and never found the Horn of Joramun to bring this cold thing down





Jaime


His hand burned

Still still long after they had snuffed out the torch they’d used to sear his bloody stump days after he could still feel the fire lancing up his arm and his fingers twisting in the flames the fingers he no longer had

He had taken wounds before but never like this He had never known there could be such pain Sometimes unbidden old prayers bubbled from his lips prayers he learned as a child and never thought of since prayers he had first prayed with Cersei kneeling beside him in the sept at Casterly Rock Sometimes he even wept until he heard the Mummers laughing Then he made his eyes go dry and his heart go dead and prayed for his fever to burn away his tears Now I know how Tyrion has felt all those times they laughed at him

After the second time he fell from the saddle they bound him tight to Brienne of Tarth and made them share a horse again One day instead of back to front they bound them face-to-face The lovers Shagwell sighed loudly and what a lovely sight they are ’Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and his lady Then he laughed that high shrill laugh of his and said Ah but which one is the knight and which one is the lady

If I had my hand you’d learn that soon enough Jaime thought His arms ached and his legs were numb from the ropes but after a while none of that mattered His world shrunk to the throb of agony that was his phantom hand and Brienne pressed against him She’s warm at least he consoled himself though the wench’s breath was as foul as his own

His hand was always between them Urswyck had hung it about his neck on a cord so it dangled down against his chest slapping Brienne’s breasts as Jaime slipped in and out of consciousness His right eye was swollen shut the wound inflamed where Brienne had cut him during their fight but it was his hand that hurt the most Blood and pus seeped from his stump and the missing hand throbbed every time the horse took a step

His throat was so raw that he could not eat but he drank wine when they gave it to him and water when that was all they offered Once they handed him a cup and he quaffed it straight away trembling and the Brave Companions burst into laughter so loud and harsh it hurt his ears That’s horse piss you’re drinking Kingslayer Rorge told him Jaime was so thirsty he drank it anyway but afterward he retched it all back up They made Brienne wash the vomit out of his beard just as they made her clean him up when he soiled himself in the saddle

One damp cold morning when he was feeling slightly stronger a madness took hold of him and he reached for the Dornishman’s sword with his left hand and wrenched it clumsily from its scabbard Let them kill me he thought so long as I die fighting a blade in hand But it was no good Shagwell came hopping from leg to leg dancing nimbly aside when Jaime slashed at him Unbalanced he staggered forward hacking wildly at the fool but Shagwell spun and ducked and darted until all the Mummers were laughing at Jaime’s futile efforts to land a blow When he tripped over a rock and stumbled to his knees the fool leapt in and planted a wet kiss atop his head

Rorge finally flung him aside and kicked the sword from Jaime’s feeble fingers as he tried to bring it up That wath amuthing Kingthlayer said Vargo Hoat but if you try it again I thall take your other hand or perhapth a foot

Jaime lay on his back afterward staring at the night sky trying not to feel the pain that snaked up his right arm every time he moved it The night was strangely beautiful The moon was a graceful crescent and it seemed as though he had never seen so many stars The King’s Crown was at the zenith and he could see the Stallion rearing and there the Swan The Moonmaid shy as ever was half-hidden behind a pine tree How can such a night be beautiful he asked himself Why would the stars want to look down on such as me

Jaime Brienne whispered so faintly he thought he was dreaming it Jaime what are you doing

Dying he whispered back
