without ambiguity  The price paid for the resulting brevity of dialogue
is the burden of memorizing the meaning of the commands  This is an
inherent disadvantage of a one-dimensional auditory display over the
more conventional graphical output   presenting menus by speech is tedious and
long-winded  In practice however for a simple task such as the
Stores Information Service it is quite convenient for the caller to
search for the appropriate command by trying out all possibilities em there
