know all  
A few moments passed and she added slowly And
I will
Bathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood
which carried her through the actions following this
murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her
life She went to the lumber-closet for a screw-driver
At the end of a short though undefined time she found
herself in the small room quivering with emotion a mist
before her eyes and an excruciating pulsation in her
brain standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl
whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her and
saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed within --
It was best to know the worst and I know it now
P 357
She was conscious of having brought about this
situation by a series of actions done as by one in an
extravagant dream  of following that idea as to method
which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring
obviousness by gliding to the top of the stairs assuring
herself by listening to the heavy breathing of her maids
that they were asleep gliding down again turning the
handle of the door within which the young girl lay and
deliberately setting herself to do what if she had antici+
pated any such undertaking at night and alone would
have horrified her but which when done was not so
dreadful as was the conclusive proof of her husbands
conduct which came with knowing beyond doubt the
last chapter of Fannys story
Bathshebas head sank upon her bosom and the
breath which had been bated in suspense curiosity and
interest was exhaled now in the form of a whispered
wail Oh-h-h she said and the silent room added
length to her moan
Her tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the
coffin tears of a complicated origin of a nature inde+
scribable almost indefinable except as other than those
of simple sorrow Assuredly their wonted fires must
have lived in Fannys ashes when events were so shaped
as to chariot her hither in this natural unobtrusive yet
effectual manner The one feat alone -- that of dying --
by which a mean condition couId be resolved into a
grand one Fanny had achieved And to that had
destiny subjoined this rencounter to-night which had
in Bathshebas wild imagining turned her companions
failure to success her humiliation to triumph her luck
lessness to ascendency et had thrown over herself a
garish light of mockery and set upon all things about
her an ironical smile
Fannys face was framed in by that yeIIow hair of
hers and there was no longer much room for doubt as
to the origin of the curl owned by Troy In Bath+
shebas heated fancy the innocent white countenance
expressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain
she was retaliating for her pain with all the merciless
rigour of the Mosaic law Burning for burning wound
for wound strife for strife
Bathsheba indulged in contempIations of escape from
her position by immediate death which thought she

though it was an inconvenient and awful way had limits
to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not be
overpassed  whilst the shames of life were measureless
Yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out

tamely copying her rivals method without the reasons
which had glorified it in her rivals case She glided
rapidly up and down the room as was mostly her habit
hen excited her hands hanging clasped in front of her
as she thought and in part expressed in brocken words 
O I hate her yet I dont mean that I hate her for
it is grievous and wicked and yet I hate her a little 
yes my flesh insists upon hating her whether my spirit
is willing or no  If she had only lived I could
ave been angry and cruel towards her with some justifi+
cation  but to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman
recoils upon myself O God have mercy I am
miserable at all this  
Bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her
own state of mind that she looked around for some sort
of refuge from herself The vision of Oak kneeling
down that night recurred to her and with the imitative
instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea
resolved to kneel and if possible pray Gabriel had
prayed  so would she
She knelt beside the coffin covered her face with her
hands and for a time the room was silent as a tomb
whether from a purely mechanical or from any other
cause when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted spirit
and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had
seized upon her just before
In her desire to make atonement she took flowers
from a vase by the window and began laying them
around the dead girls head Bathsheba knew no other
way of showing kindness to persons departed than by
giving them flowers She knew not how long she
remained engaged thus She forgot time life where
she was what she was doing A slamming together of
the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to her+
self again An instant after the front door opened and
