her -- that she had felt herself sufficient to herself and
had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied
there was a certain degradation in renouncing the
simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler
half of an indifferent matrimonial whole -- were facts
now bitterly remembered O if she had never
stooped to folly of this kind respectable as it was and
could only stand again as she had stood on the hill at
Norcombe and dare Troy or any other man to pollute
a hair of her head by his interference
The next morning she rose earlier than usual and
had the horse saddled for her ride round the farm in
the customary way When she came in at half-past
eight -- their usual hour for breakfasting -- she was in+
formed that her husband had risen taken his breakfast
and driven off to Casterbridge with the gig and Poppet
After breakfast she was cool and collected -- quite
herself in fact -- and she rambled to the gate intending
to walk to another quarter of the farm which she still
personally superintended as well as her duties in the
house would permit continually however finding her+
self preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak for whom
she began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister
Of course she sometimes thought of him in the light of
an old lover and had momentary imaginings of what
life with him as a husband would have been like also
of life with Boldwood under the same conditions But
Bathsheba though she could feel was not much given
to futile dreaming and her musings under this head
were short and entirely confined to the times when
Troys neglect was more than ordinarily evident
She saw coming up the road a man like Mr Boldwood
P 335
It was Mr Boldwood Bathsheba blushed painfully
and watched The farmer stopped when still a long
way off and held up his hand to Gabriel Oak who was
in a footpath across the field The two men then
approached each other and seemed to engage in
earnest conversation
Thus they continued for a long time Joseph Poor+
grass now passed near them wheeling a barrow of apples
up the hill to Bathshebas residence Boldwood and
Gabriel called to him spoke to him for a few minutes
and then all three parted Joseph immediately coming
up the hill with his barrow
Bathsheba who had seen this pantomime with some
surprise experienced great relief when Boldwood turned
back again Well whats the message Joseph   she
said
He set down his barrow and putting upon himself
the refined aspect that a conversation with a lady re+
quired spoke to Bathsheba over the gate
Youll never see Fanny Robin no more -- use nor
principai-maam
 Why 
Because shes dead in the Union
 Fanny dead -- never
 Yes maam
 What did she die from 
I dont know for certain but I should be inclined
to think it was from general neshness of constitution
She was such a limber maid that a could stand no
hardship even when I knowed her and a went like a
candle-snoff so tis said She was took bad in the
morning and being quite feeble and worn out she
died in the evening She belongs by law to our parish
and Mr Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three
this afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her
Indeed I shall not let Mr Boldwood do any such
thing-i shall do it Fanny was my uncles servant
and although I only knew her for a couple of days
FANNY IS SENT FOR
she belongs to me How very very sad this is --
the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse Bathsheba
had begun to know what suffering was and she spoke
with real feeling Send across to Mr Boldwoods
and say that Mrs Troy will take upon herself the duty
P 336
of fetching an old servant of the family We
ought not to put her in a waggon well get a hearse
 There will hardly be time maam will there
 Perhaps not she said musingly  When did you
say we must be at the door -- three oclock
 Three oclock this afternoon maam so to speak it
Very weli-you go with it A pretty waggon is
better than an ugly hearse after all Joseph have the
new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels
and wash it very clean And Joseph --  -- 
 Yes maam
 Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put
upon her coffin  -- indeed gather a great many and
completely bury her in them Get some boughs of
laurustinus and variegated box and yew and boysiove
ay and some hunches of chrysanthemum And let old
Pleasant draw her because she knew him so well
I will maam I ought to have said that the
Union in the form of four labouring men will meet me
when I gets to our churchyard gate and take her and
bury her according to the rites of the Board of Guardians
as by law ordained
