I know Dany told her

It was her fourteenth name day





BRAN

In the yard below Rickon ran with the wolves

Bran watched from his window seat Wherever the boy went Grey Wind was there first loping ahead to cut him off until Rickon saw him screamed in delight and went pelting off in another direction Shaggydog ran at his heels spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close His fur had darkened until he was all black and his eyes were green fire Bran’s Summer came last He was silver and smoke with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see Smaller than Grey Wind and more wary Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter He could hear his brother’s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs

His eyes stung He wanted to be down there laughing and running Angry at the thought Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall His eighth name day had come and gone He was almost a man grown now too old to cry

It was just a lie he said bitterly remembering the crow from his dream I can’t fly I can’t even run

Crows are all liars Old Nan agreed from the chair where she sat doing her needlework I know a story about a crow

I don’t want any more stories Bran snapped his voice petulant He had liked Old Nan and her stories once Before But it was different now They left her with him all day now to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely but she just made it worse I hate your stupid stories

The old woman smiled at him toothlessly My stories No my little lord not mine The stories are before me and after me before you too

She was a very ugly old woman Bran thought spitefully shrunken and wrinkled almost blind too weak to climb stairs with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp No one really knew how old she was but his father said she’d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy She was the oldest person in Winterfell for certain maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him He had been an older brother of Lord Rickard Bran’s grandfather or perhaps a younger brother or a brother to Lord Rickard’s father Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children She had lost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne and her grandson was killed on the walls of Pyke during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died All that was left of her own blood was Hodor the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables but Old Nan just lived on and on doing her needlework and telling her stories

I don’t care whose stories they are Bran told her I hate them He didn’t want stories and he didn’t want Old Nan He wanted his mother and father He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside him He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows He wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers He wanted it to be the way it had been before

I know a story about a boy who hated stories Old Nan said with her stupid little smile her needles moving all the while click click click until Bran was ready to scream at her

It would never be the way it had been he knew The crow had tricked him into flying but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed They had all left him his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King’s Landing but they’d gone without him Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message and another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall but there had been no answers Ofttimes the birds are lost child the maester had told him There’s many a mile and many a hawk between here and King’s Landing the message may not have reached them Yet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept… or perhaps Bran had died and they had forgotten him Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom and a quarter of the guard

Only Robb and baby Rickon were still here and Robb was changed He was Robb the Lord now or trying to be He wore a real sword and never smiled His days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his window At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin talking or going over account books Sometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time visiting distant holdfasts Whenever he was away more than a day Rickon would cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming back Even when he was home at Winterfell Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen and Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers

I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder Old Nan said That was always your favorite

Thousands and thousands of years ago Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell and some said the Wall Bran knew the story but it had never been his favorite Maybe one of the other Brandons had liked that story Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon the baby she had nursed all those years ago and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon who was killed by the Mad King before Bran was even born She had lived so long Mother had told him once that all the Brandon Starks had become one person in her head

That’s not my favorite he said My favorites were the scary ones He heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse the wolves following him but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening He smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing

Oh my sweet summer child Old Nan said quietly what do you know of fear Fear is for the winter my little lord when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north Fear is for the long night when the sun hides its face for years at a time and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry and the white walkers move through the woods

You mean the Others Bran said querulously

The Others Old Nan agreed Thousands and thousands of years ago a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man There came a night that lasted a generation and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels Women smothered their children rather than see them starve and cried and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks Her voice and her needles fell silent and she glanced up at Bran with pale filmy eyes and asked So child This is the sort of story you like

Well Bran said reluctantly yes only…

Old Nan nodded In that darkness the Others came for the first time she said as her needles went click click click They were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain All the swords of men could not stay their advance and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them They hunted the maids through frozen forests and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children

Her voice had dropped very low almost to a whisper and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen

Now these were the days before the Andals came and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men who had taken these lands from the children of the forest Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills and the faces in the trees kept watch So as cold and death filled the earth the last hero determined to seek out the children in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost He set out into the dead lands with a sword a horse a dog and a dozen companions For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities One by one his friends died and his horse and finally even his dog and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds—

The door opened with a bang and Bran’s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear but it was only Maester Luwin with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him Hodor the stableboy announced as was his custom smiling hugely at them all

Maester Luwin was not smiling We have visitors he announced and your presence is required Bran

I’m listening to a story now Bran complained

Stories wait my little lord and when you come back to them why there they are Old Nan said Visitors are not so patient and ofttimes they bring stories of their own

Who is it Bran asked Maester Luwin

Tyrion Lannister and some men of the Night’s Watch with word from your brother Jon Robb is meeting with them now Hodor will you help Bran down to the hall

Hodor Hodor agreed happily He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door Hodor was nearly seven feet tall It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan Bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great-grandmother when he was old It did not seem likely even if Hodor lived to be a thousand

Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay and cradled him against his massive chest He always smelled faintly of horses but it was not a bad smell His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair Hodor he said again Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know much but no one could doubt that he knew his name Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told her that and confessed that Hodor’s real name was Walder No one knew where Hodor had come from she said but when he started saying it they started calling him by it It was the only word he had

They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery with Maester Luwin following behind hurrying to keep up with the stableboy’s long strides

Robb was seated in Father’s high seat wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants and four strangers in the black of the Night’s Watch Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor carried him through the doors

Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord His sword was across his knees the steel bare for all the world to see Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword

Any man of the Night’s Watch the dwarf repeated but not me do I take your meaning boy

Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword I am the lord here while my mother and father are away Lannister I am not your boy

If you are a lord you might learn a lord’s courtesy the little man replied ignoring the sword point in his face Your bastard brother has all your father’s graces it would seem

Jon Bran gasped out from Hodor’s arms

The dwarf turned to look at him So it is true the boy lives I could scarce believe it You Starks are hard to kill

You Lannisters had best remember that Robb said lowering his sword Hodor bring my brother here

Hodor Hodor said and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North The seat was cold stone polished smooth by countless bottoms the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms Bran clasped them as he sat his useless legs dangling The great seat made him feel half a baby

Robb put a hand on his shoulder You said you had business with Bran Well here he is Lannister

Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister’s eyes One was black and one was green and both were looking at him studying him weighing him I am told you were quite the climber Bran the little man said at last Tell me how is it you happened to fall that day

I never Bran insisted He never fell never never never

The child does not remember anything of the fall or the climb that came before it said Maester Luwin gently

Curious said Tyrion Lannister
