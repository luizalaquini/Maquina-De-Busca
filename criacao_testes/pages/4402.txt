FG Table 102  Syntax for a telephone calculator
A calculation is a sequence of operations followed by an EXIT function call
There are twelve different operations one for each button on the keypad
Actually two of them em
ul
cancel
and
ul
function
em share the same key so that  can be reserved for use as a
separator but the context ensures that they cannot be confused by the system
pp
Six of the operations give control over the dialogue
There are three different repeat commands a command called
ul
erasec

which undoes the effect of the last operation
one which reads out the value of a register
and one which aborts the current utterance
Four more commands provide the basic arithmetic operations of add
subtract multiply and divide
The operands of these may be keyed literal numbers or register values
or function calls
A further command clears a register
pp
It is through functions that the extensibility of the language is achieved
A function has a name like SIN EXIT MYFUNC which is keyed with an
appropriate single-key-per-character sequence namely 746 3948 693862
respectively
One function DEFINE allows new ones to be entered
Another LOOP repeats sequences of operations
TEST incorporates arithmetic testing
The details of these are not important  what is interesting is the evident
power of the calculator
pp
For example the keying sequence
LB
NI
5    1  1  2  3    2  1    2    9    6    2  1    4  
LE
would be decoded as
LB
NI
ul
clearc
  +  123  -  12  c
ul
display  erasec
  -  14
LE
One of the difficulties with such a tight syntax is that almost any sequence
will be intepreted as a valid calculation em syntax errors are nearly
impossible
Thus a small mistake by the user can have a catastrophic effect on the
calculation
Here however speech output gives an advantage over conventional
character-by-character echoing
on visual displays
It is quite adequate to echo syntactic units as they are decoded instead
of echoing keys as they are entered
It was suggested earlier in this chapter that confirmation of entry
should be generated in the same way that the user would be likely to
verbalize it himself
Thus the synthetic voice could respond to the above keying sequence as
shown in the second line except that the
ul
display
command would also state the result
and possibly summarize the calculation so far
Numbers could be verbalized as one hundred and twenty-three
instead of as one  two  three
Note however that this will make it necessary to await the  terminator
after numbers and function names before they can be echoed

There are no books which relate techniques of man-computer dialogue
to speech interaction
The best I can do is to guide you to some of the standard works on
interactive techniques
