There was general laughter led by Lord Renly himself The tension of a few moments ago was gone and Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable… until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside and stood before her unsmiling He did not say a word Lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head I am sorry if I offended you Ser Ilyn she said

She waited for an answer but none came As the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him Still silent he turned and walked away

Sansa did not understand She looked at her prince Did I say something wrong Your Grace Why will he not speak to me

Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years Lord Renly commented with a sly smile

Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took Sansa’s hands in his own Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers

He speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned Then she smiled graciously and said Sansa the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella Please give your sweet sister my apologies Joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today

It would be my pleasure Mother Joffrey said very formally He took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and Sansa’s spirits took flight A whole day with her prince She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully He was so gallant she thought The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound why it was almost like the songs like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa from the giants or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys’s honor against evil Ser Morgil’s slanders

The touch of Joffrey’s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster What would you like to do

Be with you Sansa thought but she said Whatever you’d like to do my prince

Jofftey reflected a moment We could go riding

Oh I love riding Sansa said

Joffrey glanced back at Lady who was following at their heels Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say

Sansa hesitated If you like she said uncertainly I suppose I could tie Lady up She did not quite understand though I didn’t know you had a dog…

Joffrey laughed He’s my mother’s dog in truth She has set him to guard me and so he does

You mean the Hound she said She wanted to hit herself for being so slow Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid Is it safe to leave him behind

Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask Have no fear lady I am almost a man grown and I don’t fight with wood like your brothers All I need is this He drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castle-forged and double-edged with a leather grip and a lion’s-head pommel in gold Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and Joffrey looked pleased I call it Lion’s Tooth he said

And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion’s Tooth

It was a glorious day a magical day The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north Prince Joffrey’s mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare It was a day for adventures They explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry Joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady They dined on trout fresh from the river and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before My father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince

My betrothed can drink as much as she wants Joffrey said refilling her cup

They went more slowly after they had eaten Joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine Shouldn’t we be starting back she asked

Soon Joffrey said The battleground is right up ahead where the river bends That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen you know He smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys and my father was king What’s that sound

Sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack I don’t know she said It made her nervous though Joffrey let’s go back

I want to see what it is Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and Sansa had no choice but to follow The noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt

Someone’s there Sansa said anxiously She found herself thinking of Lady wishing the direwolf was with her

You’re safe with me Joffrey drew his Lion’s Tooth from its sheath The sound of steel on leather made her tremble This way he said riding through a stand of trees

Beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights Their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily The boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack The girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy’s blows but not all When she tried to lunge at him he caught her stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers She cried out and lost her weapon

Prince Joffrey laughed The boy looked around wide-eyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass The girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and Sansa was horrified Arya she called out incredulously
