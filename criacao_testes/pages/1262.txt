The ironmen slammed shut the tall doors at the foot of the hall From the high seat Bran could see about twenty of them He probably left some guards on the gates and the armory Even so there couldn’t be more than thirty

Theon raised his hands for quiet You all know me—

Aye we know you for a sack of steaming dung shouted Mikken before the bald man drove the butt of his spear into his gut then smashed him across the face with the shaft The smith stumbled to his knees and spat out a tooth

Mikken you be silent Bran tried to sound stern and lordly the way Robb did when he made a command but his voice betrayed him and the words came out in a shrill squeak

Listen to your little lordling Mikken said Theon He has more sense than you do

A good lord protects his people he reminded himself I’ve yielded Winterfell to Theon

Louder Bran And call me prince

He raised his voice I have yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon All of you should do as he commands you

Damned if I will bellowed Mikken

Theon ignored the outburst My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands He claims the north as well by right of conquest You are all his subjects

Bugger that Mikken wiped the blood from his mouth I serve the Starks not some treasonous squid of—aah The butt of the spear smashed him face first into the stone floor

Smiths have strong arms and weak heads observed Theon But if the rest of you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark you’ll find me as generous a lord as you could want on his hands and knees Mikken spat blood Please don’t Bran wished at him but the blacksmith shouted If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o’—

The bald man drove the point of his spear into the back of Mikken’s neck Steel slid through flesh and came out his throat in a welter of blood A woman screamed and Meera wrapped her arms around Rickon It’s blood he drowned on Bran thought numbly His own blood

Who else has something to say asked Theon Greyjoy

Hodor hodor hodor hodor shouted Hodor eyes wide

Someone kindly shut that halfwit up

Two ironmen began to beat Hodor with the butts of their spears The stableboy dropped to the floor trying to shield himself with his hands

I will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was Theon raised his voice to be heard above the smack of wood on flesh Betray me though and you’ll wish you hadn’t And don’t think the men you see here are the whole of my power Torrhen’s Square and Deepwood Motte will soon be ours as well and my uncle is sailing up the Saltspear to seize Moat Cailin If Robb Stark can stave off the Lannisters he may reign as King of the Trident hereafter but House Greyjoy holds the north now

Stark’s lords will fight you the man Reek called out That bloated pig at White Harbor for one and them Umbers and Karstarks too You’ll need men Free me and I’m yours

Theon weighed him a moment You’re cleverer than you smell but I could not suffer that stench

Well said Reek I could wash some If I was free

A man of rare good sense Theon smiled Bend the knee one of the ironmen handed Reek a sword and he laid it at Theon’s feet and swore obedience to House Greyjoy and King Balon Bran could not look The green dream was coming true

M’lord Greyjoy Osha stepped past Mikken’s body I was brought here captive too You were there the day I was taken

I thought you were a friend Bran thought hurt

I need fighters Theon declared not kitchen sluts

It was Robb Stark put me in the kitchens For the best part of a year I’ve been left to scour kettles scrape grease and warm the straw for this one She threw a look at Gage I’ve had a bellyful of it Put a spear in my hand again

I got a spear for you right here said the bald man who’d killed Mikken He grabbed his crotch grinning

Osha drove her bony knee up between his legs You keep that soft pink thing She wrested the spear from him and used the butt to knock him off his feet I’ll have me the wood and iron The bald man writhed on the floor while the other reavers sent up gales of laughter

Theon laughed with the rest You’ll do he said Keep the spear Stygg can find another Now bend the knee and swear

When no one else rushed forward to pledge service they were dismissed with a warning to do their work and make no trouble Hodor was given the task of bearing Bran back to his bed His face was all ugly from the beating his nose swollen and one eye closed Hodor he sobbed between cracked lips as he lifted Bran in huge strong arms and bloody hands and carried him back out into the rain





ARYA

There’s ghosts I know there is Hot Pie was kneading bread his arms floured up to his elbows Pia saw something in the buttery last night

Arya made a rude noise Pia was always seeing things in the buttery Usually they were men Can I have a tart she asked You baked a whole tray

I need a whole tray Ser Amory is partial to them

She hated Ser Amory Let’s spit on them

Hot Pie looked around nervously The kitchens were full of shadows and echoes but the other cooks and scullions were all asleep in the cavernous lofts above the ovens He’ll know

He will not Arya said You can’t taste spit

If he does it’s me they’ll whip Hot Pie stopped his kneading You shouldn’t even be here It’s the black of night

It was but Arya never minded Even in the black of night the kitchens were never still there was always someone rolling dough for the morning bread stirring a kettle with a long wooden spoon or butchering a hog for Ser Amory’s breakfast bacon Tonight it was Hot Pie

If Pinkeye wakes and finds you gone— Hot Pie said

Pinkeye never wakes His true name was Mebble but everyone called him Pinkeye for his runny eyes Not once he’s passed out Each morning he broke his fast with ale Each evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper wine-colored spit running down his chin Arya would wait until she heard him snoring then creep barefoot up the servant’s stair making no more noise than the mouse she’d been She carried neither candle nor taper Syrio had told her once that darkness could be her friend and he was right If she had the moon and the stars to see by that was enough I bet we could escape and Pinkeye wouldn’t even notice I was gone she told Hot Pie

I don’t want to escape It’s better here than it was in them woods I don’t want to eat no worms Here sprinkle some flour on the board

Arya cocked her head What’s that

What I don’t—

Listen with your ears not your mouth That was a warhorn Two blasts didn’t you hear And there that’s the portcullis chains someone’s going out or coming in Want to go see The gates of Harrenhal had not been opened since the morning Lord Tywin had marched with his host

I’m making the morning bread Hot Pie complained Anyhow I don’t like it when it’s dark I told you

I’m going I’ll tell you after Can I have a tart

No
