They’re not wearing skins Jon realized That’s hair Shaggy pelts covered their bodies thick below the waist sparser above The stink that came off them was choking but perhaps that was the mammoths And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth He looked for great swords ten feet long but saw only clubs Most were just the limbs of dead trees some still trailing shattered branches A few had stone balls lashed to the ends to make colossal mauls The song never says if the horn can put them back to sleep

One of the giants coming up on them looked older than the rest His pelt was grey and streaked with white and the mammoth he rode larger than any of the others was grey and white as well Tormund shouted something up to him as he passed harsh clanging words in a tongue that Jon did not comprehend The giant’s lips split apart to reveal a mouth full of huge square teeth and he made a sound half belch and half rumble After a moment Jon realized he was laughing The mammoth turned its massive head to regard the two of them briefly one huge tusk passing over the top of Jon’s head as the beast lumbered by leaving huge footprints in the soft mud and fresh snow along the river The giant shouted down something in the same coarse tongue that Tormund had used

Was that their king asked Jon

Giants have no kings no more’n mammoths do nor snow bears nor the great whales o’ the grey sea That was Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg Mag the Mighty You can kneel to him if you like he won’t mind I know your kneeler’s knees must be itching for want of some king to bend to Watch out he don’t step on you though Giants have bad eyes and might be he wouldn’t see some little crow all the way down there by his feet

What did you say to him Was that the Old Tongue

Aye I asked him if that was his father he was forking they looked so much alike except his father had a better smell

And what did he say to you

Tormund Thunderfist cracked a gap-toothed smile He asked me if that was my daughter riding there beside me with her smooth pink cheeks The wildling shook snow from his arm and turned his horse about It may be he never saw a man without a beard before Come we start back Mance grows sore wroth when I’m not found in my accustomed place

Jon wheeled and followed Tormund back toward the head of the column his new cloak hanging heavy from his shoulders It was made of unwashed sheepskins worn fleece side in as the wildlings suggested It kept the snow off well enough and at night it was good and warm but he kept his black cloak as well folded up beneath his saddle Is it true you killed a giant once he asked Tormund as they rode Ghost loped silently beside them leaving paw prints in the new-fallen snow

Now why would you doubt a mighty man like me It was winter and I was half a boy and stupid the way boys are I went too far and my horse died and then a storm caught me A true storm not no little dusting such as this Har I knew I’d freeze to death before it broke So I found me a sleeping giant cut open her belly and crawled up right inside her Kept me warm enough she did but the stink near did for me The worst thing was she woke up when the spring come and took me for her babe Suckled me for three whole moons before I could get away Har There’s times I miss the taste o’ giant’s milk though

If she nursed you you couldn’t have killed her

I never did but see you don’t go spreading that about Tormund Giantsbane has a better ring to it than Tormund Giantsbabe and that’s the honest truth o’ it

So how did you come by your other names Jon asked Mance called you the Horn-Blower didn’t he Mead-king of Ruddy Hall Husband to Bears Father to Hosts It was the horn blowing he particularly wanted to hear about but he dared not ask too plainly And Joramun blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth Is that where they had come from them and their mammoths Had Mance Rayder found the Horn of Joramun and given it to Tormund Thunderfist to blow

Are all crows so curious asked Tormund Well here’s a tale for you It were another winter colder even than the one I spent inside that giant and snowing day and night snowflakes as big as your head not these little things It snowed so hard the whole village was half buried I was in me Ruddy Hall with only a cask o’ mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it The more I drank the more I got to thinking about this woman lived close by a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever saw She had a temper on her that one but oh she could be warm too and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth

The more I drank the more I thought about her and the more I thought the harder me member got till I couldn’t suffer it no more Fool that I was I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels wrapped a winding wool around me face and set off to find her The snow was coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice and the wind blew right through me and froze me bones but finally I come on her all bundled up like I was

The woman had a terrible temper and she put up quite the fight when I laid hands on her It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o’ them furs but when I did oh she was hotter even than I remembered and we had a fine old time and then I went to sleep Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining but I was in no fit state to enjoy it All ripped and torn I was and half me member bit right off and there on me floor was a she-bear’s pelt And soon enough the free folk were telling tales o’ this bald bear seen in the woods with the queerest pair o’ cubs behind her Har He slapped a meaty thigh Would that I could find her again She was fine to lay with that bear Never was a woman gave me such a fight nor such strong sons neither

’What could you do if you did find her Jon asked smiling You said she bit your member off

Only half And half me member is twice as long as any other man’s Tormund snorted Now as to you… is it true they cut your members off when they take you for the Wall

No Jon said affronted

I think it must be true Else why refuse Ygritte She’d hardly give you any fight at all seems to me The girl wants you in her that’s plain enough to see

Too bloody plain thought Jon and it seems that half the column has seen it He studied the falling snow so Tormund might not see him redden I am a man of the Night’s Watch he reminded himself So why did he feel like some blushing maid

He spent most of his days in Ygritte’s company and most nights as well Mance Rayder had not been blind to Rattleshirt’s mistrust of the crow-come-over so after he had given Jon his new sheepskin cloak he had suggested that he might want to ride with Tormund Giantsbane instead Jon had happily agreed and the very next day Ygritte and Longspear Ryk left Rattleshirt’s band for Tormund’s as well Free folk ride with who they want the girl told him and we had a bellyful of Bag o’ Bones

Every night when they made camp Ygritte threw her sleeping skins down beside his own no matter if he was near the fire or well away from it Once he woke to find her nestled against him her arm across his chest He lay listening to her breathe for a long time trying to ignore the tension in his groin Rangers often shared skins for warmth but warmth was not all Ygritte wanted he suspected After that he had taken to using Ghost to keep her away Old Nan used to tell stories about knights and their ladies who would sleep in a single bed with a blade between them for honor’s sake but he thought this must be the first time where a direwolf took the place of the sword

Even then Ygritte persisted The day before last Jon had made the mistake of wishing he had hot water for a bath Cold is better she had said at once if you’ve got someone to warm you up after The river’s only part ice yet go on

Jon laughed You’d freeze me to death

Are all crows afraid of gooseprickles A little ice won’t kill you I’ll jump in with you t’prove it so

And ride the rest of the day with wet clothes frozen to our skins he objected

Jon Snow you know nothing You don’t go in with clothes

I don’t go in at all he said firmly just before he heard Tormund Thunderfist bellowing for him he hadn’t but never mind

The wildlings seemed to think Ygritte a great beauty because of her hair red hair was rare among the free folk and those who had it were said to be kissed by fire which was supposed to be lucky Lucky it might be and red it certainly was but Ygritte’s hair was such a tangle that Jon was tempted to ask her if she only brushed it at the changing of the seasons

At a lord’s court the girl would never have been considered anything but common he knew She had a round peasant face a pug nose and slightly crooked teeth and her eyes were too far apart Jon had noticed all that the first time he’d seen her when his dirk had been at her throat Lately though he was noticing some other things When she grinned the crooked teeth didn’t seem to matter And maybe her eyes were too far apart but they were a pretty blue-grey color and lively as any eyes he knew Sometimes she sang in a low husky voice that stirred him And sometimes by the cookfire when she sat hugging her knees with the flames waking echoes in her red hair and looked at him just smiling… well that stirred some things as well

But he was a man of the Night’s Watch he had taken a vow I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children He had said the words before the weirwood before his father’s gods He could not unsay them… no more than he could admit the reason for his reluctance to Tormund Thunderfist Father to Bears

Do you mislike the girl Tormund asked him as they passed another twenty mammoths these bearing wildlings in tall wooden towers instead of giants

No but I… What can I say that he will believe I am still too young to wed

Wed Tormund laughed Who spoke of wedding In the south must a man wed every girl he beds

Jon could feel himself turning red again She spoke for me when Rattleshirt would have killed me I would not dishonor her

You are a free man now and Ygritte is a free woman What dishonor if you lay together

I might get her with child

Aye I’d hope so A strong son or a lively laughing girl kissed by fire and where’s the harm in that

Words failed him for a moment The boy… the child would be a bastard

Are bastards weaker than other children More sickly more like to fail

No but—

You’re bastard-born yourself And if Ygritte does not want a child she will go to some woods witch and drink a cup o’ moon tea You do not come into it once the seed is planted

I will not father a bastard

Tormund shook his shaggy head What fools you kneelers be Why did you steal the girl if you don’t want her

Steal I never…

You did said Tormund You slew the two she was with and carried her off what do you call it

I took her prisoner

You made her yield to you

Yes but… Tormund I swear I’ve never touched her
