Sure you will She had a warm smile despite her crooked teeth And we’ll be free to kill you It’s dangerous being free but most come to like the taste o’ it She put her gloved hand on his leg just above the knee You’ll see

I will thought Jon I will see and hear and learn and when I have I will carry the word back to the Wall The wildlings had taken him for an oathbreaker but in his heart he was still a man of the Night’s Watch doing the last duty that Qhorin Halfhand had laid on him Before I killed him

At the bottom of the slope they came upon a little stream flowing down from the foothills to join the Milkwater It looked all stones and glass though they could hear the sound of water running beneath the frozen surface Rattleshirt led them across shattering the thin crust of ice

Mance Rayder’s outriders closed in as they emerged Jon took their measure with a glance eight riders men and women both clad in fur and boiled leather with here and there a helm or bit of mail They were armed with spears and fire-hardened lances all but their leader a fleshy blond man with watery eyes who bore a great curved scythe of sharpened steel The Weeper he knew at once The black brothers told tales of this one Like Rattleshirt and Harma Dogshead and Alfyn Crowkiller he was a known raider

The Lord o’ Bones the Weeper said when he saw them He eyed Jon and his wolf Who’s this then

A crow come over said Rattleshirt who preferred to be called the Lord of Bones for the clattering armor he wore He was afraid I’d take his bones as well as Halfhand’s He shook his sack of trophies at the other wildlings

He slew Qhorin Halfhand said Longspear Ryk Him and that wolf o’ his

And did for Orell too said Rattleshirt

The lad’s a warg or close enough put in Ragwyle the big spearwife His wolf took a piece o’ Halfhand’s leg

The Weeper’s red rheumy eyes gave Jon another look Aye Well he has a wolfish cast to him now as I look close Bring him to Mance might be he’ll keep him He wheeled his horse around and galloped off his riders hard behind him

The wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp Ghost kept close to Jon but the scent of him went before them like a herald and soon there were wildling dogs all around them growling and barking Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet but they paid him no heed They don’t much care for that beast o’ yours Longspear Ryk said to Jon

They’re dogs and he’s a wolf said Jon They know he’s not their kind No more than I am yours But he had his duty to be mindful of the task Qhorin Halfhand had laid upon him as they shared that final fire—to play the part of turncloak and find whatever it was that the wildlings had been seeking in the bleak cold wilderness of the Frostfangs Some power Qhorin had named it to the Old Bear but he had died before learning what it was or whether Mance Rayder had found it with his digging

There were cookfires all along the river amongst wayns and carts and sleds Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents of hide and skin and felted wool Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos or slept beneath their wagons At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and tossing them in a pile Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were sparring with staffs leaping at each other over the flames grunting each time one landed a blow A dozen women sat nearby in a circle fletching arrows

Arrows for my brothers Jon thought Arrows for my father’s folk for the people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth Arrows for the north

But not all he saw was warlike He saw women dancing as well and heard a baby crying and a little boy ran in front of his garron all bundled up in fur and breathless from play Sheep and goats wandered freely while oxen plodded along the riverbank in search of grass The smell of roast mutton drifted from one cookfire and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit

In an open space surrounded by tall green soldier pines Rattleshirt dismounted We’ll make camp here he told Lenyl and Ragwyle and the others Feed the horses then the dogs then yourself Ygritte Longspear bring the crow so Mance can have his look We’ll gut him after

They walked the rest of the way past more cookfires and more tents with Ghost following at their heels Jon had never seen so many wildlings He wondered if anyone ever had The camp goes on forever he reflected but it’s more a hundred camps than one and each more vulnerable than the last Stretched out over long leagues the wildlings had no defenses to speak of no pits nor sharpened stakes only small groups of outriders patrolling their perimeters Each group or clan or village had simply stopped where they wanted as soon as they saw others stopping or found a likely spot The free folk If his brothers were to catch them in such disarray many of them would pay for that freedom with their life’s blood They had numbers but the Night’s Watch had discipline and in battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten his father had once told him

There was no doubting which tent was the king’s It was thrice the size of the next largest he’d seen and he could hear music drifting from within Like many of the lesser tents it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on but Mance Rayder’s hides were the shaggy white pelts of snow bears The peaked roof was crowned with a huge set of antlers from one of the giant elks that had once roamed freely throughout the Seven Kingdoms in the times of the First Men

Here at least they found defenders two guards at the flap of the tent leaning on tall spears with round leather shields strapped to their arms When they caught sight of Ghost one of them lowered his spearpoint and said That beast stays here

Ghost stay Jon commanded The direwolf sat

Longspear watch the beast Rattleshirt yanked open the tent and gestured Jon and Ygritte inside

The tent was hot and smoky Baskets of burning peat stood in all four corners filling the air with a dim reddish light More skins carpeted the ground Jon felt utterly alone as he stood there in his blacks awaiting the pleasure of the turncloak who called himself King-beyond-the-Wall When his eyes had adjusted to the smoky red gloom he saw six people none of whom paid him any mind A dark young man and a pretty blonde woman were sharing a horn of mead A pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens while a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat crosslegged on a pillow playing a lute and singing

The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun

and her kisses were warmer than spring

But the Dornishman’s blade was made of black steel

and its kiss was a terrible thing

Jon knew the song though it was strange to hear it here in a shaggy hide tent beyond the Wall ten thousand leagues from the red mountains and warm winds of Dorne

Rattleshirt took off his yellowed helm as he waited for the song to end Beneath his bone-and-leather armor he was a small man and the face under the giant’s skull was ordinary with a knobby chin thin mustache and sallow pinched cheeks His eyes were close-set one eyebrow creeping all the way across his forehead dark hair thinning back from a sharp widow’s peak

The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed

in a voice that was sweet as a peach

But the Dornishman’s blade had a song of its own

and a bite sharp and cold as a leech

Beside the brazier a short but immensely broad man sat on a stool eating a hen off a skewer Hot grease was running down his chin and into his snow-white beard but he smiled happily all the same Thick gold bands graven with runes bound his massive arms and he wore a heavy shirt of black ringmail that could only have come from a dead ranger A few feet away a taller leaner man in a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales stood frowning over a map a two-handed greatsword slung across his back in a leather sheath He was straight as a spear all long wiry muscle clean-shaved bald with a strong straight nose and deepset grey eyes He might even have been comely if he’d had ears but he had lost both along the way whether to frostbite or some enemy’s knife Jon could not tell Their lack made the man’s head seem narrow and pointed

Both the white-bearded man and the bald one were warriors that was plain to Jon at a glance These two are more dangerous than Rattleshirt by far He wondered which was Mance Rayder

As he lay on the ground with the darkness around

and the taste of his blood on his tongue

His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer

and he smiled and he laughed and he sung

Brothers oh brothers my days here are done

the Dornishman’s taken my life

But what does it matter for all men must die

and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife

As the last strains of The Dornishman’s Wife faded the bald earless man glanced up from his map and scowled ferociously at Rattleshirt and Ygritte with Jon between them What’s this he said A crow

The black bastard what gutted Orell said Rattleshirt and a bloody warg as well

You were to kill them all

This one come over explained Ygritte He slew Qhorin Halfhand with his own hand

This boy The earless man was angered by the news The Halfhand should have been mine Do you have a name crow

Jon Snow Your Grace He wondered whether he was expected to bend the knee as well

Your Grace The earless man looked at the big white-bearded one You see He takes me for a king

The bearded man laughed so hard he sprayed bits of chicken everywhere He rubbed the grease from his mouth with the back of a huge hand A blind boy must be Who ever heard of a king without ears Why his crown would fall straight down to his neck Har He grinned at Jon wiping his fingers clean on his breeches Close your beak crow Spin yourself around might be you’d find who you’re looking for
