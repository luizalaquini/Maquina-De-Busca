of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries 44
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot speaking evil of you 45 Who shall give account to
him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead

46 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but
live according to God in the spirit

47 But the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and
watch unto prayer

48 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins

49 Use hospitality one to another without grudging

410 As every man hath received the gift even so minister the same
one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God

411 If any man speak let him speak as the oracles of God if any man
minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God
in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise
and dominion for ever and ever Amen

412 Beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you 413 But
rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings that
when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy

414 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the
spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil
spoken of but on your part he is glorified

415 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an
evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters

416 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but
let him glorify God on this behalf

417 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of God  418 And if the righteous scarcely be
saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear  419 Wherefore
let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping
of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful Creator

51 The elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and
a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed 52 Feed the flock of God which is among
you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly
not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind 53 Neither as being lords
over Gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock

54 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown
of glory that fadeth not away

55 Likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder Yea all
of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for
God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble

56 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he
may exalt you in due time 57 Casting all your care upon him for he
careth for you

58 Be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a
roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 59 Whom
resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world

510 But the God of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you
perfect stablish strengthen settle you

511 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever Amen

512 By Silvanus a faithful brother unto you as I suppose I have
written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace
of God wherein ye stand

513 The church that is at Babylon elected together with you
saluteth you and so doth Marcus my son

514 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity Peace be with you
all that are in Christ Jesus Amen
