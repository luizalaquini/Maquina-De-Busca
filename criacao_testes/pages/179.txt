You have to look Jon told him keeping his voice low so the others would not hear Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes didn’t he What good are eyes if they’re shut

Yes but… I’m such a coward Jon

Jon put a hand on Sam’s shoulder We have a dozen rangers with us and the dogs even Ghost No one will hurt you Sam Go ahead and look The first look is the hardest

Sam gave a tremulous nod working up his courage with a visible effort Slowly he swiveled his head His eyes widened but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away

Ser Jaremy the Old Bear asked gruffly Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall Where are the others

Ser Jaremy shook his head Would that I knew

Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall yet your rangers heard nothing saw nothing Is this what the Night’s Watch has fallen to Do we still sweep these woods

Yes my lord but—

Do we still mount watches

We do but—

This man wears a hunting horn Mormont pointed at Othor Must I suppose that he died without sounding it Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind

Ser Jaremy bristled his face taut with anger No horn was blown my lord or my rangers would have heard it I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like… and since Benjen was lost we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before by your own command

The Old Bear grunted Yes Well Be that as it may He made an impatient gesture Tell me how they died

Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp The hair came out between his fingers brittle as straw The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand A great gash in the side of the corpse’s neck opened like a mouth crusted with dried blood Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck This was done with an axe

Aye muttered Dywen the old forester Belike the axe that Othor carried m’lord

Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body Othor had been a big ugly man and he made a big ugly corpse No axe was in evidence Jon remembered Othor he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out His singing days were done His flesh was blanched white as milk everywhere but his hands His hands were black like Jafer’s Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash breast and groin and throat Yet his eyes were still open They stared up at the sky blue as sapphires

Ser Jaremy stood The wildlings have axes too

Mormont rounded on him So you believe this is Mance Rayder’s work This close to the Wall

Who else my lord

Jon could have told him He knew they all knew yet no man of them would say the words The Others are only a story a tale to make children shiver If they ever lived at all they are gone eight thousand years Even the thought made him feel foolish he was a man grown now a black brother of the Night’s Watch not the boy who’d once sat at Old Nan’s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya

Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day’s ride from Castle Black he would have returned for more men chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads

Unless he was slain as well Ser Jaremy insisted

The words hurt even now It had been so long it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn

It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us my lord Ser Jaremy went on The forest is vast The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere I’d wager these two were the last survivors of his party on their way back to us… but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall The corpses are still fresh these men cannot have been dead more than a day…

No Samwell Tarly squeaked

Jon was startled Sam’s nervous high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear The fat boy was frightened of the officers and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience

I did not ask for your views boy Rykker said coldly
