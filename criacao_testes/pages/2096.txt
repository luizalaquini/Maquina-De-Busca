Sansa had always thought Lancel Lannister comely and well spoken but there was neither pity nor kindness in the look he gave her Using some vile sorcery your brother fell upon Ser Stafford Lannister with an army of wargs not three days ride from Lannisport Thousands of good men were butchered as they slept without the chance to lift sword After the slaughter the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain

Horror coiled cold hands around Sansa’s throat

You have nothing to say asked Joffrey

Your Grace the poor child is shocked witless murmured Ser Dontos

Silence fool Joffrey lifted his crossbow and pointed it at her face You Starks are as unnatural as those wolves of yours I’ve not forgotten how your monster savaged me

That was Arya’s wolf she said Lady never hurt you but you killed her anyway

No your father did Joff said but I killed your father I wish I’d done it myself I killed a man last night who was bigger than your father They came to the gate shouting my name and calling for bread like I was some baker but I taught them better I shot the loudest one right through the throat

And he died With the ugly iron head of the quarrel staring her in the face it was hard to think what else to say

Of course he died he had my quarrel in his throat There was a woman throwing rocks I got her as well but only in the arm Frowning he lowered the crossbow I’d shoot you too but if I do Mother says they’d kill my uncle Jaime Instead you’ll just be punished and we’ll send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesn’t yield Dog hit her

Let me beat her Ser Dontos shoved forward tin armor clattering He was armed with a morningstar whose head was a melon My Florian She could have kissed him blotchy skin and broken veins and all He trotted his broomstick around her shouting Traitor traitor and whacking her over the head with the melon Sansa covered herself with her hands staggering every time the fruit pounded her her hair sticky by the second blow People were laughing The melon flew to pieces Laugh Joffrey she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the front of her blue silk gown Laugh and be satisfied

Joffrey did not so much as snigger Boros Meryn

Ser Meryn Trant seized Dontos by the arm and flung him brusquely away The red-faced fool went sprawling broomstick melon and all Ser Boros seized Sansa

Leave her face Joffrey commanded I like her pretty

Boros slammed a fist into Sansa’s belly driving the air out of her When she doubled over the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword and for one hideous instant she was certain he meant to open her throat As he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs she thought her legs might break from the force of the blow Sansa screamed Tears welled in her eyes It will be over soon She soon lost count of the blows

Enough she heard the Hound rasp

No it isn’t the king replied Boros make her naked

Boros shoved a meaty hand down the front of Sansa’s bodice and gave a hard yank The silk came tearing away baring her to the waist Sansa covered her breasts with her hands She could hear sniggers far off and cruel Beat her bloody Joffrey said we’ll see how her brother fancies—

What is the meaning of this

The Imp’s voice cracked like a whip and suddenly Sansa was free She stumbled to her knees arms crossed over her chest her breath ragged Is this your notion of chivalry Ser Boros Tyrion Lannister demanded angrily His pet sellsword stood with him and one of his wildlings the one with the burned eye What sort of knight beats helpless maids

The sort who serves his king Imp Ser Boros raised his sword and Ser Meryn stepped up beside him his blade scraping clear of its scabbard

Careful with those warned the dwarf’s sellsword You don’t want to get blood all over those pretty white cloaks

Someone give the girl something to cover herself with the Imp said Sandor Clegane unfastened his cloak and tossed it at her Sansa clutched it against her chest fists bunched hard in the white wool The coarse weave was scratchy against her skin but no velvet had ever felt so fine

This girl’s to be your queen the Imp told Joffrey Have you no regard for her honor

I’m punishing her

For what crime She did not fight her brother’s battle

She has the blood of a wolf

And you have the wits of a goose

You can’t talk to me that way The king can do as he likes

Aerys Targaryen did as he liked Has your mother ever told you what happened to him

Ser Boros Blount harrumphed No man threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard

Tyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow I am not threatening the king ser I am educating my nephew Bronn Timett the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth kill him The dwarf smiled Now that was a threat ser See the difference

Ser Boros turned a dark shade of red The queen will hear of this

No doubt she will And why wait Joffrey shall we send for your mother

The king flushed

Nothing to say Your Grace his uncle went on Good Learn to use your ears more and your mouth less or your reign will be shorter than I am Wanton brutality is no way to win your people’s love    or your queen’s

Fear is better than love Mother says Joffrey pointed at Sansa She fears me

The Imp sighed Yes I see A pity Stannis and Renly aren’t twelve-year-old girls as well Bronn Timett bring her

Sansa moved as if in a dream She thought the Imp’s men would take her back to her bedchamber in Maegor’s Holdfast but instead they conducted her to the Tower of the Hand She had not set foot inside that place since the day her father fell from grace and it made her feel faint to climb those steps again

Some serving girls took charge of her mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair As they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head all she could see were the faces from the bailey Knights are sworn to defend the weak protect women and fight for the right but none of them did a thing Only Ser Dontos had tried to help and he was no longer a knight no more than the Imp was nor the Hound    the Hound hated knights    I hate them too Sansa thought They are no true knights not one of them

After she was clean plump ginger-headed Maester Frenken came to see her He bid her lie facedown on the mattress while he spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered the backs of her legs Afterward he mixed her a draught of dreamwine with some honey so it might go down easier Sleep a bit child When you wake all this will seem a bad dream

No it won’t you stupid man Sansa thought but she drank the dreamwine anyway and slept

It was dark when she woke again not quite knowing where she was the room both strange and strangely familiar As she rose a stab of pain went through her legs and brought it all back Tears filled her eyes Someone had laid out a robe for her beside the bed Sansa slipped it on and opened the door Outside stood a hard-faced woman with leathery brown skin three necklaces looped about her scrawny neck One was gold and one was silver and one was made of human ears Where does she think she’s going the woman asked leaning on a tall spear

The godswood She had to find Ser Dontos beg him to take her home now before it was too late

The halfman said you’re not to leave the woman said Pray here the gods will hear

Meekly Sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside She realized suddenly why this place seemed so familiar They’ve put me in Arya’s old bedchamber from when Father was the Hand of the King All her things are gone and the furnishings have been moved around but it’s the same   

A short time later a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives with a flagon of cold water Take it away Sansa commanded but the girl left the food on a table She was thirsty she realized Every step sent knives through her thighs but she made herself cross the room She drank two cups of water and was nibbling on an olive when the knock came

Anxiously she turned toward the door smoothed down the folds of her robe Yes

The door opened and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside My lady I trust I am not disturbing you

Am I your prisoner

My guest He was wearing his chain of office a necklace of linked golden hands I thought we might talk
