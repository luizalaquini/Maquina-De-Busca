to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth 2213 And
behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating
flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall
die

2214 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts Surely
this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the Lord
GOD of hosts

2215 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts Go get thee unto this
treasurer even unto Shebna which is over the house and say 2216
What hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed
thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on
high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock  2217
Behold the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and
will surely cover thee

2218 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy
glory shall be the shame of thy lords house

2219 And I will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall
he pull thee down

2220 And it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my
servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah 2221 And I will clothe him with
thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and I will commit thy
government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah

2222 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder
so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none
shall open

2223 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be
for a glorious throne to his fathers house

2224 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers
house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity
from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons

2225 In that day saith the LORD of hosts shall the nail that is
fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and
the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the LORD hath spoken
it

231 The burden of Tyre Howl ye ships of Tarshish for it is laid
waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of
Chittim it is revealed to them

232 Be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of
Zidon that pass over the sea have replenished

233 And by great waters the seed of Sihor the harvest of the river
is her revenue and she is a mart of nations

234 Be thou ashamed O Zidon for the sea hath spoken even the
strength of the sea saying I travail not nor bring forth children
neither do I nourish up young men nor bring up virgins

235 As at the report concerning Egypt so shall they be sorely pained
at the report of Tyre

236 Pass ye over to Tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isle

237 Is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her
own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn

238 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre the crowning city
whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of
the earth  239 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it to stain the
pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of
the earth

2310 Pass through thy land as a river O daughter of Tarshish there
is no more strength

2311 He stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms
the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city to
destroy the strong holds thereof

2312 And he said Thou shalt no more rejoice O thou oppressed
virgin daughter of Zidon arise pass over to Chittim there also
shalt thou have no rest

2313 Behold the land of the Chaldeans this people was not till the
Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up
the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought
it to ruin

2314 Howl ye ships of Tarshish for your strength is laid waste

2315 And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be
forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the
end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot

2316 Take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been
forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be
remembered
