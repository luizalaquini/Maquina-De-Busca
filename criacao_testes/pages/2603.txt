178 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah but Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim 179 And the coast
descended unto the river Kanah southward of the river these cities
of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh the coast of Manasseh
also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were
at the sea 1710 Southward it was Ephraims and northward it was
Manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in Asher
on the north and in Issachar on the east

1711 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns and Ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns even three countries

1712 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
of those cities but the Canaanites would dwell in that land

1713 Yet it came to pass when the children of Israel were waxen
strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute but did not utterly
drive them out

1714 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua saying Why hast
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing I am a
great people forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto  1715
And Joshua answered them If thou be a great people then get thee up
to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the
Perizzites and of the giants if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee

1716 And the children of Joseph said The hill is not enough for us
and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have
chariots of iron both they who are of Bethshean and her towns and
they who are of the valley of Jezreel

1717 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph even to Ephraim and
to Manasseh saying Thou art a great people and hast great power
thou shalt not have one lot only 1718 But the mountain shall be
thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings
of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites though
they have iron chariots and though they be strong

181 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation
there And the land was subdued before them

182 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes
which had not yet received their inheritance

183 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel How long are ye
slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers
hath given you  184 Give out from among you three men for each
tribe and I will send them and they shall rise and go through the
land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they
shall come again to me

185 And they shall divide it into seven parts Judah shall abide in
their coast on the south and the house of Joseph shall abide in their
coasts on the north

186 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring
the description hither to me that I may cast lots for you here before
the LORD our God

187 But the Levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the
LORD is their inheritance and Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of
Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east
which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them

188 And the men arose and went away and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land saying Go and walk through the land and
describe it and come again to me that I may here cast lots for you
before the LORD in Shiloh

189 And the men went and passed through the land and described it by
cities into seven parts in a book and came again to Joshua to the
host at Shiloh

1810 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD and
there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to
their divisions

1811 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
according to their families and the coast of their lot came forth
between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph

1812 And their border on the north side was from Jordan and the
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side and went up
through the mountains westward and the goings out thereof were at the
wilderness of Bethaven

1813 And the border went over from thence toward Luz to the side of
Luz which is Bethel southward and the border descended to
Atarothadar near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether
Bethhoron

1814 And the border was drawn thence and compassed the corner of the
sea southward from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward
and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal which is
Kirjathjearim a city of the children of Judah this was the west
quarter
