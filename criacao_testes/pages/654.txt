Jaime


Jaime was the first to spy the inn The main building hugged the south shore where the river bent its long low wings outstretched along the water as if to embrace travelers sailing downstream The lower story was grey stone the upper whitewashed wood the roof slate He could see stables as well and an arbor heavy with vines No smoke from the chimneys he pointed out as they approached Nor lights in the windows

The inn was still open when last I passed this way said Ser Cleos Frey They brewed a fine ale Perhaps there is still some to be had in the cellars

There may be people Brienne said Hiding Or dead

Frightened of a few corpses wench Jaime said

She glared at him My name is—

—Brienne yes Wouldn’t you like to sleep in a bed for a night Brienne We’d be safer than on the open river and it might be prudent to find what’s happened here

She gave no answer but after a moment she pushed at the tiller to angle the skiff in toward the weathered wooden dock Ser Cleos scrambled to take down the sail When they bumped softly against the pier he climbed out to tie them up Jaime clambered after him made awkward by his chains

At the end of the dock a flaking shingle swung from an iron post painted with the likeness of a king upon his knees his hands pressed together in the gesture of fealty Jaime took one look and laughed aloud We could not have found a better inn

Is this some special place the wench asked suspicious

Ser Cleos answered This is the Inn of the Kneeling Man my lady It stands upon the very spot where the last King in the North knelt before Aegon the Conqueror to offer his submission That’s him on the sign I suppose

Torrhen had brought his power south after the fall of the two kings on the Field of Fire said Jaime but when he saw Aegon’s dragon and the size of his host he chose the path of wisdom and bent his frozen knees He stopped at the sound of a horse’s whinny Horses in the stable One at least And one is all I need to put the wench behind me Let’s see who’s home shall we Without waiting for an answer Jaime went clinking down the dock put a shoulder to the door shoved it open…

…and found himself eye to eye with a loaded crossbow Standing behind it was a chunky boy of fifteen Lion fish or wolf the lad demanded

We were hoping for capon Jaime heard his companions entering behind him The crossbow is a coward’s weapon

It’ll put a bolt through your heart all the same

Perhaps But before you can wind it again my cousin here will spill your entrails on the floor

Don’t be scaring the lad now Ser Cleos said

We mean no harm the wench said And we have coin to pay for food and drink She dug a silver piece from her pouch

The boy looked suspiciously at the coin and then at Jaime’s manacles Why’s this one in irons

Killed some crossbowmen said Jaime Do you have ale

Yes The boy lowered the crossbow an inch Undo your swordbelts and let them fall and might be we’ll feed you He edged around to peer through the thick diamond-shaped windowpanes and see if any more of them were outside That’s a Tully sail

We come from Riverrun Brienne undid the clasp on her belt and let it clatter to the floor Ser Cleos followed suit

A sallow man with a pocked doughy face stepped through the cellar door holding a butcher’s heavy cleaver Three are you We got horsemeat enough for three The horse was old and tough but the meat’s still fresh

Is there bread asked Brienne

Hardbread and stale oatcakes
