no evil

4418 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven
and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things
and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine

4419 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured
out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her
and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men  4420 Then
Jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and
to all the people which had given him that answer saying 4421 The
incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the
people of the land did not the LORD remember them and came it not
into his mind  4422 So that the LORD could no longer bear because
of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye
have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an
astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day

4423 Because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned
against the LORD and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD nor
walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies
therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day

4424 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the
women Hear the word of the LORD all Judah that are in the land of
Egypt 4425 Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel saying
Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled
with your hand saying We will surely perform our vows that we have
vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink
offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely
perform your vows

4426 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD all Judah that dwell in
the land of Egypt Behold I have sworn by my great name saith the
LORD that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of
Judah in all the land of Egypt saying The Lord GOD liveth

4427 Behold I will watch over them for evil and not for good and
all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed
by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them

4428 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
land of Egypt into the land of Judah and all the remnant of Judah
that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall know
whose words shall stand mine or theirs

4429 And this shall be a sign unto you saith the LORD that I will
punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely
stand against you for evil 4430 Thus saith the LORD Behold I will
give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and
into the hand of them that seek his life as I gave Zedekiah king of
Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon his enemy and
that sought his life

451 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of
Neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of
Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah saying 452 Thus saith the LORD the God of Israel unto thee
O Baruch 453 Thou didst say Woe is me now for the LORD hath added
grief to my sorrow I fainted in my sighing and I find no rest

454 Thus shalt thou say unto him The LORD saith thus Behold that
which I have built will I break down and that which I have planted I
will pluck up even this whole land

455 And seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for
behold I will bring evil upon all flesh saith the LORD but thy life
will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest

461 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against
the Gentiles 462 Against Egypt against the army of Pharaohnecho
king of Egypt which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish which
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah king of Judah

463 Order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle

464 Harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with
your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines

465 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back and
their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not
back for fear was round about saith the LORD

466 Let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they
shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates

467 Who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as
the rivers  468 Egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are
moved like the rivers and he saith I will go up and will cover the
earth I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof

469 Come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men
come forth the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield
and the Lydians that handle and bend the bow

4610 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts a day of
vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword
shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood
