I wanted to be a knight For this at least Dontos lurched back to his feet and took her arm Come Be quiet now no questions

They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper They were inside a long gallery Along the walls stood empty suits of armor dark and dusty their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs As they hurried past the taper’s light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist The hollow knights are turning into dragons she thought

One more stair took them to an oaken door banded with iron Be strong now my Jonquil you are almost there When Dontos lifted the bar and pulled open the door Sansa felt a cold breeze on her face She passed through twelve feet of wall and then she was outside the castle standing at the top of the cliff Below was the river above the sky and one was as black as the other

We must climb down Ser Dontos said At the bottom a man is waiting to row us out to the ship

I’ll fall Bran had fallen and he had loved to climb

No you won’t There’s a sort of ladder a secret ladder carved into the stone Here you can feel it my lady He got down on his knees with her and made her lean over the edge of the cliff groping with her fingers until she found the handhold cut into the face of the bluff Almost as good as rungs

Even so it was a long way down I can’t

You must

Isn’t there another way

This is the way It won’t be so hard for a strong young girl like you Hold on tight and never look down and you’ll be at the bottom in no time at all His eyes were shiny Your poor Florian is fat and old and drunk I’m the one should be afraid I used to fall off my horse don’t you remember That was how we began I was drunk and fell off my horse and Joffrey wanted my fool head but you saved me You saved me sweetling

He’s weeping she realized And now you have saved me

Only if you go If not I have killed us both

It was him she thought He killed Joffrey She had to go for him as much as for herself You go first ser If he did fall she did not want him falling down on her head and knocking both of them off the cliff

As you wish my lady He gave her a sloppy kiss and swung his legs clumsily over the precipice kicking about until he found a foothold Let me get down a bit and come after You will come now You must swear it

I’ll come she promised

Ser Dontos disappeared She could hear him huffing and puffing as he began the descent Sansa listened to the tolling of the bell counting each ring At ten gingerly she eased herself over the edge of the cliff poking with her toes until they found a place to rest The castle walls loomed large above her and for a moment she wanted nothing so much as to pull herself up and run back to her warm rooms in the Kitchen Keep Be brave she told herself Be brave like a lady in a song

Sansa dared not look down She kept her eyes on the face of the cliff making certain of each step before reaching for the next The stone was rough and cold Sometimes she could feel her fingers slipping and the handholds were not as evenly spaced as she would have liked The bells would not stop ringing Before she was halfway down her arms were trembling and she knew that she was going to fall One more step she told herself one more step She had to keep moving If she stopped she would never start again and dawn would find her still clinging to the cliff frozen in fear One more step and one more step

The ground took her by surprise She stumbled and fell her heart pounding When she rolled onto her back and stared up at from where she had come her head swam dizzily and her fingers clawed at the dirt I did it I did it I didn’t fall I made the climb and now I’m going home

Ser Dontos pulled her back onto her feet This way Quiet now quiet quiet He stayed close to the shadows that lay black and thick beneath the cliffs Thankfully they did not have to go far Fifty yards downriver a man sat in a small skiff half-hidden by the remains of a great galley that had gone aground there and burned Dontos limped up to him puffing Oswell

No names the man said In the boat He sat hunched over his oars an old man tall and gangling with long white hair and a great hooked nose with eyes shaded by a cowl Get in be quick about it he muttered We need to be away

When both of them were safe aboard the cowled man slid the blades into the water and put his back into the oars rowing them out toward the channel Behind them the bells were still tolling the boy king’s death They had the dark river all to themselves

With slow steady rhythmic strokes they threaded their way downstream sliding above the sunken galleys past broken masts burned hulls and torn sails The oarlocks had been muffled so they moved almost soundlessly A mist was rising over the water Sansa saw the embattled ramparts of one of the Imp’s winch towers looming above but the great chain had been lowered and they rowed unimpeded past the spot where a thousand men had burned The shore fell away the fog grew thicker the sound of the bells began to fade Finally even the lights were gone lost somewhere behind them They were out in Blackwater Bay and the world shrank to dark water blowing mist and their silent companion stooped over the oars How far must we go she asked

No talk The oarsman was old but stronger than he looked and his voice was fierce There was something oddly familiar about his face though Sansa could not say what it was

Not far Ser Dontos took her hand in his own and rubbed it gently Your friend is near waiting for you

No talk the oarsman growled again Sound carries over water Ser Fool

Abashed Sansa bit her lip and huddled down in silence The rest was rowing rowing rowing

The eastern sky was vague with the first hint of dawn when Sansa finally saw a ghostly shape in the darkness ahead a trading galley her sails furled moving slowly on a single bank of oars As they drew closer she saw the ship’s figurehead a merman with a golden crown blowing on a great seashell horn She heard a voice cry out and the galley swung slowly about

As they came alongside the galley dropped a rope ladder over the rail The rower shipped the oars and helped Sansa to her feet Up now Go on girl I got you Sansa thanked him for his kindness but received no answer but a grunt It was much easier going up the rope ladder than it had been coming down the cliff The oarsman Oswell followed close behind her while Ser Dontos remained in the boat

Two sailors were waiting by the rail to help her onto the deck Sansa was trembling She’s cold she heard someone say He took off his cloak and put it around her shoulders There is that better my lady Rest easy the worst is past and done

She knew the voice But he’s in the Vale she thought Ser Lothor Brune stood beside him with a torch

Lord Petyr Dontos called from the boat I must needs row back before they think to look for me

Petyr Baelish put a hand on the rail But first you’ll want your payment Ten thousand dragons was it

Ten thousand Dontos rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand As you promised my lord

Ser Lothor the reward

Lothor Brune dipped his torch Three men stepped to the gunwale raised crossbows fired One bolt took Dontos in the chest as he looked up punching through the left crown on his surcoat The others ripped into throat and belly It happened so quickly neither Dontos nor Sansa had time to cry out When it was done Lothor Brune tossed the torch down on top of the corpse The little boat was blazing fiercely as the galley moved away

You killed him Clutching the rail Sansa turned away and retched Had she escaped the Lannisters to tumble into worse

My lady Littlefinger murmured your grief is wasted on such a man as that He was a sot and no man’s friend

But he saved me

He sold you for a promise of ten thousand dragons Your disappearance will make them suspect you in Joffrey’s death The gold cloaks will hunt and the eunuch will jingle his purse Dontos    well you heard him He sold you for gold and when he’d drunk it up he would have sold you again A bag of dragons buys a man’s silence for a while but a well-placed quarrel buys it forever He smiled sadly All he did he did at my behest I dared not befriend you openly When I heard how you saved his life at Joff’s tourney I knew he would be the perfect catspaw

Sansa felt sick He said he was my Florian

Do you perchance recall what I said to you that day your father sat the Iron Throne

The moment came back to her vividly You told me that life was not a song That I would learn that one day to my sorrow She felt tears in her eyes but whether she wept for Ser Dontos Hollard for Joff for Tyrion or for herself Sansa could not say Is it all lies forever and ever everyone and everything

Almost everyone Save you and I of course He smiled Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

The note    it was you

It had to be the godswood No other place in the Red Keep is safe from the eunuch’s little birds    or little rats as I call them There are trees in the godswood instead of walls Sky above instead of ceiling Roots and dirt and rock in place of floor The rats have no place to scurry Rats need to hide lest men skewer them with swords Lord Petyr took her arm Let me show you to your cabin You have had a long and trying day I know You must be weary

Already the little boat was no more than a swirl of smoke and fire behind them almost lost in the immensity of the dawn sea There was no going back her only road was forward Very weary she admitted

As he led her below he said Tell me of the feast The queen took such pains The singers the jugglers the dancing bear    did your little lord husband enjoy my jousting dwarfs

Yours

I had to send to Braavos for them and hide them away in a brothel until the wedding The expense was exceeded only by the bother It is surprisingly difficult to hide a dwarf and Joffrey    you can lead a king to water but with Joff one had to splash it about before he realized he could drink it When I told him about my little surprise His Grace said ‘Why would I want some ugly dwarfs at my feast I hate dwarfs’ I had to take him by the shoulder and whisper ‘Not as much as your uncle will’

The deck rocked beneath her feet and Sansa felt as if the world itself had grown unsteady They think Tyrion poisoned Joffrey Ser Dontos said they seized him
