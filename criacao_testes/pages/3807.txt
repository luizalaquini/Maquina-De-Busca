The last time Tyrion had seen the man a sharp word had been enough to set him sweating but it seemed the singer had found some courage somewhere Most like in that flagon Or perhaps Tyrion himself was to blame for this new boldness I threatened him but nothing ever came of the threat so now he believes me toothless He sighed I am told you are a very gifted singer

You are most kind to say so my lord

Tyrion gave him a smile I think it is time you brought your music to the Free Cities They are great lovers of song in Braavos and Pentos and Lys and generous with those who please them He took a sip of wine It was foul stuff but strong A tour of all nine cities would be best You wouldn’t want to deny anyone the joy of hearing you sing A year in each should suffice He reached inside his cloak to where the gold was hidden With the port closed you will need to go to Duskendale to take ship but my man Bronn will find a horse for you and I would be honored if you would let me pay your passage…

But my lord the man objected you have never heard me sing Pray listen a moment His fingers moved deftly over the strings of the woodharp and soft music filled the cellar Symon began to sing





He rode through the streets of the city

down from his hill on high

O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles

he rode to a woman’s sigh

For she was his secret treasure

she was his shame and his bliss

And a chain and a keep are nothing

compared to a woman’s kiss





There’s more the man said as he broke off Oh a good deal more The refrain is especially nice I think For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm…

Enough Tyrion slid his fingers from his cloak empty That’s not a song I would care to hear again Ever

No Symon Silver Tongue put his harp aside and took a sip of wine A pity Still each man has his song as my old master used to say when he was teaching me to play Others might like my tune better The queen perhaps Or your lord father

Tyrion rubbed the scar over his nose and said My father has no time for singers and my sister is not as generous as one might think A wise man could earn more from silence than from song He could not put it much plainer than that

Symon seemed to take his meaning quick enough You will find my price modest my lord

That’s good to know This would not be a matter of thirty golden dragons Tyrion feared Tell me

At King Joffrey’s wedding feast the man said there is to be a tournament of singers

And jugglers and jesters and dancing bears

Only one dancing bear my lord said Symon who had plainly attended Cersei’s arrangements with far more interest than Tyrion had but seven singers Galyeon of Cuy Bethany Fair-fingers Aemon Costayne Alaric of Eysen Hamish the Harper Collio Quaynis and Orland of Oldtown will compete for a gilded lute with silver strings… yet unaccountably no invitation has been forthcoming for one who is master of them all

Let me guess Symon Silver Tongue

Symon smiled modestly I am prepared to prove the truth of my boast before king and court Hamish is old and oft forgets what he is singing And Collio with that absurd Tyroshi accent if you understand one word in three count yourself fortunate

My sweet sister has arranged the feast Even if I could secure you this invitation it might look queer Seven kingdoms seven vows seven challenges seventy-seven dishes… but eight singers What would the High Septon think

You did not strike me as a pious man my lord

Piety is not the point Certain forms must be observed

Symon took a sip of wine Still… a singer’s life is not without peril We ply our trade in alehouses and wine sinks before unruly drunkards If one of your sister’s seven should suffer some mishap I hope you might consider me to fill his place He smiled slyly inordinately pleased with himself

Six singers would be as unfortunate as eight to be sure I will inquire after the health of Cersei’s seven If any of them should be indisposed my man Bronn will find you

Very good my lord Symon might have left it at that but flushed with triumph he added I shall sing the night of King Joffrey’s wedding Should it happen that I am called to court why I will want to offer the king my very best compositions songs I have sung a thousand times that are certain to please If I should find myself singing in some dreary winesink though… well that would be an apt occasion to try my new song For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm

That will not be necessary said Tyrion You have my word as a Lannister Bronn will call upon you soon

Very good my lord The balding kettle-bellied singer took up his woodharp again

Bronn was waiting with the horses at the mouth of the alley He helped Tyrion into his saddle When do I take the man to Duskendale

You don’t Tyrion turned his horse Give him three days then inform him that Hamish the Harper has broken his arm Tell him that his clothes will never serve for court so he must be fitted for new garb at once He’ll come with you quick enough He grimaced You may want his tongue I understand it’s made of silver The rest of him should never be found

Bronn grinned There’s a pot shop I know in Flea Bottom makes a savory bowl of brown All kinds of meat in it I hear

Make certain I never eat there Tyrion spurred to a trot He wanted a bath and the hotter the better

Even that modest pleasure was denied him however no sooner had he returned to his chambers than Podrick Payne informed him that he had been summoned to the Tower of the Hand His lordship wants to see you The Hand Lord Tywin

I recall who the Hand is Pod Tyrion said I lost my nose not my wits

Bronn laughed Don’t bite the boy’s head off now

Why not He never uses it Tyrion wondered what he’d done now Or more like what I have failed to do A summons from Lord Tywin always had teeth his father never sent for him just to share a meal or a cup of wine that was for certain

As he entered his lord father’s solar a few moments later he heard a voice saying …cherrywood for the scabbards bound in red leather and ornamented with a row of lion’s-head studs in pure gold Perhaps with garnets for the eyes…

Rubies Lord Tywin said Garnets lack the fire

Tyrion cleared his throat My lord You sent for me

His father glanced up I did Come have a look at this A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand A wedding gift for Joffrey he told Tyrion The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold With this fool’s jabber of Stannis and his magic sword it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well A king should bear a kingly weapon

That’s much too much sword for Joff Tyrion said

He will grow into it Here feel the weight of it He offered the weapon hilt first

The sword was much lighter than he had expected As he turned it in his hand he saw why Only one metal could be beaten so thin and still have strength enough to fight with and there was no mistaking those ripples the mark of steel that has been folded back on itself many thousands of times Valyrian steel
