THEON

She was undeniably a beauty But your first is always beautiful Theon Greyjoy thought

Now there’s a pretty grin a woman’s voice said behind him The lordling likes the look of her does he

Theon turned to give her an appraising glance He liked what he saw Ironborn he knew at a glance lean and longlegged with black hair cut short wind-chafed skin strong sure hands a dirk at her belt Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face but her smile made up for it He judged her a few years older than he was but no more than five-and-twenty She moved as if she were used to a deck beneath her feet

Yes she’s a sweet sight he told her though not half so sweet as you

Oho She grinned I’d best be careful This lordling has a honeyed tongue

Taste it and see

Is it that way then she said eyeing him boldly There were women on the Iron Islands—not many but a few—who crewed the longships along with their men and it was said that salt and sea changed them gave them a man’s appetites Have you been that long at sea lordling Or were there no women where you came from

Women enough but none like you

And how would you know what I’m like

My eyes can see your face My ears can hear your laughter And my cock’s gone hard as a mast for you

The woman stepped close and pressed a hand to the front of his breeches Well you’re no liar she said giving him a squeeze through the cloth How bad does it hurt

Fiercely

Poor lordling She released him and stepped back As it happens I’m a woman wed and new with child

The gods are good Theon said No chance I’d give you a bastard that way

Even so my man wouldn’t thank you

No but you might

And why would that be I’ve had lords before They’re made the same as other men

Have you ever had a prince he asked her When you’re wrinkled and grey and your teats hang past your belly you can tell your children’s children that once you loved a king

Oh is it love we’re talking now And here I thought it was just cocks and cunts

Is it love you fancy He’d decided that he liked this wench whoever she was her sharp wit was a welcome respite from the damp gloom of Pyke Shall I name my longship after you and play you the high harp and keep you in a tower room in my castle with only jewels to wear like a princess in a song

You ought to name your ship after me she said ignoring all the rest It was me who built her

Sigrin built her My lord father’s shipwright
