274 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
family because he hath no son Give unto us therefore a possession
among the brethren of our father

275 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD

276 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 277 The daughters of
Zelophehad speak right thou shalt surely give them a possession of an
inheritance among their fathers brethren and thou shalt cause the
inheritance of their father to pass unto them

278 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel saying If a
man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass
unto his daughter

279 And if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance
unto his brethren

2710 And if he have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance
unto his fathers brethren

2711 And if his father have no brethren then ye shall give his
inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family and he
shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of Israel a
statute of judgment as the LORD commanded Moses

2712 And the LORD said unto Moses Get thee up into this mount
Abarim and see the land which I have given unto the children of
Israel

2713 And when thou hast seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy
people as Aaron thy brother was gathered

2714 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin in
the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before
their eyes that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness
of Zin

2715 And Moses spake unto the LORD saying 2716 Let the LORD the
God of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation
2717 Which may go out before them and which may go in before them
and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the
congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd

2718 And the LORD said unto Moses Take thee Joshua the son of Nun a
man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him 2719 And set
him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and
give him a charge in their sight

2720 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him that all the
congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient

2721 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest who shall ask
counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD at his
word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in both he
and all the children of Israel with him even all the congregation

2722 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him and he took Joshua and
set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation
2723 And he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the
LORD commanded by the hand of Moses

281 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 282 Command the children
of Israel and say unto them My offering and my bread for my
sacrifices made by fire for a sweet savour unto me shall ye observe
to offer unto me in their due season

283 And thou shalt say unto them This is the offering made by fire
which ye shall offer unto the LORD two lambs of the first year
without spot day by day for a continual burnt offering

284 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning and the other lamb
shalt thou offer at even 285 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour
for a meat offering mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten
oil

286 It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in mount
Sinai for a sweet savour a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD

287 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin
for the one lamb in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine
to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering

288 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even as the meat offering
of the morning and as the drink offering thereof thou shalt offer
it a sacrifice made by fire of a sweet savour unto the LORD

289 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot
and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering mingled with oil
and the drink offering thereof 2810 This is the burnt offering of
every sabbath beside the continual burnt offering and his drink
offering

2811 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
offering unto the LORD two young bullocks and one ram seven lambs
of the first year without spot 2812 And three tenth deals of flour
for a meat offering mingled with oil for one bullock and two tenth
deals of flour for a meat offering mingled with oil for one ram
2813 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering unto one lamb for a burnt offering of a sweet savour a
