2524 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there
were twins in her womb

2525 And the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and
they called his name Esau

2526 And after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on
Esaus heel and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was threescore
years old when she bare them

2527 And the boys grew and Esau was a cunning hunter a man of the
field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents

2528 And Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but
Rebekah loved Jacob

2529 And Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from the field and he was
faint 2530 And Esau said to Jacob Feed me I pray thee with that
same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom

2531 And Jacob said Sell me this day thy birthright

2532 And Esau said Behold I am at the point to die and what profit
shall this birthright do to me  2533 And Jacob said Swear to me
this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto
Jacob

2534 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did
eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his
birthright

261 And there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that
was in the days of Abraham And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar

262 And the LORD appeared unto him and said Go not down into Egypt
dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of 263 Sojourn in this
land and I will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and
unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the
oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father 264 And I will make thy
seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed
all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed 265 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept
my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws

266 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar 267 And the men of the place asked him
of his wife and he said She is my sister for he feared to say She
is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for
Rebekah because she was fair to look upon

268 And it came to pass when he had been there a long time that
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window and saw
and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife

269 And Abimelech called Isaac and said Behold of a surety she is
thy wife and how saidst thou She is my sister And Isaac said unto
him Because I said Lest I die for her

2610 And Abimelech said What is this thou hast done unto us one of
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest
have brought guiltiness upon us

2611 And Abimelech charged all his people saying He that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely be put to death

2612 Then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an
hundredfold and the LORD blessed him

2613 And the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he
became very great 2614 For he had possession of flocks and
possession of herds and great store of servants and the Philistines
envied him

2615 For all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the
days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped them and
filled them with earth

2616 And Abimelech said unto Isaac Go from us for thou art much
mightier than we

2617 And Isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of
Gerar and dwelt there

2618 And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged
in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped
them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the
names by which his father had called them

2619 And Isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a
well of springing water

2620 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaacs herdmen
saying The water is ours and he called the name of the well Esek
because they strove with him

2621 And they digged another well and strove for that also and he
called the name of it Sitnah

2622 And he removed from thence and digged another well and for
that they strove not and he called the name of it Rehoboth and he
