2231 As for God his way is perfect the word of the LORD is tried
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him

2232 For who is God save the LORD and who is a rock save our God
2233 God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect

2234 He maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high
places

2235 He teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms

2236 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy
gentleness hath made me great

2237 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not
slip

2238 I have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not
again until I had consumed them

2239 And I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not
arise yea they are fallen under my feet

2240 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose
up against me hast thou subdued under me

2241 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that I might
destroy them that hate me

2242 They looked but there was none to save even unto the LORD but
he answered them not

2243 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth I did
stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad

2244 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which I knew not
shall serve me

2245 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear
they shall be obedient unto me

2246 Strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their
close places

2247 The LORD liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the God
of the rock of my salvation

2248 It is God that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people
under me

2249 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast
lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast
delivered me from the violent man

2250 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee O LORD among the
heathen and I will sing praises unto thy name

2251 He is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to
his anointed unto David and to his seed for evermore

231 Now these be the last words of David David the son of Jesse
said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the God
of Jacob and the sweet psalmist of Israel said 232 The Spirit of
the LORD spake by me and his word was in my tongue

233 The God of Israel said the Rock of Israel spake to me He that
ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of God

234 And he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth
even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of
the earth by clear shining after rain

235 Although my house be not so with God yet he hath made with me an
everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all
my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow

236 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
away because they cannot be taken with hands 237 But the man that
shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear
and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place

238 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had The
Tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same
was Adino the Eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom
he slew at one time

239 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite one of the
three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that
were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were
gone away 2310 He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand
was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the LORD wrought a
great victory that day and the people returned after him only to
spoil

2311 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite And the
Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of
ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the Philistines
