he saw Boldwoods action Though there is no name
I think it is for your shepherd
Boldwood looked then at the address --
To the New Shepherd
Weatherbury Farm
Near Casterbridge
Oh -- what a mistake  -- it is not mine Nor is it
for my shepherd It is for Miss Everdenes You had
better take it on to him -- Gabriel Oak -- and say I opencd
it in mistake
At this moment on the ridge up against the blazing
sky a figure was visible like the black snuff in the
midst of a candle-flame Then it moved and began to
bustle about vigorously from place to place carrying
square skeleton masses which were riddled by the same
rays A small figure on all fours followed behind The
tall form was that of Gabriel Oak  the small one that
of George  the articles in course of transit were hurdles
Wait said Boldwood  Thats the man on the hill
Ill take the letter to him myself
To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to
I another man It was an opportunity Exhibiting a
face pregnant with intention he entered the snowy field
Gabriel at that minute descended the hill towards
the right The glow stretched down in this direction
now and touched the distant roof of Warrens Malthouse
whither the shepherd was apparently bent   Boldwood
followed at a distance

THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did
not penetrate to its interior which was as usual lighted
by a rival glow of similar hue radiating from the hearth
The maltster after having lain down in his clothes
for a few hours was now sitting beside a three-leggcd
table breakfasting of bread and bacon This was
eaten on the plateless system which is performed by
placing a slice of bread upon the table the meat flat
upon the bread a mustard plaster upon the meat and
a pinch of salt upon the whole then cutting them
vertically downwards with a large pocket-knife till wood
is reached when the severed lamp is impaled on the
knife elevated and sent the proper way of food
The maltsters lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly
diminish his powers as a mill He had been without
them for so many years that toothlessness was felt less
to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition Indeed
he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic curve
approaches a stmight line -- less directly as he got nearer
till it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all
In the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting and a
boiling pipkin of charred bread callcd coffee for the
benefit of whomsoever should call for Warrens was a
sort of clubhouse used as an alternative to the in
I say says I we get a fine day and then down
comes a snapper at night was a remark now suddenly
heard spreading into the malthouse from the door which
had been opened the previous moment The form of
Henery Fray advanced to the fire stamping the snow
from his boots when about half-way there The speech
and entry had not seemed to be at all an abrupt begin+

omitted in this neighbourhood both from word and

deed and the maltster having the same latitude allowed
him did not hurry to reply He picked up a fragment
of cheese by pecking upon it with his knife as a butcher
picks up skewers
Henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat
buttoned over his smock-frock the white skirts of the
latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below
the coat-tails which when you got used to the style of
dress looked natural enough and even ornamental -- it
certainly was comfortable
Matthew Moon Joseph Poorgrass and other carters
and waggoners followed at his heels with great lanterns
dangling from their hands which showed that they had
just come from the cart-horse stables where they had
been busily engaged since four oclock that morning
And how is she getting on without a baily the
maltster inquired
Henery shook his head and smiled one of the bitter
smiles dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a
corrugated heap in the centre
 Shell rue it -- surely surely   he said  Benjy
Pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily --
as big a betrayer as Joey Iscariot himself But to think
she can carr on alone  He allowed his head to swing
laterally three or four times in silence  Never in all my
creeping up -- never 
This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some
gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought
alone during the shake of the head Henery meanwhile
retained several marks of despair upon his face to
imply that they would be required for use again directly
he should go on speaking
All will be ruined and ourselves too or theres no
meat in gentlemens houses said Mark Clark
A headstrong maid thats what she is -- and wont
listen to no advice at all Pride and vanity have ruined
