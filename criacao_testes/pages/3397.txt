the south three gates and on the west three gates

2114 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb

2115 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof

2116 And the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the
breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand
furlongs

The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal

2117 And he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four
cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel

2118 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city
was pure gold like unto clear glass

2119 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones The first foundation was jasper the
second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald
2120 The fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh
chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a
chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst

2121 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was
of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were
transparent glass

2122 And I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it

2123 And the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to
shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is the
light thereof

2124 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into
it

2125 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there
shall be no night there

2126 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
it

2127 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but
they which are written in the Lambs book of life

221 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal
proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb

222 In the midst of the street of it and on either side of the
river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits
and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations

223 And there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and of
the Lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 224 And
they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads

225 And there shall be no night there and they need no candle
neither light of the sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they
shall reign for ever and ever

226 And he said unto me These sayings are faithful and true and the
Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be done

227 Behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
the prophecy of this book

228 And I John saw these things and heard them And when I had heard
and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
shewed me these things

229 Then saith he unto me See thou do it not for I am thy
fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which
keep the sayings of this book worship God

2210 And he saith unto me Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book for the time is at hand

2211 He that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is
filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be
righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still

2212 And behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give
every man according as his work shall be

2213 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and
the last

2214 Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have
right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the
city
