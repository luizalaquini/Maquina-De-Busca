him before the LORD for his issue

1516 And if any mans seed of copulation go out from him then he
shall wash all his flesh in water and be unclean until the even

1517 And every garment and every skin whereon is the seed of
copulation shall be washed with water and be unclean until the even

1518 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation
they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the
even

1519 And if a woman have an issue and her issue in her flesh be
blood she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her
shall be unclean until the even

1520 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
unclean every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean

1521 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe
himself in water and be unclean until the even

1522 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the
even

1523 And if it be on her bed or on any thing whereon she sitteth
when he toucheth it he shall be unclean until the even

1524 And if any man lie with her at all and her flowers be upon him
he shall be unclean seven days and all the bed whereon he lieth shall
be unclean

1525 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
time of her separation or if it run beyond the time of her
separation all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as
the days of her separation she shall be unclean

1526 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
unto her as the bed of her separation and whatsoever she sitteth upon
shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her separation

1527 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean and shall
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the
even

1528 But if she be cleansed of her issue then she shall number to
herself seven days and after that she shall be clean

1529 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles or
two young pigeons and bring them unto the priest to the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation

1530 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness

1531 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
uncleanness that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile
my tabernacle that is among them

1532 This is the law of him that hath an issue and of him whose seed
goeth from him and is defiled therewith 1533 And of her that is
sick of her flowers and of him that hath an issue of the man and of
the woman and of him that lieth with her that is unclean

161 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
Aaron when they offered before the LORD and died 162 And the LORD
said unto Moses Speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all
times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat which
is upon the ark that he die not for I will appear in the cloud upon
the mercy seat

163 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock
for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering

164 He shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle and
with the linen mitre shall he be attired these are holy garments
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water and so put them on

165 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel
two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt
offering

166 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is
for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house

167 And he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation

168 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats one lot for the
LORD and the other lot for the scapegoat

169 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORDs lot fell
and offer him for a sin offering

1610 But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall
be presented alive before the LORD to make an atonement with him and
to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness
