The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians


11 Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ 12 Grace
unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

13 We are bound to thank God always for you brethren as it is meet
because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other aboundeth 14 So that we ourselves
glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure 15 Which is a
manifest token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer 16
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you 17 And to you who are troubled rest with us
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty
angels 18 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ 19 Who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord and from the glory of his power 110 When he shall come to
be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe
because our testimony among you was believed in that day

111 Wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count
you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness and the work of faith with power 112 That the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to
the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ

21 Now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and by our gathering together unto him 22 That ye be not
soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word
nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand

23 Let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come
except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be
revealed the son of perdition 24 Who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God

25 Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these
things  26 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
revealed in his time

27 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now
letteth will let until he be taken out of the way

28 And then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming 29 Even him whose coming is after the
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders 210 And
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish
because they received not the love of the truth that they might be
