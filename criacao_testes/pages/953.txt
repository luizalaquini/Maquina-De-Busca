Well most of me Jaime was gaunt his hair hacked short I left a hand at Harrenhal Bringing the Brave Companions across the narrow sea was not one of Father’s better notions He lifted his arm and Tyrion saw the stump

A bark of hysterical laughter burst from his lips Oh gods he said Jaime I am so sorry but… gods be good look at the two of us Handless and Noseless the Lannister boys

There were days when my hand smelled so bad I wished I was noseless Jaime lowered the torch so the light bathed his brother’s face An impressive scar

Tyrion turned away from the glare They made me fight a battle without my big brother to protect me

I heard tell you almost burned the city down

A filthy lie I only burned the river Abruptly Tyrion remembered where he was and why Are you here to kill me

Now that’s ungrateful Perhaps I should leave you here to rot if you’re going to be so discourteous

Rotting is not the fate Cersei has in mind for me

Well no if truth be told You’re to be beheaded on the morrow out on the old tourney grounds

Tyrion laughed again Will there be food You’ll have to help me with my last words my wits have been running about like a rat in a root cellar

You won’t need last words I’m rescuing you Jaime’s voice was strangely solemn

Who said I required rescue

You know I’d almost forgotten what an annoying little man you are Now that you’ve reminded me I do believe I’ll let Cersei cut your head off after all

Oh no you won’t He waddled out of the cell Is it day or night up above I’ve lost all sense of time

Three hours past midnight The city sleeps Jaime slid the torch back into its sconce on the wall between the cells

The corridor was so poorly lit that Tyrion almost stumbled on the turnkey sprawled across the cold stone floor He prodded him with a toe Is he dead

Asleep The other three as well The eunuch dosed their wine with sweetsleep but not enough to kill them Or so he swears He is waiting back at the stair dressed up in a septon’s robe You’re going down into the sewers and from there to the river A galley is waiting in the bay Varys has agents in the Free Cities who will see that you do not lack for funds… but try not to be conspicuous Cersei will send men after you I have no doubt You might do well to take another name

Another name Oh certainly And when the Faceless Men come to kill me I’ll say ‘No you have the wrong man I’m a different dwarf with a hideous facial scar’ Both Lannisters laughed at the absurdity of it all Then Jaime went to one knee and kissed him quickly once on each cheek his lips brushing against the puckered ribbon of scar tissue

Thank you Brother Tyrion said For my life

It was… a debt I owed you Jaime’s voice was strange

A debt He cocked his head I do not understand

Good Some doors are best left closed

Oh dear said Tyrion Is there something grim and ugly behind it Could it be that someone said something cruel about me once I’ll try not to weep Tell me

Tyrion…

Jaime is afraid Tell me Tyrion said again

His brother looked away Tysha he said softly

Tysha His stomach tightened What of her
