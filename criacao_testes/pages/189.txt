My speech may be Tyroshi and my garb Dothraki but I am of Westeros of the Sunset Kingdoms Dany told him

Doreah stepped up beside her You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen Daenerys Stormborn khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms

The wine merchant dropped to his knees Princess he said bowing his head

Rise Dany commanded him I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of

The man bounded to his feet That Dornish swill It is not worthy of a princess I have a dry red from the Arbor crisp and delectable Please let me give you a cask

Khal Drogo’s visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good wine and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him You honor me ser she murmured sweetly

The honor is mine The merchant rummaged about in the back of his stall and produced a small oaken cask Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes The Redwyne sigil he said pointing for the Arbor There is no finer drink

Khal Drogo and I will share it together Aggo take this back to my litter if you’d be so kind The wineseller beamed as the Dothraki hefted the cask

She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say No His voice was strange brusque Aggo put down that cask

Aggo looked at Dany She gave a hesitant nod Ser Jorah is something wrong

I have a thirst Open it wineseller

The merchant frowned The wine is for the khaleesi not for the likes of you ser

Ser Jorah moved closer to the stall If you don’t open it I’ll crack it open with your head He carried no weapons here in the sacred city save his hands—yet his hands were enough big hard dangerous his knuckles covered with coarse dark hairs The wineseller hesitated a moment then took up his hammer and knocked the plug from the cask

Pour Ser Jorah commanded The four young warriors of Dany’s khas arrayed themselves behind him frowning watching with their dark almond-shaped eyes

It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe The wineseller had not put his hammer down

Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt but Dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm Do as Ser Jorah says she said People were stopping to watch

The man gave her a quick sullen glance As the princess commands He had to set aside his hammer to lift the cask He filled two thimble-sized tasting cups pouring so deftly he did not spill a drop

Ser Jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine frowning

Sweet isn’t it the wineseller said smiling Can you smell the fruit ser The perfume of the Arbor Taste it my lord and tell me it isn’t the finest richest wine that’s ever touched your tongue

Ser Jorah offered him the cup You taste it first

Me The man laughed I am not worthy of this vintage my lord And it’s a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares His smile was amiable yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow

You will drink Dany said cold as ice Empty the cup or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat

The wineseller shrugged reached for the cup… and grabbed the cask instead flinging it at her with both hands Ser Jorah bulled into her knocking her out of the way The cask bounced off his shoulder and smashed open on the ground Dany stumbled and lost her feet No she screamed thrusting her hands out to break her fall… and Doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward so she landed on her legs and not her belly

The trader vaulted over the stall darting between Aggo and Rakharo Quaro reached for an arakh that was not there as the blond man slammed him aside He raced down the aisle Dany heard the snap of Jhogo’s whip saw the leather lick out and coil around the wineseller’s leg The man sprawled face first in the dirt

A dozen caravan guards had come running With them was the master himself Merchant Captain Byan Votyris a diminutive Norvoshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to his ears He seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken Take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal he commanded gesturing at the man on the ground Two guards hauled the wineseller to his feet His goods I gift to you as well Princess the merchant captain went on Small token of regret that one of mine would do this thing

Doreah and Jhiqui helped Dany back to her feet The poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask into the dirt How did you know she asked Ser Jorah trembling How

I did not know Khaleesi not until the man refused to drink but once I read Magister Illyrio’s letter I feared His dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market Come Best not to talk of it here
