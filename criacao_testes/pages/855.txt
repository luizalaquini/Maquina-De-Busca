Wind and fire did the rest All Jon had to do was watch With flames below and flames above the wildlings had nowhere to go Some continued upward and died Some went downward and died Some stayed where they were They died as well Many leapt from the steps before they burned and died from the fall Twenty-odd Thenns were still huddled together between the fires when the ice cracked from the heat and the whole lower third of the stair broke off along with several tons of ice That was the last that Jon Snow saw of Styr the Magnar of Thenn The Wall defends itself he thought

Jon asked Satin to help him down to the yard His wounded leg hurt so badly that he could hardly walk even with the crutch Bring the torch he told the boy from Oldtown I need to look for someone It had been mostly Thenns on the steps Surely some of the free folk had escaped Mance’s people not the Magnar’s She might have been one So they climbed down past the bodies of the men who’d tried the trapdoor and Jon wandered through the dark with his crutch under one arm and the other around the shoulders of a boy who’d been a whore in Oldtown

The stables and the common hall had burned down to smoking cinders by then but the fire still raged along the wall climbing step by step and landing by landing From time to time they’d hear a groan and then a craaaack and another chunk would come crashing off the Wall The air was full of ash and ice crystals

He found Quort dead and Stone Thumbs dying He found some dead and dying Thenns he had never truly known He found Big Boil weak from all the blood he’d lost but still alive

He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commander’s Tower with an arrow between her breasts The ice crystals had settled over her face and in the moonlight it looked as though she wore a glittering silver mask

The arrow was black Jon saw but it was fletched with white duck feathers Not mine he told himself not one of mine But he felt as if it were

When he knelt in the snow beside her her eyes opened Jon Snow she said very softly It sounded as though the arrow had found a lung Is this a proper castle now Not just a tower

It is Jon took her hand

Good she whispered I wanted t’ see one proper castle before… before I…

You’ll see a hundred castles he promised her The battle’s done Maester Aemon will see to you He touched her hair You’re kissed by fire remember Lucky It will take more than an arrow to kill you Aemon will draw it out and patch you up and we’ll get you some milk of the poppy for the pain

She just smiled at that D’you remember that cave We should have stayed in that cave I told you so

We’ll go back to the cave he said You’re not going to die Ygritte You’re not

Oh Ygritte cupped his cheek with her hand You know nothing Jon Snow she sighed dying





Bran


It is only another empty castle Meera Reed said as she gazed across the desolation of rubble ruins and weeds

No thought Bran it is the Nightfort and this is the end of the world In the mountains all he could think of was reaching the Wall and finding the three-eyed crow but now that they were here he was filled with fears The dream he’d had… the dream Summer had had… No I mustn’t think about that dream He had not even told the Reeds though Meera at least seemed to sense that something was wrong If he never talked of it maybe he could forget he ever dreamed it and then it wouldn’t have happened and Robb and Grey Wind would still be…

Hodor Hodor shifted his weight and Bran with it He was tired They had been walking for hours At least he’s not afraid Bran was scared of this place and almost as scared of admitting it to the Reeds I’m a prince of the north a Stark of Winterfell almost a man grown I have to be as brave as Robb

Jojen gazed up at him with his dark green eyes There’s nothing here to hurt us Your Grace

Bran wasn’t so certain The Nightfort had figured in some of Old Nan’s scariest stories It was here that Night’s King had reigned before his name was wiped from the memory of man This was where the Rat Cook had served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie where the seventy-nine sentinels stood their watch where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered This was the castle where King Sherrit had called down his curse on the Andals of old where the ’prentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the hellhounds fighting Mad Axe had once walked these yards and climbed these towers butchering his brothers in the dark

All that had happened hundreds and thousands of years ago to be sure and some maybe never happened at all Maester Luwin always said that Old Nan’s stories shouldn’t be swallowed whole But once his uncle came to see Father and Bran asked about the Nightfort Benjen Stark never said the tales were true but he never said they weren’t he only shrugged and said We left the Nightfort two hundred years ago as if that was an answer

Bran forced himself to look around The morning was cold but bright the sun shining down from a hard blue sky but he did not like the noises The wind made a nervous whistling sound as it shivered through the broken towers the keeps groaned and settled and he could hear rats scrabbling under the floor of the great hall The Rat Cook’s children running from their father The yards were small forests where spindly trees rubbed their bare branches together and dead leaves scuttled like roaches across patches of old snow There were trees growing where the stables had been and a twisted white weirwood pushing up through the gaping hole in the roof of the domed kitchen Even Summer was not at ease here Bran slipped inside his skin just for an instant to get the smell of the place He did not like that either

And there was no way through

Bran had told them there wouldn’t be He had told them and told them but Jojen Reed had insisted on seeing for himself He had had a green dream he said and his green dreams did not lie They don’t open any gates either thought Bran

The gate the Nightfort guarded had been sealed since the day the black brothers had loaded up their mules and garrons and departed for Deep Lake its iron portcullis lowered the chains that raised it carried off the tunnel packed with stone and rubble all frozen together until they were as impenetrable as the Wall itself We should have followed Jon Bran said when he saw it He thought of his bastard brother often since the night that Summer had watched him ride off through the storm We should have found the kingsroad and gone to Castle Black

We dare not my prince Jojen said I’ve told you why
