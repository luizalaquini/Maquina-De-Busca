One my lord Jon agreed Brothers returning

Mormont moved to the fire The Halfhand And past time He had grown more restive every day they waited much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs See that there’s hot food for the men and fodder for the horses I’ll see Qhorin at once

I’ll bring him my lord The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago When they had not appeared the brothers had begun to wonder Jon had heard gloomy mutterings around the cookfire and not just from Dolorous Edd Ser Ottyn Wythers was for retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower hoping to pick up Qhorin’s trail and learn what had befallen him And Thoren Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains Mance Rayder knows he must battle the Watch Thoren had declared but he will never look for us so far north If we ride up the Milkwater we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on him

The numbers would be greatly against us Ser Ottyn had objected Craster said he was gathering a great host Many thousands Without Qhorin we are only two hundred

Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep ser and see what happens said Smallwood confidently

There are goats among these sheep Thoren warned Jarman Buckwell Aye and maybe a few lions Rattleshirt Harma the Dogshead Alfyn Crowkiller…

I know them as well as you do Buckwell Thoren Smallwood snapped back And I mean to have their heads every one These are wildlings No soldiers A few hundred heroes drunk most like amidst a great horde of women children and thralls We will sweep over them and send them howling back to their hovels

They had argued for many hours and reached no agreement The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater seeking battle In the end nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower and talk again if they did not appear

And now they had which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer Jon was glad of that much at least If they must battle Mance Rayder let it be soon

He found Dolorous Edd at the fire complaining about how difficult it was for him to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods Jon gave him something new to complain about Together they woke Hake who received the Lord Commander’s orders with a stream of curses but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a soup

Sam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp Under the black hood his face was as pale and round as the moon I heard the horn Has your uncle come back

It’s only the men from the Shadow Tower It was growing harder to cling to the hope of Benjen Stark’s safe return The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to his uncle or one of his men even the Old Bear admitted as much though why they would have buried it there wrapped around the cache of dragonglass no one could say Sam I have to go

At the ringwall he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an opening It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending their way up the slope All in leather and fur they were with here and there a bit of steel or bronze heavy beards covered hard lean faces and made them look as shaggy as their garrons Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse When he looked more closely it was plain that many of them were wounded There has been trouble on the way

Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him though they had never met The big ranger was half a legend in the Watch a man of slow words and swift action tall and straight as a spear long-limbed and solemn Unlike his men he was clean-shaven His hair fell from beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost and the blacks he wore were so faded they might have been greys Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling’s axe that would otherwise have split his skull It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes and slew him while he was blind Since that day the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable

Jon hailed him Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once I’ll show you to his tent

Qhorin swung down from his saddle My men are hungry and our horses require tending

They’ll all be seen to

The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed You are Jon Snow You have your father’s look

Did you know him my lord

I am no lordling Only a brother of the Night’s Watch I knew Lord Eddard yes And his father before him

Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin’s long strides Lord Rickard died before I was born

He was a friend to the Watch Qhorin glanced behind It is said that a direwolf runs with you

Ghost should be back by dawn He hunts at night

They found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle over the Old Bear’s cookfire Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair I had begun to fear for you Did you meet with trouble

We met with Alfyn Crowkiller Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall and we chanced on him returning Qhorin removed his helm Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer but some of his company escaped us We hunted down as many as we could but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains

And the cost

Four brothers dead A dozen wounded A third as many as the foe And we took captives One died quickly from his wounds but the other lived long enough to be questioned

Best talk of this inside Jon will fetch you a horn of ale Or would you prefer hot spiced wine

Boiled water will suffice An egg and a bite of bacon

As you wish Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and stepped through

Edd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon I envy those eggs he said I could do with a bit of boiling about now If the kettle were larger I might jump in Though I would sooner it were wine than water There are worse ways to die than warm and drunk I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once It was a poor vintage though and his corpse did not improve it

You drank the wine

It’s an awful thing to find a brother dead You’d have need of a drink as well Lord Snow Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg

Restless Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick He could hear the Old Bear’s voice inside the tent punctuated by the raven’s squawks and Qhorin Halfhand’s quieter tones but he could not make out the words Alfyn Crowkiller dead that’s good He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders taking his name from the black brothers he’d slain So why does Qhorin sound so grave after such a victory

Jon had hoped that the arrival of men from the Shadow Tower would lift the spirits in the camp Only last night he was coming back through the dark from a piss when he heard five or six men talking in low voices around the embers of a fire When he heard Chett muttering that it was past time they turned back Jon stopped to listen It’s an old man’s folly this ranging he heard We’ll find nothing but our graves in them mountains

There’s giants in the Frostfangs and wargs and worse things said Lark the Sisterman

I’ll not be going there I promise you

The Old Bear’s not like to give you a choice

Might be we won’t give him one said Chett

Just then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled and he had to move away quickly before he was seen I was not meant to hear that he thought He considered taking the tale to Mormont but he could not bring himself to inform on his brothers even brothers such as Chett and the Sisterman It was just empty talk he told himself They are cold and afraid we all are It was hard waiting here perched on the stony summit above the forest wondering what the morrow might bring The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome

Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself and wound hempen twine around it to make a grip Ugly but it served Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were about as useful as nipples on a knight’s breastplate but Jon was not so certain The dragonglass blade was sharper than steel albeit far more brittle

It must have been buried for a reason

He had made a dagger for Grenn as well and another for the Lord Commander The warhorn he had given to Sam On closer examination the horn had proved cracked and even after he had cleaned all the dirt out Jon had been unable to get any sound from it The rim was chipped as well but Sam liked old things even worthless old things Make a drinking horn out of it Jon told him and every time you take a drink you’ll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall all the way to the Fist of the First Men He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck

The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger but he preferred a steel knife at his belt Jon had noticed Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or what it might mean Perhaps Qhorin will know The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the wild than any other living man

You want to serve or shall I

Jon sheathed the dagger I’ll do it He wanted to hear what they were saying

Edd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread stacked them on a wooden platter covered them with bacon and bacon drippings and filled a bowl with hard-cooked eggs Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord Commander’s tent

Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor his spine as straight as a spear Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke …Rattleshirt the Weeping Man and every other chief great and small he was saying They have wargs as well and mammoths and more strength than we would have dreamed Or so he claimed I will not swear as to the truth of it Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a little longer

True or false the Wall must be warned the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter between them And the king

Which king
