2815 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their
lamps of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps
thereof and for the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the
candlestick and also for the lamps thereof according to the use of
every candlestick

2816 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread for
every table and likewise silver for the tables of silver 2817 Also
pure gold for the fleshhooks and the bowls and the cups and for the
golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason and likewise
silver by weight for every bason of silver 2818 And for the altar of
incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the
chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the
ark of the covenant of the LORD

2819 All this said David the LORD made me understand in writing by
his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern

2820 And David said to Solomon his son Be strong and of good
courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the LORD God even
my God will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of
the LORD

2821 And behold the courses of the priests and the Levites even
they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God and
there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing
skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the
people will be wholly at thy commandment

291 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation
Solomon my son whom alone God hath chosen is yet young and tender
and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the LORD
God

292 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of
silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of
iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set
glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious
stones and marble stones in abundance

293 Moreover because I have set my affection to the house of my God
I have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which I have given
to the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for
the holy house

294 Even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir and
seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the
houses withal 295 The gold for things of gold and the silver for
things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands
of artificers And who then is willing to consecrate his service this
day unto the LORD  296 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of
the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds
with the rulers of the kings work offered willingly 297 And gave
for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and
ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass
eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron

298 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
treasure of the house of the LORD by the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite

299 Then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly
because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD and
David the king also rejoiced with great joy

2910 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation
and David said Blessed be thou LORD God of Israel our father for
ever and ever

2911 Thine O LORD is the greatness and the power and the glory
and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in
the earth is thine thine is the kingdom O LORD and thou art exalted
as head above all

2912 Both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all
and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make
great and to give strength unto all

2913 Now therefore our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious
name

2914 But who am I and what is my people that we should be able to
offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and
of thine own have we given thee

2915 For we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all
our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none
abiding

2916 O LORD our God all this store that we have prepared to build
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all
thine own

2917 I know also my God that thou triest the heart and hast
pleasure in uprightness As for me in the uprightness of mine heart I
have willingly offered all these things and now have I seen with joy
thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee
