up

5010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD that obeyeth the voice
of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him
trust in the name of the LORD and stay upon his God

5011 Behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about
with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye
have kindled This shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in
sorrow

511 Hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek
the LORD look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of
the pit whence ye are digged

512 Look unto Abraham your father and unto Sarah that bare you for
I called him alone and blessed him and increased him

513 For the LORD shall comfort Zion he will comfort all her waste
places and he will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like
the garden of the LORD joy and gladness shall be found therein
thanksgiving and the voice of melody

514 Hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me O my nation
for a law shall proceed from me and I will make my judgment to rest
for a light of the people

515 My righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine
arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine
arm shall they trust

516 Lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth
beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth
shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in
like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness
shall not be abolished

517 Hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose
heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid
of their revilings

518 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall
eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my
salvation from generation to generation

519 Awake awake put on strength O arm of the LORD awake as in
the ancient days in the generations of old Art thou not it that hath
cut Rahab and wounded the dragon  5110 Art thou not it which hath
dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths
of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over  5111 Therefore the
redeemed of the LORD shall return and come with singing unto Zion
and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain
gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away

5112 I even I am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou
shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man
which shall be made as grass 5113 And forgettest the LORD thy maker
that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the
earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of
the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury
of the oppressor  5114 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be
loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread
should fail

5115 But I am the LORD thy God that divided the sea whose waves
roared The LORD of hosts is his name

5116 And I have put my words in thy mouth and I have covered thee in
the shadow of mine hand that I may plant the heavens and lay the
foundations of the earth and say unto Zion Thou art my people

5117 Awake awake stand up O Jerusalem which hast drunk at the
hand of the LORD the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of
the cup of trembling and wrung them out

5118 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all
the sons that she hath brought up

5119 These two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for
thee  desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by
whom shall I comfort thee  5120 Thy sons have fainted they lie at
the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of
the fury of the LORD the rebuke of thy God

5121 Therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not
with wine 5122 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD and thy God that
pleadeth the cause of his people Behold I have taken out of thine
hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou
shalt no more drink it again 5123 But I will put it into the hand of
them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul Bow down that we
may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the
street to them that went over

521 Awake awake put on thy strength O Zion put on thy beautiful
garments O Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean

522 Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down O Jerusalem
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck O captive daughter of Zion
