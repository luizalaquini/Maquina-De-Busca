The day was grey and bitter cold and the dogs would not take the scent

The big black bitch had taken one sniff at the bear tracks backed off and skulked back to the pack with her tail between her legs The dogs huddled together miserably on the riverbank as the wind snapped at them Chett felt it too biting through his layers of black wool and boiled leather It was too bloody cold for man or beast but here they were His mouth twisted and he could almost feel the boils that covered his cheeks and neck growing red and angry I should be safe back at the Wall tending the bloody ravens and making fires for old Maester Aemon It was the bastard Jon Snow who had taken that from him him and his fat friend Sam Tarly It was their fault he was here freezing his bloody balls off with a pack of hounds deep in the haunted forest

Seven hells He gave the leashes a hard yank to get the dogs’ attention Track you bastards That’s a bear print You want some meat or no Find But the hounds only huddled closer whining Chett snapped his short lash above their heads and the black bitch snarled at him Dog meat would taste as good as bear he warned her his breath frosting with every word

Lark the Sisterman stood with his arms crossed over his chest and his hands tucked up into his armpits He wore black wool gloves but he was always complaining how his fingers were frozen It’s too bloody cold to hunt he said Bugger this bear he’s not worth freezing over

We can’t go back emptyhand Lark rumbled Small Paul through the brown whiskers that covered most of his face The Lord Commander wouldn’t like that There was ice under the big man’s squashed pug nose where his snot had frozen A huge hand in a thick fur glove clenched tight around the shaft of a spear

Bugger that Old Bear too said the Sisterman a thin man with sharp features and nervous eyes Mormont will be dead before daybreak remember Who cares what he likes

Small Paul blinked his black little eyes Maybe he had forgotten Chett thought he was stupid enough to forget most anything Why do we have to kill the Old Bear Why don’t we just go off and let him be

You think he’ll let us be said Lark He’ll hunt us down You want to be hunted you great muttonhead

No said Small Paul I don’t want that I don’t

So you’ll kill him said Lark

Yes The huge man stamped the butt of his spear on the frozen riverbank I will He shouldn’t hunt us

The Sisterman took his hands from his armpits and turned to Chett We need to kill all the officers I say

Chett was sick of hearing it We been over this The Old Bear dies and Blane from the Shadow Tower Grubbs and Aethan as well their ill luck for drawing the watch Dywen and Barmen for their tracking and Ser Piggy for the ravens That’s all We kill them quiet while they sleep One scream and we’re wormfood every one of us His boils were red with rage Just do your bit and see that your cousins do theirs And Paul try and remember it’s third watch not second
