Procedure 63  Pascal algorithm for producing reflection coefficients
from filter coefficients
TE
pp
Although we will not go into the theoretical details here
reflection coefficients are bounded by +-1 for stable filters
and hence form a useful test for stability  Having a limited
range makes them easy to quantize for transmission and in fact
they behave better under quantization than do the filter coefficients
One could resynthesize speech from reflection coefficients by first
converting them to filter coefficients and using the synthesis
method described above  However it is natural to seek a single-stage
procedure which can regenerate speech directly from reflection
coefficients
pp
Such a procedure does exist and is called a
ul
lattice filter
Figure 68 shows one form of lattice for speech synthesis
FC Figure 68
The error signal whether transmitted or synthesized
enters at the upper left-hand corner passes along the top forward
signal path being modified on the way to give the output signal
at the right-hand side
Then it passes back through a chain of delays along the bottom
backward path and is used to modify subsequent forward signals
Finally it is discarded at the lower left-hand corner
pp
There are p stages in the lattice structure of Figure 68 where p is the
order of the linear predictive filter
Each stage involves two multiplications by the appropriate
reflection coefficients one by the backward signal em the
result of which is added into the forward path em and the other by
the forward signal em the result of which is subtracted from the
backward path  Thus the number of multiplications is twice
the order of the filter and hence twice as many as for the
realization using coefficients a sub k  If the labour necessary
to turn the reflection coefficients into a sub ks is included
the computational load becomes the same  Moreover since the
