She would never have cheated the Hound she thought during the long walk back to the docks The distance seemed to have grown by miles since she’d ridden it

The purple galley was still there If the ship had sailed while she was being robbed that would have been too much to bear A cask of mead was being rolled up the plank when she arrived When she tried to follow a sailor up on deck shouted down at her in a tongue she did not know I want to see the captain Arya told him He only shouted louder But the commotion drew the attention of a stout grey-haired man in a coat of purple wool and he spoke the Common Tongue I am captain here he said What is your wish Be quick child we have a tide to catch

I want to go north to the Wall Here I can pay She gave him the purse The Night’s Watch has a castle on the sea

Eastwatch The captain spilled out the silver onto his palm and frowned Is this all you have

It is not enough Arya knew without being told She could see it on his face I wouldn’t need a cabin or anything she said I could sleep down in the hold or…

Take her on as cabin girl said a passing oarsman a bolt of wool over one shoulder She can sleep with me

Mind your tongue the captain snapped

I could work said Arya I could scrub the decks I scrubbed a castle steps once Or I could row…

No he said you couldn’t He gave her back her coins It would make no difference if you could child The north has nothing for us Ice and war and pirates We saw a dozen pirate ships making north as we rounded Crackclaw Point and I have no wish to meet them again From here we bend our oars for home and I suggest you do the same

I have no home Arya thought I have no pack And now I don’t even have a horse

The captain was turning away when she said What ship is this my lord

He paused long enough to give her a weary smile This is the galleas Titan’s Daughter of the Free City of Braavos

Wait Arya said suddenly I have something else She had stuffed it down inside her smallclothes to keep it safe so she had to dig deep to find it while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered with obvious impatience One more silver will make no difference child he finally said

It’s not silver Her fingers closed on it It’s iron Here She pressed it into his hand the small black iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her so worn the man whose head it bore had no features It’s probably worthless but…

The captain turned it over and blinked at it then looked at her again This… how…

Jaqen said to say the words too Arya crossed her arms against her chest Valar morghulis she said as loud as if she’d known what it meant

Valar dohaeris he replied touching his brow with two fingers Of course you shall have a cabin





Samwell


He sucks harder than mine Gilly stroked the babe’s head as she held him to her nipple

He’s hungry said the blonde woman Val the one the black brothers called the wildling princess He’s lived on goats’ milk up to now and potions from that blind maester

The boy did not have a name yet no more than Gilly’s did That was the wildling way Not even Mance Rayder’s son would get a name till his third year it would seem though Sam had heard the brothers calling him the little prince and born-in-battle

He watched the child nurse at Gilly’s breast and then he watched Jon watch Jon is smiling A sad smile still but definitely a smile of sorts Sam was glad to see it It is the first time I’ve seen him smile since I got back

They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake and from Deep Lake to Queensgate following a narrow track from one castle to the next never out of sight of the Wall A day and a half from Castle Black as they trudged along on callused feet Gilly heard horses behind them and turned to see a column of black riders coming from the west My brothers Sam assured her No one uses this road but the Night’s Watch It had turned out to be Ser Denys Mallister from the Shadow Tower along with the wounded Bowen Marsh and the survivors from the fight at the Bridge of Skulls When Sam saw Dywen Giant and Dolorous Edd Tollett he broke down and wept

It was from them that he learned about the battle beneath the Wall Stannis landed his knights at Eastwatch and Cotter Pyke led him along the ranger’s roads to take the wildlings unawares Giant told him He smashed them Mance Rayder was taken captive a thousand of his best slain including Harma Dogshead The rest scattered like leaves before a storm we heard The gods are good Sam thought If he had not gotten lost as he made his way south from Craster’s Keep he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle… or into Mance Rayder’s camp at the very least That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy but not for him Sam had heard all the stories about what wildlings did with captured crows He shuddered
