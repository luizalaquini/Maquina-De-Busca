He spurred his horse back into motion trotting over and around a scatter of corpses Downriver the Blackwater was jammed with the hulks of burning galleys Patches of wildfire still floated atop the water sending fiery green plumes swirling twenty feet into the air They had dispersed the men on the battering ram but he could see fighting all along the riverfront Ser Balon Swann’s men most like or Lancel’s trying to throw the enemy back into the water as they swarmed ashore off the burning ships We’ll ride for the Mud Gate he commanded

Ser Mandon shouted The Mud Gate And they were off again King’s Landing his men cried raggedly and Halfman Halfman He wondered who had taught them that Through the steel and padding of his helm he heard anguished screams the hungry crackle of flame the shuddering of warhorns and the brazen blast of trumpets Fire was everywhere Gods be good no wonder the Hound was frightened It’s the flames he fears   

A splintering crash rang across the Blackwater as a stone the size of a horse landed square amidships on one of the galleys Ours or theirs Through the roiling smoke he could not tell His wedge was gone every man was his own battle now I should have turned back he thought riding on

The axe was heavy in his fist A handful still followed him the rest dead or fled He had to wrestle his stallion to keep his head to the east The big destrier liked fire no more than Sandor Clegane had but the horse was easier to cow

Men were crawling from the river men burned and bleeding coughing up water staggering most dying He led his troop among them delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand The war shrank to the size of his eye slit Knights twice his size fled from him or stood and died They seemed little things and fearful Lannister he shouted slaying His arm was red to the elbow glistening in the light off the river When his horse reared again he shook his axe at the stars and heard them call out Halfman Halfman Tyrion felt drunk

The battle fever He had never thought to experience it himself though Jaime had told him of it often enough How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop how the past and the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant how fear fled and thought fled and even your body You don’t feel your wounds then or the ache in your back from the weight of the armor or the sweat running down into your eyes You stop feeling you stop thinking you stop being you there is only the fight the foe this man and then the next and the next and the next and you know they are afraid and tired but you’re not you’re alive and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly you can dance through them laughing Battle fever I am half a man and drunk with slaughter let them kill me if they can

They tried Another spearman ran at him Tyrion lopped off the head of his spear then his hand then his arm trotting around him in a circle An archer bowless thrust at him with an arrow holding it as if it were a knife The destrier kicked at the man’s thigh to send him sprawling and Tyrion barked laughter He rode past a banner planted in the mud one of Stannis’s fiery hearts and chopped the staff in two with a swing of his axe A knight rose up from nowhere to hack at his shield with a two-handed greatsword again and again until someone thrust a dagger under his arm One of Tyrion’s men perhaps He never saw

I yield ser a different knight called out farther down the river Yield Ser knight I yield to you My pledge here here The man lay in a puddle of black water offering up a lobstered gauntlet in token of submission Tyrion had to lean down to take it from him As he did a pot of wildfire burst overhead spraying green flame In the sudden stab of light he saw that the puddle was not black but red The gauntlet still had the knight’s hand in it He flung it back Yield the man sobbed hopelessly helplessly Tyrion reeled away

A man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of his horse and thrust at Tyrion’s face with a dagger He knocked the blade aside and buried the axe in the nape of the man’s neck As he was wresting it free a blaze of white appeared at the edge of his vision Tyrion turned thinking to find Ser Mandon Moore beside him again but this was a different white knight Ser Balon Swann wore the same armor but his horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans of his House He’s more a spotted knight than a white one Tyrion thought inanely Every bit of Ser Balon was spattered with gore and smudged by smoke He raised his mace to point downriver Bits of brain and bone clung to its head My lord look

Tyrion swung his horse about to peer down the Blackwater The current still flowed black and strong beneath but the surface was a roil of blood and flame The sky was red and orange and garish green What he said Then he saw

Steel-clad men-at-arms were clambering off a broken galley that had smashed into a pier So many where are they coming from Squinting into the smoke and glare Tyrion followed them back out into the river Twenty galleys were jammed together out there maybe more it was hard to count Their oars were crossed their hulls locked together with grappling lines they were impaled on each other’s rams tangled in webs of fallen rigging One great hulk floated hull up between two smaller ships Wrecks but packed so closely that it was possible to leap from one deck to the other and so cross the Blackwater

Hundreds of Stannis Baratheon’s boldest were doing just that Tyrion saw one great fool of a knight trying to ride across urging a terrified horse over gunwales and oars across tilting decks slick with blood and crackling with green fire We made them a bloody bridge he thought in dismay Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment but that did not seem to stop them Those are brave men he told Ser Balon in admiration Let’s go kill them

He led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront pounding down a long stone quay with his own men and Ser Balon’s behind him Ser Mandon fell in with them his shield a ragged ruin Smoke and cinders swirled through the air and the foe broke before their charge throwing themselves back into the water knocking over other men as they fought to climb up The foot of the bridge was a half-sunken enemy galley with Dragonsbane painted on her prow her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion had placed between the quays A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar drove the point of his weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann’s horse before he could dismount spilling the knight from the saddle Tyrion hacked at the man’s head as he flashed by and by then it was too late to rein up His stallion leapt from the end of the quay and over a splintered gunwale landing with a splash and a scream in ankle-deep water Tyrion’s axe went spinning followed by Tyrion himself and the deck rose up to give him a wet smack

Madness followed His horse had broken a leg and was screaming horribly Somehow he managed to draw his dagger and slit the poor creature’s throat The blood gushed out in a scarlet fountain drenching his arms and chest He found his feet again and lurched to the rail and then he was fighting staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water Men came at him Some he killed some he wounded and some went away but always there were more He lost his knife and gained a broken spear he could not have said how He clutched it and stabbed shrieking curses Men ran from him and he ran after them clambering up over the rail to the next ship and then the next His two white shadows were always with him Balon Swann and Mandon Moore beautiful in their pale plate Surrounded by a circle of Velaryon spearmen they fought back to back they made battle as graceful as a dance

His own killing was a clumsy thing He stabbed one man in the kidney when his back was turned and grabbed another by the leg and upended him into the river Arrows hissed past his head and clattered off his armor one lodged between shoulder and breastplate but he never felt it A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm Stones began to plummet down crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot knocking him sideways

Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck deep A groaning filled the air like the death cries of some enormous beast The ship he had time to think the ship’s about to tear loose The broken galleys were ripping apart the bridge breaking apart No sooner had he come to that realization than he heard a sudden crack loud as thunder the deck lurched beneath him and he slid back down into the water

The list was so steep he had to climb back up hauling himself along a snapped line inch by bloody inch Out of the corner of his eye he saw the hulk they’d been tangled with drifting downstream with the current spinning slowly as men leapt over her side Some wore Stannis’s flaming heart some Joffrey’s stag-and-lion some other badges but it seemed to make no matter Fires were burning upstream and down On one side of him was a raging battle a great confusion of bright banners waving above a sea of struggling men shield walls forming and breaking mounted knights cutting through the press dust and mud and blood and smoke On the other side the Red Keep loomed high on its hill spitting fire They were on the wrong sides though For a moment Tyrion thought he was going mad that Stannis and the castle had traded places How could Stannis cross to the north bank Belatedly he realized that the deck was turning and somehow he had gotten spun about so castle and battle had changed sides Battle what battle if Stannis hasn’t crossed who is he fighting Tyrion was too tired to make sense of it His shoulder ached horribly and when he reached up to rub it he saw the arrow and remembered I have to get off this ship Downstream was nothing but a wall of fire and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into it

Someone was calling his name faintly through the din of battle Tyrion tried to shout back Here Here I’m here help me His voice sounded so thin he could scarcely hear himself He pulled himself up the slanting deck and grabbed for the rail The hull slammed into the next galley over and rebounded so violently he was almost knocked into the water Where had all his strength gone It was all he could do to hang on

MY LORD TAKE MY HAND MY LORD TYRION

There on the deck of the next ship across a widening gulf of black water stood Ser Mandon Moore a hand extended Yellow and green fire shone against the white of his armor and his lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood but Tyrion reached for it all the same wishing his arms were longer It was only at the very last as their fingers brushed across the gap that something niggled at him    Ser Mandon was holding out his left hand why   

Was that why he reeled backward or did he see the sword after all He would never know The point slashed just beneath his eyes and he felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze of pain His head spun around as if he’d been slapped The shock of the cold water was a second slap more jolting than the first He flailed for something to grab on to knowing that once he went down he was not like to come back up Somehow his hand found the splintered end of a broken oar Clutching it tight as a desperate lover he shinnied up foot by foot His eyes were full of water his mouth was full of blood and his head throbbed horribly Gods give me strength to reach the deck    There was nothing else only the oar the water the deck

Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted flat on his back Balls of green and orange flame crackled overhead leaving streaks between the stars He had a moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view The knight was a white steel shadow his eyes shining darkly behind his helm Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt

And suddenly he lurched to the left staggering into the rail Wood split and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash An instant later the hulls came slamming together again so hard the deck seemed to jump Then someone was kneeling over him Jaime he croaked almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth Who else would save him if not his brother

Be still my lord you’re hurt bad A boy’s voice that makes no sense thought Tyrion It sounded almost like Pod





SANSA

When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said Tell my brother ser Her voice was distant as if the news were of no great interest to her

Your brother’s likely dead Ser Lancel’s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under his arm When he had arrived in the hall the sight of him had made some of the guests scream He was on the bridge of boats when it broke apart we think Ser Mandon’s likely gone as well and no one can find the Hound Gods be damned Cersei why did you have them fetch Joffrey back to the castle The gold cloaks are throwing down their spears and running hundreds of them When they saw the king leaving they lost all heart The whole Blackwater’s awash with wrecks and fire and corpses but we could have held if—

Osney Kettleblack pushed past him There’s fighting on both sides of the river now Y’Grace It may be that some of Stannis’s lords are fighting each other no one’s sure it’s all confused over there The Hound’s gone no one knows where and Ser Balon’s fallen back inside the city The riverside’s theirs They’re ramming at the King’s Gate again and Ser Lancel’s right your men are deserting the walls and killing their own officers There’s mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out and Flea Bottom’s one great drunken riot

Gods be good Sansa thought it is happening Joffrey’s lost his head and so have I She looked for Ser Ilyn but the King’s Justice was not to be seen I can feel him though He’s close I’ll not escape him he’ll have my head

Strangely calm the queen turned to his brother Osfryd Raise the drawbridge and bar the doors No one enters or leaves Maegor’s without my leave

What about them women who went to pray

They chose to leave my protection Let them pray perhaps the gods will defend them Where’s my son

The castle gatehouse He wanted to command the crossbowmen There’s a mob howling outside half of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate

Bring him inside Maegor’s now

No Lancel was so angry he forgot to keep his voice down Heads turned toward them as he shouted We’ll have the Mud Gate all over again Let him stay where he is he’s the king—

He’s my son Cersei Lannister rose to her feet You claim to be a Lannister as well cousin prove it Osfryd why are you standing there Now means today

Osfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall his brother with him Many of the guests were rushing out as well Some of the women were weeping some praying Others simply remained at the tables and called for more wine Cersei Ser Lancel pleaded if we lose the castle Joffrey will be killed in any case you know that Let him stay I’ll keep him by me I swear—

Get out of my way Cersei slammed her open palm into his wound Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen swept from the room She spared Sansa not so much as a glance She’s forgotten me Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won’t even think about it

Oh gods an old woman wailed We’re lost the battle’s lost she’s running Several children were crying They can smell the fear Sansa found herself alone on the dais Should she stay here or run after the queen and plead for her life

She never knew why she got to her feet but she did Don’t be afraid she told them loudly The queen has raised the drawbridge This is the safest place in the city There’s thick walls the moat the spikes   

What’s happened demanded a woman she knew slightly the wife of a lesser lordling What did Osney tell her Is the king hurt has the city fallen

Tell us someone else shouted One woman asked about her father another her son

Sansa raised her hands for quiet Joffrey’s come back to the castle He’s not hurt They’re still fighting that’s all I know they’re fighting bravely The queen will be back soon The last was a lie but she had to soothe them She noticed the fools standing under the galley Moon Boy make us laugh

Moon Boy did a cartwheel and vaulted on top of a table He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them Every so often one of them would come down and smash him in the head A few nervous laughs echoed through the hall Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside him His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck him Madness he gasped Gods the Imp was right was right   

Help him Sansa commanded two of the serving men One just looked at her and ran flagon and all Other servants were leaving the hall as well but she could not help that Together Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet Take him to Maester Frenken Lancel was one of them yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead I am soft and weak and stupid just as Joffrey says I should be killing him not helping him

The torches had begun to burn low and one or two had flickered out No one troubled to replace them Cersei did not return Ser Dontos climbed the dais while all eyes were on the other fool Go back to your bedchamber sweet Jonquil he whispered Lock yourself in you’ll be safer there I’ll come for you when the battle’s done

Someone will come for me Sansa thought but will it be you or will it be Ser Ilyn For a mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend her He had been a knight too trained with the sword and sworn to defend the weak No He has not the courage or the skill I would only be killing him as well

It took all the strength she had in her to walk slowly from the Queen’s Ballroom when she wanted so badly to run When she reached the steps she did run up and around until she was breathless and dizzy One of the guards knocked into her on the stair A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he’d wrapped them in and went clattering down the steps He hurried after them paying Sansa no mind once he decided she was not going to try and take his loot
