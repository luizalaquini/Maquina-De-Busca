shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace

37 Therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the
cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all
the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped
the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up

38 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused
the Jews

39 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar O king live for
ever

310 Thou O king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer
and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image
311 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be
cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace

312 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men O
king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the
golden image which thou hast set up

313 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Then they brought these men before
the king

314 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them Is it true O Shadrach
Meshach and Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden
image which I have set up  315 Now if ye be ready that at what time
ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and
dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image
which I have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the
same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that
God that shall deliver you out of my hands  316 Shadrach Meshach
and Abednego answered and said to the king O Nebuchadnezzar we are
not careful to answer thee in this matter

317 If it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O
king

318 But if not be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve
thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up

319 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage
was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he
spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times
more than it was wont to be heated

320 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and to cast them into the
burning fiery furnace

321 Then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their
hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the
burning fiery furnace

322 Therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the
furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took
up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego

323 And these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down
bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace

324 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste
and spake and said unto his counsellors Did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire They answered and said unto the
king True O king

325 He answered and said Lo I see four men loose walking in the
midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth
is like the Son of God

326 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
furnace and spake and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego ye
servants of the most high God come forth and come hither Then
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the midst of the fire

327 And the princes governors and captains and the kings
counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies
the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither
were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them

328 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said Blessed be the God of
Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who hath sent his angel and
delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the
kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor
worship any god except their own God

329 Therefore I make a decree That every people nation and
language which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach
Meshach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall
be made a dunghill because there is no other God that can deliver
after this sort

330 Then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the
province of Babylon
