The direwolf trotted to him Jon heard Samwell Tarly’s sharp intake of breath

Gods be good Dywen muttered That’s a hand





EDDARD

The grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of hoofbeats awoke Eddard Stark from his brief exhausted sleep He lifted his head from the table to look down into the yard Below men in mail and leather and crimson cloaks were making the morning ring to the sound of swords and riding down mock warriors stuffed with straw Ned watched Sandor Clegane gallop across the hard-packed ground to drive an iron-tipped lance through a dummy’s head Canvas ripped and straw exploded as Lannister guardsmen joked and cursed

Is this brave show for my benefit he wondered If so Cersei was a greater fool than he’d imagined Damn her he thought why is the woman not fled I have given her chance after chance…

The morning was overcast and grim Ned broke his fast with his daughters and Septa Mordane Sansa still disconsolate stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat but Arya wolfed down everything that was set in front of her Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening she said Can I Father All my things are packed

A short lesson and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change I want you ready to leave by midday is that understood

By midday Arya said

Sansa looked up from her food If she can have a dancing lesson why won’t you let me say farewell to Prince Joffrey

I would gladly go with her Lord Eddard Septa Mordane offered There would be no question of her missing the ship

It would not be wise for you to go to Joffrey right now Sansa I’m sorry

Sansa’s eyes filled with tears But why

Sansa your lord father knows best Septa Mordane said You are not to question his decisions

It’s not fair Sansa pushed back from her table knocked over her chair and ran weeping from the solar

Septa Mordane rose but Ned gestured her back to her seat Let her go Septa I will try to make her understand when we are all safely back in Winterfell The septa bowed her head and sat down to finish her breakfast

It was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his solar His shoulders slumped as if the weight of the great maester’s chain around his neck had become too great to bear My lord he said King Robert is gone The gods give him rest

No Ned answered He hated rest The gods give him love and laughter and the joy of righteous battle It was strange how empty he felt He had been expecting the visit and yet with those words something died within him He would have given all his titles for the freedom to weep… but he was Robert’s Hand and the hour he dreaded had come Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar he told Pycelle The Tower of the Hand was as secure as he and Tomard could make it he could not say the same for the council chambers

My lord Pycelle blinked Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow when our grief is not so fresh

Ned was quiet but firm I fear we must convene at once

Pycelle bowed As the Hand commands He called his servants and sent them running then gratefully accepted Ned’s offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer

Ser Barristan Selmy was the first to answer the summons immaculate in white cloak and enameled scales My lords he said my place is beside the young king now Pray give me leave to attend him

Your place is here Ser Barristan Ned told him

Littlefinger came next still garbed in the blue velvets and silver mockingbird cape he had worn the night previous his boots dusty from riding My lords he said smiling at nothing in particular before he turned to Ned That little task you set me is accomplished Lord Eddard

Varys entered in a wash of lavender pink from his bath his plump face scrubbed and freshly powdered his soft slippers all but soundless The little birds sing a grievous song today he said as he seated himself The realm weeps Shall we begin

When Lord Renly arrives Ned said
