I did not keep silent Stannis declared I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn

Rather than your own brother

My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful said Stannis From me such accusations would have seemed peevish and self-serving a means of placing myself first in the line of succession I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn whom he loved

Ah said Renly So we have the word of a dead man

Do you think he died by happenstance you purblind fool Cersei had him poisoned for fear he would reveal her Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs—

—which doubtless died with him How inconvenient

Catelyn was remembering fitting pieces together My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell she admitted Later in the Eyrie she laid the murder at the feet of the queen’s brother Tyrion

Stannis snorted If you step in a nest of snakes does it matter which one bites you first

All this of snakes and incest is droll but it changes nothing You may well have the better claim Stannis but I still have the larger army Renly’s hand slid inside his cloak Stannis saw and reached at once for the hilt of his sword but before he could draw steel his brother produced    a peach Would you like one brother Renly asked smiling From Highgarden You’ve never tasted anything so sweet I promise you He took a bite Juice ran from the corner of his mouth

I did not come here to eat fruit Stannis was fuming

My lords Catelyn said We ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance not trading taunts

A man should never refuse to taste a peach Renly said as he tossed the stone away He may never get the chance again Life is short Stannis Remember what the Starks say Winter is coming He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand

I did not come here to be threatened either

Nor were you Renly snapped back When I make threats you’ll know it If truth be told I’ve never liked you Stannis but you are my own blood and I have no wish to slay you So if it is Storm’s End you want take it    as a brother’s gift As Robert once gave it to me I give it to you

It is not yours to give It is mine by rights

Sighing Renly half turned in the saddle What am I to do with this brother of mine Brienne He refuses my peach he refuses my castle he even shunned my wedding   

We both know your wedding was a mummer’s farce A year ago you were scheming to make the girl one of Robert’s whores

A year ago I was scheming to make the girl Robert’s queen Renly said but what does it matter The boar got Robert and I got Margaery You’ll be pleased to know she came to me a maid

In your bed she’s like to die that way

Oh I expect I’ll get a son on her within the year Pray how many sons do you have Stannis Oh yes—none Renly smiled innocently As to your daughter I understand If my wife looked like yours I’d send my fool to service her as well

Enough Stannis roared I will not be mocked to my face do you hear me I will not He yanked his longsword from its scabbard The steel gleamed strangely bright in the wan sunlight now red now yellow now blazing white The air around it seemed to shimmer as if from heat

Catelyn’s horse whinnied and backed away a step but Brienne moved between the brothers her own blade in hand Put up your steel she shouted at Stannis

Cersei Lannister is laughing herself breathless Catelyn thought wearily

Stannis pointed his shining sword at his brother I am not without mercy thundered he who was notoriously without mercy Nor do I wish to sully Lightbringer with a brother’s blood For the sake of the mother who bore us both I will give you this night to rethink your folly Renly Strike your banners and come to me before dawn and I will grant you Storm’s End and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me Otherwise I shall destroy you

Renly laughed Stannis that’s a very pretty sword I’ll grant you but I think the glow off it has ruined your eyes Look across the fields brother Can you see all those banners

Do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king

Tyrell swords will make me king Rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king with axe and mace and warhammer Tarth arrows and Penrose lances Fossoway Cuy Mullendore Estermont Selmy Hightower Oakheart Crane Caswell Blackbar Morrigen Beesbury Shermer Dunn Footly    even House Florent your own wife’s brothers and uncles they will make me king All the chivalry of the south rides with me and that is the least part of my power My foot is coming behind a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes And you will destroy me With what pray That paltry rabble I see there huddled under the castle walls I’ll call them five thousand and be generous codfish lords and onion knights and sellswords Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts You have fewer than four hundred horse my scouts tell me—freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are Stannis that host of yours won’t survive the first charge of my vanguard

We shall see brother Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis slid his sword back into its scabbard Come the dawn we shall see

I hope your new god’s a merciful one brother

Stannis snorted and galloped away disdainful The red priestess lingered a moment behind Look to your own sins Lord Renly she said as she wheeled her horse around

Catelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few waited their return That was amusing if not terribly profitable he commented I wonder where I can get a sword like that Well doubtless Loras will make me a gift of it after the battle It grieves me that it must come to this

You have a cheerful way of grieving said Catelyn whose distress was not feigned

Do I Renly shrugged So be it Stannis was never the most cherished of brothers I confess Do you suppose this tale of his is true If Joffrey is the Kingslayer’s get—

—your brother is the lawful heir

While he lives Renly admitted Though it’s a fool’s law wouldn’t you agree Why the oldest son and not the best-fitted The crown will suit me as it never suited Robert and would not suit Stannis I have it in me to be a great king strong yet generous clever just diligent loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies yet capable of forgiveness patient—

—humble Catelyn supplied

Renly laughed You must allow a king some flaws my lady

Catelyn felt very tired It had all been for nothing The Baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while her son faced the Lannisters alone and nothing she could say or do would stop it It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father’s eyes she thought That much at least I can do I may be a poor envoy but I am a good mourner gods save me

Their camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south It was far more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the Mander though only a quarter as large When he’d learned of his brother’s assault on Storm’s End Renly had split his forces much as Robb had done at the Twins His great mass of foot he had left behind at Bitterbridge with his young queen his wagons carts draft animals and all his cumbersome siege machinery while Renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east

How like his brother Robert he was even in that    only Robert had always had Eddard Stark to temper his boldness with caution Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to bring up his whole force to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers That choice Renly had denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother He had outdistanced his supply lines left food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen He must come to battle soon or starve

Catelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied Renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment Inside the walls of green silk his captains and lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley My brother has not changed their young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the gold-and-jade crown from his brow Castles and courtesies will not appease him he must have blood Well I am of a mind to grant his wish

Your Grace I see no need for battle here Lord Mathis Rowan put in The castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm’s End Let Lord Stannis have his siege He will find no joy in it and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless we will take King’s Landing

And have men say I feared to face Stannis

Only fools will say that Lord Mathis argued

Renly looked to the others What say you all

I say that Stannis is a danger to you Lord Randyll Tarly declared Leave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger while your own power is diminished by battle The Lannisters will not be beaten in a day By the time you are done with them Lord Stannis may be as strong as you    or stronger

Others chorused their agreement The king looked pleased We shall fight then

I have failed Robb as I failed Ned Catelyn thought My lord she announced If you are set on battle my purpose here is done I ask your leave to return to Riverrun

You do not have it Renly seated himself on a camp chair

She stiffened I had hoped to help you make a peace my lord I will not help you make a war
