than as an experimental tool for linguistic research it is important
that the method of specifying utterances is natural and easy to learn
Prosodic features must be communicated to the computer in a manner
considerably simpler than individual duration and pitch specifications
for each phoneme as was required in early synthesis-by-rule systems
Fortunately a notation has been developed for conveying some of the
prosodic features of utterances as a by-product of the linguistically
important task of classifying the intonation contours used in
conversational English Halliday 1967

This system has even been used to help foreigners speak English
Halliday 1970 em which emphasizes the fact that it was designed for use
by laymen not just linguists

Here are examples of the way utterances can be conveyed to the ISP
speech synthesis system which was described in the previous chapter
The notation is based upon Hallidays

Automatic synthesis of speech from a phonetic representation  Three
levels of stress are distinguished  tonic or sentence stress
marked by  before the syllable foot stress marked by 
and unstressed syllables
The notion of a foot controls the rhythm of the speech in a way that
will be described shortly
A fourth level of stress is indicated on a segmental basis when a syllable
contains a reduced vowel
pp
Utterances are divided by punctuation into
ul
tone groups
which are the basic prosodic unit em there are two in the example
The shape of the pitch contour is governed by a numeral at the start of
each tone group
Crude control over pauses is achieved by punctuation marks  full stop for
example signals a pause while comma does not
Longer pauses can be obtained by several full stops as in   The
 character stands for a so-called silent stress or breath point
Word boundaries are marked by two spaces between phonemes
As mentioned in the previous chapter syllable boundaries and explicit
pitch and duration specifiers can also be included in the input
If they are not the ISP system will attempt to compute them
rh Rhythm
Our understanding of speech rhythm knows many laws but little order
In the mid 1970s there was a spate of publications reporting new data
on segmental duration in various contexts and there is a growing
awareness that segmental duration is influenced by a great many factors
ranging from the structure of a discourse through semantic and syntactic
attributes of the utterances their phonemic and phonetic make-up
right down to physiological constraints
these multifarious influences are ably documented and reviewed by
Klatt 1976

Klatt 1976 Linguistic uses of segment duration in English

What seems to be lacking in this work is a conceptual framework on to
which new information about segmental duration can be nailed
pp
One starting-point for imitating the rhythm of English speech is the
hypothesis of regularly recurring stresses
These stresses are primarily
ul
rhythmic
ones and should be distinguished from the tonic stress mentioned above which
is primarily an
ul
intonational
one
Rhythmic stresses are marked in the transcription by a 
The stretch between one and the next is called a foot
and the hypothesis above is often referred to as that of isochronous feet
isochronous means of equal time
There is considerable controversy about this hypothesis
It is most popular among British linguists and it must be admitted
amongst those who work by introspection and intuition and do not actually
ul
measure
things
Although the question of isochrony of feet has long been debated there
seems to be general agreement
em even amongst American linguists em
that there is at least a tendency towards
equal spacing of foot boundaries
However little is known about the strength of this tendency and the extent
of deviations from it see Hill
