As you wish Lord Tywin said

Oh good thought Tyrion savagely After this farce of a trial execution will almost come as a relief

That night as he sat by his window drinking he heard voices outside his door Ser Kevan come for my answer he thought at once but it was not his uncle who entered

Tyrion rose to give Prince Oberyn a mocking bow Are judges permitted to visit the accused

Princes are permitted to go where they will Or so I told your guards The Red Viper took a seat

My father will be displeased with you

The happiness of Tywin Lannister has never been high on my list of concerns Is it Dornish wine you’re drinking

From the Arbor

Oberyn made a face Red water Did you poison him

No Did you

The prince smiled Do all dwarfs have tongues like yours Someone is going to cut it out one of these days

You are not the first to tell me that Perhaps I should cut it out myself it seems to make no end of trouble

So I’ve seen I think I may drink some of Lord Redwyne’s grape juice after all

As you like Tyrion served him a cup

The man took a sip sloshed it about in his mouth and swallowed It will serve for the moment I will send you up some strong Dornish wine on the morrow He took another sip I have turned up that golden-haired whore I was hoping for

So you found Chataya’s

At Chataya’s I bedded the black-skinned girl Alayaya I believe she is called Exquisite despite the stripes on her back But the whore I referred to is your sister

Has she seduced you yet Tyrion asked unsurprised

Oberyn laughed aloud No but she will if I meet her price The queen has even hinted at marriage Her Grace needs another husband and who better than a prince of Dorne Ellaria believes I should accept Just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes her wet the randy wench And we should not even need to pay the dwarf’s penny All your sister requires from me is one head somewhat overlarge and missing a nose

And said Tyrion waiting

By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled his wine and said When the Young Dragon conquered Dorne so long ago he left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear This Tyrell moved with his tail from keep to keep chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent He would arrive in force take a castle for his own stay a moon’s turn and ride on to the next castle It was his custom to turn the lords out of their own chambers and take their beds for himself One night he found himself beneath a heavy velvet canopy A sash hung down near the pillows should he wish to summon a wench He had a taste for Dornish women this Lord Tyrell and who can blame him So he pulled upon the sash and when he did the canopy above him split open and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon his head His death lit a fire that soon swept across Dorne undoing all the Young Dragon’s victories in a fortnight The kneeling men stood up and we were free again

I know the tale said Tyrion What of it

Just this If I should ever find a sash beside my own bed and pull on it I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty

Tyrion grinned We have that much in common then

To be sure I have much to thank your sister for If not for her accusation at the feast it might well be you judging me instead of me judging you The prince’s eyes were dark with amusement Who knows more of poison than the Red Viper of Dorne after all Who has better reason to want to keep the Tyrells far from the crown And with Joffrey in his grave by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to his sister Myrcella who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew thanks to you

Dornish law does not apply Tyrion had been so ensnared in his own troubles that he’d never stopped to consider the succession My father will crown Tommen count on that

He may indeed crown Tommen here in King’s Landing Which is not to say that my brother may not crown Myrcella down in Sunspear Will your father make war on your niece on behalf of your nephew Will your sister He gave a shrug Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all on the condition that she support her daughter over her son Do you think she would
