By the end the wench’s face was as swollen and bloody as Jaime’s must have been and they had knocked out two of her teeth It did nothing to improve her appearance Stumbling and bleeding the two captives were dragged back through the woods to the horses Brienne limping from the thigh wound he’d given her in the brook Jaime felt sorry for her She would lose her maidenhood tonight he had no doubt That noseless bastard would have her for a certainty and some of the others would likely take a turn

The Dornishman bound them back to back atop Brienne’s plow horse while the other Mummers were stripping Cleos Frey to his skin to divvy up his possessions Rorge won the bloodstained surcoat with its proud Lannister and Frey quarterings The arrows had punched holes through lions and towers alike

I hope you’re pleased wench Jaime whispered at Brienne He coughed and spat out a mouthful of blood If you’d armed me we’d never have been taken She made no answer There’s a pig-stubborn bitch he thought But brave yes He could not take that from her When we make camp for the night you’ll be raped and more than once he warned her You’d be wise not to resist If you fight them you’ll lose more than a few teeth

He felt Brienne’s back stiffen against his Is that what you would do if you were a woman

If I were a woman I’d be Cersei If I were a woman I’d make them kill me But I’m not Jaime kicked their horse to a trot Urswyck A word

The cadaverous sellsword in the ragged leather cloak reined up a moment then fell in beside him What would you have of me ser And mind your tongue or I’ll chastise you again

Gold said Jaime You do like gold

Urswyck studied him through reddened eyes It has its uses I do confess

Jaime gave Urswyck a knowing smile All the gold in Casterly Rock Why let the goat enjoy it Why not take us to King’s Landing and collect my ransom for yourself Hers as well if you like Tarth is called the Sapphire Isle a maiden told me once The wench squirmed at that but said nothing

Do you take me for a turncloak

Certainly What else

For half a heartbeat Urswyck considered the proposition King’s Landing is a long way and your father is there Lord Tywin may resent us for selling Harrenhal to Lord Bolton

He’s cleverer than he looks Jaime had been been looking forward to hanging the wretch while his pockets bulged with gold Leave me to deal with my father I’ll get you a royal pardon for any crimes you have committed I’ll get you a knighthood

Ser Urswyck the man said savoring the sound How proud my dear wife would be to hear it If only I hadn’t killed her He sighed And what of brave Lord Vargo

Shall I sing you a verse of ‘The Rains of Castamere’ The goat won’t be quite so brave when my father gets hold of him

And how will he do that Are your father’s arms so long that they can reach over the walls of Harrenhal and pluck us out

If need be King Harren’s monstrous folly had fallen before and it could fall again Are you such a fool as to think the goat can outfight the lion

Urswyck leaned over and slapped him lazily across the face The sheer casual insolence of it was worse than the blow itself He does not fear me Jaime realized with a chill I have heard enough Kingslayer I would have to be a great fool indeed to believe the promises of an oathbreaker like you He kicked his horse and galloped smartly ahead

Aerys Jaime thought resentfully It always turns on Aerys He swayed with the motion of his horse wishing for a sword Two swords would be even better One for the wench and one for me We’d die but we’d take half of them down to hell with us Why did you tell him Tarth was the Sapphire Isle Brienne whispered when Urswyck was out of earshot He’s like to think my father’s rich in gemstones   

You best pray he does

Is every word you say a lie Kingslayer Tarth is called the Sapphire Isle for the blue of its waters

Shout it a little louder wench I don’t think Urswyck heard you The sooner they know how little you’re worth in ransom the sooner the rapes begin Every man here will mount you but what do you care Just close your eyes open your legs and pretend they’re all Lord Renly

Mercifully that shut her mouth for a time

The day was almost done by the time they found Vargo Hoat sacking a small sept with another dozen of his Brave Companions The leaded windows had been smashed the carved wooden gods dragged out into the sunlight The fattest Dothraki Jaime had ever seen was sitting on the Mother’s chest when they rode up prying out her chalcedony eyes with the point of his knife Nearby a skinny balding septon hung upside down from the limb of a spreading chestnut tree Three of the Brave Companions were using his corpse for an archery butt One of them must have been good the dead man had arrows through both of his eyes

When the sellswords spied Urswyck and the captives a cry went up in half a dozen tongues The goat was seated by a cookfire eating a half-cooked bird off a skewer grease and blood running down his fingers into his long stringy beard He wiped his hands on his tunic and rose Kingthlayer he slobbered You are my captifth

My lord I am Brienne of Tarth the wench called out Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to his brother at King’s Landing

The goat gave her a disinterested glance Thilence her

Hear me Brienne entreated as Rorge cut the ropes that bound her to Jaime in the name of the King in the North the king you serve please listen—

Rorge dragged her off the horse and began to kick her See that you don’t break any bones Urswyck called out to him The horse-faced bitch is worth her weight in sapphires

The Dornishman Timeon and a foul-smelling Ibbenese pulled Jaime down from the saddle and shoved him roughly toward the cookfire It would not have been hard for him to have grasped one of their sword hilts as they manhandled him but there were too many and he was still in fetters He might cut down one or two but in the end he would die for it Jaime was not ready to die just yet and certainly not for the likes of Brienne of Tarth

Thith ith a thweet day Vargo Hoat said Around his neck hung a chain of linked coins coins of every shape and size cast and hammered bearing the likenesses of kings wizards gods and demons and all manner of fanciful beasts

Coins from every land where he has fought Jaime remembered Greed was the key to this man If he was turned once he can be turned again Lord Vargo you were foolish to leave my father’s service but it is not too late to make amends He will pay well for me you know it

Oh yeth said Vargo Hoat Half the gold in Cathterly Rock I thall have But firth I mutht thend him a methage He said something in his slithery goatish tongue

Urswyck shoved him in the back and a jester in green and pink motley kicked his legs out from under him When he hit the ground one of the archers grabbed the chain between Jaime’s wrists and used it to yank his arms out in front of him The fat Dothraki put aside his knife to unsheathe a huge curved arakh the wickedly sharp scythe-sword the horselords loved

They mean to scare me The fool hopped on Jaime’s back giggling as the Dothraki swaggered toward him The goat wants me to piss my breeches and beg his mercy but he’ll never have that pleasure He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock Lord Commander of the Kingsguard no sellsword would make him scream

Sunlight ran silver along the edge of the arakh as it came shivering down almost too fast to see And Jaime screamed





ARYA

The small square keep was half a ruin and so too the great grey knight who lived there He was so old he did not understand their questions No matter what was said to him he would only smile and mutter I held the bridge against Ser Maynard Red hair and a black temper he had but he could not move me Six wounds I took before I killed him Six

The maester who cared for him was a young man thankfully After the old knight had drifted to sleep in his chair he took them aside and said I fear you seek a ghost We had a bird ages ago half a year at least The Lannisters caught Lord Beric near the Gods Eye He was hanged

Aye hanged he was but Thoros cut him down before he died Lem’s broken nose was not so red or swollen as it had been but it was healing crooked giving his face a lopsided look His lordship’s a hard man to kill he is

And a hard man to find it would seem the maester said Have you asked the Lady of the Leaves

We shall said Greenbeard

The next morning as they crossed the little stone bridge behind the keep Gendry wondered if this was the bridge the old man had fought over No one knew Most like it is said Jack-Be-Lucky Don’t see no other bridges

You’d know for certain if there was a song said Tom Sevenstrings One good song and we’d know who Ser Maynard used to be and why he wanted to cross this bridge so bad Poor old Lychester might be as far famed as the Dragonknight if he’d only had sense enough to keep a singer

Lord Lychester’s sons died in Robert’s Rebellion grumbled Lem Some on one side some on t’other He’s not been right in the head since No bloody song’s like to help any o’ that

What did the maester mean about asking the Lady of the Leaves Arya asked Anguy as they rode

The archer smiled Wait and see

Three days later as they rode through a yellow wood Jack-Be-Lucky unslung his horn and blew a signal a different one than before The sounds had scarcely died away when rope ladders unrolled from the limbs of trees Hobble the horses and up we go said Tom half singing the words They climbed to a hidden village in the upper branches a maze of rope walkways and little moss-covered houses concealed behind walls of red and gold and were taken to the Lady of the Leaves a stick-thin white-haired woman dressed in roughspun We cannot stay here much longer with autumn on us she told them A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past hunting If they’d chanced to look up they might have seen us
