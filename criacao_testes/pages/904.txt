Never Tyrion wanted to say but the word caught in his throat Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of her sex If Dornish law applied in the west she would be the heir to Casterly Rock in her own right She and Jaime were twins but Cersei had come first into the world and that was all it took By championing Myrcella’s cause she would be championing her own I do not know how my sister would choose between Tommen and Myrcella he admitted It makes no matter My father will never give her that choice

Your father said Prince Oberyn may not live forever

Something about the way he said it made the hairs on the back of Tyrion’s neck bristle Suddenly he was mindful of Elia again and all that Oberyn had said as they crossed the field of ashes He wants the head that spoke the words not just the hand that swung the sword It is not wise to speak such treasons in the Red Keep my prince The little birds are listening

Let them Is it treason to say a man is mortal Valar morghulis was how they said it in Valyria of old All men must die And the Doom came and proved it true The Dornishman went to the window to gaze out into the night It is being said that you have no witnesses for us

I was hoping one look at this sweet face of mine would be enough to persuade you all of my innocence

You are mistaken my lord The Fat Flower of Highgarden is quite convinced of your guilt and determined to see you die His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too as he has reminded us half a hundred times

And you said Tyrion

Men are seldom as they appear You look so very guilty that I am convinced of your innocence Still you will likely be condemned Justice is in short supply this side of the mountains There has been none for Elia Aegon or Rhaenys Why should there be any for you Perhaps Joffrey’s real killer was eaten by a bear That seems to happen quite often in King’s Landing Oh wait the bear was at Harrenhal now I remember

Is that the game we are playing Tyrion rubbed at his scarred nose He had nothing to lose by telling Oberyn the truth There was a bear at Harrenhal and it did kill Ser Amory Lorch

How sad for him said the Red Viper And for you Do all noseless men lie so badly I wonder

I am not lying Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her father’s bed and stabbed her to death He had some men-at-arms with him but I do not know their names He leaned forward It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon’s head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his hands

What is this now Truth from a Lannister Oberyn smiled coldly Your father gave the commands yes

No He spoke the lie without hesitation and never stopped to ask himself why he should

The Dornishman raised one thin black eyebrow Such a dutiful son And such a very feeble lie It was Lord Tywin who presented my sister’s children to King Robert all wrapped up in crimson Lannister cloaks

Perhaps you ought to have this discussion with my father He was there I was at the Rock and still so young that I thought the thing between my legs was only good for pissing

Yes but you are here now and in some difficulty I would say Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face but it will not save you No more than your father will The Dornish prince smiled But I might

You Tyrion studied him You are one judge in three How could you save me

Not as your judge As your champion





Jaime


A white book sat on a white table in a white room

The room was round its walls of whitewashed stone hung with white woolen tapestries It formed the first floor of White Sword Tower a slender structure of four stories built into an angle of the castle wall overlooking the bay The undercroft held arms and armor the second and third floors the small spare sleeping cells of the six brothers of the Kingsguard

One of those cells had been his for eighteen years but this morning he had moved his things to the topmost floor which was given over entirely to the Lord Commander’s apartments Those rooms were spare as well though spacious and they were above the outer walls which meant he would have a view of the sea I will like that he thought The view and all the rest

As pale as the room Jaime sat by the book in his Kingsguard whites waiting for his Sworn Brothers A longsword hung from his hip From the wrong hip Before he had always wom his sword on his left and drawn it across his body when he unsheathed He had shifted it to his right hip this morning so as to be able to draw it with his left hand in the same manner but the weight of it felt strange there and when he had tried to pull the blade from the scabbard the whole motion seemed clumsy and unnatural His clothing fit badly as well He had donned the winter raiment of the Kingsguard a tunic and breeches of bleached white wool and a heavy white cloak but it all seemed to hang loose on him

Jaime had spent his days at his brother’s trial standing well to the back of the hall Either Tyrion never saw him there or he did not know him but that was no surprise Half the court no longer seemed to know him I am a stranger in my own House His son was dead his father had disowned him and his sister… she had not allowed him to be alone with her once after that first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles Even when they bore him across the city to his tomb in the Great Sept of Baelor Cersei kept a careful distance
