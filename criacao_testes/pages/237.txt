21 And Hannah prayed and said My heart rejoiceth in the LORD mine
horn is exalted in the LORD my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies
because I rejoice in thy salvation

22 There is none holy as the LORD for there is none beside thee
neither is there any rock like our God

23 Talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of
your mouth for the LORD is a God of knowledge and by him actions are
weighed

24 The bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are
girded with strength

25 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they
that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she
that hath many children is waxed feeble

26 The LORD killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave
and bringeth up

27 The LORD maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and
lifteth up

28 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit
the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the LORDs and
he hath set the world upon them

29 He will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be
silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail

210 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces out of
heaven shall he thunder upon them the LORD shall judge the ends of
the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the
horn of his anointed

211 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house And the child did
minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest

212 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial they knew not the LORD

213 And the priests custom with the people was that when any man
offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in
seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand 214 And he
struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the
fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself So they did in
Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither

215 Also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and
said to the man that sacrificed Give flesh to roast for the priest
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw

216 And if any man said unto him Let them not fail to burn the fat
presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would
answer him Nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not I will
take it by force

217 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
LORD for men abhorred the offering of the LORD

218 But Samuel ministered before the LORD being a child girded with
a linen ephod

219 Moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him
from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice

220 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said The LORD give
thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD And
they went unto their own home

221 And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived and bare
three sons and two daughters And the child Samuel grew before the
LORD

222 Now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all
Israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation

223 And he said unto them Why do ye such things for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this people

224 Nay my sons for it is no good report that I hear ye make the
LORDs people to transgress

225 If one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if
a man sin against the LORD who shall intreat for him Notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the LORD
would slay them

226 And the child Samuel grew on and was in favour both with the
LORD and also with men

227 And there came a man of God unto Eli and said unto him Thus
saith the LORD Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father
when they were in Egypt in Pharaohs house  228 And did I choose him
out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to offer upon mine
altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did I give
