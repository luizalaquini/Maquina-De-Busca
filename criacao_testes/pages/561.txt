The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass but beyond the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush shook droplets from his fur sniffed at the darkness suspiciously then lifted a leg against one rocky wall Qhorin had already dismounted Jon did the same You knew this place was here

When I was no older than you I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls He unsaddled his horse removed her bit and bridle and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane There is a way through the heart of the mountain Come dawn if they have not found us we will press on The first watch is mine brother Qhorin seated himself on the sand his back to a wall no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave Over the rush of falling waters Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword

He took off his wet cloak but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep Jon was grateful for his warmth He wondered if the fire was still burning outside or if it had gone out by now If the Wall should ever fall all the fires will go out The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand but after a time that too faded and went dark

Sleep came at last and with it nightmares He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves It was still dark when Qhorin woke him While the Halfhand slept Jon sat with his back to the cave wall listening to the water and waiting for the dawn

At break of day they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat then saddled their garrons once again and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark holding the pale flame up before him Jon followed with the horses The stony path twisted and turned first down then up then down more steeply In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through By the time we come out we will have lost them he told himself as they went Not even an eagle can see through solid stone We will have lost them and we will ride hard for the Fist and tell the Old Bear all we know

But when they emerged back into the light long hours later the eagle was waiting for them perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air

Qhorin’s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes

Here is as good a place as any to make a stand he declared The mouth of the cave shelters us from above and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain Is your sword sharp Jon Snow

Yes he said

We’ll feed the horses They’ve served us bravely poor beasts

Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers I am the shield that guards the realms of men

A hunting horn echoed through the mountains and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds They will be with us soon announced Qhorin Keep your wolf in hand

Ghost to me Jon called The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side tail held stiffly behind him

The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away Their hounds ran before them snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood Ghost bared his teeth his fur bristling Easy Jon murmured Stay Overhead he heard a rustle of wings The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph

The hunters approached warily perhaps fearing arrows Jon counted fourteen with eight dogs Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather On either wing archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows but did not loose The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls One had a chipped stone axe They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids Wildlings did not mine or smelt and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall

Qhorin drew his longsword The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath Despite the chill in the air sweat stung his eyes

Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted Their leader came on alone riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering both were armored in bones Cow bones sheep bones the bones of goats and aurochs and elk the great bones of the hairy mammoths… and human bones as well

Rattleshirt Qhorin called down icy-polite

To crows I be the Lord o’ Bones The rider’s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather

Qhorin snorted I see no lord Only a dog dressed in chickenbones who rattles when he rides

The wildling hissed in anger and his mount reared He did rattle Jon could hear it the bones were strung together loosely so they clacked and clattered when he moved It’s your bones I’ll be rattling soon Halfhand I’ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs I’ll carve your teeth to cast me runes and eat me oaten porridge from your skull

If you want my bones come get them

That Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time But another of his company edged a horse up beside him one of the fighting women called spearwives We are four-and-ten to two crows and eight dogs to your wolf she called Fight or run you are ours

Show them commanded Rattleshirt

The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy Ebben had been bald as an egg so she dangled the head by an ear He died brave she said

But he died said Rattleshirt same like you He freed his battleaxe brandishing it above his head Good steel it was with a wicked gleam to both blades Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons The other wildlings crowded forward beside him yelling taunts A few chose Jon for their mockery Is that your wolf boy a skinny youth called unlimbering a stone flail He’ll be my cloak before the sun is down On the other side of the line another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast Does the baby want his momma Come have a suck o’ this boy The dogs were barking too

They would shame us into folly Qhorin gave Jon a long look Remember your orders
