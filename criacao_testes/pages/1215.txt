Lord Balon Greyjoy rose from the Seastone Chair Have done with your drink and come to my solar he commanded his companions on the dais We have plans to lay He left them with no other word flanked by two of his guards His brothers followed in short order Theon rose to go after them

My little brother is in a rush to be off Asha raised her drinking horn and beckoned for more ale

Our lord father is waiting

And has for many a year It will do him no harm to wait a little longer… but if you fear his wrath scurry after him by all means You ought to have no trouble catching our uncles She smiled One is drunk on seawater after all and the other is a great grey bullock so dim he’ll probably get lost

Theon sat back down annoyed I run after no man

No man but every woman

It was not me who grabbed your cock

I don’t have one remember You grabbed every other bit of me quick enough

He could feel the flush creeping up his cheeks I’m a man with a man’s hungers What sort of unnatural creature are you

Only a shy maid Asha’s hand darted out under the table to give his cock a squeeze Theon nearly jumped from his chair What don’t you want me to steer you into port brother

Marriage is not for you Theon decided When I rule I believe I will pack you off to the silent sisters He lurched to his feet and strode off unsteadily to find his father

Rain was falling by the time he reached the swaying bridge out to the Sea Tower His stomach was crashing and churning like the waves below and wine had unsteadied his feet Theon gritted his teeth and gripped the rope tightly as he made his way across pretending that it was Asha’s neck he was clutching

The solar was as damp and drafty as ever Buried under his sealskin robes his father sat before the brazier with his brothers on either side of him Victarion was talking of tides and winds when Theon entered but Lord Balon waved him silent I have made my plans It is time you heard them

I have some suggestions—

When I require your counsel I shall ask for it his father said We have had a bird from Old Wyk Dagmer is bringing the Drumms and Stonehouses If the god grants us good winds we will sail when they arrive… or you will I mean for you to strike the first blow Theon You shall take eight longships north—

Eight His face reddened What can I hope to accomplish with only eight longships

You are to harry the Stony Shore raiding the fishing villages and sinking any ships you chance to meet It may be that you will draw some of the northern lords out from behind their stone walls Aeron will accompany you and Dagmer Cleftjaw

May the Drowned God bless our swords the priest said

Theon felt as if he’d been slapped He was being sent to do reaver’s work burning fishermen out of their hovels and raping their ugly daughters and yet it seemed Lord Balon did not trust him sufficiently to do even that much Bad enough to have to suffer the Damphair’s scowls and chidings With Dagmer Cleftjaw along as well his command would be purely nominal

Asha my daughter Lord Balon went on and Theon turned to see that his sister had slipped in silently you shall take thirty longships of picked men round Sea Dragon Point Land upon the tidal flats north of Deepwood Motte March quickly and the castle may fall before they even know you are upon them

Asha smiled like a cat in cream I’ve always wanted a castle she said sweetly

Then take one

Theon had to bite his tongue Deepwood Motte was the stronghold of the Glovers With both Robett and Galbart warring in the south it would be lightly held and once the castle fell the ironmen would have a secure base in the heart of the north I should be the one sent to take Deepwood He knew Deepwood Motte he had visited the Glovers several times with Eddard Stark

Victarion Lord Balon said to his brother the main thrust shall fall to you When my sons have struck their blows Winterfell must respond You should meet small opposition as you sail up Saltspear and the Fever River At the headwaters you will be less than twenty miles from Moat Cailin The Neck is the key to the kingdom Already we command the western seas Once we hold Moat Cailin the pup will not be able to win back to the north… and if he is fool enough to try his enemies will seal the south end of the causeway behind him and Robb the boy will find himself caught like a rat in a bottle

Theon could keep silent no longer A bold plan Father but the lords in their castles—

Lord Balon rode over him The lords are gone south with the pup Those who remained behind are the cravens old men and green boys They will yield or fall one by one Winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it The rest shall be ours forest and field and hall and we shall make the folk our thralls and salt wives

Aeron Damphair raised his arms And the waters of wrath will rise high and the Drowned God will spread his dominion across the green lands

What is dead can never die Victarion intoned Lord Balon and Asha echoed his words and Theon had no choice but to mumble along with them And then it was done

Outside the rain was falling harder than ever The rope bridge twisted and writhed under his feet Theon Greyjoy stopped in the center of the span and contemplated the rocks below The sound of the waves was a crashing roar and he could taste the salt spray on his lips A sudden gust of wind made him lose his footing and he stumbled to his knees

Asha helped him rise You can’t hold your wine either brother

Theon leaned on her shoulder and let her guide him across the rainslick boards I liked you better when you were Esgred he told her accusingly

She laughed That’s fair I liked you better when you were nine





TYRION

Through the door came the soft sound of the high harp mingled with a trilling of pipes The singer’s voice was muffled by the thick walls yet Tyrion knew the verse I loved a maid as fair as summer he remembered with sunlight in her hair…

Ser Meryn Trant guarded the queen’s door this night His muttered My lord struck Tyrion as a tad grudging but he opened the door nonetheless The song broke off abruptly as he strode into his sister’s bedchamber

Cersei was reclining on a pile of cushions Her feet were bare her golden hair artfully tousled her robe a green-and-gold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as she looked up Sweet sister Tyrion said how beautiful you look tonight He turned to the singer And you as well cousin I had no notion you had such a lovely voice

The compliment made Ser Lancel sulky perhaps he thought he was being mocked It seemed to Tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted Lancel had thick sandy hair green Lannister eyes and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip At sixteen he was cursed with all the certainty of youth unleavened by any trace of humor or self-doubt and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome His recent elevation had only made him worse Did Her Grace send for you the boy demanded

Not that I recall Tyrion admitted It grieves me to disturb your revels Lancel but as it happens I have matters of import to discuss with my sister

Cersei regarded him suspiciously If you are here about those begging brothers Tyrion spare me your reproaches I won’t have them spreading their filthy treasons in the streets They can preach to each other in the dungeons

And count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen added Lancel I would have had their tongues out

One even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the rightful king Cersei declared It will not be borne Tyrion I gave you ample opportunity to deal with these lice but you and your Ser Jacelyn did nothing so I commanded Vylarr to attend to the matter

And so he did Tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him but they were not important enough to battle over No doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets That is not why I came I have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear sweet sister but they are best spoken of privily

Very well The harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out while Cersei kissed her cousin chastely on the cheek Leave us Lancel My brother’s harmless when he’s alone If he’d brought his pets we’d smell them

The young knight gave his cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully behind him I’ll have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight Tyrion said when he was gone

You’re very pleased with yourself aren’t you Why

Why not Tyrion said Every day every night hammers rang along the Street of Steel and the great chain grew longer He hopped up onto the great canopied bed Is this the bed where Robert died I’m surprised you kept it

It gives me sweet dreams she said Now spit out your business and waddle away Imp

Tyrion smiled Lord Stannis has sailed from Dragonstone
