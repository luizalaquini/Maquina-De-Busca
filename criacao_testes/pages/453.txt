The merchant prince sat up sharply Pyat Pree has blue lips and it is truly said that blue lips speak only lies Heed the wisdom of one who loves you Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

I would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend Xaro Xhoan Daxos would give me what I ask

I have given you my home and heart do they mean nothing to you I have given you perfume and pomegranates tumbling monkeys and spitting snakes scrolls from lost Valyria an idol’s head and a serpent’s foot I have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold and a matched set of bullocks to bear it one white as ivory and one black as jet with horns inlaid with jewels

Yes Dany said But it was ships and soldiers I wanted

Did I not give you an army sweetest of women A thousand knights each in shining armor

The armor had been made of silver and gold the knights of jade and beryl and onyx and tourmaline of amber and opal and amethyst each as tall as her little finger A thousand lovely knights she said but not the sort my enemies need fear And my bullocks cannot carry me across the water I—why are we stopping The oxen had slowed notably

Khaleesi Aggo called through the drapes as the palanquin jerked to a sudden halt Dany rolled onto an elbow to lean out They were on the fringes of the bazaar the way ahead blocked by a solid wall of people What are they looking at

Jhogo rode back to her A firemage Khaleesi

I want to sec

Then you must The Dothraki offered a hand down When she took it he pulled her up onto his horse and sat her in front of him where she could see over the heads of the crowd The firemage had conjured a ladder in the air a crackling orange ladder of swirling flame that rose unsupported from the floor of the bazaar reaching toward the high latticed roof

Most of the spectators she noticed were not of the city she saw sailors off trading ships merchants come by caravan dusty men out of the red waste wandering soldiers craftsmen slavers Jhogo slid one hand about her waist and leaned close The Milk Men shun him Khaleesi do you see the girl in the felt hat There behind the fat priest She is a—

—cutpurse finished Dany She was no pampered lady blind to such things She had seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the Free Cities during the years she’d spent with her brother running from the Usurper’s hired knives

The mage was gesturing urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of his arms As the watchers craned their necks upward the cutpurses squirmed through the press small blades hidden in their palms They relieved the prosperous of their coin with one hand while pointing upward with the other

When the fiery ladder stood forty feet high the mage leapt forward and began to climb it scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey Each rung he touched dissolved behind him leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke When he reached the top the ladder was gone and so was he

A fine trick announced Jhogo with admiration

No trick a woman said in the Common Tongue

Dany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd yet there she stood eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask What mean you my lady

Half a year gone that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass He had some small skill with powders and wildfire sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets

Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood Even the smoke was gone now and the crowd was breaking up each man going about his business In a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty And now

And now his powers grow Khaleesi And you are the cause of it

Me She laughed How could that be

The woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany’s wrist You are the Mother of Dragons are you not

She is and no spawn of shadows may touch her Jhogo brushed Quaithe’s fingers away with the handle of his whip

The woman took a step backward You must leave this city soon Daenerys Targaryen or you will never be permitted to leave it at all

Dany’s wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched her Where would you have me go she asked

To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Asshai Dany thought She would have me go to Asshai Will the Asshai’i give me an army she demanded Will there be gold for me in Asshai Will there be ships What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth
