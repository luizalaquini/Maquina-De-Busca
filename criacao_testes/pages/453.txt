good

345 For Job hath said I am righteous and God hath taken away my
judgment

346 Should I lie against my right my wound is incurable without
transgression

347 What man is like Job who drinketh up scorning like water  348
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with
wicked men

349 For he hath said It profiteth a man nothing that he should
delight himself with God

3410 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it
from God that he should do wickedness and from the Almighty that he
should commit iniquity

3411 For the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every
man to find according to his ways

3412 Yea surely God will not do wickedly neither will the Almighty
pervert judgment

3413 Who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed
the whole world  3414 If he set his heart upon man if he gather
unto himself his spirit and his breath 3415 All flesh shall perish
together and man shall turn again unto dust

3416 If now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice
of my words

3417 Shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn
him that is most just  3418 Is it fit to say to a king Thou art
wicked and to princes Ye are ungodly  3419 How much less to him
that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more
than the poor for they all are the work of his hands

3420 In a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at
midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without
hand

3421 For his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his
goings

3422 There is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of
iniquity may hide themselves

3423 For he will not lay upon man more than right that he should
enter into judgment with God

3424 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set
others in their stead

3425 Therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the
night so that they are destroyed

3426 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others
3427 Because they turned back from him and would not consider any of
his ways 3428 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto
him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted

3429 When he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he
hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a
nation or against a man only 3430 That the hypocrite reign not
lest the people be ensnared

3431 Surely it is meet to be said unto God I have borne
chastisement I will not offend any more 3432 That which I see not
teach thou me if I have done iniquity I will do no more

3433 Should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it
whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not I therefore
speak what thou knowest

3434 Let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken
unto me

3435 Job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without
wisdom

3436 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
answers for wicked men

3437 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands
among us and multiplieth his words against God

351 Elihu spake moreover and said 352 Thinkest thou this to be
right that thou saidst My righteousness is more than Gods  353
For thou saidst What advantage will it be unto thee and What profit
shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin  354 I will answer thee
and thy companions with thee

355 Look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are
higher than thou

356 If thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy
transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him  357 If thou
be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine
