hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
`Dear dear  How queer everything is to-day  And yesterday
things went on just as usual  I wonder if Ive been changed in
the night  Let me think  was I the same when I got up this
morning  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different  But if Im not the same the next question is Who in
the world am I  Ah THATS the great puzzle  And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of
them

  `Im sure Im not Ada she said `for her hair goes in such
long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
sure I cant be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she
oh she knows such a very little  Besides SHES she and Im I
and--oh dear how puzzling it all is  Ill try if I know all the
things I used to know  Let me see  four times five is twelve
and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is--oh dear
I shall never get to twenty at that rate  However the
Multiplication Table doesnt signify  lets try Geography
London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome
and Rome--no THATS all wrong Im certain  I must have been
changed for Mabel  Ill try and say How doth the little--
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do--

            `How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale

            `How cheerfully he seems to grin
              How neatly spread his claws
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws

  `Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on `I must be Mabel
after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so
many lessons to learn  No Ive made up my mind about it if Im
Mabel Ill stay down here  Itll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying Come up again dear  I shall only look
up and say Who am I then  Tell me that first and then if I
like being that person Ill come up  if not Ill stay down
here till Im somebody else--but oh dear cried Alice with a
sudden burst of tears `I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here

  As she said this she looked down at her hands and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little
white kid gloves while she was talking  `How CAN I have done
that she thought  `I must be growing small again  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that
as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high
and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it
hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether

`That WAS a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at
the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in
existence `and now for the garden and she ran with all speed
back to the little door  but alas the little door was shut
again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before `and things are worse than ever thought the poor child
`for I never was so small as this before never  And I declare
its too bad that it is

  As she said these words her foot slipped and in another
moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water  He first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea `and in that
case I can go back by railway she said to herself  Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general
conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and
behind them a railway station  However she soon made out that
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high

  `I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as she swam about
trying to find her way out  `I shall be punished for it now I
suppose by being drowned in my own tears  That WILL be a queer
thing to be sure  However everything is queer to-day

  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then
she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself

  `Would it be of any use now thought Alice `to speak to this
mouse  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should
think very likely it can talk  at any rate theres no harm in
trying  So she began  `O Mouse do you know the way out of
this pool  I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse
Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse
she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having
seen in her brothers Latin Grammar `A mouse--of a mouse--to a
