the LORD endureth for ever Praise ye the LORD



1181 O give thanks unto the LORD for he is good because his mercy
endureth for ever

1182 Let Israel now say that his mercy endureth for ever

1183 Let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endureth for
ever

1184 Let them now that fear the LORD say that his mercy endureth for
ever

1185 I called upon the LORD in distress the LORD answered me and
set me in a large place

1186 The LORD is on my side I will not fear what can man do unto
me

1187 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall
I see my desire upon them that hate me

1188 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man

1189 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
princes

11810 All nations compassed me about but in the name of the LORD
will I destroy them

11811 They compassed me about yea they compassed me about but in
the name of the LORD I will destroy them

11812 They compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the
fire of thorns for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them

11813 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall but the LORD
helped me

11814 The LORD is my strength and song and is become my salvation

11815 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly

11816 The right hand of the LORD is exalted the right hand of the
LORD doeth valiantly

11817 I shall not die but live and declare the works of the LORD

11818 The LORD hath chastened me sore but he hath not given me over
unto death

11819 Open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and
I will praise the LORD

11820 This gate of the LORD into which the righteous shall enter

11821 I will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my
salvation

11822 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner

11823 This is the LORDs doing it is marvellous in our eyes

11824 This is the day which the LORD hath made we will rejoice and
be glad in it

11825 Save now I beseech thee O LORD O LORD I beseech thee send
now prosperity

11826 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD we have
blessed you out of the house of the LORD

11827 God is the LORD which hath shewed us light bind the sacrifice
with cords even unto the horns of the altar

11828 Thou art my God and I will praise thee thou art my God I
will exalt thee

11829 O give thanks unto the LORD for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever



1191 Blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the
LORD

1192 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him
with the whole heart

1193 They also do no iniquity they walk in his ways

1194 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently

1195 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes

1196 Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy
