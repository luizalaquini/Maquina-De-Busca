Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one If you said that in my son’s hearing he would kill you for it

Only so long as I was wearing these Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her We both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat

My son may be young but if you take him for a fool you are sadly mistaken… and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back

Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well

I grow weary of this ser There are things I must know

Why should I tell you anything

To save your life

You think I fear death That seemed to amuse him

You should Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just

What gods are those Lady Catelyn The trees your husband prayed to How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off Jaime gave a chuckle If there are gods why is the world so full of pain and injustice

Because of men like you

There are no men like me There’s only me

There is nothing here but arrogance and pride and the empty courage of a madman I am wasting my breath with this one If there was ever a spark of honor in him it is long dead If you will not speak with me so be it Drink the wine or piss in it ser it makes no matter to me

Her hand was at the door pull when he said Lady Stark She turned waited Things go to rust in this damp Jaime went on Even a man’s courtesies Stay and you shall have your answers… for a price

He has no shame Captives do not set prices

Oh you’ll find mine modest enough Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies and he cannot even keep them straight One day he says Cersei has been flayed and the next it’s my father Answer my questions and I’ll answer yours

Truthfully

Oh it’s truth you want Be careful my lady Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when it’s served up

I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say

As you will then But first if you’d be so kind… the wine My throat is raw

Catelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer Jaime sloshed the wine around his mouth before he swallowed Sour and vile he said but it will do He put his back to the wall drew his knees up to his chest and stared at her Your first question Lady Catelyn

Not knowing how long this game might continue Catelyn wasted no time Are you Joffrey’s father

You would never ask unless you knew the answer

I want it from your own lips

He shrugged Joffrey is mine As are the rest of Cersei’s brood I suppose

You admit to being your sister’s lover

I’ve always loved my sister and you owe me two answers Do all my kin still live
