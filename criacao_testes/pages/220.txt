Crow food Bronn muttered beside him giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid He could only nod Had his lord father taken leave of his senses No pikes too few bowmen a bare handful of knights the ill-armed and unarmored commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage… how could his father expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left

He had no time to think about it The drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his hands to twitching Bronn drew his longsword and suddenly the enemy was there before them boiling over the tops of the hills advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes

Gods be damned look at them all Tyrion thought though he knew his father had more men on the field Their captains led them on armored warhorses standard-bearers riding alongside with their banners He glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods the Karstark sunburst Lord Cerwyn’s battle-axe and the mailed fist of the Glovers… and the twin towers of Frey blue on grey So much for his father’s certainty that Lord Walder would not bestir himself The white of House Stark was seen everywhere the grey direwolves seeming to run and leap as the banners swirled and streamed from the high staffs Where is the boy Tyrion wondered

A warhorn blew Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo it cried its voice as long and low and chilling as a cold wind from the north The Lannister trumpets answered da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA brazen and defiant yet it seemed to Tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller more anxious He could feel a fluttering in his bowels a queasy liquid feeling he hoped he was not going to die sick

As the horns died away a hissing filled the air a vast flight of arrows arched up from his right where the archers stood flanking the road The northerners broke into a run shouting as they came but the Lannister arrows fell on them like hail hundreds of arrows thousands and shouts turned to screams as men stumbled and went down By then a second flight was in the air and the archers were fitting a third arrow to their bowstrings

The trumpets blared again da-DAAA da-DAAA da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAA Ser Gregor waved his huge sword and bellowed a command and a thousand other voices screamed back at him Tyrion put his spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony and the van surged forward The river he shouted at his clansmen as they rode Remember hew to the river He was still leading when they broke a canter until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and galloped past him and Shagga howled and followed The clansmen charged after them leaving Tyrion in their dust

A crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead a double hedgehog bristling with steel waiting behind tall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of Karstark Gregor Clegane was the first to reach them leading a wedge of armored veterans Half the horses shied at the last second breaking their charge before the row of spears The others died sharp steel points ripping through their chests Tyrion saw a dozen men go down The Mountain’s stallion reared lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed spearhead raked across his neck Maddened the beast lunged into the ranks Spears thrust at him from every side but the shield wall broke beneath his weight The northerners stumbled away from the animal’s death throes As his horse fell snorting blood and biting with his last red breath the Mountain rose untouched laying about him with his two-handed greatsword

Shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close other Stone Crows hard behind him Tyrion shouted Burned Men Moon Brothers After me but most of them were ahead of him He glimpsed Timett son of Timett vault free as his mount died under him in full stride saw a Moon Brother impaled on a Karstark spear watched Conn’s horse shatter a man’s ribs with a kick A flight of arrows descended on them where they came from he could not say but they fell on Stark and Lannister alike rattling off armor or finding flesh Tyrion lifted his shield and hid beneath it

The hedgehog was crumbling the northerners reeling back under the impact of the mounted assault Tyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came on at a run saw his axe shear through mail and leather and muscle and lungs The man was dead on his feet the axehead lodged in his breast yet Shagga rode on cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right Finally the dead man slid off Shagga smashed the two axes together and roared

By then the enemy was on him and Tyrion’s battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around his horse A man-at-arms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out knocking the spear aside The man danced back for another try but Tyrion spurred his horse and rode right over him Bronn was surrounded by three foes but he lopped the head off the first spear that came at him and raked his blade across a second man’s face on his backslash

A thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield with a woody chunk He wheeled and raced after the thrower but the man raised his own shield over his head Tyrion circled around him raining axe blows down on the wood Chips of oak went flying until the northerner lost his feet and slipped failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him He was below the reach of Tyrion’s axe and it was too much bother to dismount so he left him there and rode after another man taking him from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up his arm That won him a moment’s respite Reining up he looked for the river There it was off to the right Somehow he had gotten turned around

A Burned Man rode past slumped against his horse A spear had entered his belly and come out through his back He was past any help but when Tyrion saw one of the northerners run up and make a grab for his reins he charged

His quarry met him sword in hand He was tall and spare wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel but he’d lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face but the tall man slammed it aside Dwarf he screamed Die He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around him hacking at his head and shoulders Steel rang on steel and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was Where in the seven hells was Bronn Die the man grunted chopping at him savagely Tyrion barely got his shield up in time and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow The shattered pieces fell away from his arm Die the swordsman bellowed shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the temple so hard his head rang The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the steel The tall man grinned… until Tyrion’s destrier bit quick as a snake laying his cheek bare to the bone Then he screamed Tyrion buried his axe in his head You die he told him and he did

As he wrenched the blade free he heard a shout ‘Eddard a voice rang out For Eddard and Winterfell The knight came thundering down on him swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around his head Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for Bronn His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint His axe was gone as fast as that He clawed for his sword but the morningstar was circling again coming at his face A sickening crunch and he was falling He did not recall hitting the ground but when he looked up there was only sky above him He rolled onto his side and tried to find his feet but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed The knight who had felled him drew up above him Tyrion the Imp he boomed down You are mine Do you yield Lannister

Yes Tyrion thought but the word caught in his throat He made a croaking sound and fought his way to his knees fumbling for a weapon His sword his dirk anything…

Do you yield The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse Man and horse both seemed immense The spiked ball swung in a lazy circle Tyrion’s hands were numb his vision blurred his scabbard empty Yield or die the knight declared his flail whirling faster and faster

Tyrion lurched to his feet driving his head into the horse’s belly The animal gave a hideous scream and reared It tried to twist away from the agony a shower of blood and viscera poured down over Tyrion’s face and the horse fell like an avalanche The next he knew his visor was packed with mud and something was crushing his foot He wriggled free his throat so tight he could scarce talk …yield… he managed to croak faintly

Yes a voice moaned thick with pain

Tyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again The horse had fallen away from him onto its rider The knight’s leg was trapped the arm he’d used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle Yield he repeated Fumbling at his belt with his good hand he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion’s feet I yield my lord

Dazed the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade Pain hammered through his elbow when he moved his arm The battle seemed to have moved beyond him No one remained on his part of the field save a large number of corpses Ravens were already circling and landing to feed He saw that Ser Kevan had brought up his center in support of the van his huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners back against the hills They were struggling on the slopes pikes thrusting against another wall of shields these oval and reinforced with iron studs As he watched the air filled with arrows again and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire I believe you are losing ser he told the knight under the horse The man made no reply

The sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl though he could scarcely lift the sword he held for the agony in his elbow Brorm reined up and looked down on him

Small use you turned out to be Tyrion told him

It would seem you did well enough on your own Bronn answered You’ve lost the spike off your helm though

Tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm The spike had snapped off clean I haven’t lost it I know just where it is Do you see my horse

By the time they found it the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin’s reserve came sweeping up along the river Tyrion watched his father fly past the crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across the field Five hundred knights surrounded him sunlight flashing off the points of their lances The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their charge

With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter He and Bronn went looking for his men Many he found among the dead Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood his arm gone at the elbow a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him Shagga was slumped beneath a tree riddled with arrows Conn’s head in his lap Tyrion thought they were both dead but as he dismounted Shagga opened his eyes and said They have killed Conn son of Coratt Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast where the spear thrust had killed him When Bronn pulled Shagga to his feet the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time He plucked them out one by one cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga and showed them four ears she had taken Timett they discovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men Of the three hundred clansmen who had ridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister perhaps half had survived

He left the living to look after the dead sent Bronn to take charge of his captive knight and went alone in search of his father Lord Tywin was seated by the river sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his breastplate A fine victory Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion Your wild men fought well
