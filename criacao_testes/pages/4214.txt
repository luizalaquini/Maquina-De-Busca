face Finding that her mistress
was going to say no more Liddy glided out closed the
door softly and went to bed
Bathshebas face as she continued looking into the
fire that evening might have excited solicitousness on
her account even among those who loved her least
The sadness of Fanny Robins fate did not make Bath+
shebas glorious although she was the Esther to this
poor Vashti and their fates might be supposed to stand
in some respects as contrasts to each other When
Liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful
eyes which met hers had worn a listless weary look+
When she went out after telling the story they had ex+
pressed wretchedness in full activity Her simple
country nature fed on old-fashioned principles was
troubled by that which would have troubled a woman
of the world very little both Fanny and her child if she
had one being dead
Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection
between her own history and the dimly suspected
tragedy of Fannys end which Oak and Boldwood never
for a moment credited her with possessing The
meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday
night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of Oak
may have had the best of intentions in withholding for
as many days as possible the details of what had
happened to Fanny  but had he known that Bathshebas
perceptions had already been exercised in the matter
he would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of
suspense she was now undergoing when the certainty
which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected
after all
She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some
one stronger than herself and so get strength to sustain
her surmised position with dignity and her carking
doubts with stoicism Where could she find such a
friend nowhere in the house She was by far the
coolest of the women under her roof Patience and
suspension of judgement for a few hours were what she
wanted to learn and there was nobody to teach her
Might she but go to Gabriel Oak  -- but that could not
be What a way Oak had she thought of enduring
things Boldwood who seemed so much deeper and
higher and stronger in

feeling than Gabriel had not
yet learnt any more than she herself the simple
lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn
and look he gave -- that among the multitude of interests
by which he was surrounded those which affected his
personal welibeing were not the most absorbing and
important in his eyes Oak meditatively looked upon
the horizon of circumstances without any special regard
to his own standpoint in the midst That was how
she would wish to be But then Oak was not racked
by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his bosom as
she was at this moment Oak knew all about Fanny
that he wished to know -- she felt convinced of that
If she were to go to him now at once and say no more
than these few words What is the truth of the story
he would feel bound in honour to tell her It would
be an inexpressible relief No further speech would
need to be uttered He knew her so well that no
eccentricity of behaviour in her would alarm him
She flung a cloak roundher went to the door and
opened it Every blade every twig was still The air
was yet thick with moisture though somewhat less dense
than during the afternoon and a steady smack of drops
upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost
musical in its soothing regularity lt seemed better to
be out of the house than within it and Bathsheba closed
the door and walked slowly down the lane till she came
opposite to Gabriels cottage where he now lived alone
having left Coggans house through being pinched for
room There was a light in one window only and that
was downstairs The shutters were not closed nor was
any blind or curtain drawn over the window neither
robbery nor observation being a contingency which could
do much injury to the occupant of the domicile Yes
it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up  he was reading
From her standing-place in the road she could see him
plainly sitting quite still his light curly head upon his
hand and only occasionally looking up to snuff the
candle which stood beside him At length he looked
at the clock seemed surprised at the lateness of the
hour closed his book and arose He was going to bed
she knew and if she tapped it must be done at once
P 356
Alas for her resolve  She felt she could not do it
Not for worlds now could she give a hint about her
misery to him much less ask him plainly for information
on the cause of Fannys death She must suspect and
guess and chafe and bear it all alone
Like a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank
as if lulled and fascinated by the atmosphere of content
which seemed to spread from that little dwelling and
was so sadly lacking in her own Gabriel appeared in
an upper room placed his light in the window-bench
and then -- knelt down to pray The contrast of the
picture with her rebellious and agitated existence at this
