Look at you for starters Its like hes waiting for me
to transform into a hybrid drooling wolf right before his
eyes He stares so long I find myself casting furtive glances
at the one-way glass hoping for some direction from
Haymitch but my earpiece stays silent Youre not very big
are you Or particularly pretty
I know hes been through hell and back and yet
somehow the observation rubs me the wrong way Well
youve looked better
Haymitchs advice to back off gets muffled by Peetas
laughter And not even remotely nice To say that to me
after all Ive been through
Yeah Weve all been through a lot And youre the one
who was known for being nice Not me Im doing
everything wrong I dont know why I feel so defensive Hes
been tortured Hes been hijacked Whats wrong with me
Suddenly I think I might start screaming at him--Im not even
sure about what--so I decide to get out of there Look I
dont feel so well Maybe Ill drop by tomorrow
Ive just reached the door when his voice stops me
Katniss I remember about the bread
The bread Our one moment of real connection before
the Hunger Games
They showed you the tape of me talking about it I
say
No Is there a tape of you talking about it Why didnt
the Capitol use it against me he asks
I made it the day you were rescued I answer The
pain in my chest wraps around my ribs like a vise The
dancing was a mistake So what do you remember
You In the rain he says softly Digging in our trash
bins Burning the bread My mother hitting me Taking the
bread out for the pig but then giving it to you instead
Thats it Thats what happened I say The next day
after school I wanted to thank you But I didnt know how
We were outside at the end of the day I tried to catch
your eye You looked away And thenfor some reason I
think you picked a dandelion I nod He does remember I
have never spoken about that moment aloud I must have
loved you a lot
You did My voice catches and I pretend to cough
And did you love me he asks
I keep my eyes on the tiled floor Everyone says I did
Everyone says thats why Snow had you tortured To break
me
Thats not an answer he tells me I dont know what
to think when they show me some of the tapes In that first
arena it looked like you tried to kill me with those tracker
jackers
I was trying to kill all of you I say You had me treed
Later theres a lot of kissing Didnt seem very
genuine on your part Did you like kissing me he asks
Sometimes I admit You know people are watching
us now
I know What about Gale he continues
My angers returning I dont care about his recovery--
this isnt the business of the people behind the glass Hes
not a bad kisser either I say shortly
And it was okay with both of us You kissing the
other he asks
No It wasnt okay with either of you But I wasnt
asking your permission I tell him
Peeta laughs again coldly dismissively Well youre
a piece of work arent you
Haymitch doesnt protest when I walk out Down the
hall Through the beehive of compartments Find a warm
pipe to hide behind in a laundry room It takes a long time
before I get to the bottom of why Im so upset When I do
its almost too mortifying to admit All those months of
taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are
over Finally he can see me for who I really am Violent
Distrustful Manipulative Deadly
And I hate him for it
17
Blindsided Thats how I feel when Haymitch tells me in
the hospital I fly down the steps to Command mind racing
a mile a minute and burst right into a war meeting
What do you mean Im not going to the Capitol I
have to go Im the Mockingjay I say
Coin barely looks up from her screen And as the
Mockingjay your primary goal of unifying the districts
against the Capitol has been achieved Dont worry--if it
goes well well fly you in for the surrender
The surrender
Thatll be too late Ill miss all the fighting You need
me--Im the best shot youve got I shout I dont usually
brag about this but its got to be at least close to true
Gales going
Gale has shown up for training every day unless
occupied with other approved duties We feel confident he
can manage himself in the field says Coin How many
training sessions do you estimate youve attended
None Thats how many Well sometimes I was
hunting AndI trained with Beetee down in Special
Weaponry
Its not the same Katniss says Boggs We all know
youre smart and brave and a good shot But we need
soldiers in the field You dont know the first thing about
executing orders and youre not exactly at your physical
peak
