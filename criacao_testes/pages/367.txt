232 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel with the
priests and the Levites

233 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and
eight thousand

234 Of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
of the house of the LORD and six thousand were officers and judges
235 Moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised
the LORD with the instruments which I made said David to praise
therewith

236 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi
namely Gershon Kohath and Merari

237 Of the Gershonites were Laadan and Shimei

238 The sons of Laadan the chief was Jehiel and Zetham and Joel
three

239 The sons of Shimei Shelomith and Haziel and Haran three
These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan

2310 And the sons of Shimei were Jahath Zina and Jeush and
Beriah

These four were the sons of Shimei

2311 And Jahath was the chief and Zizah the second but Jeush and
Beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning
according to their fathers house

2312 The sons of Kohath Amram Izhar Hebron and Uzziel four

2313 The sons of Amram Aaron and Moses and Aaron was separated
that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for
ever to burn incense before the LORD to minister unto him and to
bless in his name for ever

2314 Now concerning Moses the man of God his sons were named of the
tribe of Levi

2315 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer

2316 Of the sons of Gershom Shebuel was the chief

2317 And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the chief And Eliezer
had none other sons but the sons of Rehabiah were very many

2318 Of the sons of Izhar Shelomith the chief

2319 Of the sons of Hebron Jeriah the first Amariah the second
Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth

2320 Of the sons of Uzziel Micah the first and Jesiah the second

2321 The sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi The sons of Mahli
Eleazar and Kish

2322 And Eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their
brethren the sons of Kish took them

2323 The sons of Mushi Mahli and Eder and Jeremoth three

2324 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers
even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names
by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the
LORD from the age of twenty years and upward

2325 For David said The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his
people that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever 2326 And also unto
the Levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels
of it for the service thereof

2327 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
twenty years old and above 2328 Because their office was to wait on
the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD in the
courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things
and the work of the service of the house of God 2329 Both for the
shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the
unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that
which is fried and for all manner of measure and size 2330 And to
stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD and likewise at
even 2331 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number
according to the order commanded unto them continually before the
LORD 2332 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of
the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of
the sons of Aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the
LORD

241 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron The sons of
Aaron Nadab and Abihu Eleazar and Ithamar

242 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no
children therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests office

243 And David distributed them both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar
and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar according to their offices in
