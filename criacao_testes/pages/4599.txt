Your grandmother Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time with Ser Loras touching her arm She could feel the warmth of his hand through the silk

Lady Olenna She is to sup with you as well

Oh said Sansa I am talking to him and he’s touching me he’s holding my arm and touching me The Queen of Thorns she’s called Isn’t that right

It is Ser Loras laughed He has the warmest laugh she thought as he went on You’d best not use that name in her presence though or you’re like to get pricked

Sansa reddened Any fool would have realized that no woman would be happy about being called the Queen of Thorns Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him but her wits had deserted her She almost told him how beautiful he was until she remembered that she’d already done that

He was beautiful though He seemed taller than he’d been when she’d first met him but still so lithe and graceful and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes He’s no boy though he’s a man grown a knight of the Kingsguard She thought he looked even finer in white than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped his cloak the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves

Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor’s for them to pass He was all in white as well though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras Beyond the spiked moat two dozen men were taking their practice with sword and shield With the castle so crowded the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise their tents and pavilions leaving only the smaller inner yards for training One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad with the eyes on his shield Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword seemed to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack but Osney’s brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt Blunted swords or no Slynt would have a rich crop of bruises by the morrow It made Sansa wince just to watch They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle and already they are practicing for the next one

On the edge of the yard a lone knight with a pair of golden roses on his shield was holding off three foes Even as they watched he caught one of them alongside the head knocking him senseless Is that your brother Sansa asked

It is my lady said Ser Loras Garlan often trains against three men or even four In battle it is seldom one against one he says so he likes to be prepared

He must be very brave

He is a great knight Ser Loras replied A better sword than me in truth though I’m the better lance

I remember said Sansa You ride wonderfully ser

My lady is gracious to say so When has she seen me ride

At the Hand’s tourney don’t you remember You rode a white courser and your armor was a hundred different kinds of flowers You gave me a rose A red rose You threw white roses to the other girls that day It made her flush to speak of it You said no victory was half as beautiful as me

Ser Loras gave her a modest smile I spoke only a simple truth that any man with eyes could see

He doesn’t remember Sansa realized startled He is only being kind to me he doesn’t remember me or the rose or any of it She had been so certain that it meant something that it meant everything A red rose not a white It was after you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce she said desperately

He took his hand from her arm I slew Robar at Storm’s End my lady It was not a boast he sounded sad

Him and another of King Renly’s Rainbow Guard as well yes Sansa had heard the women talking of it round the well but for a moment she’d forgotten That was when Lord Renly was killed wasn’t it How terrible for your poor sister

For Margaery His voice was tight To be sure She was at Bitterbridge though She did not see

Even so when she heard   

Ser Loras brushed the hilt of his sword lightly with his hand Its grip was white leather its pommel a rose in alabaster Renly is dead Robar as well What use to speak of them

The sharpness in his tone took her aback I    my lord I    I did not mean to give offense ser

Nor could you Lady Sansa Ser Loras replied but all the warmth had gone from his voice Nor did he take her arm again

They ascended the serpentine steps in a deepening silence

Oh why did I have to mention Ser Robar Sansa thought I’ve ruined everything He is angry with me now She tried to think of something she might say to make amends but all the words that came to her were lame and weak Be quiet or you will only make it worse she told herself

Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage had been housed behind the royal sept in the long slate-roofed keep that had been called the Maidenvault since King Baelor the Blessed had confined his sisters therein so the sight of them might not tempt him into carnal thoughts Outside its tall carved doors stood two guards in gilded halfhelms and green cloaks edged in gold satin the golden rose of Highgarden sewn on their breasts Both were seven-footers wide of shoulder and narrow of waist magnificently muscled When Sansa got close enough to see their faces she could not tell one from the other They had the same strong jaws the same deep blue eyes the same thick red mustaches Who are they she asked Ser Loras her discomfit forgotten for a moment

My grandmother’s personal guard he told her Their mother named them Erryk and Arryk but Grandmother can’t tell them apart so she calls them Left and Right

Left and Right opened the doors and Margaery Tyrell herself emerged and swept down the short flight of steps to greet them Lady Sansa she called I’m so pleased you came Be welcome

Sansa knelt at the feet of her future queen You do me great honor Your Grace

Won’t you call me Margaery Please rise Loras help the Lady Sansa to her feet Might I call you Sansa

If it please you Ser Loras helped her up

Margaery dismissed him with a sisterly kiss and took Sansa by the hand Come my grandmother awaits and she is not the most patient of ladies

A fire was crackling in the hearth and sweet-swelling rushes had been scattered on the floor Around the long trestle table a dozen women were seated

Sansa recognized only Lord Tyrell’s tall dignified wife Lady Alerie whose long silvery braid was bound with jeweled rings Margaery performed the other introductions There were three Tyrell cousins Megga and Alla and Elinor all close to Sansa’s age Buxom Lady Janna was Lord Tyrell’s sister and wed to one of the green-apple Fossoways dainty bright-eyed Lady Leonette was a Fossoway as well and wed to Ser Garlan Septa Nysterica had a homely pox-scarred face but seemed jolly Pale elegant Lady Graceford was with child and Lady Bulwer was a child no more than eight And Merry was what she was to call boisterous plump Meredyth Crane but most definitely not Lady Merryweather a sultry black-eyed Myrish beauty

Last of all Margaery brought her before the wizened white-haired doll of a woman at the head of the table I am honored to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna widow to the late Luthor Tyrell Lord of Highgarden whose memory is a comfort to us all

The old woman smelled of rosewater Why she’s just the littlest bit of a thing There was nothing the least bit thorny about her Kiss me child Lady Olenna said tugging at Sansa’s wrist with a soft spotted hand It is so kind of you to sup with me and my foolish flock of hens

Dutifully Sansa kissed the old woman on the cheek It is kind of you to have me my lady

I knew your grandfather Lord Rickard though not well

He died before I was born

I am aware of that child It’s said that your Tully grandfather is dying too Lord Hoster surely they told you An old man though not so old as me Still night falls for all of us in the end and too soon for some You would know that more than most poor child You’ve had your share of grief I know We are sorry for your losses

Sansa glanced at Margaery I was saddened when I heard of Lord Renly’s death Your Grace He was very gallant

You are kind to say so answered Margaery

Her grandmother snorted Gallant yes and charming and very clean He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he knew how to bathe and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be king The Baratheons have always had some queer notions to be sure It comes from their Targaryen blood I should think She sniffed They tried to marry me to a Targaryen once but I soon put an end to that

Renly was brave and gentle Grandmother said Margaery Father liked him as well and so did Loras

Loras is young Lady Olenna said crisply and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your father would that I’d been born a peasant woman with a big wooden spoon I might have been able to beat some sense into his fat head

Mother Lady Alerie scolded

Hush Alerie don’t take that tone with me And don’t call me Mother If I’d given birth to you I’m sure I’d remember I’m only to blame for your husband the lord oaf of Highgarden

Grandmother Margaery said mind your words or what will Sansa think of us

She might think we have some wits about us One of us at any rate The old woman turned back to Sansa It’s treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother how can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair Tut-tut says my son don’t you want your sweetling to be queen You Starks were kings once the Arryns and the Lannisters as well and even the Baratheons through the female line but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until Aegon the Dragon came along and cooked the rightful King of the Reach on the Field of Fire If truth be told even our claim to Highgarden is a bit dodgy just as those dreadful Florents are always whining ‘What does it matter’ you ask and of course it doesn’t except to oafs like my son The thought that one day he may see his grandson with his arse on the Iron Throne makes Mace puff up like    now what do you call it Margaery you’re clever be a dear and tell your poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke it

They call them puff fish Grandmother
