Quiet as a shadow she whispered pulling him down

Some of Yoren’s other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse waiting their turn at a tub You men one of the gold cloaks shouted You the ones left to take the black

We might be came the cautious answer

We’d rather join you boys old Reysen said We hear it’s cold on that Wall

The gold cloak officer dismounted I have a warrant for a certain boy—

Yoren stepped out of the inn fingering his tangled black beard Who is it wants this boy

The other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside their horses Why are we hiding the Bull whispered

It’s me they want Arya whispered back His ear smelled of soap You be quiet

The queen wants him old man not that it’s your concern the officer said drawing a ribbon from his belt Here Her Grace’s seal and warrant

Behind the hedge the Bull shook his head doubtfully Why would the queen want you Arry

She punched his shoulder Be quiet

Yoren fingered the warrant ribbon with its blob of golden wax Pretty He spit Thing is the boy’s in the Night’s Watch now What he done back in the city don’t mean piss-all

The queen’s not interested in your views old man and neither am I the officer said I’ll have the boy

Arya thought about running but she knew she wouldn’t get far on her donkey when the gold cloaks had horses And she was so tired of running She’d run when Ser Meryn came for her and again when they killed her father If she was a real water dancer she would go out there with Needle and kill all of them and never run from anyone ever again

You’ll have no one Yoren said stubbornly There’s laws on such things

The gold cloak drew a shortsword Here’s your law

Yoren looked at the blade That’s no law just a sword Happens I got one too

The officer smiled Old fool I have five men with me

Yoren spat Happens I got thirty

The gold cloak laughed This lot said a big lout with a broken nose Who’s first he shouted showing his steel

Tarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay I am

No I am called Cutjack the plump stonemason pulling his hammer off the leather apron he always wore

Me Kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand

Me and him Koss strung his longbow

All of us said Reysen snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried

Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle saw what was happening and dropped everything but his dagger Is it a fight he asked

I guess said Hot Pie scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw Arya could not believe what she was seeing She hated Hot Pie Why would he risk himself for her

The one with the broken nose still thought it was funny You girls put away them rocks and sticks before you get spanked None of you knows what end of a sword to hold

I do Arya wouldn’t let them die for her like Syrio She wouldn’t Shoving through the hedge with Needle in hand she slid into a water dancer’s stance

Broken Nose guffawed The officer looked her up and down Put the blade away little girl no one wants to hurt you

I’m not a girl she yelled furious What was wrong with them They rode all this way for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her I’m the one you want

He’s the one we want The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull who’d come forward to stand beside her Praed’s cheap steel in his hand

But it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren even for an instant Quick as that the black brother’s sword was pressed to the apple of the officer’s throat Neither’s the one you get less you want me to see if your apple’s ripe yet I got me ten fifteen more brothers in that inn if you still need convincing I was you I’d let loose of that gutcutter spread my cheeks over that fat little horse and gallop on back to the city He spat and poked harder with the point of his sword Now

The officer’s fingers uncurled His sword fell in the dust

We’ll just keep that Yoren said Good steel’s always needed on the Wall

As you say For now Men The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up You’d best scamper up to that Wall of yours in a hurry old man The next time I catch you I believe I’ll have your head to go with the bastard boy’s

Better men than you have tried Yoren slapped the rump of the officer’s horse with the flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad His men followed

When they were out of sight Hot Pie began to whoop but Yoren looked angrier than ever Fool You think he’s done with us Next time he won’t prance up and hand me no damn ribbon Get the rest out o’ them baths we need to be moving Ride all night maybe we can stay ahead o’ them for a bit He scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped Who wants this

Me Hot Pie yelled

Don’t be using it on Arry He handed the boy the sword hilt first and walked over to Arya but it was the Bull he spoke to Queen wants you bad boy

Arya was lost Why should she want him

The Bull scowled at her Why should she want you You’re nothing but a little gutter rat

Well you’re nothing but a bastard boy Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy What’s your true name

Gendry he said like he wasn’t quite sure

Don’t see why no one wants neither o’ you Yoren said but they can’t have you regardless You ride them two coursers First sight of a gold cloak make for the Wall like a dragon’s on your tail The rest o’ us don’t mean spit to them

Except for you Arya pointed out That man said he’d take your head too

Well as to that Yoren said if he can get it off my shoulders he’s welcome to it
