As the girl went to fetch their drinks the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest It is not so yet ofttimes it feels that way does it not On days like this I envy you northerners your summer snows The heavy jeweled chain around the old man’s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat To be sure King Maekar’s summer was hotter than this one and near as long There were fools even in the Citadel who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last the summer that never ends but in the seventh year it broke suddenly and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter Still the heat was fierce while it lasted Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods I remember the smells of those nights my lord—perfume and sweat melons ripe to bursting peaches and pomegranates nightshade and moonbloom I was a young man then still forging my chain The heat did not exhaust me as it does now Pycelle’s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep My pardons Lord Eddard You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born Forgive an old man his wanderings if you would Minds are like swords I do fear The old ones go to rust Ah and here is our milk The serving girl placed the tray between them and Pycelle gave her a smile Sweet child He lifted a cup tasted nodded Thank you You may go

When the girl had taken her leave Pycelle peered at Ned through pale rheumy eyes Now where were we Oh yes You asked about Lord Arryn…

I did Ned sipped politely at the iced milk It was pleasantly cold but oversweet to his taste

If truth be told the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time Pycelle said We had sat together on council many a year he and I and the signs were there to read but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm and more besides His son was ever sickly and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight It was enough to weary even a strong man and the Lord Jon was not young Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired Or so I thought at the time Yet now I am less certain He gave a ponderous shake of his head

What can you tell me of his final illness

The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow He came to me one day asking after a certain book as hale and healthy as ever though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply The next morning he was twisted over in pain too sick to rise from bed Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach The weather had been hot and the Hand often iced his wine which can upset the digestion When Lord Jon continued to weaken I went to him myself but the gods did not grant me the power to save him

I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away

The Grand Maester’s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier I did and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that Maybe I was wrong but at the time I thought it best Maester Colemon is like a son to me and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities but he is young and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice and I feared he might kill him

Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours

Pycelle wrinkled his brow In the last stage of his fever the Hand called out the name Robert several times but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom for fear that he too might be taken ill The king did come and he sat beside the bed for hours talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon’s spirits His love was fierce to see

Was there nothing else No final words

When I saw that all hope had fled I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy so he should not suffer Just before he closed his eyes for the last time he whispered something to the king and his lady wife a blessing for his son The seed is strong he said At the end his speech was too slurred to comprehend Death did not come until the next morning but Lord Jon was at peace after that He never spoke again

Ned took another swallow of milk trying not to gag on the sweetness of it Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn’s death

Unnatural The aged maester’s voice was thin as a whisper No I could not say so Sad for a certainty Yet in its own way death is the most natural thing of all Lord Eddard Jon Arryn rests easy now his burdens lifted at last

This illness that took him said Ned Had you ever seen its like before in other men

Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms Pycelle replied Under our good King Robert and Aerys Targaryen before him and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys’s father Aegon the Fortunate the Fifth of His Name I have seen more of illness than I care to remember my lord I will tell you this Every case is different and every case is alike Lord Jon’s death was no stranger than any other

His wife thought otherwise

The Grand Maester nodded I recall now the widow is sister to your own noble wife If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds and the Lady Lysa was never that Since her last stillbirth she has seen enemies in every shadow and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost

So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness

I am Pycelle replied gravely If not illness my good lord what else could it be

Poison Ned suggested quietly

Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat A disturbing thought We are not the Free Cities where such things are common Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts yet even so the poisoner is beneath contempt He fell silent for a moment his eyes lost in thought What you suggest is possible my lord yet I do not think it likely Every hedge maester knows the common poisons and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs And the Hand was loved by all What sort of monster in man’s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord

I have heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon

Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully It is said Women cravens… and eunuchs He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes Above them a raven cawed loudly in the rookery The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys did you know Put not your trust in spiders my lord

That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl I will remember that Maester And I thank you for your help I have taken enough of your time He stood

Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease If there is any other service I might perform you need only ask

One thing Ned told him I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill

I fear you would find it of little interest Pycelle said It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses

Still I should like to see it

The old man opened the door As you wish I have it here somewhere When I find it I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway

You have been most courteous Ned told him Then almost as an afterthought he said One last question if you would be so kind You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died I wonder was the queen with him

Why no Pycelle said She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock in company with her father Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion’s crown In that he was sadly disappointed It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart

Dark wings dark words Ned murmured It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy

So the fishwives say Grand Maester Pycelle agreed but we know it is not always so When Maester Luwin’s bird brought the word about your Bran the message lifted every true heart in the castle did it not

As you say Maester

The gods are merciful Pycelle bowed his head Come to me as often as you like Lord Eddard I am here to serve

Yes Ned thought as the door swung shut but whom

On the way back to his chambers he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet Ned stopped and looked at her Arya what are you doing

Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself

Ned had to smile Which toe he teased

Any toe Arya said exasperated with the question She hopped from her right leg to her left swaying dangerously before she regained her balance

Must you do your standing here he asked It’s a long hard fall down these steps

Syrio says a water dancer never falls She lowered her leg to stand on two feet Father will Bran come and live with us now

Not for a long time sweet one he told her He needs to win his strength back

Arya bit her lip What will Bran do when he’s of age

Ned knelt beside her He has years to find that answer Arya For now it is enough to know that he will live The night the bird had come from Winterfell Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river The heart tree there was a great oak its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving as if it had been a weirwood Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose Arya several hours later curling up in the grass under Ned’s cloak All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone When dawn broke over the city the dark red blooms of dragon’s breath surrounded the girls where they lay I dreamed of Bran Sansa had whispered to him I saw him smiling

He was going to be a knight Arya was saying now A knight of the Kingsguard Can he still be a knight

No Ned said He saw no use in lying to her Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon But he will never run beside his wolf again he thought with a sadness too deep for words or lie with a woman or hold his own son in his arms

Arya cocked her head to one side Can I be a king’s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon

You Ned said kissing her lightly on the brow will marry a king and rule his castle and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a High Septon
