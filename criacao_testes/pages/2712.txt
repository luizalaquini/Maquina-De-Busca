Bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand

1712 And she said As the LORD thy God liveth I have not a cake but
an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and
behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for
me and my son that we may eat it and die

1713 And Elijah said unto her Fear not go and do as thou hast said
but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and
after make for thee and for thy son

1714 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel The barrel of meal shall
not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the
LORD sendeth rain upon the earth

1715 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she
and he and her house did eat many days

1716 And the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil
fail according to the word of the LORD which he spake by Elijah

1717 And it came to pass after these things that the son of the
woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so
sore that there was no breath left in him

1718 And she said unto Elijah What have I to do with thee O thou
man of God art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and
to slay my son  1719 And he said unto her Give me thy son And he
took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he
abode and laid him upon his own bed

1720 And he cried unto the LORD and said O LORD my God hast thou
also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her
son  1721 And he stretched himself upon the child three times and
cried unto the LORD and said O LORD my God I pray thee let this
childs soul come into him again

1722 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the
child came into him again and he revived

1723 And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the
chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and Elijah
said See thy son liveth

1724 And the woman said to Elijah Now by this I know that thou art a
man of God and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth

181 And it came to pass after many days that the word of the LORD
came to Elijah in the third year saying Go shew thyself unto Ahab
and I will send rain upon the earth

182 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab And there was a sore
famine in Samaria

183 And Ahab called Obadiah which was the governor of his house
Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly 184 For it was so when Jezebel
cut off the prophets of the LORD that Obadiah took an hundred
prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and
water  185 And Ahab said unto Obadiah Go into the land unto all
fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the
beasts

186 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it Ahab
went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself

187 And as Obadiah was in the way behold Elijah met him and he
knew him and fell on his face and said Art thou that my lord
Elijah  188 And he answered him I am go tell thy lord Behold
Elijah is here

189 And he said What have I sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me  1810 As the LORD thy God
liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent
to seek thee and when they said He is not there he took an oath of
the kingdom and nation that they found thee not

1811 And now thou sayest Go tell thy lord Behold Elijah is here

1812 And it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from thee that
the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not and so
when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me
but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth

1813 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
prophets of the LORD how I hid an hundred men of the LORDs prophets
by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water  1814 And now
thou sayest Go tell thy lord Behold Elijah is here and he shall
slay me

1815 And Elijah said As the LORD of hosts liveth before whom I
stand I will surely shew myself unto him to day

1816 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to
meet Elijah

1817 And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto
him Art thou he that troubleth Israel  1818 And he answered I have
not troubled Israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have
forsaken the commandments of the LORD and thou hast followed Baalim
