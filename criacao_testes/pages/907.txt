That I couldn’t say my lord He had a great wide smile on his face did Ser Osmund as if he and Jaime were old comrades in arms playing some jolly little game I’m a soldier though not no tourney knight

Where had you served before my sister found you

Here and there my lord

I have been to Oldtown in the south and Winterfell in the north I have been to Lannisport in the west and King’s Landing in the east But I have never been to Here Nor There For want of a finger Jaime pointed his stump at Ser Osmund’s beak of a nose I will ask once more Where have you served

In the Stepstones Some in the Disputed Lands There’s always fighting there I rode with the Gallant Men We fought for Lys and some for Tyrosh

You fought for anyone who would pay you How did you come by your knighthood

On a battlefield

Who knighted you

Ser Robert… Stone He’s dead now my lord

To be sure Ser Robert Stone might have been some bastard from the Vale he supposed selling his sword in the Disputed Lands On the other hand he might be no more than a name Ser Osmund cobbled together from a dead king and a castle wall What was Cersei thinking when she gave this one a white cloak

At least Kettleblack would likely know how to use a sword and shield Sellswords were seldom the most honorable of men but they had to have a certain skill at arms to stay alive Very well ser Jaime said You may go

The man’s grin returned He left swaggering

Ser Meryn Jaime smiled at the sour knight with the rust-red hair and the pouches under his eyes I have heard it said that Joffrey made use of you to chastise Sansa Stark He turned the White Book around one-handed Here show me where it is in our vows that we swear to beat women and children

I did as His Grace commanded me We are sworn to obey

Henceforth you will temper that obedience My sister is Queen Regent My father is the King’s Hand I am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Obey us None other

Ser Meryn got a stubborn look on his face Are you telling us not to obey the king

The king is eight Our first duty is to protect him which includes protecting him from himself Use that ugly thing you keep inside your helm If Tommen wants you to saddle his horse obey him If he tells you to kill his horse come to me

Aye As you command my lord

Dismissed As he left Jaime turned to Ser Balon Swann Ser Balon I have watched you tilt many a time and fought with and against you in mêlées I’m told you proved your valor a hundred times over during the Battle of the Blackwater The Kingsguard is honored by your presence

The honor’s mine my lord Ser Balon sounded wary

There is only one question I would put to you You served us loyally it’s true… but Varys tells me that your brother rode with Renly and then Stannis whilst your lord father chose not to call his banners at all and remained behind the walls of Stonehelm all through the fighting

My father is an old man my lord Well past forty His fighting days are done

And your brother

Donnel was wounded in the battle and yielded to Ser Elwood Harte He was ransomed afterward and pledged his fealty to King Joffrey as did many other captives

So he did said Jaime Even so… Renly Stannis Joffrey Tommen how did he come to omit Balon Greyjoy and Robb Stark He might have been the first knight in the realm to swear fealty to all six kings

Ser Balon’s unease was plain Donnel erred but he is Tommen’s man now You have my word

It’s not Ser Donnel the Constant who concerns me It’s you Jaime leaned forward What will you do if brave Ser Donnel gives his sword to yet another usurper and one day comes storming into the throne room And there you stand all in white between your king and your blood What will you do
