they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his
captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen

923 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomons
work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that
wrought in the work

924 But Pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
house which Solomon had built for her then did he build Millo

925 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD So he finished
the house

926 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber which is
beside Eloth on the shore of the Red sea in the land of Edom

927 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea with the servants of Solomon

928 And they came to Ophir and fetched from thence gold four
hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king Solomon

101 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD she came to prove him with hard
questions

102 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels
that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when
she was come to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her
heart

103 And Solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing
hid from the king which he told her not

104 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomons wisdom and
the house that he had built 105 And the meat of his table and the
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and
their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up
unto the house of the LORD there was no more spirit in her

106 And she said to the king It was a true report that I heard in
mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom

107 Howbeit I believed not the words until I came and mine eyes had
seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and
prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard

108 Happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand
continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom

109 Blessed be the LORD thy God which delighted in thee to set thee
on the throne of Israel because the LORD loved Israel for ever
therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice

1010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and
of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon

1011 And the navy also of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir
brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious
stones

1012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
the LORD and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for
singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day

1013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire
whatsoever she asked beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal
bounty

So she turned and went to her own country she and her servants

1014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
hundred threescore and six talents of gold 1015 Beside that he had
of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of
all the kings of Arabia and of the governors of the country

1016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six
hundred shekels of gold went to one target

1017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of
gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the
forest of Lebanon

1018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it
with the best gold

1019 The throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round
behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat
and two lions stood beside the stays

1020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom

1021 And all king Solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all
the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold
none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of
