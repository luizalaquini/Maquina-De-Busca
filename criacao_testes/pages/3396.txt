201 And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand

202 And he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the
Devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years 203 And cast him
into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him
that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years
should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season

204 And I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given
unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus and for the word of God and which had not
worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark
upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned
with Christ a thousand years

205 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
were finished This is the first resurrection

206 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of
God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years

207 And when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison 208 And shall go out to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them
together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea

209 And they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the
camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down
from God out of heaven and devoured them

2010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be
tormented day and night for ever and ever

2011 And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no
place for them

2012 And I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the
books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of
life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written
in the books according to their works

2013 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and
hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged
every man according to their works

2014 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire This is the
second death

2015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the lake of fire

211 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea

212 And I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God
out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband

213 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying Behold the
tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they
shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their
God

214 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there
shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
there be any more pain for the former things are passed away

215 And he that sat upon the throne said Behold I make all things
new

And he said unto me Write for these words are true and faithful

216 And he said unto me It is done I am Alpha and Omega the
beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely

217 He that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his
God and he shall be my son

218 But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and
murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all
liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone which is the second death

219 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me
saying Come hither I will shew thee the bride the Lambs wife

2110 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
mountain and shewed me that great city the holy Jerusalem
descending out of heaven from God 2111 Having the glory of God and
her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper
stone clear as crystal 2112 And had a wall great and high and had
twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written
thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
Israel 2113 On the east three gates on the north three gates on
