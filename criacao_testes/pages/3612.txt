You ought to name your ship after me she said ignoring all the rest It was me who built her

Sigrin built her My lord father’s shipwright

I’m Esgred Ambrode’s daughter and wife to Sigrin

He had not known that Ambrode had a daughter or Sigrin a wife… but he’d met the younger shipwright only once and the older one he scarce remembered You’re wasted on Sigrin

Oho Sigrin told me this sweet ship is wasted on you

Theon bristled Do you know who I am

Prince Theon of House Greyjoy Who else Tell me true my lord how well do you love her this new maid of yours Sigrin will want to know

The longship was so new that she still smelled of pitch and resin His uncle Aeron would bless her on the morrow but Theon had ridden over from Pyke to get a look at her before she was launched She was not so large as Lord Balon’s own Great Kraken or his uncle Victarion’s Iron Victory but she looked swift and sweet even sitting in her wooden cradle on the strand lean black hull a hundred feet long a single tall mast fifty long oars deck enough for a hundred men… and at the prow the great iron ram in the shape of an arrowhead Sigrin did me good service he admitted Is she as fast as she looks

Faster—for a master that knows how to handle her

It has been a few years since I sailed a ship And I’ve never captained one if truth be told Still I’m a Greyjoy and an ironman The sea is in my blood

And your blood will be in the sea if you sail the way you talk she told him

I would never mistreat such a fair maiden

Fair maiden She laughed She’s a sea bitch this one

There and now you’ve named her Sea Bitch

That amused her he could see the sparkle in her dark eyes And you said you’d name her after me she said in a voice of wounded reproach

I did He caught her hand Help me my lady In the green lands they believe a woman with child means good fortune for any man who beds her

And what would they know about ships in the green lands Or women for that matter Besides I think you made that up

If I confess will you still love me

Still When have I ever loved you

Never he admitted but I am trying to repair that lack my sweet Esgred The wind is cold Come aboard my ship and let me warm you On the morrow my uncle Aeron will pour seawater over her prow and mumble a prayer to the Drowned God but I’d sooner bless her with the milk of my loins and yours

The Drowned God might not take that kindly

Bugger the Drowned God If he troubles us I’ll drown him again We’re off to war within a fortnight Would you send me into battle all sleepless with longing

Gladly

A cruel maid My ship is well named If I steer her onto the rocks in my distraction you’ll have yourself to blame

Do you plan to steer with this Esgred brushed the front of his breeches once more and smiled as a finger traced the iron outline of his manhood

Come back to Pyke with me he said suddenly thinking What will Lord Balon say And why should I care I am a man grown if I want to bring a wench to bed it is no one’s business but my own

And what would I do in Pyke Her hand stayed where it was

My father will feast his captains tonight He had them to feast every night while he waited for the last stragglers to arrive but Theon saw no need to tell all that

Would you make me your captain for the night my lord prince She had the wickedest smile he’d ever seen on a woman

I might If I knew you’d steer me safe into port

Well I know which end of the oar goes in the sea and there’s no one better with ropes and knots One-handed she undid the lacing of his breeches then grinned and stepped lightly away from him A pity I’m a woman wed and new with child

Flustered Theon laced himself back up I need to start back to the castle if you do not come with me I may lose my way for grief and all the islands would be poorer

We couldn’t have that… but I have no horse my lord

You could take my squire’s mount

And leave your poor squire to walk all the way to Pyke

Share mine then

You’d like that well enough The smile again Now would I be behind you or in front

You would be wherever you liked

I like to be on top

Where has this wench been all my life My father’s hall is dim and dank It needs Esgred to make the fires blaze

The lordling has a honeyed tongue

Isn’t that where we began

She threw up her hands And where we end Esgred is yours sweet prince Take me to your castle Let me see your proud towers rising from the sea

I left my horse at the inn Come They walked down the strand together and when Theon took her arm she did not pull away He liked the way she walked there was a boldness to it part saunter and part sway that suggested she would be just as bold beneath the blankets

Lordsport was as crowded as he’d ever seen it swarming with the crews of the longships that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater Ironmen did not bend their knees often nor easily but Theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet as they passed and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head They have finally learned who I am he thought And past time too

Lord Goodbrother of Great Wyk had come in the night before with his main strength near forty longships His men were everywhere conspicuous in their striped goat’s hair sashes It was said about the inn that Otter Gimpknee’s whores were being fucked bowlegged by beardless boys in sashes The boys were welcome to them so far as Theon was concerned A poxier den of slatterns he hoped he’d never see His present companion was more to his taste That she was wed to his father’s shipwright and pregnant to boot only made her more intriguing

Has my lord prince begun choosing his crew Esgred asked as they made their way toward the stable Ho Bluetooth she shouted to a passing seafarer a tall man in bearskin vest and raven-winged helm How fares your bride

Fat with child and talking of twins

So soon Esgred smiled that wicked smile You got your oar in the water quickly

Aye and stroked and stroked and stroked roared the man
