No Your Grace forgive this one her outburst Your slave’s name is Missandei but…

Missandei is no longer a slave I free you from this instant Come ride with me in the litter I wish to talk Rakharo helped them in and Dany drew the curtains shut against the dust and heat If you stay with me you will serve as one of my handmaids she said as they set off I shall keep you by my side to speak for me as you spoke for Kraznys But you may leave my service whenever you choose if you have father or mother you would sooner return to

This one will stay the girl said This one… I… there is no place for me to go This… I will serve you gladly

I can give you freedom but not safety Dany warned I have a world to cross and wars to fight You may go hungry You may grow sick You may be killed

Valar morghulis said Missandei in High Valyrian

All men must die Dany agreed but not for a long while we may pray She leaned back on the pillows and took the girl’s hand Are these Unsullied truly fearless

Yes Your Grace

You serve me now Is it true they feel no pain

The wine of courage kills such feelings By the time they slay their sucklings they have been drinking it for years

And they are obedient

Obedience is all they know If you told them not to breathe they would find that easier than not to obey

Dany nodded And when I am done with them

Your Grace

When I have won my war and claimed the throne that was my father’s my knights will sheathe their swords and return to their keeps to their wives and children and mothers… to their lives But these eunuchs have no lives What am I to do with eight thousand eunuchs when there are no more battles to be fought

The Unsullied make flne guards and excellent watchmen Your Grace said Missandei And it is never hard to find a buyer for such fine well-blooded troops

Men are not bought and sold in Westeros they tell me

With all respect Your Grace Unsullied are not men

If I did resell them how would I know they could not be used against me Dany asked pointedly Would they do that Fight against me even do me harm

If their master commanded They do not question Your Grace All the questions have been culled from them They obey She looked troubled When you are… when you are done with them… your Grace might command them to fall upon their swords

And even that they would do

Yes Missandei’s voice had grown soft Your Grace

Dany squeezed her hand You would sooner I did not ask it of them though Why is that Why do you care

This one does not… I… Your Grace…

Tell me

The girl lowered her eyes Three of them were my brothers once Your Grace

Then I hope your brothers are as brave and clever as you Dany leaned back into her pillow and let the litter bear her onward back to Balerion one last time to set her world in order And back to Drogon Her mouth set grimly

It was a long dark windy night that followed Dany fed her dragons as she always did but found she had no appetite herself She cried awhile alone in her cabin then dried her tears long enough for yet another argument with Groleo Magister Illyrio is not here she finally had to tell him and if he was he could not sway me either I need the Unsullied more than I need these ships and I will hear no more about it
