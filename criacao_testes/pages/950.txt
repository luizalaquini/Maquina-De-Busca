filthy communication out of your mouth

39  Lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with
his deeds
310  And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the
image of him that created him
311  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor
uncircumcision Barbarian Scythian bond nor free but Christ is all and in
all

312  Put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of
mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering
313  Forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a
quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye

314  And above all these things put on charity which is the bond of
perfectness

315  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye
are called in one body and be ye thankful

316  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing
with grace in your hearts to the Lord

317  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him

318  Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the
Lord

319  Husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them

320  Children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing
unto the Lord

321  Fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be
discouraged

322  Servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not
with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God
323  And whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto
men
324  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ

325  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
done and there is no respect of persons

41  Masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing
that ye also have a Master in heaven

42  Continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving
43  Withal praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of
utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds
44  That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak

45  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time

46  Let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may
know how ye ought to answer every man

47  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved
brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord
48  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know
your estate and comfort your hearts
49  With Onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you They
shall make known unto you all things which are done here

410  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and Marcus sisters son
to Barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you
receive him
411  And Jesus which is called Justus who are of the circumcision These
only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God which have been a comfort
unto me

412  Epaphras who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you
always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and
complete in all the will of God

413  For I bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them
that are in Laodicea and them in Hierapolis

414  Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you

415  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea and Nymphas and the
church which is in his house

416  And when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also
in the church of the Laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from
Laodicea

417  And say to Archippus Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the Lord that thou fulfil it

418  The salutation by the hand of me Paul Remember my bonds Grace be
with you Amen
