I hope he falls and shames himself she thought bitterly I hope Ser Balon kills him When Joffrey proclaimed her father’s death it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard’s severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold while Sansa wept and screamed

Morros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward and Ser Balon’s point struck the blazon square Morros dropped his lance fought for balance and lost One foot caught in a stirrup as he fell and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists head bouncing against the ground Joff hooted derision Sansa was appalled wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse they found him bloodied but alive Tommen we picked the wrong foe for you the king told his brother The straw knight jousts better than that one

Next came Ser Horas Redwyne’s turn He fared better than his twin vanquishing an elderly knight whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blue-and-white field Splendid as he looked the old man made a poor contest of it Joffrey curled his lip This is a feeble show

I warned you said the Hound Gnats

The king was growing bored It made Sansa anxious She lowered her eyes and resolved to keep quiet no matter what When Joffrey Baratheon’s mood darkened any chance word might set off one of his rages

Lothor Brune freerider in the service of Lord Baelish cried the herald Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard 

The freerider a small man in dented plate without device duly appeared at the west end of the yard but of his opponent there was no sign Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks but Ser Dontos was not on it The knight appeared a moment later cursing and staggering clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else His legs were pale and skinny and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse The watchers roared and shouted insults Catching his horse by the bridle Ser Dontos tried to mount but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup

By then the crowd was howling with laughter… all but the king Joffrey had a look in his eyes that Sansa remembered well the same look he’d had at the Great Sept of Baelor the day he pronounced death on Lord Eddard Stark Finally Ser Dontos the Red gave it up for a bad job sat down in the dirt and removed his plumed helm I lose he shouted Fetch me some wine

The king stood A cask from the cellars I’ll see him drowned in it

Sansa heard herself gasp No you can’t

Joffrey turned his head What did you say

Sansa could not believe she had spoken Was she mad To tell him no in front of half the court She hadn’t meant to say anything only… Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless but he meant no harm

Did you say I can’t Did you

Please Sansa said I only meant… it would be ill luck Your Grace… to to kill a man on your name day

You’re lying Joffrey said I ought to drown you with him if you care for him so much

I don’t care for him Your Grace The words tumbled out desperately Drown him or have his head off only… kill him on the morrow if you like but please… not today not on your name day I couldn’t bear for you to have ill luck… terrible luck even for kings the singers all say so…

Joffrey scowled He knew she was lying she could see it He would make her bleed for this

The girl speaks truly the Hound rasped What a man sows on his name day he reaps throughout the year His voice was flat as if he did not care a whit whether the king believed him or no Could it be true Sansa had not known It was just something she’d said desperate to avoid punishment

Unhappy Joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at Ser Dontos Take him away I’ll have him killed on the morrow the fool

He is Sansa said A fool You’re so clever to see it He’s better fitted to be a fool than a knight isn’t he You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you He doesn’t deserve the mercy of a quick death

The king studied her a moment Perhaps you’re not so stupid as Mother says He raised his voice Did you hear my lady Dontos From this day on you’re my new fool You can sleep with Moon Boy and dress in motley

Ser Dontos sobered by his near brush with death crawled to his knees Thank you Your Grace And you my lady Thank you

As a brace of Lannister guardsmen led him off the master of revels approached the box Your Grace he said shall I summon a new challenger for Brune or proceed with the next tilt

Neither These are gnats not knights I’d have them all put to death only it’s my name day The tourney is done Get them all out of my sight

The master of revels bowed but Prince Tommen was not so obedient I’m supposed to ride against the straw man

Not today

But I want to ride

I don’t care what you want

Mother said I could ride

She said Princess Myrcella agreed

Mother said mocked the king Don’t be childish

We’re children Myrcella declared haughtily We’re supposed to be childish

The Hound laughed She has you there

Joffrey was beaten Very well Even my brother couldn’t tilt any worse than these others Master bring out the quintain Tommen wants to be a gnat

Tommen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied his chubby little legs pumping hard Luck Sansa called to him

They set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the prince’s pony was being saddled Tommen’s opponent was a child-sized leather warrior stuffed with straw and mounted on a pivot with a shield in one hand and a padded mace in the other Someone had fastened a pair of antlers to the knight’s head Joffrey’s father King Robert had worn antlers on his helm Sansa remembered… but so did his uncle Lord Renly Robert’s brother who had turned traitor and crowned himself king

A pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silver-and-crimson armor A tall plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm and the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon frolicked together on his shield The squires helped him mount and Ser Aron Santagar the Red Keep’s master-at-arms stepped forward and handed Tommen a blunted silver longsword with a leaf-shaped blade crafted to fit an eight-year-old hand

Tommen raised the blade high Casterly Rock he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put his heels into his pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles started a ragged cheer and Sansa added her voice to theirs The king brooded in silence

Tommen got his pony up to a brisk trot waved his sword vigorously and struck the knight’s shield a solid blow as he went by The quintain spun the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of his head Tommen spilled from the saddle his new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as he hit the ground His sword went flying his pony cantered away across the bailey and a great gale of derision went up King Joffrey laughed longest and loudest of all

Oh Princess Myrcella cried She scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother

Sansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage You should go with her she told the king Your brother might be hurt

Joffrey shrugged What if he is

You should help him up and tell him how well he rode Sansa could not seem to stop herself

He got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt the king pointed out That’s not riding well

Look the Hound interrupted The boy has courage He’s going to try again

They were helping Prince Tommen mount his pony If only Tommen were the elder instead of Joffrey Sansa thought I wouldn’t mind marrying Tommen

The sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise Chains rattled as the portcullis was drawn upward and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges Who told them to open the gate Joff demanded With the troubles in the city the gates of the Red Keep had been closed for days

A column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter of hooves Clegane stepped close to the king one hand on the hilt of his longsword The visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty yet the standard they carried was the lion of Lannister golden on its crimson field A few wore the red cloaks and mail of Lannister men-at-arms but more were freeriders and sellswords armored in oddments and bristling with sharp steel… and there were others monstrous savages out of one of Old Nan’s tales the scary ones Bran used to love They were clad in shabby skins and boiled leather with long hair and fierce beards Some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or wrapped around their hands and others were missing eyes ears and fingers

In their midst riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front was the queen’s dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister the one they called the Imp He had let his beard grow to cover his pushed-in face until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair coarse as wire Down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak black fur striped with white He held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he had visited Winterfell With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes he was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon

Yet Tommen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard shouting with glee One of the savages a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers scooped the boy out of his saddle armor and all and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle Tommen’s breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion clapped him on the backplate and Sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height Myrcella came running after her brother and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun her in a circle squealing
