He will forgive me she told herself I am his liege Dany found herself wondering whether he was right about Daario She felt very lonely all of a sudden Mirri Maz Duur had promised that she would never bear a living child House Targaryen will end with me That made her sad You must be my children she told the dragons my three fierce children Arstan says dragons live longer than men so you will go on after I am dead

Drogon looped his neck around to nip at her hand His teeth were very sharp but he never broke her skin when they played like this Dany laughed and rolled him back and forth until he roared his tail lashing like a whip It is longer than it was she saw and tomorrow it will be longer still They grow quickly now and when they are grown I shall have my wings Mounted on a dragon she could lead her own men into battle as she had in Astapor but as yet they were still too small to bear her weight

A stillness settled over her camp when midnight came and went Dany remained in her pavilion with her maids while Arstan Whitebeard and Strong Belwas kept the guard The waiting is the hardest part To sit in her tent with idle hands while her battle was being fought without her made Dany feel half a child again

The hours crept by on turtle feet Even after Jhiqui rubbed the knots from her shoulders Dany was too restless for sleep Missandei offered to sing her a lullaby of the Peaceful People but Dany shook her head Bring me Arstan she said

When the old man came she was curled up inside her hrakkar pelt whose musty smell still reminded her of Drogo I cannot sleep when men are dying for me Whitebeard she said Tell me more of my brother Rhaegar if you would I liked the tale you told me on the ship of how he decided that he must be a warrior

Your Grace is kind to say so

Viserys said that our brother won many tourneys

Arstan bowed his white head respectfully It is not meet for me to deny His Grace’s words…

But said Dany sharply Tell me I command it

Prince Rhaegar’s prowess was unquestioned but he seldom entered the lists He never loved the song of swords the way that Robert did or Jaime Lannister It was something he had to do a task the world had set him He did it well for he did everything well That was his nature But he took no joy in it Men said that he loved his harp much better than his lance

He won some tourneys surely said Dany disappointed

When he was young His Grace rode brilliantly in a tourney at Storm’s End defeating Lord Steffon Baratheon Lord Jason Mallister the Red Viper of Dorne and a mystery knight who proved to be the infamous Simon Toyne chief of the kingswood outlaws He broke twelve lances against Ser Arthur Dayne that day

Was he the champion then

No Your Grace That honor went to another knight of the Kingsguard who unhorsed Prince Rhaegar in the final tilt

Dany did not want to hear about Rhaegar being unhorsed But what tourneys did my brother win

Your Grace The old man hesitated He won the greatest tourney of them all

Which was that Dany demanded

The tourney Lord Whent staged at Harrenhal beside the Gods Eye in the year of the false spring A notable event Besides the jousting there was a mêlée in the old style fought between seven teams of knights as well as archery and axe-throwing a horse race a tournament of singers a mummer show and many feasts and frolics Lord Whent was as open handed as he was rich The lavish purses he proclaimed drew hundreds of challengers Even your royal father came to Harrenhal when he had not left the Red Keep for long years The greatest lords and mightiest champions of the Seven Kingdoms rode in that tourney and the Prince of Dragonstone bested them all

But that was the tourney when he crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty said Dany Princess Elia was there his wife and yet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl and later stole her away from her betrothed How could he do that Did the Dornish woman treat him so ill

It is not for such as me to say what might have been in your brother’s heart Your Grace The Princess Elia was a good and gracious lady though her health was ever delicate

Dany pulled the lion pelt tighter about her shoulders Viserys said once that it was my fault for being born too late She had denied it hotly she remembered going so far as to tell Viserys that it was his fault for not being born a girl He beat her cruelly for that insolence If I had been born more timely he said Rhaegar would have married me instead of Elia and it would all have come out different If Rhaegar had been happy in his wife he would not have needed the Stark girl

Perhaps so Your Grace Whitebeard paused a moment But I am not certain it was in Rhaegar to be happy

You make him sound so sour Dany protested

Not sour no but… there was a melancholy to Prince Rhaegar a sense… The old man hesitated again

Say it she urged A sense…

…of doom He was born in grief my queen and that shadow hung over him all his days

Viserys had spoken of Rhaegar’s birth only once Perhaps the tale saddened him too much It was the shadow of Summerhall that haunted him was it not
