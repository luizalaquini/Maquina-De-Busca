77 Howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men

78 For laying aside the commandment of God ye hold the tradition of
men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things
ye do

79 And he said unto them Full well ye reject the commandment of God
that ye may keep your own tradition

710 For Moses said Honour thy father and thy mother and Whoso
curseth father or mother let him die the death 711 But ye say If a
man shall say to his father or mother It is Corban that is to say a
gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free

712 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mother 713 Making the word of God of none effect through your
tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye

714 And when he had called all the people unto him he said unto
them Hearken unto me every one of you and understand 715 There is
nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but
the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man

716 If any man have ears to hear let him hear

717 And when he was entered into the house from the people his
disciples asked him concerning the parable

718 And he saith unto them Are ye so without understanding also Do
ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the
man it cannot defile him 719 Because it entereth not into his
heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all
meats  720 And he said That which cometh out of the man that
defileth the man

721 For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts
adulteries fornications murders 722 Thefts covetousness
wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride
foolishness 723 All these evil things come from within and defile
the man

724 And from thence he arose and went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but
he could not be hid

725 For a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit
heard of him and came and fell at his feet 726 The woman was a
Greek a Syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would
cast forth the devil out of her daughter

727 But Jesus said unto her Let the children first be filled for it
is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the
dogs

728 And she answered and said unto him Yes Lord yet the dogs under
the table eat of the childrens crumbs

729 And he said unto her For this saying go thy way the devil is
gone out of thy daughter

730 And when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out
and her daughter laid upon the bed

731 And again departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon he came
unto the sea of Galilee through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis

732 And they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment
in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him

733 And he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers
into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue 734 And looking
up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him Ephphatha that is Be
opened

735 And straightway his ears were opened and the string of his
tongue was loosed and he spake plain

736 And he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he
charged them so much the more a great deal they published it 737
And were beyond measure astonished saying He hath done all things
well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak

81 In those days the multitude being very great and having nothing
to eat Jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them 82
I have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me
three days and have nothing to eat 83 And if I send them away
fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of
them came from far

84 And his disciples answered him From whence can a man satisfy
these men with bread here in the wilderness  85 And he asked them
How many loaves have ye And they said Seven

86 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took
the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his
disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people

87 And they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to
set them also before them
