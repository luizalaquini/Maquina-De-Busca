sort of considerations apply to choosing a window for linear
prediction
pp
This is known as the
ul
autocorrelation method
of computing prediction parameters  Typically a window of
100 to 250 samples is used for analysis of one frame of speech
rh Algorithm for the autocorrelation method
The algorithm for obtaining linear prediction coefficients
by the autocorrelation method is quite simple  It is
straightforward to compute the matrix coefficients
Rm from the speech samples and window coefficients
The Durbin-Levinson method of solving matrix equations operates
directly on this R-vector to produce the coefficient vector a sub k
The complete procedure is given as Procedure 61 and is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 65
