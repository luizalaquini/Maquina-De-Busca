The main difference between these two transforms is that the range of integration
begins at -infinity for the Fourier transform and at 0 for the Laplace
Advocates of the Fourier transform which typically include people involved with
telecommunications enjoy the freedom from initial conditions which is bestowed
by an origin way back in the mists of time  Advocates of Laplace including
most analogue filter theorists invariably
consider systems where all is quiet before t=0 em altering the origin
of measurement of time to achieve this if necessary em and welcome the opportunity
to include initial conditions explicitly

without
having to worry about what happens in the mists of time
Although there is a two-sided Laplace transform where the integration begins
at -infinity it is not generally used because it causes some convergence
complications  Ignoring this difference between the transforms by considering
signals which are zero when t0 the Fourier spectrum can be found from the
Laplace transform by writing  s=j2 pi f that is by considering values
of s which lie on the imaginary axis

The z-transform is

depending on whether a one-sided or two-sided transform is used  The advantages
and disadvantages of one- and two-sided transforms are the same as in the
analogue case
z plays the role of e sup sT  and so it is not surprising that the response

The above relation between z and f means that real-valued frequencies correspond
to points where |z|=1 that is the unit circle in the complex z-plane
As you travel anticlockwise around this unit circle starting from the
point z=1 the corresponding frequency increases from 0 to 12T half-way
round z=-1 to 1T when you get back to the beginning z=1 again
Frequencies greater than the sampling frequency are aliased back into the
sampling band corresponding to further circuits of |z|=1 with frequency
going from 1T to 2T 2T to 3T and so on  In fact this is the circle
of Figure 33 which was used earlier to explain how sampling affects the frequency
spectrum

Let us return from this brief digression into techniques of digital signal
analysis to the problem of determining the frequency spectrum of speech
Although a bank of bandpass filters such as is used in the channel vocoder
is the perhaps most straightforward way to obtain a frequency spectrum
there are other techniques which are in fact more commonly used in digital speech
processing

It is possible to define the Fourier transform of a discrete sequence of
points  To motivate the definition consider first the
ordinary Fourier transform FT which is
LB

gt  = 
integral from - infinity to infinity Gfe sup +j2 pi ft df

Gf  = 
integral from - infinity to infinity gte sup -j2 pi ft dt 

LE
This takes a continuous time domain into a continuous frequency domain
Sometimes you see a normalizing factor 12 pi multiplying the integral in
either the forward or the reverse transform  This is only needed
when the frequency variable is expressed in radianss and we will find it
more convenient to express frequencies in Hz
pp
The Fourier series FS which should also be familiar to you
operates on a periodic time waveform or equivalently
one that only exists for a finite period of time which is notionally extended
periodically  If a period lies in the time range 0b then the transform is
LB

gt  = 
sum from r = - infinity to infinity Gre sup +j2 pi rtb

Gr  =  1 over b  integral from 0 to b gte sup -j2 pi rtb dt

The Fourier series takes a periodic time-domain function into a discrete frequency-domain one
Because of the basic duality between the time and frequency domains in the
Fourier transforms it is not surprising that another version of the transform
can be defined which takes a periodic
