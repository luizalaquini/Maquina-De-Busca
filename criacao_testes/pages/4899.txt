the law for her that hath born a male or a female

128 And if she be not able to bring a lamb then she shall bring two
turtles or two young pigeons the one for the burnt offering and the
other for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
her and she shall be clean

131 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron saying 132 When a man
shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising a scab or bright spot
and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy then he
shall be brought unto Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the
priests 133 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of
the flesh and when the hair in the plague is turned white and the
plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh it is a plague
of leprosy and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him
unclean

134 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh and in
sight be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof be not turned
white then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven
days 135 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day and
behold if the plague in his sight be at a stay and the plague spread
not in the skin then the priest shall shut him up seven days more
136 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and
behold if the plague be somewhat dark and the plague spread not in
the skin the priest shall pronounce him clean it is but a scab and
he shall wash his clothes and be clean

137 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing he shall be seen of
the priest again

138 And if the priest see that behold the scab spreadeth in the
skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a leprosy

139 When the plague of leprosy is in a man then he shall be brought
unto the priest 1310 And the priest shall see him and behold if
the rising be white in the skin and it have turned the hair white
and there be quick raw flesh in the rising 1311 It is an old leprosy
in the skin of his flesh and the priest shall pronounce him unclean
and shall not shut him up for he is unclean

1312 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin and the leprosy
cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to
his foot wheresoever the priest looketh 1313 Then the priest shall
consider and behold if the leprosy have covered all his flesh he
shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague it is all turned
white he is clean

1314 But when raw flesh appeareth in him he shall be unclean

1315 And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be
unclean for the raw flesh is unclean it is a leprosy

1316 Or if the raw flesh turn again and be changed unto white he
shall come unto the priest 1317 And the priest shall see him and
behold if the plague be turned into white then the priest shall
pronounce him clean that hath the plague he is clean

1318 The flesh also in which even in the skin thereof was a boil
and is healed 1319 And in the place of the boil there be a white
rising or a bright spot white and somewhat reddish and it be
shewed to the priest 1320 And if when the priest seeth it behold
it be in sight lower than the skin and the hair thereof be turned
white the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a plague of
leprosy broken out of the boil

1321 But if the priest look on it and behold there be no white
hairs therein and if it be not lower than the skin but be somewhat
dark then the priest shall shut him up seven days 1322 And if it
spread much abroad in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean it is a plague

1323 But if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not it is
a burning boil and the priest shall pronounce him clean

1324 Or if there be any flesh in the skin whereof there is a hot
burning and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot
somewhat reddish or white 1325 Then the priest shall look upon it
and behold if the hair in the bright spot be turned white and it be
in sight deeper than the skin it is a leprosy broken out of the
burning wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is the
plague of leprosy

1326 But if the priest look on it and behold there be no white
hair in the bright spot and it be no lower than the other skin but
be somewhat dark then the priest shall shut him up seven days 1327
And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day and if it be
spread much abroad in the skin then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean it is the plague of leprosy

1328 And if the bright spot stay in his place and spread not in the
skin but it be somewhat dark it is a rising of the burning and the
priest shall pronounce him clean for it is an inflammation of the
burning

1329 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard
1330 Then the priest shall see the plague and behold if it be in
sight deeper than the skin and there be in it a yellow thin hair
then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is a dry scall even a
