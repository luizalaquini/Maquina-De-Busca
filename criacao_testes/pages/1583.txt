his phone call with the president The first thing he does is
instruct Soldier Jackson his second in command to set up
a two-person round-the-clock guard on Peeta Then he
takes me on a walk weaving through the sprawling tent
encampment until our squad is far behind us
Hell try and kill me anyway I say Especially here
Where there are so many bad memories to set him off
Ill keep him contained Katniss says Boggs
Why does Coin want me dead now I ask
She denies she does he answers
But we know its true I say And you must at least
have a theory
Boggs gives me a long hard look before he answers
Heres as much as I know The president doesnt like you
She never did It was Peeta she wanted rescued from the
arena but no one else agreed It made matters worse when
you forced her to give the other victors immunity But even
that could be overlooked in view of how well youve
performed
Then what is it I insist
Sometime in the near future this war will be resolved
A new leader will be chosen says Boggs
I roll my eyes Boggs no one thinks Im going to be
the leader
No They dont he agrees But youll throw support to
someone Would it be President Coin Or someone else
I dont know Ive never thought about it I say
If your immediate answer isnt Coin then youre a
threat Youre the face of the rebellion You may have more
influence than any other single person says Boggs
Outwardly the most youve ever done is tolerated her
So shell kill me to shut me up The minute I say the
words I know theyre true
She doesnt need you as a rallying point now As she
said your primary objective to unite the districts has
succeeded Boggs reminds me These current propos
could be done without you Theres only one last thing you
could do to add fire to the rebellion
Die I say quietly
Yes Give us a martyr to fight for says Boggs But
thats not going to happen under my watch Soldier
Everdeen Im planning for you to have a long life
Why This kind of thinking will only bring him trouble
You dont owe me anything
Because youve earned it he says Now get back to
your squad
I know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking his
neck out for me but really Im just frustrated I mean how
can I steal his Holo and desert now Betraying him was
complicated enough without this whole new layer of debt I
already owe him for saving my life
Seeing the cause of my current dilemma calmly
pitching his tent back at our site makes me furious What
time is my watch I ask Jackson
She squints at me in doubt or maybe shes just trying
to get my face in focus I didnt put you in the rotation
Why not I ask
Im not sure you could really shoot Peeta if it came to
it she says
I speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly I
wouldnt be shooting Peeta Hes gone Johannas right Itd
be just like shooting another of the Capitols mutts It feels
good to say something horrible about him out loud in
public after all the humiliation Ive felt since his return
Well that sort of comment isnt recommending you
either says Jackson
Put her in the rotation I hear Boggs say behind me
Jackson shakes her head and makes a note
Midnight to four Youre on with me
The dinner whistle sounds and Gale and I line up at
the canteen Do you want me to kill him he asks bluntly
Thatll get us both sent back for sure I say But even
though Im furious the brutality of the offer rattles me I can
deal with him
You mean until you take off You and your paper map
and possibly a Holo if you can get your hands on it So
Gale has not missed my preparations I hope they havent
been so obvious to the others None of them know my mind
like he does though Youre not planning on leaving me
behind are you he asks
Up until this point I was But having my hunting partner
to watch my back doesnt sound like a bad idea As your
fellow soldier I have to strongly recommend you stay with
your squad But I cant stop you from coming can I
He grins No Not unless you want me to alert the rest
of the army
Squad 451 and the television crew collect dinner from
the canteen and gather in a tense circle to eat At first I think
that Peeta is the cause of the unease but by the end of the
meal I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have been
directed my way This is a quick turnaround since Im pretty
sure when Peeta appeared the whole team was concerned
about how dangerous he might be especially to me But its
not until I get a phone call through to Haymitch that I
understand
What are you trying to do Provoke him into an
attack he asks me
Of course not I just want him to leave me alone I say
Well he cant Not after what the Capitol put him
through says Haymitch Look Coin may have sent him
