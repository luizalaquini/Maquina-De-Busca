My sword is Valyrian steel The Old Bear gave it to me

Do you remember the words of your vow

Yes They were not words a man was like to forget Once said they could never be unsaid They changed your life forever

Say them again with me Jon Snow

If you like Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness Night gathers and now my watch begins It shall not end until my death I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children I shall wear no crowns and win no glory I shall live and die at my post I am the sword in the darkness I am the watcher on the walls I am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers the shield that guards the realms of men I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch for this night and all the nights to come

When they were done there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers holding tight to the words in his mind praying that his father’s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came It would not be long now The garrons were near the end of their strength Qhorin’s mount would not last another day Jon suspected

The flames were burning low by then the warmth fading The fire will soon go out Qhorin said but if the Wall should ever fall all the fires will go out

There was nothing Jon could say to that He nodded

We may escape them yet the ranger said Or not

I’m not afraid to die It was only half a lie

It may not be so easy as that Jon

He did not understand What do you mean

If we are taken you must yield

Yield He blinked in disbelief The wildlings did not make captives of the men they called the crows They killed them except for…They only spare oathbreakers Those who join them like Mance Rayder

And you

No He shook his head Never I won’t

You will I command it of you

Command it But…

Our honor means no more than our lives so long as the realm is safe Are you a man of the Night’s Watch

Yes but—

There is no but Jon Snow You are or you are not

Jon sat up straight I am

Then hear me If we are taken you will go over to them as the wildling girl you captured once urged you They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons that you swear them an oath on your father’s grave that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander You must not balk whatever is asked of you Do as they bid you… but in your heart remember who and what you are Ride with them eat with them fight with them for as long as it takes And watch

For what Jon asked

Would that I knew said Qhorin Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the Milkwater What did they seek in such a bleak and distant place Did they find it That is what you must learn before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers That is the duty I lay on you Jon Snow

I’ll do as you say Jon said reluctantly but… you will tell them won’t you The Old Bear at least You’ll tell him that I never broke my oath

Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire his eyes lost in pools of shadow When I see him next I swear it He gestured at the fire More wood I want it bright and hot

Jon went to cut more branches snapping each one in two before tossing it into the flames The tree had been dead a long time but it seemed to live again in the fire as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow red and orange

Enough Qhorin said abruptly Now we ride

Ride It was dark beyond the fire and the night was cold Ride where

Back Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time The fire will draw them past I hope Come brother

Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire The sun was long gone and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them He did not know what Qhorin had in mind but perhaps it was a chance He hoped so I do not want to play the oathbreaker even for good reason

They went cautiously moving as silent as man and horse could move retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains Jon remembered the place They had watered the horses here before the sun went down

The water’s icing up Qhorin observed as he turned aside else we’d ride in the streambed But if we break the ice they are like to see Keep close to the cliffs There’s a crook a half mile on that will hide us He rode into the defile Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire and followed

The farther in they went the closer the cliffs pressed to either side They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source Icicles bearded its stony banks but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust

A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up where a section of the cliff face had fallen but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through Beyond the walls pinched in sharply and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall The air was full of mist like the breath of some vast cold beast The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight Jon looked about in dismay There is no way out He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs but not with the horses He did not think they would last long afoot

Quickly now the Halfhand commanded The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones right into the curtain of water and vanished When he did not reappear Jon put his heels into his horse and went after His garron did his best to shy away The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon’s breath

Then he was through drenched and shivering but through

The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass but beyond the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush shook droplets from his fur sniffed at the darkness suspiciously then lifted a leg against one rocky wall Qhorin had already dismounted Jon did the same You knew this place was here

When I was no older than you I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls He unsaddled his horse removed her bit and bridle and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane There is a way through the heart of the mountain Come dawn if they have not found us we will press on The first watch is mine brother Qhorin seated himself on the sand his back to a wall no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave Over the rush of falling waters Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword

He took off his wet cloak but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep Jon was grateful for his warmth He wondered if the fire was still burning outside or if it had gone out by now If the Wall should ever fall all the fires will go out The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand but after a time that too faded and went dark

Sleep came at last and with it nightmares He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves It was still dark when Qhorin woke him While the Halfhand slept Jon sat with his back to the cave wall listening to the water and waiting for the dawn

At break of day they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat then saddled their garrons once again and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark holding the pale flame up before him Jon followed with the horses The stony path twisted and turned first down then up then down more steeply In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through By the time we come out we will have lost them he told himself as they went Not even an eagle can see through solid stone We will have lost them and we will ride hard for the Fist and tell the Old Bear all we know

But when they emerged back into the light long hours later the eagle was waiting for them perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air

Qhorin’s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes

Here is as good a place as any to make a stand he declared The mouth of the cave shelters us from above and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain Is your sword sharp Jon Snow

Yes he said

We’ll feed the horses They’ve served us bravely poor beasts

Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers I am the shield that guards the realms of men

A hunting horn echoed through the mountains and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds They will be with us soon announced Qhorin Keep your wolf in hand
