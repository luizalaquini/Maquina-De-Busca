I see he’s a dwarf said Prince Oberyn The day I fear a dwarf’s wrath is the day I drown myself in a cask of red

We need no fetters Lord Tywin glanced at the windows and rose The hour grows late We shall resume on the morrow

That night alone in his tower cell with a blank parchment and a cup of wine Tyrion found himself thinking of his wife Not Sansa his first wife Tysha The whore wife not the wolf wife Her love for him had been pretense and yet he had believed and found joy in that belief Give me sweet lies and keep your bitter truths He drank his wine and thought of Shae Later when Ser Kevan paid his nightly visit Tyrion asked for Varys

You believe the eunuch will speak in your defense

I won’t know until I have talked with him Send him here Uncle if you would be so good

As you wish

Maesters Ballabar and Frenken opened the second day of trial They had opened King Joffrey’s noble corpse as well they swore and found no morsel of pigeon pie nor any other food lodged in the royal throat It was poison that killed him my lords said Ballabar as Frenken nodded gravely

Then they brought forth Grand Maester Pycelle leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as he walked a few white hairs sprouting from his long chicken’s neck He had grown too frail to stand so the judges permitted a chair to be brought in for him and a table as well On the table were laid a number of small jars Pycelle was pleased to put a name to each

Greycap he said in a quavery voice from the toadstool Nightshade sweetsleep demon’s dance This is blindeye Widow’s blood this one is called for the color A cruel potion It shuts down a man’s bladder and bowels until he drowns in his own poisons This wolfsbane here basilisk venom and this one the tears of Lys Yes I know them all The Imp Tyrion Lannister stole them from my chambers when he had me falsely imprisoned

Pycelle Tyrion called out risking his father’s wrath could any of these poisons choke off a man’s breath

No For that you must turn to a rarer poison When I was a boy at the Citadel my teachers named it simply the strangler

But this rare poison was not found was it

No my lord Pycelle blinked at him You used it all to kill the noblest child the gods ever put on this good earth

Tyrion’s anger overwhelmed his sense Joffrey was cruel and stupid but I did not kill him Have my head off if you like I had no hand in my nephew’s death

Silence Lord Tywin said I have told you thrice The next time you shall be gagged and chained

After Pycelle came the procession endless and wearisome Lords and ladies and noble knights highborn and humble alike they had all been present at the wedding feast had all seen Joffrey choke his face turning as black as a Dornish plum Lord Redwyne Lord Celtigar and Ser Flement Brax had heard Tyrion threaten the king two serving men a juggler Lord Gyles Ser Hobber Redwyne and Ser Philip Foote had observed him fill the wedding chalice Lady Merryweather swore that she had seen the dwarf drop something into the king’s wine while Joff and Margaery were cutting the pie old Estermont young Peckledon the singer Galyeon of Cuy and the squires Morros and Jothos Slynt told how Tyrion had picked up the chalice as Joff was dying and poured out the last of the poisoned wine onto the floor

When did I make so many enemies Lady Merryweather was all but a stranger Tyrion wondered if she was blind or bought At least Galyeon of Cuy had not set his account to music or else there might have been seventy-seven bloody verses to it

When his uncle called that night after supper his manner was cold and distant He thinks I did it too Do you have witnesses for us Ser Kevan asked him

Not as such no Unless you’ve found my wife

His uncle shook his head It would seem the trial is going very badly for you

Oh do you think so I hadn’t noticed Tyrion fingered his scar Varys has not come

Nor will he On the morrow he testifies against you

Lovely I see He shifted in his seat I am curious You were always a fair man Uncle What convinced you

Why steal Pycelle’s poisons if not to use them Ser Kevan said bluntly And Lady Merryweather saw—

—nothing There was nothing to see But how do I prove that How do I prove anything penned up here

Perhaps the time has come for you to confess

Even through the thick stone walls of the Red Keep Tyrion could hear the steady wash of rain Say that again Uncle I could swear you urged me to confess

If you were to admit your guilt before the throne and repent of your crime your father would withhold the sword You would be permitted to take the black

Tyrion laughed in his face Those were the same terms Cersei offered Eddard Stark We all know how that ended

Your father had no part in that

That much was true at least Castle Black teems with murderers thieves and rapists Tyrion said but I don’t recall meeting many regicides while I was there You expect me to believe that if I admit to being a kinslayer and kingslayer my father will simply nod forgive me and pack me off to the Wall with some warm woolen smallclothes He hooted rudely

Naught was said of forgiveness Ser Kevan said sternly A confession would put this matter to rest It is for that reason your father sends me with this offer

Thank him kindly for me Uncle said Tyrion but tell him I am not presently in a confessing mood

Were I you I’d change my mood Your sister wants your head and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to give it to her

So one of my judges has already condemned me without hearing a word in my defense It was no more than he expected Will I still be allowed to speak and present witnesses

You have no witnesses his uncle reminded him Tyrion if you are guilty of this enormity the Wall is a kinder fate than you deserve And if you are blameless    there is fighting in the north I know but even so it will be a safer place for you than King’s Landing whatever the outcome of this trial The mob is convinced of your guilt Were you so foolish as to venture out into the streets they would tear you limb from limb

I can see how much that prospect upsets you

You are my brother’s son

You might remind him of that

Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you were not his own blood and Joanna’s Tywin seems a hard man to you I know but he is no harder than he’s had to be Our own father was gentle and amiable but so weak his bannermen mocked him in their cups Some saw fit to defy him openly Other lords borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay it At court they japed of toothless lions Even his mistress stole from him A woman scarcely one step above a whore and she helped herself to my mother’s jewels It fell to Tywin to restore House Lannister to its proper place Just as it fell to him to rule this realm when he was no more than twenty He bore that heavy burden for twenty years and all it earned him was a mad king’s envy Instead of the honor he deserved he was made to suffer slights beyond count yet he gave the Seven Kingdoms peace plenty and justice He is a just man You would be wise to trust him

Tyrion blinked in astonishment Ser Kevan had always been solid stolid pragmatic he had never heard him speak with such fervor before You love him

He is my brother

I    I will think on what you’ve said

Think carefully then And quickly

He thought of little else that night but come morning was no closer to deciding if his father could be trusted A servant brought him porridge and honey to break his fast but all he could taste was bile at the thought of confession They will call me kinslayer till the end of my days For a thousand years or more if I am remembered at all it will be as the monstrous dwarf who poisoned his young nephew at his wedding feast The thought made him so bloody angry that he flung the bowl and spoon across the room and left a smear of porridge on the wall Ser Addam Marbrand looked at it curiously when he came to escort Tyrion to trial but had the good grace not to inquire

Lord Varys the herald said master of whisperers

Powdered primped and smelling of rosewater the Spider rubbed his hands one over the other all the time he spoke Washing my life away Tyrion thought as he listened to the eunuch’s mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the Hound’s protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tommen as king Half-truths are worth more than outright lies And unlike the others Varys had documents parchments painstakingly filled with notes details dates whole conversations So much material that its recitation took all day and so much of it damning Varys confirmed Tyrion’s midnight visit to Grand Maester Pycelle’s chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions confirmed the threat he’d made to Cersei the night of their supper confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself When Prince Oberyn asked him how he could possibly know all this not having been present at any of these events the eunuch only giggled and said My little birds told me Knowing is their purpose and mine

How do I question a little bird thought Tyrion I should have had the eunuch’s head off my first day in King’s Landing Damn him And damn me for whatever trust I put in him

Have we heard it all Lord Tywin asked his daughter as Varys left the hall

Almost said Cersei I beg your leave to bring one final witness before you on the morrow
