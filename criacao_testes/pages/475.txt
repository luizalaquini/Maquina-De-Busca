The eunuch sighed You are sorry but you do not believe me No my lord no need to apologize I was drugged and in pain and it was a very long time ago and far across the sea No doubt I dreamed that voice I’ve told myself as much a thousand times

I believe in steel swords gold coins and men’s wits said Tyrion And I believe there once were dragons I’ve seen their skulls after all

Let us hope that is the worst thing you ever see my lord

On that we agree Tyrion smiled And for Ser Cortnay’s death well we know Stannis hired sellsails from the Free Cities Perhaps he bought himself a skilled assassin as well

A very skilled assassin

There are such I used to dream that one day I’d be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister

Regardless of how Ser Cortnay died said Varys he is dead the castle fallen Stannis is free to march

Any chance we might convince the Dornishmen to descend on the Marches asked Tyrion

None

A pity Well the threat may serve to keep the Marcher lords close to their castles at least What news of my father

If Lord Tywin has won across the Red Fork no word has reached me yet If he does not hasten he may be trapped between his foes The Oakheart leaf and the Rowan tree have been seen north of the Mander

No word from Littlefinger

Perhaps he never reached Bitterbridge Or perhaps he’s died there Lord Tarly has seized Renly’s stores and put a great many to the sword Florents chiefly Lord Caswell has shut himself up in his castle

Tyrion threw back his head and laughed

Varys reined up nonplussed My lord

Don’t you see the jest Lord Varys Tyrion waved a hand at the shuttered windows at all the sleeping city Storm’s End is fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and the gods alone know what dark powers and the good folk don’t have Jaime to protect them nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor their precious Knight of Flowers Only me the one they hate He laughed again The dwarf the evil counselor the twisted little monkey demon I’m all that stands between them and chaos





CATELYN

Tell Father I have gone to make him proud Her brother swung up into his saddle every inch the lord in his bright mail and flowing mud-and-water cloak A silver trout ornamented the crest of his greathelm twin to the one painted on his shield

He was always proud of you Edmure And he loves you fiercely Believe that

I mean to give him better reason than mere birth He wheeled his warhorse about and raised a hand Trumpets sounded a drum began to boom the drawbridge descended in fits and starts and Ser Edmure Tully led his men out from Riverrun with lances raised and banners streaming

I have a greater host than yours brother Catelyn thought as she watched them go A host of doubts and fears

Beside her Brienne’s misery was almost palpable Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to her measure handsome gowns to suit her birth and sex yet still she preferred to dress in oddments of mail and boiled leather a swordbelt cinched around her waist She would have been happier riding to war with Edmure no doubt but even walls as strong as Riverrun’s required swords to hold them Her brother had taken every able-bodied man for the fords leaving Ser Desmond Grell to command a garrison made up of the wounded the old and the sick along with a few squires and some untrained peasant boys still shy of manhood This to defend a castle crammed full of women and children

When the last of Edmure’s foot had shuffled under the portcullis Brienne asked What shall we do now my lady

Our duty Catelyn’s face was drawn as she started across the yard I have always done my duty she thought Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all his children Her two older brothers had both died in infancy so she had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born Then her mother had died and her father had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now and she had done that too And when Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark she had thanked him for making her such a splendid match

I gave Brandon my favor to wear and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother I did so gladly though I never saw Ned’s face until our wedding day I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent him off to his war and his king and the woman who bore him his bastard because I always did my duty
