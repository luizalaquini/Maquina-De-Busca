3611 Let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand
of the wicked remove me

3612 There are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down
and shall not be able to rise



371 Fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity

372 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the
green herb

373 Trust in the LORD and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land
and verily thou shalt be fed

374 Delight thyself also in the LORD and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart

375 Commit thy way unto the LORD trust also in him and he shall
bring it to pass

376 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy
judgment as the noonday

377 Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for him fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass

378 Cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise
to do evil

379 For evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the
LORD they shall inherit the earth

3710 For yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou
shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be

3711 But the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace

3712 The wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with
his teeth

3713 The LORD shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is
coming

3714 The wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to
cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright
conversation

3715 Their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows
shall be broken

3716 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked

3717 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the LORD
upholdeth the righteous

3718 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance
shall be for ever

3719 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of
famine they shall be satisfied

3720 But the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the LORD shall
be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they
consume away

3721 The wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous
sheweth mercy and giveth

3722 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they
that be cursed of him shall be cut off

3723 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD and he
delighteth in his way

3724 Though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the LORD
upholdeth him with his hand

3725 I have been young and now am old yet have I not seen the
righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread

3726 He is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed

3727 Depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore

3728 For the LORD loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they
are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off

3729 The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for
ever

3730 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue
talketh of judgment

3731 The law of his God is in his heart none of his steps shall
