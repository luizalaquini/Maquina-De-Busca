which has solution  f=045T
Thus a pseudo-random shift register generates
noise whose spectrum is substantially flat up to half the clock frequency
Anything over 10 kHz is therefore a suitable clocking rate for speech-quality
noise  Choose 20 kHz to err on the conservative side  If the repetition occurs
in less than 3 or 4 seconds it can be heard quite clearly but above this figure
it is not noticeable  An 18-bit shift register clocked at 20 kHz repeats
every  2 sup 18 -120000  =  13 seconds which is more than adequate
sh 53  Simulating vocal tract resonances
pp
The vocal tract from glottis to lips can be modelled as an unconstricted
tube of varying cross-section with no side branches and no sub-glottal coupling
This has an all-pole transfer function which can be written in the form
LB
EQ
Hs  = 
w sub 1 sup 2 over s sup 2 + b sub 1 s + w sub 1 sup 2
w sub 2 sup 2 over s sup 2 + b sub 2 s + w sub 2 sup 2    
EN
LE
There is an unspecified conceptually infinite number of terms in the
product  Each of them produces a peak in the energy spectrum
and these are the formants we observed in Chapter 2
pp
Formants appear even in an over-simplified
model of the tract as a tube of uniform cross-section with a sound source
at one end the larynx and open at the other the lips
This extremely crude model was discussed in Chapter 2 and surprisingly
perhaps it gives a good approximation to the observed formant frequencies
for a neutral relaxed vowel such as that in
ul
ac
bove
pp
Speech is made by varying the postures of the various organs of the vocal tract
Different vowels for example result largely from different tongue positions
and lip postures  Naturally such physical changes alter the frequencies of the
resonances and successful automatic speech synthesis depends upon
successful movement of the formants  Fortunately only the first three or
four resonances need to be altered even for extremely realistic synthesis and
virtually all existing synthesizers provide control over these formants only
rh Analysis of a single formant
Each formant is modelled as a second-order resonance with transfer function
LB

Hs  =  w sub c sup 2 over s sup 2 + b s + w sub c sup 2  
EN
LE
As will be shown below w sub c is the nominal resonant frequency in
radianss and b is the
approximate 3 dB bandwidth of the resonance  The term w sub c sup 2 in the
numerator adjusts the gain to be unity at DC s=0
pp
To calculate the frequency response of the formant write  s=jw  Then the
energy spectrum is

|Hjw| sup 2  mark = 
w sub c sup 4 over w sup 2 - w sub c sup 2  sup 2 + b sup 2 w sup 2

w sup 2 -w sub c sup 2 - b sup 2 over 2  sup 2 
+b sup 2 w sub c sup 2-b sup 2 over 4  
EN
sp
LE
This reaches a maximum when the squared term in the denominator of the second
expression is zero namely when  w=w sub c sup 2 - b sup 2 2 sup 12
However
formant bandwidths are low compared with their centre frequencies and so to
a good approximation the peak occurs
at  w=w sub c  and is of amplitude  w sub c b  that
is  10log sub 10 w sub c b dB above the DC gain
At frequencies higher than the peak the energy falls off as 1w sup 4
a factor of 116 for each doubling
in frequency and so the asymptotic decay is 12 dBoctave
