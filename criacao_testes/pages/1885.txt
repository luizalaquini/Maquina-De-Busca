Call the sampling interval T seconds so that the
sampling frequency is 1T Hz
Then components at 12T+f 32T-f 32T+f and so on all masquerade
as a component at 12T-f  Similarly components at frequencies just under
the sampling frequency masquerade as very low-frequency components as shown
in Figure 31b  This phenomenon is often called aliasing
pp
Thus the continuous infinite frequency axis for the unsampled signal where
two components at different frequencies can always be distinguished maps
into a repetitive frequency axis when the signal is sampled  As depicted
in Figure 32 the frequency
interval 1T 2T udgd

is mapped back into the band 0 1T as are the
intervals 2T 3T  3T 4T and so on
FC Figure 32
Furthermore the interval 12T 1T between half the sampling frequency and the sampling
frequency is mapped back into the interval
below half the sampling frequency but this time the mapping is backwards
with frequencies at just under 1T being mapped to frequencies slightly greater
than zero and frequencies just over 12T being mapped to ones
just under 12T
The best way to represent a repeating frequency axis like this is as a circle
Figure 33 shows how the linear frequency axis for continuous systems maps
on to a circular axis for sampled systems
FC Figure 33
For present purposes it is
easiest to imagine the bottom half of the circle as being reflected into
the top half so that traversing the upper semicircle in the anticlockwise direction
corresponds to frequencies increasing from 0 to 12T half the sample frequency
and returning along the lower semicircle is actually the same as coming
back round the upper one and corresponds to frequencies from 12T to 1T
being mapped into the range 12T to 0

As far as speech is concerned then we must ensure that before sampling a
signal no significant components at greater than half the sample frequency
are present  Furthermore the sampled signal will only contain information
about frequency components less than this so the sample frequency must be
chosen as twice the highest frequency of interest
For example consider telephone-quality speech
Telephones provide a familiar standard of speech quality which
although it can only be an approximate standard
will be much used throughout this book
The telephone network
aims to transmit only frequencies lower than 34 kHz  We saw in the
previous chapter that this region will contain the information-bearing formants
and some em but not all em of the fricative and aspiration energy
Actually transmitting speech through the telephone system degrades its
quality very significantly probably more than you realize since everyone is
so accustomed to telephone speech  Try the dial-a-disc service and compare
it with high-fidelity music for a striking example of the kind of degradation
suffered
pp
For telephone speech the sampling frequency must be chosen to be
at least 68 kHz
Since speech contains significant amounts of energy above 34 kHz it should be
filtered before sampling to remove this otherwise the higher components
would be mapped back into the baseband and distort the low-frequency information
Because it is difficult to make filters that cut off very sharply the
sampling frequency is chosen rather greater than twice the highest frequency of
interest  For example the digital telephone network samples at 8 kHz
The pre-sampling filter should have a cutoff frequency of 4 kHz aim for
negligible distortion below 34 kHz and transmit negligible components
above 46 kHz em for these are reflected back into the band of interest
namely 0 to 34 kHz  Figure 34 shows a block diagram for the input hardware

rh Quantization
Before considering specifications for the pre-sampling filter let us turn
from discretization in time to discretization in amplitude that is
quantization
This is performed by an AD converter analogue-to-digital which takes as input
a constant analogue voltage produced by the sampler and generates a
corresponding binary value as output  The simplest correspondence is
ul
uniform
quantization where the amplitude range is split into equal regions by points
termed quantization levels and the output is a binary representation of
the nearest quantization level to the input voltage
Typically 11-bit conversion is used for speech giving 2048 quantization
levels and the signal is adjusted to have zero mean so that half the
levels correspond to negative input voltages and the other half to positive
ones
pp
It is at first sight surprising that as many as 11 bits are needed for
adequate representation of speech signals  Research on the digital telephone
network for example has concluded that a signal-to-noise ratio of
some 26-27 dB is enough to avoid undue harshness of quality loss
of intelligibility and listener fatigue for speech at a comfortable
level in an otherwise reasonably good channel
Rabiner and Schafer 1978 suggest that about 36 dB signal-to-noise ratio
would most likely provide adequate quality in a communications system
