Ned gave him his answer You will my lord

Good he said smiling I will give Lyanna your love Ned Take care of my children for me

The words twisted in Ned’s belly like a knife For a moment he was at a loss He could not bring himself to lie Then he remembered the bastards little Barra at her mother’s breast Mya in the Vale Gendry at his forge and all the others I shall… guard your children as if they were my own he said slowly

Robert nodded and closed his eyes Ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face Sleep took him

Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned I will do all in my power my lord but the wound has mortified It took them two days to get him back By the time I saw him it was too late I can lessen His Grace’s suffering but only the gods can heal him now

How long Ned asked

By rights he should be dead already I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely

My brother was always strong Lord Renly said Not wise perhaps but strong In the sweltering heat of the bedchamber his brow was slick with sweat He might have been Robert’s ghost as he stood there young and dark and handsome He slew the boar His entrails were sliding from his belly yet somehow he slew the boar His voice was full of wonder

Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing Ned told him

Outside the door Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy Ned told him See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me

It shall be as you command my lord Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his years I have failed my sacred trust

Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself Ned said Robert loved to hunt boar I have seen him take a thousand of them He would stand his ground without flinching his legs braced the great spear in his hands and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged and wait until the last possible second until it was almost on him before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust No one could know this one would be his death

You are kind to say so Lord Eddard

The king himself said as much He blamed the wine

The white-haired knight gave a weary nod His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair yet he commanded us all to stand aside

I wonder Ser Barristan asked Varys so quietly who gave the king this wine

Ned had not heard the eunuch approach but when he looked around there he stood He wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor and his face was freshly powdered

The wine was from the king’s own skin Ser Barristan said

Only one skin Hunting is such thirsty work

I did not keep count More than one for a certainty His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required it

Such a dutiful boy said Varys to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment

Ned had a bitter taste in his mouth He recalled the two fair-haired boys Robert had sent chasing after a breastplate stretcher The king had told everyone the tale that night at the feast laughing until he shook Which squire

The elder said Ser Barristan Lancel

I know the lad well said Varys A stalwart boy Ser Kevan Lannister’s son nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth how well do I remember

Certainly Varys had once been young Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent You mention children Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made I want unmade At once

Alas said Varys At once may be too late I fear those birds have flown But I shall do what I can my lord With your leave He bowed and vanished down the steps his soft-soled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his descent

Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly emerged from Maegor’s Holdfast Lord Eddard he called after Ned a moment if you would be so kind

Ned stopped As you wish

Renly walked to his side Send your men away They met in the center of the bridge the dry moat beneath them Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined its bed

Ned gestured Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them That letter He leaned close Was it the regency Has my brother named you Protector He did not wait for a reply My lord I have thirty men in my personal guard and other friends beside knights and lords Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords in your hand

And what should I do with a hundred swords my lord

Strike Now while the castle sleeps Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand Protector or no the man who holds the king holds the kingdom We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well Once we have her children Cersei will not dare oppose us The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward

Ned regarded him coldly Robert is not dead yet The gods may spare him If not I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds

Lord Renly took a step back taut as a bowstring Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies it may be too late… for both of us

Then we should pray that Robert does not die

Small chance of that said Renly

Sometimes the gods are merciful

The Lannisters are not Lord Renly turned away and went back across the moat to the tower where his brother lay dying

By the time Ned returned to his chambers he felt weary and heartsick yet there was no question of his going back to sleep not now When you play the game of thrones you win or you die Cersei Lannister had told him in the godswood He found himself wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly’s offer He had no taste for these intrigues and there was no honor in threatening children and yet… if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee he might well have need of Renly’s hundred swords and more besides

I want Littlefinger he told Cayn If he’s not in his chambers take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King’s Landing until you find him Bring him to me before break of day Cayn bowed and took his leave and Ned turned to Tomard The Wind Witch sails on the evening tide Have you chosen the escort

Ten men with Porther in command

Twenty and you will command Ned said Porther was a brave man but headstrong He wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his daughters

As you wish m’lord Tom said Can’t say I’ll be sad to see the back of this place I miss the wife

You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north I need you to deliver a letter for me

Tom looked apprehensive To Dragonstone m’lord The island fortress of House Targaryen had a sinister repute

Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island They may be wary of unexpected visitors If he is reluctant offer him whatever it takes I will give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon No one else Not his steward nor the captain of his guard nor his lady wife but only Lord Stannis himself

As you command m’lord

When Tomard had left him Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside him on the table For a moment his grief overwhelmed him He wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of Robert Baratheon who had been more than a brother to him Men would whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his king’s friendship and disinherited his sons he could only hope that the gods would know better and that Robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave

Ned took out the king’s last letter A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden wax a few short words and a smear of blood How small the difference between victory and defeat between life and death

He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot To His Grace Stannis of the House Baratheon he wrote By the time you receive this letter your brother Robert our King these past fifteen years will be dead He was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood…
