but I have been able to explain that in several ways
since Even were I half persuaded that I shall see
him no more I am far from thinking of marriage with
another I should be very contemptible to indulge in
such a thought
They were silent now awhile and having struck into
an unfrequented track across a common the creaks of
Boldwoods saddle and gig springs were all the
sounds to be heard Boldwood ended the pause
Do you remember when I carried you fainting in
my arms into the Kings Arms in Casterbridge Every
dog has his day that was mine
I know-i know it all she said hurriedly
I for one shall never cease regretting that events
so fell out as to deny you to me
I too am very sorry she said and then checked
herself I mean you know I am sorry you thought
i -- 
I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over
those past times with you -- that I was something to
you before 1he1 was anything and that you belonged
1almost1 to me But of course thats nothing You
never liked me
 I did  and respected you too
Do you now
Yes
Which
How do you mean which
Do you like me or do you respect me
I dont know -- at least I cannot tell you It is
difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language
which is chiefly made by men to express theirs My
treatment of you was thoughtless inexcusable wicked
I shall eternally regret it If there had been anything
I could have done to make amends I would most
gladly have done it -- there was nothing on earth I so
longed to do as to repair the error But that was not
possible
Dont blame yourself -- you were not so far in the
wrong as you suppose Bathsheba suppose you had
real complete proof
P 413
that you are what in fact you are
 -- a widow -- would you repair the old wrong to me by
marrying me
I cannot say I shouldnt yet at any rate
But you might at some future time of your life
O yes I might at some time
Well then do you know that without further proof
of any kind you may marry again in about six years
from the present -- subject to nobodys objection or
blame
O yes she said quickly  I know all that But
dont talk of it -- seven or six years -- where may we all
be by that time
They will soon glide by and it will seem an
astonishingly short time to look back upon when they
are past -- much less than to look forward to now
Yes yes I have found that in my own experience
 Now listen once more Boldwood pleaded If I
wait that time will you marry me You own that you
owe me amends-iet that be your way of making them
But Mr Boldwood -- six years -- 
Do you want to be the wife of any other man
No indeed I mean that I dont like to talk
about this matter now Perhaps it is not proper and
I ought not to allow it Let us drop it My husband
may be living as I said
Of course Ill drop the subject if you wish But
propriety has nothing to do with reasons I am a
middle-aged man willing to protect you for the
remainder of our lives On your side at least there
is no passion or blamable haste -- on mine perhaps
there is But I cant help seeing that if you choose
from a feeling of pity and as you say a wish to make
amends to make a bargain with me for a far-ahead
time -- an agreement which will set all things right
and make me happy late though it may be -- there is
no fault to be found with you as a woman Hadnt
I the first place beside you Havent you been
almost mine once already Surely you can say to
me as much as this you will have me back again
should circumstances permit  Now pray speak  O
Bathsheba promise -- it is only a little promise -- that
if you marry again you will marry me
His tone was so excited that she almost feared him
at this
P 414
moment even whilst she sympathized It was
a simple physical fear -- the weak of the strong there
no emotional aversion or inner repugnance She
said with some distress in her voice for she remembered
vividly his outburst on the Yalbury Road and shrank
from a repetition of his anger --
I will never marry another man whilst you wish me
to be your wife whatever comes -- but to say more -- you
have taken me so by surprise -- -
But let it stand in these simple words -- that in six
years time you will be my wife  Unexpected accidents
well not mention because those of course must be
