All you have to give Jon Snow He is a king

He shut the door and pulled the bell cord The winch began to turn They rose The day was bright and the Wall was weeping long fingers of water trickling down its face and glinting in the sun In the close confines of the iron cage he was acutely aware of the red woman’s presence She even smells red The scent reminded him of Mikken’s forge of the way iron smelled when red-hot the scent was smoke and blood Kissed by fire he thought remembering Ygritte The wind got in amongst Melisandre’s long red robes and sent them flapping against Jon’s legs as he stood beside her You are not cold my lady he asked her

She laughed Never The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse in time with the beating of her heart The Lord’s fire lives within me Jon Snow Feel She put her hand on his cheek and held it there while he felt how warm she was That is how life should feel she told him Only death is cold

They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall brooding over the field where he had won his battle and the great green forest beyond He was dressed in the same black breeches tunic and boots that a brother of the Night’s Watch might wear Only his cloak set him apart a heavy golden cloak trimmed in black fur and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart I have brought you the Bastard of Winterfell Your Grace said Melisandre

Stannis turned to study him Beneath his heavy brow were eyes like bottomless blue pools His hollow cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the gauntness of his face and his teeth were clenched His neck and shoulders were clenched as well and his right hand Jon found himself remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon brothers Robert was the true steel Stannis is pure iron black and hard and strong but brittle the way iron gets He’ll break before he bends Uneasily he knelt wondering why this brittle king had need of him

Rise I have heard much and more of you Lord Snow

I am no lord sire Jon rose I know what you have heard That I am a turncloak and craven That I slew my brother Qhorin Halfhand so the wildlings would spare my life That I rode with Mance Rayder and took a wildling wife

Aye All that and more You are a warg too they say a skinchanger who walks at night as a wolf King Stannis had a hard smile How much of it is true

I had a direwolf Ghost I left him when I climbed the Wall near Greyguard and have not seen him since Qhorin Halfhand commanded me to join the wildlings He knew they would make me kill him to prove myself and told me to do whatever they asked of me The woman was named Ygritte I broke my vows with her but I swear to you on my father’s name that I never turned my cloak

I believe you the king said

That startled him Why

Stannis snorted I know Janos Slynt And I knew Ned Stark as well Your father was no friend of mine but only a fool would doubt his honor or his honesty You have his look A big man Stannis Baratheon towered over Jon but he was so gaunt that he looked ten years older than he was I know more than you might think Jon Snow I know it was you who found the dragonglass dagger that Randyll Tarly’s son used to slay the Other

Ghost found it The blade was wrapped in a ranger’s cloak and buried beneath the Fist of the First Men There were other blades as well… spearheads arrowheads all dragonglass

I know you held the gate here King Stannis said If not I would have come too late

Donal Noye held the gate He died below in the tunnel fighting the king of the giants

Stannis grimaced Noye made my first sword for me and Robert’s warhammer as well Had the god seen fit to spare him he would have made a better Lord Commander for your order than any of these fools who are squabbling over it now

Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister are no fools sire Jon said They’re good men and capable Othell Yarwyck as well in his own way Lord Mormont trusted each of them

Your Lord Mormont trusted too easily Else he would not have died as he did But we were speaking of you I have not forgotten that it was you who brought us this magic horn and captured Mance Rayder’s wife and son

Dalla died Jon was saddened by that still Val is her sister She and the babe did not require much capturing Your Grace You had put the wildlings to flight and the skinchanger Mance had left to guard his queen went mad when the eagle burned Jon looked at Melisandre Some say that was your doing

She smiled her long copper hair tumbling across her face The Lord of Light has fiery talons Jon Snow

Jon nodded and turned back to the king Your Grace you spoke of Val She has asked to see Mance Rayder to bring his son to him It would be a… a kindness

The man is a deserter from your order Your brothers are all insisting on his death Why should I do him a kindness

Jon had no answer for that If not for him for Val For her sister’s sake the child’s mother

You are fond of this Val

I scarcely know her

They tell me she is comely

Very Jon admitted

Beauty can be treacherous My brother learned that lesson from Cersei Lannister She murdered him do not doubt it Your father and Jon Arryn as well He scowled You rode with these wildlings Is there any honor in them do you think

Yes Jon said but their own sort of honor sire

In Mance Rayder

Yes I think so

In the Lord of Bones

Jon hesitated Rattleshirt we called him Treacherous and bloodthirsty If there’s honor in him he hides it down beneath his suit of bones

And this other man this Tormund of the many names who eluded us after the battle Answer me truly

Tormund Giantsbane seemed to me the sort of man who would make a good friend and a bad enemy Your Grace

Stannis gave a curt nod Your father was a man of honor He was no friend to me but I saw his worth Your brother was a rebel and a traitor who meant to steal half my kingdom but no man can question his courage What of you

Does he want me to say I love him Jon’s voice was stiff and formal as he said I am a man of the Night’s Watch

Words Words are wind Why do you think I abandoned Dragonstone and sailed to the Wall Lord Snow

I am no lord sire You came because we sent for you I hope Though I could not say why you took so long about it

Surprisingly Stannis smiled at that You’re bold enough to be a Stark Yes I should have come sooner If not for my Hand I might not have come at all Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth but he reminded me of my duty when all I could think of was my rights I had the cart before the horse Davos said I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne Stannis pointed north There is where I’ll find the foe that I was born to fight

His name may not be spoken Melisandre added softly He is the God of Night and Terror Jon Snow and these shapes in the snow are his creatures

They tell me that you slew one of these walking corpses to save Lord Mormont’s life Stannis said it may be that this is your war as well Lord Snow If you will give me your help

My sword is pledged to the Night’s Watch Your Grace Jon Snow answered carefully

That did not please the king Stannis ground his teeth and said I need more than a sword from you

Jon was lost My lord

I need the north

The north I… my brother Robb was King in the North…

Your brother was the rightful Lord of Winterfell If he had stayed home and done his duty instead of crowning himself and riding off to conquer the riverlands he might be alive today Be that as it may You are not Robb no more than I am Robert

The harsh words had blown away whatever sympathy Jon might have had for Stannis I loved my brother he said

And I mine Yet they were what they were and so are we I am the only true king in Westeros north or south And you are Ned Stark’s bastard Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North to reward him for betraying your brother The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy’s death yet they still hold Moat Cailin Deepwood Motte Torrhen’s Square and most of the Stony Shore Your father’s lands are bleeding and I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell A loyal Lord of Winterfell
