The Tickler said Maybe he’ll give you to me

If you want me come get me Sandor pushed away from the wall and stood in a half-crouch behind the bench his sword held across his body

You think we won’t said Polliver You’re drunk

Might be said the Hound but you’re dead His foot lashed out and caught the bench driving it hard into Polliver’s shins Somehow the bearded man kept his feet but the Hound ducked under his wild slash and brought his own sword up in a vicious backhand cut Blood spattered on the ceiling and walls The blade caught in the middle of Polliver’s face and when the Hound wrenched it loose half his head came with it

The Tickler backed away Arya could smell his fear The shortsword in his hand suddenly seemed almost a toy against the long blade the Hound was holding and he wasn’t armored either He moved swiftly light on his feet never taking his eyes off Sandor Clegane It was the easiest thing in the world for Arya to step up behind him and stab him

Is there gold hidden in the village she shouted as she drove the blade up through his back Is there silver Gems She stabbed twice more Is there food Where is Lord Beric She was on top of him by then still stabbing Where did he go How many men were with him How many knights How many bowmen How many how many how many how many how many how many Is there gold in the village

Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged her off him Enough was all he said He was bleeding like a butchered pig himself and dragging one leg when he walked

There’s one more Arya reminded him

The squire had pulled the knife out of his belly and was trying to stop the blood with his hands When the Hound yanked him upright he screamed and started to blubber like a baby Mercy he wept please Don’t kill me Mother have mercy

Do I look like your bloody mother The Hound looked like nothing human You killed this one too he told Arya Pricked him in his bowels that’s the end of him He’ll be a long time dying though

The boy didn’t seemed to hear him I came for the girls he whimpered    make me a man Polly said    oh gods please take me to a castle    a maester take me to a maester my father’s got gold    it was only for the girls    mercy ser

The Hound gave him a crack across the face that made him scream again Don’t call me ser He turned back to Arya This one is yours she-wolf You do it

She knew what he meant Arya went to Polliver and knelt in his blood long enough to undo his swordbelt Hanging beside his dagger was a slimmer blade too long to be a dirk too short to be a man’s sword    but it felt just right in her hand

You remember where the heart is the Hound asked

She nodded The squire rolled his eyes Mercy

Needle slipped between his ribs and gave it to him

Good Sandor’s voice was thick with pain If these three were whoring here Gregor must hold the ford as well as Harrenhal More of his pets could ride up any moment and we’ve killed enough of the bloody buggers for one day

Where will we go she asked

Saltpans He put a big hand on her shoulder to keep from falling Get some wine she-wolf And take whatever coin they have as well we’ll need it If there’s ships at Saltpans we can reach the Vale by sea His mouth twitched at her as more blood ran down from where his ear had been Maybe Lady Lysa will marry you to her little Robert There’s a match I’d like to see He started to laugh then groaned instead

When the time came to leave he needed Arya’s help to get back up on Stranger He had tied a strip of cloth about his neck and another around his thigh and taken the squire’s cloak off its peg by the door The cloak was green with a green arrow on a white bend but when the Hound wadded it up and pressed it to his ear it soon turned red Arya was afraid he would collapse the moment they set out but somehow he stayed in the saddle

They could not risk meeting whoever held the ruby ford so instead of following the kingsroad they angled south by east through weedy fields woods and marshes It was hours before they reached the banks of the Trident The river had returned meekly to its accustomed channel Arya saw all its wet brown rage vanished with the rains It’s tired too she thought

Close by the water’s edge they found some willows rising from a jumble of weathered rocks Together the rocks and trees formed a sort of natural fort where they could hide from both river and trail Here will do the Hound said Water the horses and gather some deadwood for a fire When he dismounted he had to catch himself on a tree limb to keep from falling

Won’t the smoke be seen

Anyone wants to find us all they need to do is follow my blood Water and wood But bring me that wineskin first

When he got the fire going Sandor propped up his helm in the flames emptied half the wineskin into it and collapsed back against a jut of moss-covered stone as if he never meant to rise again He made Arya wash out the squire’s cloak and cut it into strips Those went into his helm as well If I had more wine I’d drink till I was dead to the world Maybe I ought to send you back to that bloody inn for another skin or three

No Arya said He wouldn’t would he If he does I’ll just leave him and ride off

Sandor laughed at the fear on her face A jest wolf girl A bloody jest Find me a stick about so long and not too big around And wash the mud off it I hate the taste of mud

He didn’t like the first two sticks she brought him By the time she found one that suited him the flames had scorched his dog’s snout black all the way to the eyes Inside the wine was boiling madly Get the cup from my bedroll and dip it half full he told her Be careful You knock the damn thing over I will send you back for more Take the wine and pour it on my wounds Think you can do that Arya nodded Then what are you waiting for he growled

Her knuckles brushed the steel the first time she filled the cup burning her so badly she got blisters Arya had to bite her lip to keep from screaming The Hound used the stick for the same purpose clamping it between his teeth as she poured She did the gash in his thigh first then the shallower cut on the back of his neck Sandor coiled his right hand into a fist and beat against the ground when she did his leg When it came to his neck he bit the stick so hard it broke and she had to find him a new one She could see the terror in his eyes Turn your head She trickled the wine down over the raw red flesh where his ear had been and fingers of brown blood and red wine crept over his jaw He did scream then despite the stick Then he passed out from the pain

Arya figured the rest out by herself She fished the strips they’d made of the squire’s cloak out of the bottom of the helm and used them to bind the cuts When she came to his ear she had to wrap up half his head to stop the bleeding By then dusk was settling over the Trident She let the horses graze then hobbled them for the night and made herself as comfortable as she could in a niche between two rocks The fire burned a while and died Arya watched the moon through the branches overhead

Ser Gregor the Mountain she said softly Dunsen Raff the Sweetling Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Queen Cersei It made her feel queer to leave out Polliver and the Tickler And Joffrey too She was glad he was dead but she wished she could have been there to see him die or maybe kill him herself Polliver said that Sansa killed him and the Imp Could that be true The Imp was a Lannister and Sansa    I wish I could change into a wolf and grow wings and fly away

If Sansa was gone too there were no more Starks but her Jon was on the Wall a thousand leagues away but he was a Snow and these different aunts and uncles the Hound wanted to sell her to they weren’t Starks either They weren’t wolves

Sandor moaned and she rolled onto her side to look at him She had left his name out too she realized Why had she done that She tried to think of Mycah but it was hard to remember what he’d looked like She hadn’t known him long All he ever did was play at swords with me The Hound she whispered and Valar morghulis Maybe he’d be dead by morning   

But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees it was him who woke her with the toe of his boot She had dreamed she was a wolf again chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a pack behind her but his foot brought her back just as they were closing for the kill

The Hound was still weak every movement slow and clumsy He slumped in the saddle and sweated and his ear began to bleed through the bandage He needed all his strength just to keep from falling off Stranger Had the Mountain’s men come hunting them she doubted if he would even be able to lift a sword Arya glanced over her shoulder but there was nothing behind them but a crow flitting from tree to tree The only sound was the river

Long before noon Sandor Clegane was reeling There were hours of daylight still remaining when he called a halt I need to rest was all he said This time when he dismounted he did fall Instead of trying to get back up he crawled weakly under a tree and leaned up against the trunk Bloody hell he cursed Bloody hell When he saw Arya staring at him he said I’d skin you alive for a cup of wine girl

She brought him water instead He drank a little of it complained that it tasted of mud and slid into a noisy fevered sleep When she touched him his skin was burning up Arya sniffed at his bandages the way Maester Luwin had done sometimes when treating her cut or scrape His face had bled the worst but it was the wound on his thigh that smelled funny to her

She wondered how far this Saltpans was and whether she could find it by herself I wouldn’t have to kill him If I just rode off and left him he’d die all by himself He’ll die of fever and lie there beneath that tree until the end of days But maybe it would be better if she killed him herself She had killed the squire at the inn and he hadn’t done anything except grab her arm The Hound had killed Mycah Mycah and more I bet he’s killed a hundred Mycahs He probably would have killed her too if not for the ransom

Needle glinted as she drew it Polliver had kept it nice and sharp at least She turned her body sideways in a water dancer’s stance without even thinking about it Dead leaves crunched beneath her feet Quick as a snake she thought Smooth as summer silk

His eyes opened You remember where the heart is he asked in a hoarse whisper

As still as stone she stood I    I was only   

Don’t lie he growled I hate liars I hate gutless frauds even worse Go on do it When Arya did not move he said I killed your butcher’s boy I cut him near in half and laughed about it after He made a queer sound and it took her a moment to realize he was sobbing And the little bird your pretty sister I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her I took the bloody song she never gave it I meant to take her too I should have I should have fucked her bloody and ripped her heart out before leaving her for that dwarf A spasm of pain twisted his face Do you mean to make me beg bitch Do it The gift of mercy    avenge your little Michael   

Mycah Arya stepped away from him You don’t deserve the gift of mercy

The Hound watched her saddle Craven through eyes bright with fever Not once did he attempt to rise and stop her But when she mounted he said A real wolf would finish a wounded animal

Maybe some real wolves will find you Arya thought Maybe they’ll smell you when the sun goes down Then he would learn what wolves did to dogs You shouldn’t have hit me with an axe she said You should have saved my mother She turned her horse and rode away from him and never looked back once

On a bright morning six days later she came to a place where the Trident began to widen out and the air smelled more of salt than trees She stayed close to the water passing fields and farms and a little after midday a town appeared before her Saltpans she hoped A small castle dominated the town no more than a holdfast really a single tall square keep with a bailey and a curtain wall Most of the shops and inns and alehouses around the harbor had been plundered or burned though some looked still inhabited But the port was there and eastward spread the Bay of Crabs its waters shimmering blue and green in the sun

And there were ships

Three thought Arya there are three Two were only river galleys shallow draft boats made to ply the waters of the Trident The third was bigger a salt sea trader with two banks of oars a gilded prow and three tall masts with furled purple sails Her hull was painted purple too Arya rode Craven down to the docks to get a better look Strangers are not so strange in a port as they are in little villages and no one seemed to care who she was or why she was here

I need silver The realization made her bite her lip They had found a stag and a dozen coppers on Polliver eight silvers on the pimply squire she’d killed and only a couple of pennies in the Tickler’s purse But the Hound had told her to pull off his boots and slice open his blood-drenched clothes and she’d turned up a stag in each toe and three golden dragons sewn in the lining of his jerkin Sandor had kept it all though That wasn’t fair It was mine as much as his If she had given him the gift of mercy    she hadn’t though She couldn’t go back no more than she could beg for help Begging for help never gets you any She would have to sell Craven and hope she brought enough

The stable had been burnt she learned from a boy by the docks but the woman who’d owned it was still trading behind the sept Arya found her easily a big robust woman with a good horsey smell to her She liked Craven at first look asked Arya how she’d come by her and grinned at her answer She’s a well-bred horse that’s plain enough and I don’t doubt she belonged to a knight sweetling she said But the knight wasn’t no dead brother o’ yours I been dealing with the castle there many a year so I know what gentleborn folk is like This mare is well-bred but you’re not She poked a finger at Arya’s chest Found her or stole her never mind which that’s how it was Only way a scruffy little thing like you comes to ride a palfrey
