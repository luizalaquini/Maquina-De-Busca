79 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down
to the grave shall come up no more

710 He shall return no more to his house neither shall his place
know him any more

711 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth I will speak in the
anguish of my spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my soul

712 Am I a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me  713
When I say My bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my
complaints 714 Then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me
through visions 715 So that my soul chooseth strangling and death
rather than my life

716 I loathe it I would not live alway let me alone for my days
are vanity

717 What is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou
shouldest set thine heart upon him  718 And that thou shouldest
visit him every morning and try him every moment  719 How long wilt
thou not depart from me nor let me alone till I swallow down my
spittle  720 I have sinned what shall I do unto thee O thou
preserver of men  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so
that I am a burden to myself  721 And why dost thou not pardon my
transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall I sleep in the
dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but I shall not be

81 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said 82 How long wilt thou
speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like
a strong wind  83 Doth God pervert judgment or doth the Almighty
pervert justice  84 If thy children have sinned against him and he
have cast them away for their transgression 85 If thou wouldest seek
unto God betimes and make thy supplication to the Almighty 86 If
thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and
make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous

87 Though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly
increase

88 For enquire I pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself
to the search of their fathers 89 For we are but of yesterday and
know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow 810 Shall
not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their
heart  811 Can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow
without water  812 Whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut
down it withereth before any other herb

813 So are the paths of all that forget God and the hypocrites hope
shall perish 814 Whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall
be a spiders web

815 He shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall
hold it fast but it shall not endure

816 He is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his
garden

817 His roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of
stones

818 If he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying
I have not seen thee

819 Behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall
others grow

820 Behold God will not cast away a perfect man neither will he
help the evil doers 821 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing and
thy lips with rejoicing

822 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling
place of the wicked shall come to nought

91 Then Job answered and said 92 I know it is so of a truth but
how should man be just with God  93 If he will contend with him he
cannot answer him one of a thousand

94 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened
himself against him and hath prospered  95 Which removeth the
mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger

96 Which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof
tremble

97 Which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the
stars

98 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves
of the sea

99 Which maketh Arcturus Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of
the south

910 Which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders
without number

911 Lo he goeth by me and I see him not he passeth on also but I
perceive him not
