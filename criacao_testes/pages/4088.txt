	cannot part them

ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow and I will bid the
	duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it
	is to look into happiness through another mans
	eyes By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
	the height of heart-heaviness by how much I shall
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

ROSALIND	Why then to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind

ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking

ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking
	Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose
	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I
	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
	of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are
	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
	some little measure draw a belief from you to do
	yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if
	you please that I can do strange things I have
	since I was three year old conversed with a
	magician most profound in his art and yet not
	damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
	as your gesture cries it out when your brother
	marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into
	what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
	not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
	to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
	as she is and without any danger

ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings

ROSALIND	By my life I do which I tender dearly though I
	say I am a magician Therefore put you in your
	best array bid your friends for if you will be
	married to-morrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will
