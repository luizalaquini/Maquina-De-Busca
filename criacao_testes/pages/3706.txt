We all saw how eager you were to take it mocked Ragwyle

He is a warg said the Lord of Bones and a crow I like him not

A warg he may be Ygritte said but that has never frightened us Others shouted agreement Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt’s stare was malignant but he yielded grudgingly These are a free folk indeed thought Jon

They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he’d fallen on a pyre made of pine needles brush and broken branches Some of the wood was still green and it burned slow and smoky sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones while the others threw dice for the ranger’s gear Ygritte won his cloak

Will we return by the Skirling Pass Jon asked her He did not know if he could face those heights again or if his garron could survive a second crossing

No she said There’s nothing behind us The look she gave him was sad By now Mance is well down the Milkwater marching on your Wall





BRAN

The ashes fell like a soft grey snow

He padded over dry needles and brown leaves to the edge of the wood where the pines grew thin Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat so strong he began to slaver

Yet as one smell drew them onward others warned them back He sniffed at the drifting smoke Men many men many horses and fire fire fire No smell was more dangerous not even the hard cold smell of iron the stuff of man-claws and hardskin The smoke and ash clouded his eyes and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame He bared his teeth but then the snake was gone Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars

All through the night the fires crackled and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror Howls shuddered through the night the howls of the man-pack wails of fear and wild shouts laughter and screams No beast was as noisy as man He pricked up his ears and listened and his brother growled at every sound They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes and embers through the sky In time the flames began to dwindle and then they were gone The sun rose grey and smoky that morning

Only then did he leave the trees stalking slow across the fields His brother ran with him drawn to the smell of blood and death They padded silent through the dens the men had built of wood and grass and mud Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed others stood as they had before Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near The wild dogs slunk away before them

Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell His brother circled round him then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse until his brother rolled on his back in submission tail tucked low One more bite at his upturned throat then he fed and let his brother feed and licked the blood off his black fur

The dark place was pulling at him by then the house of whispers where all men were blind He could feel its cold fingers on him The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose He struggled against the pull He did not like the darkness He was wolf He was hunter and stalker and slayer and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods running free beneath a starry sky He sat on his haunches raised his head and howled I will not go he cried I am wolf I will not go Yet even so the darkness thickened until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears so he could not see or smell or hear or run and the grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black…

Bran a voice was whispering softly Bran come back Come back now Bran Bran…

He closed his third eye and opened the other two the old two the blind two In the dark place all men were blind But someone was holding him He could feel arms around him the warmth of a body snuggled close He could hear Hodor singing Hodor hodor hodor quietly to himself

Bran It was Meera’s voice You were thrashing making terrible noises What did you see

Winterfell His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth One day when I come back I won’t know how to talk anymore It was Winterfell It was all on fire There were horse smells and steel and blood They killed everyone Meera

He felt her hand on his face stroking back his hair You’re all sweaty she said Do you need a drink

A drink he agreed She held a skin to his lips and Bran swallowed so fast the water ran out of the corner of his mouth He was always weak and thirsty when he came back And hungry too He remembered the dying horse the taste of blood in his mouth the smell of burnt flesh in the morning air How long

Three days said Jojen The boy had come up softfoot or perhaps he had been there all along in this blind black world Bran could not have said We were afraid for you

I was with Summer Bran said

Too long You’ll starve yourself Meera dribbled a little water down your throat and we smeared honey on your mouth but it is not enough

I ate said Bran We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him The cat had been tan-and-brown only half the size of the direwolves but fierce He remembered the musky smell of him and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak

The wolf ate Jojen said Not you Take care Bran Remember who you are

He remembered who he was all too well Bran the boy Bran the broken Better Bran the beastling Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams his wolf dreams Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened He could reach Summer whenever he wanted and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon Though maybe he had only dreamed that He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to pull him back now Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position I have to tell Osha what I saw Is she here Where did she go

The wildling woman herself gave answer Nowhere m’lord I’ve had my fill o’ blundering in the black He heard the scrape of a heel on stone turned his head toward the sound but saw nothing He thought he could smell her but he wasn’t sure All of them stank alike and he did not have Summer’s nose to tell one from the other Last night I pissed on a king’s foot Osha went on Might be it was morning who can say I was sleeping but now I’m not They all slept a lot not only Bran There was nothing else to do Sleep and eat and sleep again and sometimes talk a little… but not too much and only in whispers just to be safe Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all but there was no way to quiet Rickon or to stop Hodor from muttering Hodor hodor hodor endlessly to himself

Osha Bran said I saw Winterfell burning Off to his left he could hear the soft sound of Rickon’s breathing

A dream said Osha

A wolf dream said Bran I smelled it too Nothing smells like fire or blood

Whose blood

Men horses dogs everyone We have to go see

This scrawny skin of mine’s the only one I got said Osha That squid prince catches hold o’ me they’ll strip it off my back with a whip

Meera’s hand found Bran’s in the darkness and gave his fingers a squeeze I’ll go if you’re afraid

Bran heard fingers fumbling at leather followed by the sound of steel on flint Then again A spark flew caught Osha blew softly A long pale flame awoke stretching upward like a girl on her toes Osha’s face floated above it She touched the flame with the head of a torch Bran had to squint as the pitch began to burn filling the world with orange glare The light woke Rickon who sat up yawning

When the shadows moved it looked for an instant as if the dead were rising as well Lyanna and Brandon Lord Rickard Stark their father Lord Edwyle his father Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable Lord Donnor and Lord Beron and Lord Rodwell one-eyed Lord Jonnel Lord Barth and Lord Brandon and Lord Cregan who had fought the Dragonknight On their stone chairs they sat with stone wolves at their feet This was where they came when the warmth had seeped out of their bodies this was the dark hall of the dead where the living feared to tread

And in the mouth of the empty tomb that waited for Lord Eddard Stark beneath his stately granite likeness the six fugitives huddled round their little cache of bread and water and dried meat Little enough left Osha muttered as she blinked down on their stores I’d need to go up soon to steal food in any case or we’d be down to eating Hodor

Hodor Hodor said grinning at her

Is it day or night up there Osha wondered I’ve lost all count o’ such

Day Bran told her but it’s dark from all the smoke

M’lord is certain

Never moving his broken body he reached out all the same and for an instant he was seeing double There stood Osha holding the torch and Meera and Jojen and Hodor and the double row of tall granite pillars and long dead lords behind them stretching away into darkness… but there was Winterfell as well grey with drifting smoke the massive oak-and-iron gates charred and askew the drawbridge down in a tangle of broken chains and missing planks Bodies floated in the moat islands for the crows

Certain he declared

Osha chewed on that a moment I’ll risk a look then I want the lot o’ you close behind Meera get Bran’s basket

Are we going home Rickon asked excitedly I want my horse And I want applecakes and butter and honey and Shaggy Are we going where Shaggydog is

Yes Bran promised but you have to be quiet

Meera strapped the wicker basket to Hodor’s back and helped lift Bran into it easing his useless legs through the holes He had a queer flutter in his belly He knew what awaited them above but that did not make it any less fearful As they set off he turned to give his father one last look and it seemed to Bran that there was a sadness in Lord Eddard’s eyes as if he did not want them to go We have to he thought It’s time

Osha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other A naked sword hung down her back one of the last to bear Mikken’s mark He had forged it for Lord Eddard’s tomb to keep his ghost at rest But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory good steel had been hard to resist even if it meant grave-robbing Meera had claimed Lord Rickard’s blade though she complained that it was too heavy Brandon took his namesake’s the sword made for the uncle he had never known He knew he would not be much use in a fight but even so the blade felt good in his hand
