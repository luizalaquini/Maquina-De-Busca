He was there and he was gone again his silvery armor obscured by the trees once more Others came behind him long columns of them knights and sworn swords and freeriders three quarters of the Lannister horse

He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers Ser Brynden had promised He has ridden out with his knights thrice already to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast

Nodding Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him Ned had taught him to read maps Raid him here he said pointing A few hundred men no more Tully banners When he comes after you we will be waiting—his finger moved an inch to the left—here

Here was a hush in the night moonlight and shadows a thick carpet of dead leaves underfoot densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away

Here was her son on his stallion glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute

Here was the call of Maege Mormont’s warhorn a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east to tell them that the last of Jaime’s riders had entered the trap

And Grey Wind threw back his head and howled

The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark and she found herself shivering It was a terrible sound a frightening sound yet there was music in it too For a second she felt something like pity for the Lannisters below So this is what death sounds like she thought

HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded his own horn To east and west the trumpets of the Mallisters and Freys blew vengeance North where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow Lord Karstark’s warhorns added their own deep mournful voices to the dark chorus Men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below

The whispering wood let out its breath all at once as the bowmen Robb had hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses All around her the riders raised their lances and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel Winterfell she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again He moved away from her at a trot leading his men downhill

Catelyn sat on her horse unmoving with Hal Mollen and her guard around her and she waited as she had waited before for Brandon and Ned and her father She was high on the ridge and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath her A heartbeat two four and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone in the wood The rest were melted away into the green

Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge she saw the Greatjon’s riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees They were in a long line an endless line and as they burst from the wood there was an instant the smallest part of a heartbeat when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge wreathed in silver flame

Then she blinked and they were only men rushing down to kill or die

Afterward she could not claim she had seen the battle Yet she could hear and the valley rang with echoes The crack of a broken lance the clash of swords the cries of Lannister and Winterfell and Tully Riverrun and Tully When she realized there was no more to see she closed her eyes and listened The battle came alive around her She heard hoofbeats iron boots splashing in shallow water the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel the hiss of arrows the thunder of drums the terrified screaming of a thousand horses Men shouted curses and begged for mercy and got it or not and lived or died The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound Once she heard Robb’s voice as clear as if he’d been standing at her side calling To me To me And she heard his direwolf snarling and growling heard the snap of those long teeth the tearing of flesh shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike Was there only one wolf It was hard to be certain

Little by little the sounds dwindled and died until at last there was only the wolf As a red dawn broke in the east Grey Wind began to howl again

Robb came back to her on a different horse riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion he had taken down into the valley The wolf’s head on his shield was slashed half to pieces raw wood showing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak but Robb himself seemed unhurt Yet when he came closer Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood You’re hurt she said

Robb lifted his hand opened and closed his fingers No he said This is… Torrhen’s blood perhaps or… He shook his head I do not know

A mob of men followed him up the slope dirty and dented and grinning with Theon and the Greatjon at their head Between them they dragged Ser Jaime Lannister They threw him down in front of her horse The Kingslayer Hal announced unnecessarily

Lannister raised his head Lady Stark he said from his knees Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair I would offer you my sword but I seem to have mislaid it

It is not your sword I want ser she told him Give me my father and my brother Edmure Give me my daughters Give me my lord husband

I have mislaid them as well I fear

A pity Catelyn said coldly

Kill him Robb Theon Greyjoy urged Take his head off

No her son answered peeling off his bloody glove He’s more use alive than dead And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle

A wise man Jaime Lannister said and honorable

Take him away and put him in irons Catelyn said

Do as my lady mother says Robb commanded and make certain there’s a strong guard around him Lord Karstark will want his head on a pike

That he will the Greatjon agreed gesturing Lannister was led away to be bandaged and chained

Why should Lord Karstark want him dead Catelyn asked

Robb looked away into the woods with the same brooding look that Ned often got He… he killed them…

Lord Karstark’s sons Galbart Glover explained

Both of them said Robb Torrhen and Eddard And Daryn Hornwood as well

No one can fault Lannister on his courage Glover said When he saw that he was lost he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down And almost did

He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark’s neck after he took Torrhen’s hand off and split Daryn Hornwood’s skull open Robb said All the time he was shouting for me If they hadn’t tried to stop him—

—I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark Catelyn said Your men did what they were sworn to do Robb They died protecting their liege lord Grieve for them Honor them for their valor But not now You have no time for grief You may have lopped the head off the snake but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my father’s castle We have won a battle not a war

But such a battle said Theon Greyjoy eagerly My lady the realm has not seen such a victory since the Field of Fire I vow the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell We’ve taken close to a hundred knights captive and a dozen lords bannermen Lord Westerling Lord Banefort Ser Garth Greenfield Lord Estren Ser Tytos Brax Mallor the Dornishman… and three Lannisters besides Jaime Lord Tywin’s own nephews two of his sister’s sons and one of his dead brother’s…

And Lord Tywin Catelyn interrupted Have you perchance taken Lord Tywin Theon

No Greyjoy answered brought up short

Until you do this war is far from done

Robb raised his head and pushed his hair back out of his eyes My mother is right We still have Riverrun





DAENERYS

The flies circled Khal Drogo slowly their wings buzzing a low thrum at the edge of hearing that filled Dany with dread

The sun was high and pitiless Heat shimmered in waves off the stony outcrops of low hills A thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between Dany’s swollen breasts The only sounds were the steady clop of their horses’ hooves the rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo’s hair and the distant voices behind them

Dany watched the flies

They were as large as bees gross purplish glistening The Dothraki called them bloodflies They lived in marshes and stagnant pools sucked blood from man and horse alike and laid their eggs in the dead and dying Drogo hated them Whenever one came near him his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around it She had never seen him miss He would hold the fly inside his huge fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing Then his fingers would tighten and when he opened his hand again the fly would be only a red smear on his palm

Now one crept across the rump of his stallion and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it away The others flitted about Drogo closer and closer The khal did not react His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills the reins loose in his hands Beneath his painted vest a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his breast The herbwomen had made it for him Mirri Maz Duur’s poultice had itched and burned and he had torn it off six days ago cursing her for a maegi The mud plaster was more soothing and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well He’d been drinking it heavily these past three days when it was not poppy wine it was fermented mare’s milk or pepper beer

Yet he scarcely touched his food and he thrashed and groaned in the night Dany could see how drawn his face had become Rhaego was restless in her belly kicking like a stallion yet even that did not stir Drogo’s interest as it had Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep And now this silence It was making her afraid Since they had mounted up at dawn he had said not a word When she spoke she got no answer but a grunt and not even that much since midday

One of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khal’s shoulder Another circling touched down on his neck and crept up toward his mouth Khal Drogo swayed in the saddle bells ringing as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace
