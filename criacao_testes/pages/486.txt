Swear it Arya said Swear it by the gods

By all the gods of sea and air and even him of fire I swear it He placed a hand in the mouth of the weirwood By the seven new gods and the old gods beyond count I swear it

He has sworn Even if I named the king…

Speak the name and death will come On the morrow at the turn of the moon a year from this day it will come A man does not fly like a bird but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there and a king dies He knelt beside her so they were face-to-face A girl whispers if she fears to speak aloud Whisper it now Is it Joffrey

Arya put her lips to his ear It’s Jaqen H’ghar

Even in the burning barn with walls of flame towering all around and him in chains he had not seemed so distraught as he did now A girl… she makes a jest

You swore The gods heard you swear

The gods did hear There was a knife in his hand suddenly its blade thin as her little finger Whether it was meant for her or him Arya could not say A girl will weep A girl will lose her only friend

You’re not my friend A friend would help me She stepped away from him balanced on the balls of her feet in case he threw his knife I’d never kill a friend

Jaqen’s smile came and went A girl might… name another name then if a friend did help

A girl might she said If a friend did help

The knife vanished Come

Now She had never thought he would act so quickly

A man hears the whisper of sand in a glass A man will not sleep until a girl unsays a certain name Now evil child

I’m not an evil child she thought I am a direwolf and the ghost in Harrenhal She put her broomstick back in its hiding place and followed him from the godswood

Despite the hour Harrenhal stirred with fitful life Vargo Hoat’s arrival had thrown off all the routines Ox carts oxen and horses had all vanished from the yard but the bear cage was still there It had been hung from the arched span of the bridge that divided the outer and middle wards suspended on heavy chains a few feet off the ground A ring of torches bathed the area in light Some of the boys from the stables were tossing stones to make the bear roar and grumble Across the ward light spilled through the door of the Barracks Hall accompanied by the clatter of tankards and men calling for more wine A dozen voices took up a song in a guttural tongue strange to Arya’s ears

They’re drinking and eating before they sleep she realized Pinkeye would have sent to wake me to help with the serving He’ll know I’m not abed But likely he was busy pouring for the Brave Companions and those of Ser Amory’s garrison who had joined them The noise they were making would be a good distraction

The hungry gods will feast on blood tonight if a man would do this thing Jaqen said Sweet girl kind and gentle Unsay one name and say another and cast this mad dream aside

I won’t

Just so He seemed resigned The thing will be done but a girl must obey A man has no time for talk

A girl will obey Arya said What should I do

A hundred men are hungry they must be fed the lord commands hot broth A girl must run to the kitchens and tell her pie boy

Broth she repeated Where will you be

A girl will help make broth and wait in the kitchens until a man comes for her Go Run

Hot Pie was pulling his loaves from the ovens when she burst into the kitchen but he was no longer alone They’d woken the cooks to feed Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers Serving men were carrying off baskets of Hot Pie’s bread and tarts the chief cook was carving cold slices off a ham spit boys were turning rabbits while the pot girls basted them with honey women were chopping onions and carrots What do you want Weasel the chief cook asked when he saw her

Broth she announced My lord wants broth

He jerked his carving knife at the black iron kettles hung over the flames What do you think that is Though I’d soon as piss in it as serve it to that goat Can’t even let a man have a night’s sleep He spat Well never you mind run back and tell him a kettle can’t be hurried
