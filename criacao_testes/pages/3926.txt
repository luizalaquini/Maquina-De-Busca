Cursing under his breath Merrett jammed his heels into his horse’s flanks and rode on up the hill As tempting as it was to drink the gold away he knew that if he didn’t come back with Petyr Pimple he had as well not come back at all

Lord Walder would soon turn two-and-ninety His ears had started to go his eyes were almost gone and his gout was so bad that he had to be carried everywhere He could not possibly last much longer all his sons agreed And when he goes everything will change and not for the better His father was querulous and stubborn with an iron will and a wasp’s tongue but he did believe in taking care of his own All of his own even the ones who had displeased and disappointed him Even the ones whose names he can’t remember Once he was gone though…

When Ser Stevron had been heir that was one thing The old man had been grooming Stevron for sixty years and had pounded it into his head that blood was blood But Stevron had died whilst campaigning with the Young Wolf in the west—of waiting no doubt Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven brought them the news—and his sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey Stevron’s son Ser Ryman stood to inherit now a thick-witted stubborn greedy man And after Ryman came his own sons Edwyn and Black Walder who were even worse Fortunately Lame Lothar once said they hate each other even more than they hate us

Merrett wasn’t certain that was fortunate at all and for that matter Lothar himself might be more dangerous than either of them Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin’s wedding but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton all the way down to which songs would be played Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn his back on him In the Twins you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted and them not very far

It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died and every daughter as well The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of his uncles nephews and cousins at the Twins the ones he happened to like or trust or more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him The rest of us he’ll shove out to fend for ourselves

The prospect worried Merrett more than words could say He would be forty in less than three years too old to take up the life of a hedge knight… even if he’d been a knight which as it happened he wasn’t He had no land no wealth of his own He owned the clothes on his back but not much else not even the horse he was riding He wasn’t clever enough to be a maester pious enough to be a septon or savage enough to be a sellsword The gods gave me no gift but birth and they stinted me there What good was it to be the son of a rich and powerful House if you were the ninth son When you took grandsons and great-grandsons into account Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than he did of inheriting the Twins

I have no luck he thought bitterly I have never had any bloody luck He was a big man broad around the chest and shoulders if only of middling height In the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy he knew but when he’d been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen his eldest full brother who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey’s brood As a boy he’d been packed off to Crakehall to serve his mother’s family as a page When old Lord Sumner had made him a squire everyone had assumed he would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years but the outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans While his fellow squire Jaime Lannister was covering himself in glory Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower then managed to get captured by a woman the one called the White Fawn Lord Sumner had ransomed him back from the outlaws but in the very next fight he’d been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken his helm and left him insensible for a fortnight Everyone gave him up for dead they told him later

Merrett hadn’t died but his fighting days were done Even the lightest blow to his head brought on blinding pain and reduced him to tears Under these circumstances knighthood was out of the question Lord Sumner told him not unkindly He was sent back to the Twins to face Lord Walder’s poisonous disdain

After that Merrett’s luck had only grown worse His father had managed to make a good marriage for him somehow he wed one of Lord Darry’s daughters back when the Darrys stood high in King Aerys’s favor But it seemed as if he no sooner had deflowered his bride than Aerys lost his throne Unlike the Freys the Darrys had been prominent Targaryen loyalists which cost them half their lands most of their wealth and almost all their power As for his lady wife she found him a great disappointment from the first and insisted on popping out nothing but girls for years three live ones a stillbirth and one that died in infancy before she finally produced a son His eldest daughter had turned out to be a slut his second a glutton When Ami was caught in the stables with no fewer than three grooms he’d been forced to marry her off to a bloody hedge knight That situation could not possibly get any worse he’d thought… until Ser Pate decided he could win renown by defeating Ser Gregor Clegane Ami had come running back a widow to Merrett’s dismay and the undoubted delight of every stablehand in the Twins

Merrett had dared to hope that his luck was finally changing when Roose Bolton chose to wed his Walda instead of one of her slimmer comelier cousins The Bolton alliance was important for House Frey and his daughter had helped secure it he thought that must surely count for something The old man had soon disabused him He picked her because she’s fat Lord Walder said You think Bolton gave a mummer’s fart that she was your whelp Think he sat about thinking ‘Heh Merrett Muttonhead that’s the very man I need for a good-father’ Your Walda’s a sow in silk that’s why he picked her and I’m not like to thank you for it We’d have had the same alliance at half the price if your little porkling put down her spoon from time to time

The final humiliation had been delivered with a smile when Lame Lothar had summoned him to discuss his role in Roslin’s wedding We must each play our part according to our gifts his half-brother told him You shall have one task and one task only Merrett but I believe you are well suited to it I want you to see to it that Greatjon Umber is so bloody drunk that he can hardly stand let alone fight

And even that I failed at He’d cozened the huge northman into drinking enough wine to kill any three normal men yet after Roslin had been bedded the Greatjon still managed to snatch the sword of the first man to accost him and break his arm in the snatching It had taken eight of them to get him into chains and the effort had left two men wounded one dead and poor old Ser Leslyn Haigh short half a ear When he couldn’t fight with his hands any longer Umber had fought with his teeth

Merrett paused a moment and closed his eyes His head was throbbing like that bloody drum they’d played at the wedding and for a moment it was all he could do to stay in the saddle I have to go on he told himself If he could bring back Petyr Pimple surely it would put him in Ser Ryman’s good graces Petyr might be a whisker on the hapless side but he wasn’t as cold as Edwyn nor as hot as Black Walder The boy will be grateful for my part and his father will see that I’m loyal a man worth having about

But only if he was there by sunset with the gold Merrett glanced at the sky Right on time He needed something to steady his hands He pulled up the waterskin hung from his saddle uncorked it and took a long swallow The wine was thick and sweet so dark it was almost black but gods it tasted good

The curtain wall of Oldstones had once encircled the brow of the hill like the crown on a king’s head Only the foundation remained and a few waist-high piles of crumbling stone spotted with lichen Merrett rode along the line of the wall until he came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood The ruins were more extensive here and he had to dismount to lead his palfrey through them In the west the sun had vanished behind a bank of low clouds Gorse and bracken covered the slopes and once inside the vanished walls the weeds were chest high Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked about warily but saw no outlaws Could I have come on the wrong day He stopped and rubbed his temples with his thumbs but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind his eyes Seven bloody hells…

From somewhere deep within the castle faint music came drifting through the trees

Merrett found himself shivering despite his cloak He pulled open his waterskin and had another drink of wine I could just get back on my horse ride to Oldtown and drink the gold away No good ever came from dealing with outlaws That vile little bitch Wenda had burned a fawn into the cheek of his arse while she had him captive No wonder his wife despised him I have to go through with this Petyr Pimple might be Lord of the Crossing one day Edwyn has no sons and Black Walder’s only got bastards Petyr will remember who came to get him He took another swallow corked the skin up and led his palfrey through broken stones gorse and thin wind-whipped trees following the sounds to what had been the castle ward

Fallen leaves lay thick upon the ground like soldiers after some great slaughter A man in patched faded greens was sitting crosslegged atop a weathered stone sepulcher fingering the strings of a woodharp The music was soft and sad Merrett knew the song High in the halls of the kings who are gone Jenny would dance with her ghosts…

Get off there Merrett said You’re sitting on a king

Old Tristifer don’t mind my bony arse The Hammer of Justice they called him Been a long while since he heard any new songs The outlaw hopped down Trim and slim he had a narrow face and foxy features but his mouth was so wide that his smile seemed to touch his ears A few strands of thin brown hair were blowing across his brow He pushed them back with his free hand and said Do you remember me my lord

No Merrett frowned Why would I

I sang at your daughter’s wedding And passing well I thought That Pate she married was a cousin We’re all cousins in Sevenstreams Didn’t stop him from turning niggard when it was time to pay me He shrugged Why is it your lord father never has me play at the Twins Don’t I make enough noise for his lordship He likes it loud I have been hearing

You bring the gold asked a harsher voice behind him

Merrett’s throat was dry Bloody outlaws always hiding in the bushes It had been the same in the kingswood You’d think you’d caught five of them and ten more would spring from nowhere

When he turned they were all around him an ill-favored gaggle of leathery old men and smooth-cheeked lads younger than Petyr Pimple the lot of them clad in roughspun rags boiled leather and bits of dead men’s armor There was one woman with them bundled up in a hooded cloak three times too big for her Merrett was too flustered to count them but there seemed to be a dozen at the least maybe a score

I asked a question The speaker was a big bearded man with crooked green teeth and a broken nose taller than Merrett though not so heavy in the belly A halfhelm covered his head a patched yellow cloak his broad shoulders Where’s our gold

in my saddlebag A hundred golden dragons Merrett cleared his throat You’ll get it when I see that Petyr—

A squat one-eyed outlaw strode forward before he could finish reached into the saddlebag bold as you please and found the sack Merrett started to grab him then thought better of it The outlaw opened the drawstring removed a coin and bit it Tastes right He hefted the sack Feels right too

They’re going to take the gold and keep Petyr too Merrett thought in sudden panic That’s the whole ransom All you asked for His palms were sweating He wiped them on his breeches Which one of you is Beric Dondarrion Dondarrion had been a lord before he turned outlaw he might still be a man of honor

Why that would be me said the one-eyed man

You’re a bloody liar Jack said the big bearded man in the yellow cloak It’s my turn to be Lord Beric

Does that mean I have to be Thoros The singer laughed My lord sad to say Lord Beric was needed elsewhere The times are troubled and there are many battles to fight But we’ll sort you out just as he would have no fear

Merrett had plenty of fear His head was pounding too Much more of this and he’d be sobbing You have your gold he said Give me my nephew and I’ll be gone Petyr was actually more a great half-nephew but there was no need to go into that

He’s in the godswood said the man in the yellow cloak We’ll take you to him Notch you hold his horse

Merrett handed over the bridle reluctantly He did not see what other choice he had My water skin he heard himself say A swallow of wine to settle my—

We don’t drink with your sort yellow cloak said curtly It’s this way Follow me

Leaves crunched beneath their heels and every step sent a spike of pain through Merrett’s temple They walked in silence the wind gusting around them The last light of the setting sun was in his eyes as he clambered over the mossy hummocks that were all that remained of the keep Behind was the godswood

Petyr Pimple was hanging from the limb of an oak a noose tight around his long thin neck His eyes bulged from a black face staring down at Merrett accusingly You came too late they seemed to say But he hadn’t He hadn’t He had come when they told him You killed him he croaked

Sharp as a blade this one said the one-eyed man

An aurochs was thundering through Merrett’s head Mother have mercy he thought I brought the gold

That was good of you said the singer amiably We’ll see that it’s put to good use

Merrett turned away from Petyr He could taste the bile in the back of his throat You… you had no right

We had a rope said yellow cloak That’s right enough

Two of the outlaws seized Merrett’s arms and bound them tight behind his back He was too deep in shock to struggle No was all he could manage I only came to ransom Petyr You said if you had the gold by sunset he wouldn’t be harmed…

Well said the singer you’ve got us there my lord That was a lie of sorts as it happens

The one-eyed outlaw came forward with a long coil of hempen rope He looped one end around Merrett’s neck pulled it tight and tied a hard knot under his ear The other end he threw over the limb of the oak The big man in the yellow cloak caught it

What are you doing Merrett knew how stupid that sounded but he could not believe what was happening even then You’d never dare hang a Frey

Yellow cloak laughed That other one the pimply boy he said the same thing

He doesn’t mean it He cannot mean it My father will pay you I’m worth a good ransom more than Petyr twice as much

The singer sighed Lord Walder might be half-blind and gouty but he’s not so stupid as to snap at the same bait twice Next time he’ll send a hundred swords instead of a hundred dragons I fear
