Lord Walder named the names My daughter Arwyn he said of a girl of fourteen Shirei my youngest trueborn daughter Ami and Marianne are granddaughters I married Ami to Ser Pate of Sevenstreams but the Mountain killed the oaf so I got her back That’s a Cersei but we call her Little Bee her mother’s a Beesbury More granddaughters One’s a Walda and the others… well they have names whatever they are…

I’m Merry Lord Grandfather one girl said

You’re noisy that’s for certain Next to Noisy is my daughter Tyta Then another Walda Alyx Marissa… are you Marissa I thought you were She’s not always bald The maester shaved her hair off but he swears it will soon grow back The twins are Serra and Sarra He squinted down at one of the younger girls Heh are you another Walda

The girl could not have been more than four I’m Ser Aemon Rivers’s Walda lord great grandfather She curtsied

How long have you been talking Not that you’re like to have anything sensible to say your father never did He’s a bastard’s son besides heh Go away I wanted only Freys up here The King in the North has no interest in base stock Lord Walder glanced to Robb as Jinglebell bobbed his head and chimed There they are all maidens Well and one widow but there’s some who like a woman broken in You might have had any one of them

It would have been an impossible choice my lord said Robb with careful courtesy They’re all too lovely

Lord Walder snorted And they say my eyes are bad Some will do well enough I suppose Others… well it makes no matter They weren’t good enough for the King in the North heh Now what is it you have to say

My ladies Robb looked desperately uncomfortable but he had known this moment must come and he faced it without flinching All men should keep their word kings most of all I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow The fault is not in you What I did was not done to slight you but because I loved another No words can set it right I know yet I come before you to ask forgiveness that the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends

The smaller girls fidgeted anxiously Their older sisters waited for Lord Walder on his black oak throne Jinglebell rocked back and forth bells chiming on collar and crown

Good the Lord of the Crossing said That was very good Your Grace ‘No words can set it right’ heh Well said well said At the wedding feast I hope you will not refuse to dance with my daughters It would please an old man’s heart heh He bobbed his wrinkled pink head up and down in much the same way his lackwit grandson did though Lord Walder wore no bells And here she is Lord Edmure My daughter Roslin my most precious little blossom heh

Ser Benfrey led her into the hall They looked enough alike to be full siblings Judging from their age both were children of the sixth Lady Frey a Rosby Catelyn seemed to recall

Roslin was small for her years her skin as white as if she had just risen from a milk bath Her face was comely with a small chin delicate nose and big brown eyes Thick chestnut hair fell in loose waves to a waist so tiny that Edmure would be able to put his hands around it Beneath the lacy bodice of her pale blue gown her breasts looked small but shapely

Your Grace The girl went to her knees Lord Edmure I hope I am not a disappointment to you

Far from it thought Catelyn Her brother’s face had lit up at the sight of her You are a delight to me my lady Edmure said And ever will be I know

Roslin had a small gap between two of her front teeth that made her shy with her smiles but the flaw was almost endearing Pretty enough Catelyn thought but so small and she comes of Rosby stock The Rosbys had never been robust She much preferred the frames of some of the older girls in the hall daughters or granddaughters she could not be sure They had a Crakehall look about them and Lord Walder’s third wife had been of that House Wide hips to bear children big breasts to nurse them strong arms to carry them The Crakehalls have always been a big-boned family and strong

My lord is kind the Lady Roslin said to Edmure

My lady is beautiful Edmure took her hand and drew her to her feet But why are you crying

For joy Roslin said I weep for joy my lord

Enough Lord Walder broke in You may weep and whisper after you’re wed heh Benfrey see your sister back to her chambers she has a wedding to prepare for And a bedding heh the sweetest part For all for all His mouth moved in and out We’ll have music such sweet music and wine heh the red will run and we’ll put some wrongs aright But now you’re weary and wet as well dripping on my floor There’s fires waiting for you and hot mulled wine and baths if you want ’em Lothar show our guests to their quarters

I need to see my men across the river my lord Robb said

They shan’t get lost Lord Walder complained They’ve crossed before haven’t they When you came down from the north You wanted crossing and I gave it to you and you never said mayhaps heh But suit yourself Lead each man across by the hand if you like it’s naught to me

My lord Catelyn had almost forgotten Some food would be most welcome We have ridden many leagues in the rain

Walder Frey’s mouth moved in and out Food heh A loaf of bread a bite of cheese mayhaps a sausage

Some wine to wash it down Robb said And salt

Bread and salt Heh Of course of course The old man clapped his hands together and servants came into the hall bearing flagons of wine and trays of bread cheese and butter Lord Walder took a cup of red himself and raised it high with a spotted hand My guests he said My honored guests Be welcome beneath my roof and at my table

We thank you for your hospitality my lord Robb replied Edmure echoed him along with the Greatjon Ser Marq Piper and the others They drank his wine and ate his bread and butter Catelyn tasted the wine and nibbled at some bread and felt much the better for it Now we should be safe she thought

Knowing how petty the old man could be she had expected their rooms to be bleak and cheerless But the Freys had made more than ample provision for them it seemed The bridal chamber was large and richly appointed dominated by a great featherbed with corner posts carved in the likeness of castle towers Its draperies were Tully red and blue a nice courtesy Sweet-smelling carpets covered a plank floor and a tall shuttered window opened to the south Catelyn’s own room was smaller but handsomely furnished and comfortable with a fire burning in the hearth Lame Lothar assured them that Robb would have an entire suite as befit a king If there is anything you require you need only tell one of the guards He bowed and withdrew limping heavily as he made his way down the curving steps

We should post our own guards Catelyn told her brother She would rest easier with Stark and Tully men outside her door The audience with Lord Walder had not been as painful as she feared yet all the same she would be glad to be done with this A few more days and Robb will be off to battle and me to a comfortable captivity at Seagard Lord Jason would show her every courtesy she had no doubt but the prospect still depressed her

She could hear the sounds of horses below as the long column of mounted men wound their way across the bridge from castle to castle The stones rumbled to the passage of heavy-laden wayns Catelyn went to the window and gazed out to watch Robb’s host emerge from the eastern twin The rain seems to be lessening

Now that we’re inside Edmure stood before the fire letting the warmth wash over him What did you make of Roslin

Too small and delicate Childbirth will go hard on her But her brother seemed well pleased with the girl so all she said was Sweet

I believe she liked me Why was she crying

She’s a maid on the eve of her wedding A few tears are to be expected Lysa had wept lakes the morning of their own wedding though she had managed to be dry-eyed and radiant when Jon Arryn swept his cream-and-blue cloak about her shoulders

She’s prettier than I dared hope Edmure raised a hand before she could speak I know there are more important things spare me the sermon septa Even so… did you see some of those other maids Frey trotted out The one with the twitch Was that the shaking sickness And those twins had more craters and eruptions on their faces than Petyr Pimple When I saw that lot I knew Roslin would be bald and one-eyed with Jinglebell’s wits and Black Walder’s temper But she seems gentle as well as fair He looked perplexed Why would the old weasel refuse to let me choose unless he meant to foist off someone hideous

Your fondness for a pretty face is well known Catelyn reminded him Perhaps Lord Walder actually wants you to be happy with your bride Or more like he did not want you balking over a boil and upsetting all his plans Or it may be that Roslin is the old man’s favorite The Lord of Riverrun is a much better match than most of his daughters can hope for

True Her brother still seemed uncertain however Is it possible the girl is barren

Lord Walder wants his grandson to inherit Riverrun How would it serve him to give you a barren wife

It rids him of a daughter no one else would take

Small good that will do him Walder Frey is a peevish man not a stupid one

Still… it is possible

Yes Catelyn conceded reluctantly There are illnesses a girl can have in childhood that leave her unable to conceive There’s no reason to believe that Lady Roslin was so afflicted though She looked round the room The Freys have received us more kindly than I had anticipated if truth be told

Edmure laughed A few barbed words and some unseemly gloating From him that’s courtesy I expected the old weasel to piss in our wine and make us praise the vintage

The jest left Catelyn strangely disquieted If you will excuse me I should change from these wet clothes

As you wish Edmure yawned I may nap an hour

She retreated to her own room The chest of clothes she’d brought from Riverrun had been carried up and laid at the foot of the bed After she’d undressed and hung her wet clothing by the fire she donned a warm wool dress of Tully red and blue washed and brushed her hair and let it dry and went in search of Freys

Lord Walder’s black oak throne was empty when she entered the hall but some of his sons were drinking by the fire Lame Lothar rose clumsily when he saw her Lady Catelyn I thought you would be resting How may I be of service

Are these your brothers she asked

Brothers half-brothers good brothers and nephews Raymund and I shared a mother Lord Lucias Vypren is my half-sister Lythene’s husband and Ser Damon is their son My half-brother Ser Hosteen I believe you know And this is Ser Leslyn Haigh and his sons Ser Harys and Ser Donnel

Well met sers Is Ser Perwyn about He helped escort me to Storm’s End and back when Robb sent me to speak with Lord Renly I was looking forward to seeing him again

Perwyn is away Lame Lothar said I shall give him your regards I know he will regret having missed you
