hath heard such things the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible
thing

1814 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock
of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another
place be forsaken  1815 Because my people hath forgotten me they
have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in
their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast
up 1816 To make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every
one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head

1817 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy I
will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their
calamity

1818 Then said they Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the
wise nor the word from the prophet Come and let us smite him with
the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words

1819 Give heed to me O LORD and hearken to the voice of them that
contend with me

1820 Shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit
for my soul Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them
and to turn away thy wrath from them

1821 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out
their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved
of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death
let their young men be slain by the sword in battle

1822 Let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a
troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and
hid snares for my feet

1823 Yet LORD thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me
forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight
but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the
time of thine anger

191 Thus saith the LORD Go and get a potters earthen bottle and
take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the
priests 192 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom which
is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that I
shall tell thee 193 And say Hear ye the word of the LORD O kings
of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem Thus saith the LORD of hosts
the God of Israel Behold I will bring evil upon this place the
which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle

194 Because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and
have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their
fathers have known nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place
with the blood of innocents 195 They have built also the high places
of Baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal
which I commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind
196 Therefore behold the days come saith the LORD that this place
shall no more be called Tophet nor The valley of the son of Hinnom
but The valley of slaughter

197 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this
place and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their
enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their
carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for
the beasts of the earth

198 And I will make this city desolate and an hissing every one
that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the
plagues thereof

199 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of
his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and
they that seek their lives shall straiten them

1910 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
with thee 1911 And shalt say unto them Thus saith the LORD of
hosts Even so will I break this people and this city as one breaketh
a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall
bury them in Tophet till there be no place to bury

1912 Thus will I do unto this place saith the LORD and to the
inhabitants thereof and even make this city as Tophet 1913 And the
houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be
defiled as the place of Tophet because of all the houses upon whose
roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have
poured out drink offerings unto other gods

1914 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet whither the LORD had sent him to
prophesy and he stood in the court of the LORDs house and said to
all the people 1915 Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel
Behold I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the
evil that I have pronounced against it because they have hardened
their necks that they might not hear my words

201 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest who was also chief
governor in the house of the LORD heard that Jeremiah prophesied
these things

202 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks
