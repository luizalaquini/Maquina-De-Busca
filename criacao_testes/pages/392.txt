Syria came up against him and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and
destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus

2424 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men
and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand because they
had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers So they executed judgment
against Joash

2425 And when they were departed from him for they left him in
great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he
died and they buried him in the city of David but they buried him
not in the sepulchres of the kings

2426 And these are they that conspired against him Zabad the son of
Shimeath an Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess

2427 Now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid
upon him and the repairing of the house of God behold they are
written in the story of the book of the kings And Amaziah his son
reigned in his stead

251 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and
he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem And his mothers name
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem

252 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD but not
with a perfect heart

253 Now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him
that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father

254 But he slew not their children but did as it is written in the
law in the book of Moses where the LORD commanded saying The
fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die
for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin

255 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains
over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of
their fathers throughout all Judah and Benjamin and he numbered them
from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand
choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and
shield

256 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
Israel for an hundred talents of silver

257 But there came a man of God to him saying O king let not the
army of Israel go with thee for the LORD is not with Israel to wit
with all the children of Ephraim

258 But if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle God shall
make thee fall before the enemy for God hath power to help and to
cast down

259 And Amaziah said to the man of God But what shall we do for the
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel And the man
of God answered The LORD is able to give thee much more than this

2510 Then Amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to
him out of Ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was
greatly kindled against Judah and they returned home in great anger

2511 And Amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and
went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of Seir ten
thousand

2512 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and
cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in
pieces

2513 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back that they
should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of Judah from
Samaria even unto Bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and
took much spoil

2514 Now it came to pass after that Amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the Edomites that he brought the gods of the children of
Seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before
them and burned incense unto them

2515 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah and
he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him Why hast thou sought
after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people
out of thine hand  2516 And it came to pass as he talked with him
that the king said unto him Art thou made of the kings counsel
forbear why shouldest thou be smitten Then the prophet forbare and
said I know that God hath determined to destroy thee because thou
hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel

2517 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice and sent to Joash the
son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu king of Israel saying Come let us
see one another in the face

2518 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon
saying Give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a
wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode down the thistle
