The ride back to Pyke promised to be a good deal more interesting than the ride down had been

When they were well beyond Lordsport Theon put a hand on her breast Esgred reached up and plucked it away I’d keep both hands on the reins or this black beast of yours is like to fling us both off and kick us to death

I broke him of that Amused Theon behaved himself for a while chatting amiably of the weather grey and overcast as it had been since he arrived with frequent rains and telling her of the men he’d killed in the Whispering Wood When he reached the part about coming that close to the Kingslayer himself he slid his hand back up to where it had been Her breasts were small but he liked the firmness of them

You don’t want to do that my lord prince

Oh but I do Theon gave her a squeeze

Your squire is watching you

Let him He’ll never speak of it I swear

Esgred pried his fingers off her breast This time she kept him firmly prisoned She had strong hands

I like a woman with a good tight grip

She snorted I’d not have thought it by that wench on the waterfront

You must not judge me by her She was the only woman on the ship

Tell me of your father Will he welcome me kindly to his castle

Why should he He scarcely welcomed me his own blood the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands

Are you she asked mildly It’s said that you have uncles brothers a sister

My brothers are long dead and my sister… well they say Asha’s favorite gown is a chainmail hauberk that hangs down past her knees with boiled leather smallclothes beneath Men’s garb won’t make her a man though I’ll make a good marriage alliance with her once we’ve won the war if I can find a man to take her As I recall she had a nose like a vulture’s beak a ripe crop of pimples and no more chest than a boy

You can marry off your sister Esgred observed but not your uncles

My uncles… Theon’s claim took precedence over those of his father’s three brothers but the woman had touched on a sore point nonetheless in the islands it was scarce unheard of for a strong ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights and usually murder him in the bargain But I am not weak Theon told himself and I mean to be stronger yet by the time my father dies My uncles pose no threat to me he declared Aeron is drunk on seawater and sanctity He lives only for his god—

His god Not yours

Mine as well What is dead can never die He smiled thinly If I make pious noises as required Damphair will give me no trouble And my uncle Victarion—

Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet and a fearsome warrior I have heard them sing of him in the alehouses

During my lord father’s rebellion he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and burned the Lannister fleet where it lay at anchor Theon recalled The plan was Euron’s though Victarion is like some great grey bullock strong and tireless and dutiful but not like to win any races No doubt he’ll serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father He has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal

Euron Croweye has no lack of cunning though I’ve heard men say terrible things of that one

Theon shifted his seat My uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two years He may be dead If so it might be for the best Lord Balon’s eldest brother had never given up the Old Way even for a day His Silence with its black sails and dark red hull was infamous in every port from Ibben to Asshai it was said

He may be dead Esgred agreed and if he lives why he has spent so long at sea he’d be half a stranger here The ironborn would never seat a stranger in the Seastone Chair

I suppose not Theon replied before it occurred to him that some would call him a stranger as well The thought made him frown Ten years is a long while but I am back now and my father is far from dead I have time to prove myself

He considered fondling Esgred’s breast again but she would probably only take his hand away and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat Time enough for such play at the castle in the privacy of his chambers I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke and see that you have an honored place at the feast he said I must sit on the dais at my father’s right hand but I will come down and join you when he leaves the hall He seldom lingers long He has no belly for drink these days

A grievous thing when a great man grows old
