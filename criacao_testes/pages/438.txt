He was angry with that cook’s boy who spilled the soup last night as well but he didn’t strip him naked

This was not a matter of some spilled soup—

No it was a matter of some pretty teats After that business in the yard Tyrion had spoken with Varys about how they might arrange for Joffrey to visit Chataya’s A taste of honey might sweeten the boy he hoped He might even be grateful gods forbid and Tyrion could do with a shade more gratitude from his sovereign It would need to be done secretly of course The tricky bit would be parting him from the Hound The dog is never far from his master’s heels he’d observed to Varys but all men sleep And some gamble and whore and visit winesinks as well

The Hound does all these things if that is your question

No said Tyrion My question is when

Varys had laid a finger on his cheek smiling enigmatically My lord a suspicious man might think you wished to find a time when Sandor Clegane was not protecting King Joffrey the better to do the boy some harm

Surely you know me better than that Lord Varys Tyrion said Why all I want is for Joffrey to love me

The eunuch had promised to look into the matter The war made its own demands though Joffrey’s initiation into manhood would need to wait Doubtless you know your son better than I do he made himself tell Cersei but regardless there’s still much to be said for a Tyrell marriage It may be the only way that Joffrey lives long enough to reach his wedding night

Littlefinger agreed The Stark girl brings Joffrey nothing but her body sweet as that may be Margaery Tyrell brings fifty thousand swords and all the strength of Highgarden

Indeed Varys laid a soft hand on the queen’s sleeve You have a mother’s heart and I know His Grace loves his little sweetling Yet kings must learn to put the needs of the realm before their own desires I say this offer must be made

The queen pulled free of the eunuch’s touch You would not speak so if you were women Say what you will my lords but Joffrey is too proud to settle for Renly’s leavings He will never consent

Tyrion shrugged When the king comes of age in three years he may give or withhold his consent as he pleases Until then you are his regent and I am his Hand and he will marry whomever we tell him to marry Leavings or no

Cersei’s quiver was empty Make your offer then but gods save you all if Joff does not like this girl

I’m so pleased we can agree Tyrion said Now which of us shall go to Bitterbridge We must reach Ser Loras with our offer before his blood can cool

You mean to send one of the council

I can scarcely expect the Knight of Flowers to treat with Bronn or Shagga can I The Tyrells are proud

His sister wasted no time trying to twist the situation to her advantage Ser Jacelyn Bywater is nobly born Send him

Tyrion shook his head We need someone who can do more than repeat our words and fetch back a reply Our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly

The Hand speaks with the king’s voice Candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in Cersei’s eyes If we send you Tyrion it will be as if Joffrey went himself And who better You wield words as skillfully as Jaime wields a sword

Are you that eager to get me out of the city Cersei You are too kind sister but it seems to me that a boy’s mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle And you have a gift for winning friends that I could never hope to match

Her eyes narrowed Joff needs me at his side

Your Grace my lord Hand said Littlefinger the king needs both of you here Let me go in your stead

You What gain does he see in this Tyrion wondered

I am of the king’s council yet not the king’s blood so I would make a poor hostage I knew Ser Loras passing well when he was here at court and gave him no cause to mislike me Mace Tyrell bears me no enmity that I know of and I flatter myself that I am not unskilled in negotiation

He has us Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish nor did he want the man out of his sight yet what other choice was left him It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself and he knew full well that if he left King’s Landing for any length of time all that he had managed to accomplish would be undone There is fighting between here and Bitterbridge he said cautiously And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brother’s wayward lambs

I’ve never been frightened of shepherds It’s the sheep who trouble me Still I suppose an escort might be in order

I can spare a hundred gold cloaks Tyrion said
