the source syllable can be replicated for each
additional syllable in corresponding
position in the target
Of course a stressed syllable should be selected for copying
if the unmatched target syllable is stressed
and similarly for unstressed ones
It is rather dangerous to copy exactly a part of a pitch
contour for the ear is very sensitive to the juxtaposition of
identically intoned segments of speech em especially when the segment is stressed
To avoid this whenever a stressed syllable is replicated the
pitch values should be decreased by say 20 on the second copy
It sometimes happens that a single stressed syllable in the source
needs to cover a stressed-unstressed pair in the target  in
this case the first part of the source pitch track can be used
for the stressed syllable and the remainder for the
unstressed one

The example of Figure 82 will help to make these rules clear
FC Figure 82
Note that the marking alone is done by hand
The detailed mapping decisions can be left to the computer
The rules were derived intuitively and do not have any sound theoretical
basis
They are intended to give reasonable results in the majority of cases

Figure 83 shows the result of transferring the pitch from the price is ten
cents to the price is seventy-seven cents
FC Figure 83
The syllable boundaries which are marked were determined automatically
The use of the last 30 of the
ten contour to cover the first -en syllable and its replication
to serve the -ty syllable can be seen
However the 70em30 proportion is applied to the source contour
and the linear distortion described next upsets the proportion in the
target utterance
The contour of the second seven can be seen to be a
replication of that of the first one lowered by 20
Notice that the pitch extraction procedure has introduced an artifact into the final
part of one of the cents contours by doubling the pitch
rh Stretching and squashing
The pitch contour over a source syllable nucleus must be stretched
or squashed to match the duration
of the target nucleus
It is difficult to see how anything other than linear stretching
and squashing could be done without considerably increasing the
complexity of the procedure
The gross non-linearities will have been accounted for
by the syllable alignment process and so simple linear time-distortion
should not cause too much degradation
rh Pitch discontinuities
Sudden jumps in pitch during voiced speech sound peculiar
although they can in fact be produced naturally by yodelling
People frequently burst into laughter on hearing them in synthetic speech
It is particularly important to avoid this diverting effect in
voice response applications
for the listeners attention is instantly directed
away from what is said to the voice that speaks
pp
Discontinuities can arise in the pitch-transfer procedure either by a
voiced-unvoiced-voiced transition between syllables mapping on to
a voiced-voiced transition in the target
or by voicing continuity being broken when the syllable
alignment procedure drops or replicates a syllable
There are several ways in which at least some of the possibilities can
be avoided
For example one could hold unstressed syllables at a constant pitch
whose value coincides with either the end of the previous
syllables contour or the beginning of the next syllables contour
depending on which transition is voiced
Alternatively the policy of reserving the trailing part
of a stressed syllable in the source to cover an unmatched following
unstressed syllable in the target could be generalized to allow use of the leading 30
of the next stressed syllables contour instead
if that maintained voicing continuity
A third solution is simply to merge the pitch contours
at a discontinuity by mixing the average pitch value at the break
with the pitch contour on either side of it in a proportion which
increases linearly from the edges of the domain of influence to the discontinuity
Figure 84 shows the effect of this merging
when the pitch contour of the price is seven cents
is transferred to the price is eleven cents
FC Figure 84
Of course the
interpolated part will not necessarily be linear
rh Results of an experiment on pitch transfer
Some experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance
of this pitch transfer method on the kind of utterances discussed above
Witten 1979

Witten 1979 On transferring pitch from one utterance to another

First the source and target sentences
were chosen to be lexically identical that is the same words were spoken
For this experiment alone
expert judges were employed
Each sentence was recorded twice by the same person
and pitch was transferred from copy A
to copy B and vice versa  Also the originals were resynthesized from their linear
predictive coefficients with their own pitch contours
Although all four often sounded extremely similar sometimes the pitch
