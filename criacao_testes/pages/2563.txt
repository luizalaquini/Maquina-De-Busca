529 O that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me
and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them
and with their children for ever  530 Go say to them Get you into
your tents again

531 But as for thee stand thou here by me and I will speak unto
thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which
thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which I give
them to possess it

532 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the
left

533 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and
that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess

61 Now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments
which the LORD your God commanded to teach you that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go to possess it 62 That thou mightest fear
the LORD thy God to keep all his statutes and his commandments which
I command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of
thy life and that thy days may be prolonged

63 Hear therefore O Israel and observe to do it that it may be
well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the LORD God of
thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and
honey

64 Hear O Israel The LORD our God is one LORD 65 And thou shalt
love the LORD thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and
with all thy might

66 And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine
heart 67 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou
walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up

68 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes

69 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy
gates

610 And it shall be when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac
and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou
buildedst not 611 And houses full of all good things which thou
filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and
olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and
be full 612 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD which brought
thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage

613 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God and serve him and shalt swear
by his name

614 Ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which
are round about you 615 For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among
you lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee and
destroy thee from off the face of the earth

616 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God as ye tempted him in
Massah

617 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God
and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee

618 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
the LORD that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in
and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers

619 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the LORD hath
spoken

620 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying What mean
the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the LORD
our God hath commanded you  621 Then thou shalt say unto thy son We
were Pharaohs bondmen in Egypt and the LORD brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand 622 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders great
and sore upon Egypt upon Pharaoh and upon all his household before
our eyes 623 And he brought us out from thence that he might bring
us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers

624 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the
LORD our God for our good always that he might preserve us alive as
it is at this day

625 And it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these
commandments before the LORD our God as he hath commanded us

71 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the
Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites
and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites seven nations
greater and mightier than thou 72 And when the LORD thy God shall
deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy
them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them
73 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou
