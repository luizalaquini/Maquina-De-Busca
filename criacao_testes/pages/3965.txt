me to give a couple to whoever Im staying with tonight I
say For keeping me
Isnt the honor of the thing enough he says
Youd think I reply But words gotten out that
mockingjays are hazardous to your health
We pluck in silence for a while longer Then he says I
saw Peeta yesterday Through the glass
Whatd you think I ask
Something selfish says Gale
That you dont have to be jealous of him anymore
My fingers give a yank and a cloud of feathers floats down
around us
No Just the opposite Gale pulls a feather out of my
hair I thoughtIll never compete with that No matter how
much pain Im in He spins the feather between his thumb
and forefinger I dont stand a chance if he doesnt get
better Youll never be able to let him go Youll always feel
wrong about being with me
The way I always felt wrong kissing him because of
you I say
Gale holds my gaze If I thought that was true I could
almost live with the rest of it
It is true I admit But so is what you said about
Peeta
Gale makes a sound of exasperation Nonetheless
after weve dropped off the birds and volunteered to go
back to the woods to gather kindling for the evening fire I
find myself wrapped in his arms His lips brushing the faded
bruises on my neck working their way to my mouth
Despite what I feel for Peeta this is when I accept deep
down that hell never come back to me Or Ill never go back
to him Ill stay in 2 until it falls go to the Capitol and kill
Snow and then die for my trouble And hell die insane and
hating me So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kiss
Gale to make up for all the kisses Ive withheld and
because it doesnt matter anymore and because Im so
desperately lonely I cant stand it
Gales touch and taste and heat remind me that at
least my bodys still alive and for the moment its a
welcome feeling I empty my mind and let the sensations
run through my flesh happy to lose myself When Gale pulls
away slightly I move forward to close the gap but I feel his
hand under my chin Katniss he says The instant I open
my eyes the world seems disjointed This is not our woods
or our mountains or our way My hand automatically goes to
the scar on my left temple which I associate with confusion
Now kiss me Bewildered unblinking I stand there while
he leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly He
examines my face closely Whats going on in your head
I dont know I whisper back
Then its like kissing someone whos drunk It doesnt
count he says with a weak attempt at a laugh He scoops
up a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty arms
returning me to myself
How do you know I say mostly to cover my
embarrassment Have you kissed someone whos drunk
I guess Gale couldve been kissing girls right and left back
in 12 He certainly had enough takers I never thought about
it much before
He just shakes his head No But its not hard to
imagine
So you never kissed any other girls I ask
I didnt say that You know you were only twelve when
we met And a real pain besides I did have a life outside of
hunting with you he says loading up with firewood
Suddenly Im genuinely curious Who did you kiss
And where
Too many to remember Behind the school on the
slag heap you name it he says
I roll my eyes So when did I become so special
When they carted me off to the Capitol
No About six months before that Right after New
Years We were in the Hob eating some slop of Greasy
Saes And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbit
for one of his kisses And I realizedI minded he tells me
I remember that day Bitter cold and dark by four in the
afternoon Wed been hunting but a heavy snow had driven
us back into town The Hob was crowded with people
looking for refuge from the weather Greasy Saes soup
made with stock from the bones of a wild dog wed shot a
week earlier was below her usual standards Still it was
hot and I was starving as I scooped it up sitting crosslegged
on her counter Darius was leaning on the post of
the stall tickling my cheek with the end of my braid while I
smacked his hand away He was explaining why one of his
kisses merited a rabbit or possibly two since everyone
knows redheaded men are the most virile And Greasy Sae
and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and
persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob
who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his
lips See The one in the green muffler Go ahead and
ask her If you need a reference
A million miles from here a billion days ago this
happened Darius was just joking around I say
Probably Although youd be the last to figure out if he
wasnt Gale tells me Take Peeta Take me Or even
Finnick I was starting to worry he had his eye on you but
he seems back on track now
You dont know Finnick if you think hed love me I
say
