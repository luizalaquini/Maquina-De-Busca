1716 Now therefore send quickly and tell David saying Lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over
lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him

1717 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel for they might not
be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and
they went and told king David

1718 Nevertheless a lad saw them and told Absalom but they went
both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in Bahurim which
had a well in his court whither they went down

1719 And the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth
and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known

1720 And when Absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they
said Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan And the woman said unto them
They be gone over the brook of water And when they had sought and
could not find them they returned to Jerusalem

1721 And it came to pass after they were departed that they came up
out of the well and went and told king David and said unto David
Arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath Ahithophel
counselled against you

1722 Then David arose and all the people that were with him and
they passed over Jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of
them that was not gone over Jordan

1723 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he
saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his
city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died
and was buried in the sepulchre of his father

1724 Then David came to Mahanaim And Absalom passed over Jordan he
and all the men of Israel with him

1725 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab
which Amasa was a mans son whose name was Ithra an Israelite that
went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash sister to Zeruiah Joabs
mother

1726 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead

1727 And it came to pass when David was come to Mahanaim that Shobi
the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon and Machir the
son of Ammiel of Lodebar and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim
1728 Brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and
barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and
parched pulse 1729 And honey and butter and sheep and cheese of
kine for David and for the people that were with him to eat for
they said The people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the
wilderness

181 And David numbered the people that were with him and set
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them

182 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
Joab and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah
Joabs brother and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite
And the king said unto the people I will surely go forth with you
myself also

183 But the people answered Thou shalt not go forth for if we flee
away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they
care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now
it is better that thou succour us out of the city

184 And the king said unto them What seemeth you best I will do And
the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by
hundreds and by thousands

185 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai saying Deal
gently for my sake with the young man even with Absalom And all the
people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
Absalom

186 So the people went out into the field against Israel and the
battle was in the wood of Ephraim 187 Where the people of Israel
were slain before the servants of David and there was there a great
slaughter that day of twenty thousand men

188 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword
devoured

189 And Absalom met the servants of David And Absalom rode upon a
mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his
head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven
and the earth and the mule that was under him went away

1810 And a certain man saw it and told Joab and said Behold I saw
Absalom hanged in an oak

1811 And Joab said unto the man that told him And behold thou
sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and
I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle

1812 And the man said unto Joab Though I should receive a thousand
