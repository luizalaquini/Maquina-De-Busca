Captain ser His son Matthos was at his elbow Your helm Davos took it with both hands and slid it over his head The pothelm was visorless he hated having his vision impeded

By then the pitch pots were raining down around them He saw one shatter on the deck of Lady Marya but Allard’s crew quickly beat it out To port warhorns sounded from the Pride of Driftmark The oars flung up sprays of water with every stroke The yard-long shaft of a scorpion came down not two feet from Matthos and sank into the wood of the deck thrumming Ahead the first line was within bowshot of the enemy flights of arrows flew between the ships hissing like striking snakes

South of the Blackwater Davos saw men dragging crude rafts toward the water while ranks and columns formed up beneath a thousand streaming banners The fiery heart was everywhere though the tiny black stag imprisoned in the flames was too small to make out We should be flying the crowned stag he thought The stag was King Robert’s sigil the city would rejoice to see it This stranger’s standard serves only to set men against us

He could not behold the fiery heart without thinking of the shadow Melisandre had birthed in the gloom beneath Storm’s End At least we fight this battle in the light with the weapons of honest men he told himself The red woman and her dark children would have no part of it Stannis had shipped her back to Dragonstone with his bastard nephew Edric Storm His captains and bannermen had insisted that a battlefield was no place for a woman Only the queen’s men had dissented and then not loudly All the same the king had been on the point of refusing them until Lord Bryce Caron said Your Grace if the sorceress is with us afterward men will say it was her victory not yours They will say you owe your crown to her spells That had turned the tide Davos himself had held his tongue during the arguments but if truth be told he had not been sad to see the back of her He wanted no part of Melisandre or her god

To starboard Devotion drove toward shore sliding out a plank Archers scrambled into the shallows holding their bows high over their heads to keep the strings dry They splashed ashore on the narrow strand beneath the bluffs Rocks came bouncing down from the castle to crash among them and arrows and spears as well but the angle was steep and the missiles seemed to do little damage

Prayer landed two dozen yards upstream and Piety was slanting toward the bank when the defenders came pounding down the riverside the hooves of their warhorses sending up gouts of water from the shallows The knights fell among the archers like wolves among chickens driving them back toward the ships and into the river before most could notch an arrow Men-at-arms rushed to defend them with spear and axe and in three heartbeats the scene had turned to blood-soaked chaos Davos recognized the dog’s-head helm of the Hound A white cloak streamed from his shoulders as he rode his horse up the plank onto the deck of Prayer hacking down anyone who blundered within reach

Beyond the castle King’s Landing rose on its hills behind the encircling walls The riverfront was a blackened desolation the Lannisters had burned everything and pulled back within the Mud Gate The charred spars of sunken hulks sat in the shallows forbidding access to the long stone quays We shall have no landing there He could see the tops of three huge trebuchets behind the Mud Gate High on Visenya’s Hill sunlight blazed off the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor

Davos never saw the battle joined but he heard it a great rending crash as two galleys came together He could not say which two Another impact echoed over the water an instant later and then a third Beneath the screech of splintering wood he heard the deep thrum-thump of the Fury’s fore catapult Stag of the Sea split one of Joffrey’s galleys clean in two but Dog’s Nose was afire and Queen Alysanne was locked between Lady of Silk and Lady’s Shame her crew fighting the boarders rail-to-rail

Directly ahead Davos saw the enemy’s Kingslander drive between Faithful and Sceptre The former slid her starboard oars out of the way before impact but Sceptre’s portside oars snapped like so much kindling as Kingslander raked along her side Loose Davos commanded and his bowmen sent a withering rain of shafts across the water He saw Kingslander’s captain fall and tried to recall the man’s name

Ashore the arms of the great trebuchets rose one two three and a hundred stones climbed high into the yellow sky Each one was as large as a man’s head when they fell they sent up great gouts of water smashed through oak planking and turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle All across the river the first line was engaged Grappling hooks were flung out iron rams crashed through wooden hulls boarders swarmed flights of arrows whispered through each other in the drifting smoke and men died    but so far none of his

Black Betha swept upriver the sound of her oarmaster’s drum thundering in her captain’s head as he looked for a likely victim for her ram The beleaguered Queen Alysanne was trapped between two Lannister warships the three made fast by hooks and lines

Ramming speed Davos shouted

The drumbeats blurred into a long fevered hammering and Black Betha flew the water turning white as milk as it parted for her prow Allard had seen the same chance Lady Marya ran beside them The first line had been transformed into a confusion of separate struggles The three tangled ships loomed ahead turning their decks a red chaos as men hacked at each other with sword and axe A little more Davos Seaworth beseeched the Warrior bring her around a little more show me her broadside

The Warrior must have been listening Black Betha and Lady Marya slammed into the side of Lady’s Shame within an instant of each other ramming her fore and aft with such force that men were thrown off the deck of Lady of Silk three boats away Davos almost bit his tongue off when his teeth jarred together He spat out blood Next time close your mouth you fool Forty years at sea and yet this was the first time he’d rammed another ship His archers were loosing arrows at will

Back water he commanded When Black Betha reversed her oars the river rushed into the splintered hole she left and Lady’s Shame fell to pieces before his eyes spilling dozens of men into the river Some of the living swam some of the dead floated the ones in heavy mail and plate sank to the bottom the quick and the dead alike The pleas of drowning men echoed in his ears

A flash of green caught his eye ahead and off to port and a nest of writhing emerald serpents rose burning and hissing from the stern of Queen Alysanne An instant later Davos heard the dread cry of Wildfire

He grimaced Burning pitch was one thing wildfire quite another Evil stuff and well-nigh unquenchable Smother it under a cloak and the cloak took fire slap at a fleck of it with your palm and your hand was aflame Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off old seamen liked to say Still Ser Imry had warned them to expect a taste of the alchemists’ vile substance Fortunately there were few true pyromancers left They will soon run out Ser Imry had assured them

Davos reeled off commands one bank of oars pushed off while the other backed water and the galley came about Lady Marya had won clear too and a good thing the fire was spreading over Queen Alysanne and her foes faster than he would have believed possible Men wreathed in green flame leapt into the water shrieking like nothing human On the walls of King’s Landing spitfires were belching death and the great trebuchets behind the Mud Gate were throwing boulders One the size of an ox crashed down between Black Betha and Wraith rocking both ships and soaking every man on deck Another not much smaller found Bold Laughter The Velaryon galley exploded like a child’s toy dropped from a tower spraying splinters as long as a man’s arm

Through black smoke and swirling green fire Davos glimpsed a swarm of small boats bearing downriver a confusion of ferries and wherries barges skiffs rowboats and hulks that looked too rotten to float It stank of desperation such driftwood could not turn the tide of a fight only get in the way The lines of battle were hopelessly ensnarled he saw Off to port Lord Steffon Ragged Jenna and Swift Sword had broken through and were sweeping upriver The starboard wing was heavily engaged however and the center had shattered under the stones of those trebuchets some captains turning downstream others veering to port anything to escape that crushing rain Fury had swung her aft catapult to fire back at the city but she lacked the range the barrels of pitch were shattering under the walls Sceptre had lost most of her oars and Faithful had been rammed and was starting to list He took Black Betha between them and struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei’s ornate carved-and-gilded pleasure barge laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now The collision spilled a dozen of them into the river where Betha’s archers picked them off as they tried to stay afloat

Matthos’s shout alerted him to the danger from port one of the Lannister galleys was coming about to ram Hard to starboard Davos shouted His men used their oars to push free of the barge while others turned the galley so her prow faced the onrushing White Hart For a moment he feared he’d been too slow that he was about to be sunk but the current helped swing Black Betha and when the impact came it was only a glancing blow the two hulls scraping against each other both ships snapping oars A jagged piece of wood flew past his head sharp as any spear Davos flinched Board her he shouted Grappling lines were flung He drew his sword and led them over the rail himself

The crew of the White Hart met them at the rail but Black Betha’s men-at-arms swept over them in a screaming steel tide Davos fought through the press looking for the other captain but the man was dead before he reached him As he stood over the body someone caught him from behind with an axe but his helm turned the blow and his skull was left ringing when it might have been split Dazed it was all he could do to roll His attacker charged screaming Davos grasped his sword in both hands and drove it up point first into the man’s belly

One of his crewmen pulled him back to his feet Captain ser the Hart is ours It was true Davos saw Most of the enemy were dead dying or yielded He took off his helm wiped blood from his face and made his way back to his own ship trodding carefully on boards slimy with men’s guts Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail

For those few instants Black Betha and White Hart were the calm eye in the midst of the storm Queen Alysanne and Lady of Silk still locked together were a ranging green inferno drifting downriver and dragging pieces of Lady’s Shame One of the Myrish galleys had slammed into them and was now afire as well Cat was taking on men from the fast-sinking Courageous The captain of Dragonsbane had driven her between two quays ripping out her bottom her crew poured ashore with the archers and men-at-arms to join the assault on the walls Red Raven rammed was slowly listing Stag of the Sea was fighting fires and boarders both but the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey’s Loyal Man Fury her proud bow smashed in by a boulder was engaged with Godsgrace He saw Lord Velaryon’s Pride of Driftmark crash between two Lannister river runners overturning one and lighting the other up with fire arrows On the south bank knights were leading their mounts aboard the cogs and some of the smaller galleys were already making their way across laden with men-at-arms They had to thread cautiously between sinking ships and patches of drifting wildfire The whole of King Stannis’s fleet was in the river now save for Salladhor Saan’s Lyseni Soon enough they would control the Blackwater Ser Imry will have his victory Davos thought and Stannis will bring his host across but gods be good the cost of this   

Captain ser Matthos touched his shoulder

It was Swordfish her two banks of oars lifting and falling She had never brought down her sails and some burning pitch had caught in her rigging The flames spread as Davos watched creeping out over ropes and sails until she trailed a head of yellow flame Her ungainly iron ram fashioned after the likeness of the fish from which she took her name parted the surface of the river before her Directly ahead drifting toward her and swinging around to present a tempting plump target was one of the Lannister hulks floating low in the water Slow green blood was leaking out between her boards

When he saw that Davos Seaworth’s heart stopped beating

No he said No NOOOOOO Above the roar and crash of battle no one heard him but Matthos Certainly the captain of the Swordfish did not intent as he was on finally spearing something with his ungainly fat sword The Swordfish went to battle speed Davos lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones

With a grinding splintering tearing crash Swordfish split the rotted hulk asunder She burst like an overripe fruit but no fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars poison from the entrails of a dying beast glistening shining spreading across the surface of the river   

Back water he roared Away Get us off her back water back water The grappling lines were cut and Davos felt the deck move under his feet as Black Betha pushed free of White Hart Her oars slid down into the water

Then he heard a short sharp woof as if someone had blown in his ear Half a heartbeat later came the roar The deck vanished beneath him and black water smashed him across the face filling his nose and mouth He was choking drowning Unsure which way was up Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly he broke the surface He spat out water sucked in air grabbed hold of the nearest chunk of debris and held on

Swordfish and the hulk were gone blackened bodies were floating downstream beside him and choking men clinging to bits of smoking wood Fifty feet high a swirling demon of green flame danced upon the river It had a dozen hands in each a whip and whatever they touched burst into fire He saw Black Betha burning and White Hart and Loyal Man to either side Piety Cat Courageous Sceptre Red Raven Harridan Faithful Fury they had all gone up Kingslander and Godsgrace as well the demon was eating his own Lord Velaryon’s shining Pride of Driftmark was trying to turn but the demon ran a lazy green finger across her silvery oars and they flared up like so many tapers For an instant she seemed to be stroking the river with two banks of long bright torches

The current had him in its teeth by then spinning him around and around He kicked to avoid a floating patch of wildfire My sons Davos thought but there was no way to look for them amidst the roaring chaos Another hulk heavy with wildfire went up behind him The Blackwater itself seemed to boil in its bed and burning spars and burning men and pieces of broken ships filled the air

I’m being swept out into the bay It wouldn’t be as bad there he ought to be able to make shore he was a strong swimmer Salladhor Saan’s galleys would be out in the bay as well Ser Imry had commanded them to stand off   

And then the current turned him about again and Davos saw what awaited him downstream

The chain Gods save us they’ve raised the chain

Where the river broadened out into Blackwater Bay the boom stretched taut a bare two or three feet above the water Already a dozen galleys had crashed into it and the current was pushing others against them Almost all were aflame and the rest soon would be Davos could make out the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan’s ships beyond but he knew he would never reach them A wall of red-hot steel blazing wood and swirling green flame stretched before him The mouth of the Blackwater Rush had turned into the mouth of hell





TYRION

Motionless as a gargoyle Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon Beyond the Mud Gate and the desolation that had once been the fishmarket and wharves the river itself seemed to have taken fire Half of Stannis’s fleet was ablaze along with most of Joffrey’s The kiss of wildfire turned proud ships into funeral pyres and men into living torches The air was full of smoke and arrows and screams

Downstream commoners and highborn captains alike could see the hot green death swirling toward their rafts and carracks and ferries borne on the current of the Blackwater The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as they fought to come about but it was no good The centipedes had no place to run

A dozen great fires raged under the city walls where casks of burning pitch had exploded but the wildfire reduced them to no more than candles in a burning house their orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust The low clouds caught the color of the burning river and roofed the sky in shades of shifting green eerily beautiful A terrible beauty Like dragonfire Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror had felt like this as he flew above his Field of Fire

The furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face yet he could not turn away He was dimly aware of the gold cloaks cheering from the hoardings He had no voice to join them It was a half victory It will not be enough

He saw another of the hulks he’d stuffed full of King Aerys’s fickle fruits engulfed by the hungry flames A fountain of burning jade rose from the river the blast so bright he had to shield his eyes Plumes of fire thirty and forty feet high danced upon the waters crackling and hissing For a few moments they washed out the screams There were hundreds in the water drowning or burning or doing a little of both

Do you hear them shrieking Stannis Do you see them burning This is your work as much as mine Somewhere in that seething mass of men south of the Blackwater Stannis was watching too Tyrion knew He’d never had his brother Robert’s thirst for battle He would command from the rear from the reserve much as Lord Tywin Lannister was wont to do Like as not he was sitting a warhorse right now clad in bright armor his crown upon his head A crown of red gold Varys says its points fashioned in the shapes of flames

My ships Joffrey’s voice cracked as he shouted up from the wallwalk where he huddled with his guards behind the ramparts The golden circlet of kingship adorned his battle helm My Kingslander’s burning Queen Cersei Loyal Man Look that’s Seaflower there He pointed with his new sword out to where the green flames were licking at Seaflower’s golden hull and creeping up her oars Her captain had turned her upriver but not quickly enough to evade the wildfire

She was doomed Tyrion knew There was no other way If we had not come forth to meet them Stannis would have sensed the trap An arrow could be aimed and a spear even the stone from a catapult but wildfire had a will of its own Once loosed it was beyond the control of mere men It could not be helped he told his nephew Our fleet was doomed in any case

Even from atop the merlon—he had been too short to see over the ramparts so he’d had them boost him up—the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle but he had seen it a thousand times in his mind’s eye Bronn would have whipped the oxen into motion the moment Stannis’s flagship passed under the Red Keep the chain was ponderous heavy and the great winches turned but slowly creaking and rumbling The whole of the usurper’s fleet would have passed by the time the first glimmer of metal could be seen beneath the water The links would emerge dripping wet some glistening with mud link by link by link until the whole great chain stretched taut King Stannis had rowed his fleet up the Blackwater but he would not row out again

Even so some were getting away A river’s current was a tricky thing and the wildfire was not spreading as evenly as he had hoped The main channel was all aflame but a good many of the Myrmen had made for the south bank and looked to escape unscathed and at least eight ships had landed under the city walls Landed or wrecked but it comes to the same thing they’ve put men ashore Worse a good part of the south wing of the enemy’s first two battle lines had been well upstream of the inferno when the hulks went up Stannis would be left with thirty or forty galleys at a guess more than enough to bring his whole host across once they had regained their courage

That might take a bit of time even the bravest would be dismayed after watching a thousand or so of his fellows consumed by wildfire Hallyne said that sometimes the substance burned so hot that flesh melted like tallow Yet even so
