I am no maester to quote history at you Your Grace Swords have been my life not books But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness Your father was not the first King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin Every time a new Targaryen is born he said the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land

Jaehaerys This old man knew my grandfather The thought gave her pause Most of what she knew of Westeros had come from her brother and the rest from Ser Jorah Ser Barristan would have forgotten more than the two of them had ever known This man can tell me what I came from So I am a coin in the hands of some god is that what you are saying ser

No Ser Barristan replied You are the trueborn heir of Westeros To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight should you find me worthy to bear a sword again If not I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire

What if I decide you’re only worthy to be my fool Dany asked scornfully Or perhaps my cook

I would be honored Your Grace Selmy said with quiet dignity I can bake apples and boil beef as well as any man and I’ve roasted many a duck over a campfire I hope you like them greasy with charred skin and bloody bones

That made her smile I’d have to be mad to eat such fare Ben Plumm come give Ser Barristan your longsword

But Whitebeard would not take it I flung my sword at Joffrey’s feet and have not touched one since Only from the hand of my queen will I accept a sword again

As you wish Dany took the sword from Brown Ben and offered it hilt first The old man took it reverently Now kneel she told him and swear it to my service

He went to one knee and lay the blade before her as he said the words Dany scarcely heard them He was the easy one she thought The other will be harder When Ser Barristan was done she turned to Jorah Mormont And now you ser Tell me true

The big man’s neck was red whether from anger or shame she did not know I have tried to tell you true half a hundred times I told you Arstan was more than he seemed I warned you that Xaro and Pyat Pree were not to be trusted I warned you—

You warned me against everyone except yourself His insolence angered her He should be humbler He should beg for my forgiveness Trust no one but Jorah Mormont you said… and all the time you were the Spider’s creature

I am no man’s creature I took the eunuch’s gold yes I learned some ciphers and wrote some letters but that was all—

All You spied on me and sold me to my enemies

For a time He said it grudgingly I stopped

When When did you stop

I made one report from Qarth but—

From Qarth Dany had been hoping it had ended much earlier What did you write from Qarth That you were my man now that you wanted no more of their schemes Ser Jorah could not meet her eyes When Khal Drogo died you asked me to go with you to Yi Ti and the Jade Sea Was that your wish or Robert’s

That was to protect you he insisted To keep you away from them I knew what snakes they were…

Snakes And what are you ser Something unspeakable occurred to her You told them I was carrying Drogo’s child…

Khaleesi…

Do not think to deny it ser Ser Barristan said sharply I was there when the eunuch told the council and Robert decreed that Her Grace and her child must die You were the source ser There was even talk that you might do the deed for a pardon

A lie Ser Jorah’s face darkened I would never… Daenerys it was me who stopped you from drinking the wine

Yes And how was it you knew the wine was poisoned

I… I but suspected… the caravan brought a letter from Varys he warned me there would be attempts He wanted you watched yes but not harmed He went to his knees If I had not told them someone else would have You know that

I know you betrayed me She touched her belly where her son Rhaego had perished I know a poisoner tried to kill my son because of you That’s what I know

No… no He shook his head I never meant… forgive me You have to forgive me

Have to It was too late He should have begun by begging forgiveness She could not pardon him as she’d intended She had dragged the wineseller behind her horse until there was nothing left of him Didn’t the man who brought him deserve the same This is Jorah my fierce bear the right arm that never failed me I would be dead without him but… I can’t forgive you she said I can’t
