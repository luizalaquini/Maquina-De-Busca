I have no home Arya thought I have no pack And now I don’t even have a horse

The captain was turning away when she said What ship is this my lord

He paused long enough to give her a weary smile This is the galleas Titan’s Daughter of the Free City of Braavos

Wait Arya said suddenly I have something else She had stuffed it down inside her smallclothes to keep it safe so she had to dig deep to find it while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered with obvious impatience One more silver will make no difference child he finally said

It’s not silver Her fingers closed on it It’s iron Here She pressed it into his hand the small black iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her so worn the man whose head it bore had no features It’s probably worthless but…

The captain turned it over and blinked at it then looked at her again This… how…

Jaqen said to say the words too Arya crossed her arms against her chest Valar morghulis she said as loud as if she’d known what it meant

Valar dohaeris he replied touching his brow with two fingers Of course you shall have a cabin





Samwell


He sucks harder than mine Gilly stroked the babe’s head as she held him to her nipple

He’s hungry said the blonde woman Val the one the black brothers called the wildling princess He’s lived on goats’ milk up to now and potions from that blind maester

The boy did not have a name yet no more than Gilly’s did That was the wildling way Not even Mance Rayder’s son would get a name till his third year it would seem though Sam had heard the brothers calling him the little prince and born-in-battle

He watched the child nurse at Gilly’s breast and then he watched Jon watch Jon is smiling A sad smile still but definitely a smile of sorts Sam was glad to see it It is the first time I’ve seen him smile since I got back

They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake and from Deep Lake to Queensgate following a narrow track from one castle to the next never out of sight of the Wall A day and a half from Castle Black as they trudged along on callused feet Gilly heard horses behind them and turned to see a column of black riders coming from the west My brothers Sam assured her No one uses this road but the Night’s Watch It had turned out to be Ser Denys Mallister from the Shadow Tower along with the wounded Bowen Marsh and the survivors from the fight at the Bridge of Skulls When Sam saw Dywen Giant and Dolorous Edd Tollett he broke down and wept

It was from them that he learned about the battle beneath the Wall Stannis landed his knights at Eastwatch and Cotter Pyke led him along the ranger’s roads to take the wildlings unawares Giant told him He smashed them Mance Rayder was taken captive a thousand of his best slain including Harma Dogshead The rest scattered like leaves before a storm we heard The gods are good Sam thought If he had not gotten lost as he made his way south from Craster’s Keep he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle… or into Mance Rayder’s camp at the very least That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy but not for him Sam had heard all the stories about what wildlings did with captured crows He shuddered

Nothing that his brothers told him prepared him for what he found at Castle Black however The common hall had burned to the ground and the great wooden stair was a mound of broken ice and scorched timbers Donal Noye was dead along with Rast Deaf Dick Red Alyn and so many more yet the castle was more crowded than Sam had ever seen not with black brothers but with the king’s soldiers more than a thousand of them There was a king in the King’s Tower for the first time in living memory and banners flew from the Lance Hardin’s Tower the Grey Keep the Shieldhall and other buildings that had stood empty and abandoned for long years The big one the gold with the black stag that’s the royal standard of House Baratheon he told Gilly who had never seen banners before The fox-and-flowers is House Florent The turtle is Estermont the swordfish is Bar Emmon and the crossed trumpets are for Wensington

They’re all bright as flowers Gilly pointed I like those yellow ones with the fire Look and some of the fighters have the same thing on their blouses

A fiery heart I don’t know whose sigil that is

He found out soon enough Queen’s men Pyp told him—after he let out a whoop and shouted Run and bar the doors lads it’s Sam the Slayer come back from the grave while Grenn was hugging Sam so hard he thought his ribs might break—but best you don’t go asking where the queen is Stannis left her at Eastwatch with their daughter and his fleet He brought no woman but the red one

The red one said Sam uncertainly

Melisandre of Asshai said Grenn The king’s sorceress They say she burned a man alive at Dragonstone so Stannis would have favorable winds for his voyage north She rode beside him in the battle too and gave him his magic sword Lightbringer they call it Wait till you see it It glows like it had a piece of sun inside it He looked at Sam again and grinned a big helpless stupid grin I still can’t believe you’re here

Jon Snow had smiled to see him too but it was a tired smile like the one he wore now You made it back after all he said And brought Gilly out as well You’ve done well Sam

Jon had done more than well himself to hear Grenn tell it Yet even capturing the Horn of Winter and a wildling prince had not been enough for Ser Alliser Thorne and his friends who still named him turncloak Though Maester Aemon said his wound was healing well Jon bore other scars deeper than the ones around his eye He grieves for his wildling girl and for his brothers

It’s strange he said to Sam Craster had no love for Mance nor Mance for Craster but now Craster’s daughter is feeding Mance’s son

I have the milk Gilly said her voice soft and shy Mine takes only a little He’s not so greedy as this one

The wildling woman Val turned to face them I’ve heard the queen’s men saying that the red woman means to give Mance to the fire as soon as he is strong enough

Jon gave her a weary look Mance is a deserter from the Night’s Watch The penalty for that is death If the Watch had taken him he would have been hanged by now but he’s the king’s captive and no one knows the king’s mind but the red woman

I want to see him Val said I want to show him his son He deserves that much before you kill him

Sam tried to explain No one is permitted to see him but Maester Aemon my lady

If it were in my power Mance could hold his son Jon’s smile was gone I’m sorry Val He turned away Sam and I have duties to return to Well Sam does anyway We’ll ask about your seeing Mance That’s all I can promise

Sam lingered long enough to give Gilly’s hand a squeeze and promise to return again after supper Then he hurried after There were guards outside the door queen’s men with spears Jon was halfway down the steps but he waited when he heard Sam puffing after him You’re more than fond of Gilly aren’t you

Sam reddened Gilly’s good She’s good and kind He was glad that his long nightmare was done glad to be back with his brothers at Castle Black… but some nights alone in his cell he thought of how warm Gilly had been when they’d curled up beneath the furs with the babe between them She… she made me braver Jon Not brave but… braver

You know you cannot keep her Jon said gently no more than I could stay with Ygritte You said the words Sam the same as I did The same as all of us

I know Gilly said she’d be a wife to me but… I told her about the words and what they meant I don’t know if that made her sad or glad but I told her He swallowed nervously and said Jon could there be honor in a lie if it were told for a… a good purpose

It would depend on the lie and the purpose I suppose Jon looked at Sam I wouldn’t advise it You’re not made to lie Sam You blush and squeak and stammer

I do said Sam but I could lie in a letter I’m better with a quill in hand I had a… a thought When things are more settled here I thought maybe the best thing for Gilly… I thought I might send her to Horn Hill To my mother and sisters and my… my f-f-father If Gilly were to say the babe was m-mine… He was blushing again My mother would want him I know She would find some place for Gilly some kind of service it wouldn’t be as hard as serving Craster And Lord R-Randyll he… he would never say so but he might be pleased to believe I got a bastard on some wildling girl At least it would prove I was man enough to lie with a woman and father a child He told me once that I was sure to die a maiden that no woman would ever… you know… Jon if I did this wrote this lie… would that be a good thing The life the boy would have…

Growing up a bastard in his grandfather’s castle Jon shrugged That depends in great part on your father and what sort of boy this is If he takes after you…

He won’t Craster’s his real father You saw him he was hard as an old tree stump and Gilly is stronger than she looks

If the boy shows any skill with sword or lance he should have a place with your father’s household guard at the least Jon said It’s not unknown for bastards to be trained as squires and raised to knighthood But you’d best be sure Gilly can play this game convincingly From what you’ve told me of Lord Randyll I doubt he would take kindly to being deceived

More guards were posted on the steps outside the tower These were king’s men though Sam had quickly learned the difference The king’s men were as earthy and impious as any other soldiers but the queen’s men were fervid in their devotion to Melisandre of Asshai and her Lord of Light Are you going to the practice yard again Sam asked as they crossed the yard Is it wise to train so hard before your leg’s done healing

Jon shrugged What else is there for me to do Marsh has removed me from duty for fear that I’m still a turncloak

It’s only a few who believe that Sam assured him Ser Alliser and his friends Most of the brothers know better King Stannis knows as well I’ll wager You brought him the Horn of Winter and captured Mance Rayder’s son

All I did was protect Val and the babe against looters when the wildlings fled and keep them there until the rangers found us I never captured anyone King Stannis keeps his men well in hand that’s plain He lets them plunder some but I’ve only heard of three wildling women being raped and the men who did it have all been gelded I suppose I should have been killing the free folk as they ran Ser Alliser has been putting it about that the only time I bared my sword was to defend our foes I failed to kill Mance Rayder because I was in league with him he says

That’s only Ser Alliser said Sam Everyone knows the sort of man he is With his noble birth his knighthood and his long years in the Watch Ser Alliser Thorne might have been a strong challenger for the Lord Commander’s title but almost all the men he’d trained during his years as master-at-arms despised him His name had been offered of course but after running a weak sixth on the first day and actually losing votes on the second Thorne had withdrawn to support Lord Janos Slynt

What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble line and trueborn while I’m the bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand and bedded with a spearwife The warg I’ve heard them call me How can I be a warg without a wolf I ask you His mouth twisted I don’t even dream of Ghost anymore All my dreams are of the crypts of the stone kings on their thrones Sometimes I hear Robb’s voice and my father’s as if they were at a feast But there’s a wall between us and I know that no place has been set for me

The living have no place at the feasts of the dead It tore the heart from Sam to hold his silence then Bran’s not dead Jon he wanted to stay He’s with friends and they’re going north on a giant elk to find a three-eyed crow in the depths of the haunted forest It sounded so mad that there were times Sam Tarly thought he must have dreamt it all conjured it whole from fever and fear and hunger… but he would have blurted it out anyway if he had not given his word

Three times he had sworn to keep the secret once to Bran himself once to that strange boy Jojen Reed and last of all to Coldhands The world believes the boy is dead his rescuer had said as they parted Let his bones lie undisturbed We want no seekers coming after us Swear it Samwell of the Night’s Watch Swear it for the life you owe me

Miserable Sam shifted his weight and said Lord Janos will never be chosen Lord Commander It was the best comfort he had to offer Jon the only comfort That won’t happen
