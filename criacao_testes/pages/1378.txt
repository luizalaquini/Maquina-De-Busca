I object to wedding any—

I have considered the Redwyne twins Theon Greyjoy Quentyn Martell and a number of others But our alliance with Highgarden was the sword that broke Stannis It should be tempered and made stronger Ser Loras has taken the white and Ser Garlan is wed to one of the Fossoways but there remains the eldest son the boy they scheme to wed to Sansa Stark

Willas Tyrell Tyrion was taking a wicked pleasure in Cersei’s helpless fury That would be the cripple he said

Their father chilled him with a look Willas is heir to Highgarden and by all reports a mild and courtly young man fond of reading books and looking at the stars He has a passion for breeding animals as well and owns the finest hounds hawks and horses in the Seven Kingdoms

A perfect match mused Tyrion Cersei also has a passion for breeding He pitied poor Willas Tyrell and did not know whether he wanted to laugh at his sister or weep for her

The Tyrell heir would be my choice Lord Tywin concluded but if you would prefer another I will hear your reasons

That is so very kind of you Father Cersei said with icy courtesy It is such a difficult choice you give me Who would I sooner take to bed the old squid or the crippled dog boy I shall need a few days to consider Do I have your leave to go

You are the queen Tyrion wanted to tell her He ought to be begging leave of you

Go their father said We shall talk again after you have composed yourself Remember your duty

Cersei swept stiffly from the room her rage plain to see Yet in the end she will do as Father bid She had proved that with Robert Though there is Jaime to consider Their brother had been much younger when Cersei wed the first time he might not acquiesce to a second marriage quite so easily The unfortunate Willas Tyrell was like to contract a sudden fatal case of sword-through-bowels which could rather sour the alliance between Highgarden and Casterly Rock I should say something but what Pardon me Father but it’s our brother she wants to marry

Tyrion

He gave a resigned smile Do I hear the herald summoning me to the lists

Your whoring is a weakness in you Lord Tywin said without preamble but perhaps some share of the blame is mine Since you stand no taller than a boy I have found it easy to forget that you are in truth a man grown with all of a man’s baser needs It is past time you were wed

I was wed or have you forgotten Tyrion’s mouth twisted and the noise emerged that was half laugh and half snarl

Does the prospect of marriage amuse you

Only imagining what a bugger-all handsome bridegroom I’ll make A wife might be the very thing he needed If she brought him lands and a keep it would give him a place in the world apart from Joffrey’s court… and away from Cersei and their father

On the other hand there was Shae She will not like this for all she swears that she is content to be my whore

That was scarcely a point to sway his father however so Tyrion squirmed higher in his seat and said You mean to wed me to Sansa Stark But won’t the Tyrells take the match as an affront if they have designs on the girl

Lord Tyrell will not broach the matter of the Stark girl until after Joffrey’s wedding If Sansa is wed before that how can he take offense when he gave us no hint of his intentions

Quite so said Ser Kevan and any lingering resentments should be soothed by the offer of Cersei for his Willas

Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of his nose The scar tissue itched abominably sometimes His Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa’s life a misery since the day her father died and now that she is finally rid of Joffrey you propose to marry her to me That seems singularly cruel Even for you Father

Why do you plan to mistreat her His father sounded more curious than concerned The girl’s happiness is not my purpose nor should it be yours Our alliances in the south may be as solid as Casterly Rock but there remains the north to win and the key to the north is Sansa Stark

She is no more than a child

Your sister swears she’s flowered If so she is a woman fit to be wed You must needs take her maidenhead so no man can say the marriage was not consummated After that if you prefer to wait a year or two before bedding her again you would be within your rights as her husband

Shae is all the woman I need just now he thought and Sansa’s a girl no matter what you say If your purpose here is to keep her from the Tyrells why not return her to her mother Perhaps that would convince Robb Stark to bend the knee

Lord Tywin’s look was scornful Send her to Riverrun and her mother will match her with a Blackwood or a Mallister to shore up her son’s alliances along the Trident Send her north and she will be wed to some Manderly or Umber before the moon turns Yet she is no less dangerous here at court as this business with the Tyrells should prove She must marry a Lannister and soon

The man who weds Sansa Stark can claim Winterfell in her name his uncle Kevan put in Had that not occurred to you

If you will not have the girl we shall give her to one of your cousins said his father Kevan is Lancel strong enough to wed do you think

Ser Kevan hesitated If we bring the girl to his bedside he could say the words… but to consummate no… I would suggest one of the twins but the Starks hold them both at Riverrun They have Genna’s boy Tion as well else he might serve

Tyrion let them have their byplay it was all for his benefit he knew Sansa Stark he mused Soft-spoken sweet-smelling Sansa who loved silks songs chivalry and tall gallant knights with handsome faces He felt as though he was back on the bridge of boats the deck shifting beneath his feet

You asked me to reward you for your efforts in the battle Lord Tywin reminded him forcefully This is a chance for you Tyrion the best you are ever likely to have He drummed his fingers impatiently on the table I once hoped to marry your brother to Lysa Tully but Aerys named Jaime to his Kingsguard before the arrangements were complete When I suggested to Lord Hoster that Lysa might be wed to you instead he replied that he wanted a whole man for his daughter

So he wed her to Jon Arryn who was old enough to be her grandfather Tyrion was more inclined to be thankful than angry considering what Lysa Arryn had become

When I offered you to Dorne I was told that the suggestion was an insult Lord Tywin continued In later years I had similar answers from Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower I finally stooped so low as to suggest you might take the Florent girl Robert deflowered in his brother’s wedding bed but her father preferred to give her to one of his own household knights

If you will not have the Stark girl I shall find you another wife Somewhere in the realm there is doubtless some little lordling who’d gladly part with a daughter to win the friendship of Casterly Rock Lady Tanda has offered Lollys…

Tyrion gave a shudder of dismay I’d sooner cut it off and feed it to the goats

Then open your eyes The Stark girl is young nubile tractable of the highest birth and still a maid She is not uncomely Why would you hesitate

Why indeed A quirk of mine Strange to say I would prefer a wife who wants me in her bed

If you think your whores want you in their bed you are an even greater fool than I suspected said Lord Tywin You disappoint me Tyrion I had hoped this match would please you

Yes we all know how important my pleasure is to you Father But there’s more to this The key to the north you say The Greyjoys hold the north now and King Balon has a daughter Why Sansa Stark and not her He looked into his father’s cool green eyes with their bright flecks of gold

Lord Tywin steepled his fingers beneath his chin Balon Greyjoy thinks in terms of plunder not rule Let him enjoy an autumn crown and suffer a northern winter He will give his subjects no cause to love him Come spring the northmen will have had a bellyful of krakens When you bring Eddard Stark’s grandson home to claim his birthright lords and little folk alike will rise as one to place him on the high seat of his ancestors You are capable of getting a woman with child I hope

I believe I am he said bristling I confess I cannot prove it Though no one can say I have not tried Why I plant my little seeds just as often as I can…

In the gutters and the ditches finished Lord Tywin and in common ground where only bastard weeds take root It is past time you kept your own garden He rose to his feet You shall never have Casterly Rock I promise you But wed Sansa Stark and it is just possible that you might win Winterfell

Tyrion Lannister Lord Protector of Winterfell The prospect gave him a queer chill Very good Father he said slowly but there’s a big ugly roach in your rushes Robb Stark is as capable as I am presumably and sworn to marry one of those fertile Freys And once the Young Wolf sires a litter any pups that Sansa births are heirs to nothing

Lord Tywin was unconcerned Robb Stark will father no children on his fertile Frey you have my word There is a bit of news I have not yet seen fit to share with the council though no doubt the good lords will hear it soon enough The Young Wolf has taken Gawen Westerling’s eldest daughter to wife

For a moment Tyrion could not believe he’d heard his father right He broke his sworn word he said incredulous He threw away the Freys for… Words failed him

A maid of sixteen years named Jeyne said Ser Kevan Lord Gawen once suggested her to me for Willem or Martyn but I had to refuse him Gawen is a good man but his wife is Sybell Spicer He should never have wed her The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense Lady Sybell’s grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps And the grandmother was some woman he’d brought back from the east A frightening old crone supposed to be a priestess Maegi they called her No one could pronounce her real name Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the like He shrugged She’s long dead to be sure And Jeyne seemed a sweet child I’ll grant you though I only saw her once But with such doubtful blood…

Having once married a whore Tyrion could not entirely share his uncle’s horror at the thought of wedding a girl whose great grandfather sold cloves Even so… A sweet child Ser Kevan had said but many a poison was sweet as well The Westerlings were old blood but they had more pride than power It would not surprise him to learn that Lady Sybell had brought more wealth to the marriage than her highborn husband The Westerling mines had failed years ago their best lands had been sold off or lost and the Crag was more ruin than stronghold A romantic ruin though jutting up so brave above the sea I am surprised Tyrion had to confess I thought Robb Stark had better sense

He is a boy of sixteen said Lord Tywin At that age sense weighs for little against lust and love and honor

He forswore himself shamed an ally betrayed a solemn promise Where is the honor in that

Ser Kevan answered He chose the girl’s honor over his own Once he had deflowered her he had no other course
