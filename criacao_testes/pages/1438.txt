That seemed to startle him I’m only twelve

I killed a boy when I was eight Arya almost said but she thought she’d better not You’ve been in battles though

Yes He did not sound very proud of it I was at the Mummer’s Ford When Lord Beric fell into the river I dragged him up onto the bank so he wouldn’t drown and stood over him with my sword I never had to fight though He had a broken lance sticking out of him so no one bothered us When we regrouped Green Gergen helped pull his lordship back onto a horse

Arya was remembering the stableboy at King’s Landing After him there’d been that guard whose throat she cut at Harrenhal and Ser Amory’s men at that holdfast by the lake She didn’t know if Weese and Chiswyck counted or the ones who’d died on account of the weasel soup… all of a sudden she felt very sad My father was called Ned too she said

I know I saw him at the Hand’s tourney I wanted to go up and speak with him but I couldn’t think what to say Ned shivered beneath his cloak a sodden length of pale purple Were you at the tourney I saw your sister there Ser Loras Tyrell gave her a rose

She told me It all seemed so long ago Her friend Jeyne Poole fell in love with your Lord Beric

He’s promised to my aunt Ned looked uncomfortable That was before though Before he…

…died she thought as Ned’s voice trailed off into an awkward silence Their horses’ hooves made sucking sounds as they pulled free of the mud

My lady Ned said at last You have a baseborn brother… Jon Snow

He’s with the Night’s Watch on the Wall Maybe I should go to the Wall instead of Riverrun Jon wouldn’t care who I killed or whether I brushed my hair… Jon looks like me even though he’s bastard-born He used to muss my hair and call me ‘little sister’ Arya missed Jon most of all Just saying his name made her sad How do you know about Jon

He is my milk brother

Brother Arya did not understand But you’re from Dorne How could you and Jon be blood

Milk brothers Not blood My lady mother had no milk when I was little so Wylla had to nurse me

Arya was lost Who’s Wylla

Jon Snow’s mother He never told you She’s served us for years and years Since before I was born

Jon never knew his mother Not even her name Arya gave Ned a wary look You know her Truly Is he making mock of me If you lie I’ll punch your face

Wylla was my wetnurse he repeated solemnly I swear it on the honor of my House

You have a House That was stupid he was a squire of course he had a House Who are you

My lady Ned looked embarrassed I’m Edric Dayne the… the Lord of Starfall

Behind them Gendry groaned Lords and ladies he proclaimed in a disgusted tone Arya plucked a withered crabapple off a passing branch and whipped it at him bouncing it off his thick bull head Ow he said That hurt He felt the skin above his eye What kind of lady throws crabapples at people

The bad kind said Arya suddenly contrite She turned back to Ned I’m sorry I didn’t know who you were My lord

The fault is mine my lady He was very polite

Jon has a mother Wylla her name is Wylla She would need to remember so she could tell him the next time she saw him She wondered if he would still call her little sister I’m not so little anymore He’d have to call me something else Maybe once she got to Riverrun she could write Jon a letter and tell him what Ned Dayne had said There was an Arthur Dayne she remembered The one they called the Sword of the Morning

My father was Ser Arthur’s elder brother Lady Ashara was my aunt I never knew her though She threw herself into the sea from atop the Palestone Sword before I was born

Why would she do that said Arya startled

Ned looked wary Maybe he was afraid that she was going to throw something at him Your lord father never spoke of her he said The Lady Ashara Dayne of Starfall

No Did he know her

Before Robert was king She met your father and his brothers at Harrenhal during the year of the false spring

Oh Arya did not know what else to say Why did she jump in the sea though

Her heart was broken

Sansa would have sighed and shed a tear for true love but Arya just thought it was stupid She couldn’t say that to Ned though not about his own aunt Did someone break it

He hesitated Perhaps it’s not my place…

Tell me

He looked at her uncomfortably My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal—

That’s not so He loved my lady mother

I’m sure he did my lady but—

She was the only one he loved

He must have found that bastard under a cabbage leaf then Gendry said behind them

Arya wished she had another crabapple to bounce off his face My father had honor she said angrily And we weren’t talking to you anyway Why don’t you go back to Stoney Sept and ring that girl’s stupid bells

Gendry ignored that At least your father raised his bastard not like mine I don’t even know my father’s name Some smelly drunk I’d wager like the others my mother dragged home from the alehouse Whenever she got mad at me she’d say ‘If your father was here he’d beat you bloody’ That’s all I know of him He spat Well if he was here now might be I’d beat him bloody But he’s dead I figure and your father’s dead too so what does it matter who he lay with

It mattered to Arya though she could not have said why Ned was trying to apologize for upsetting her but she did not want to hear it She pressed her heels into her horse and left them both Anguy the Archer was riding a few yards ahead When she caught up with him she said Dornishmen lie don’t they

They’re famous for it The bowman grinned Of course they say the same of us marchers so there you are What’s the trouble now Ned’s a good lad…

He’s just a stupid liar Arya left the trail leapt a rotten log and splashed across a streambed ignoring the shouts of the outlaws behind her They just want to tell me more lies She thought about trying to get away from them but there were too many and they knew these lands too well What was the use of running if they caught you

It was Harwin who rode up beside her in the end Where do you think you’re going milady You shouldn’t run off There are wolves in these woods and worse things

I’m not afraid she said That boy Ned said…

Aye he told me Lady Ashara Dayne It’s an old tale that one I heard it once at Winterfell when I was no older than you are now He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around I doubt there’s any truth to it But if there is what of it When Ned met this Dornish lady his brother Brandon was still alive and it was him betrothed to Lady Catelyn so there’s no stain on your father’s honor There’s nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot so maybe some words were whispered in a tent of a night who can say Words or kisses maybe more but where’s the harm in that Spring had come or so they thought and neither one of them was pledged

She killed herself though said Arya uncertainly Ned says she jumped from a tower into the sea

So she did Harwin admitted as he led her back but that was for grief I’d wager She’d lost a brother the Sword of the Morning He shook his head Let it lie my lady They’re dead all of them Let it lie… and please when we come to Riverrun say naught of this to your mother

The village was just where Notch had promised it would be They took shelter in a grey stone stable Only half a roof remained but that was half a roof more than any other building in the village It’s not a village it’s only black stones and old bones Did the Lannisters kill the people who lived here Arya asked as she helped Anguy dry the horses

No He pointed Look at how thick the moss grows on the stones No one’s moved them for a long time And there’s a tree growing out of the wall there see This place was put to the torch a long time ago
