111 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver

112 While the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth
the smell thereof

113 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me he shall lie all
night betwixt my breasts

114 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards
of Engedi

115 Behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast
doves eyes

116 Behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is
green

117 The beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir

21 I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys

22 As the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters

23 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved
among the sons I sat down under his shadow with great delight and
his fruit was sweet to my taste

24 He brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was
love

25 Stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for I am sick of
love

26 His left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace
me

27 I charge you O ye daughters of Jerusalem by the roes and by the
hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he
please

28 The voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the
mountains skipping upon the hills

29 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth
behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself
through the lattice

210 My beloved spake and said unto me Rise up my love my fair
one and come away

211 For lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone 212 The
flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land 213 The fig tree
putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give
a good smell Arise my love my fair one and come away

214 O my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret
places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy
voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely

215 Take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for
our vines have tender grapes

216 My beloved is mine and I am his he feedeth among the lilies

217 Until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved
and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether

31 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth I sought him
but I found him not

32 I will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the
broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth I sought him but I
found him not

33 The watchmen that go about the city found me to whom I said Saw
ye him whom my soul loveth  34 It was but a little that I passed
from them but I found him whom my soul loveth I held him and would
not let him go until I had brought him into my mothers house and
into the chamber of her that conceived me

35 I charge you O ye daughters of Jerusalem by the roes and by the
hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he
please

36 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the
merchant  37 Behold his bed which is Solomons threescore valiant
men are about it of the valiant of Israel

38 They all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his
sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night

39 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon

310 He made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of
gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with
love for the daughters of Jerusalem

311 Go forth O ye daughters of Zion and behold king Solomon with
