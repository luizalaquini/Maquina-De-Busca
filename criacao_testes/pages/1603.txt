tripping over abandoned treasures and snow-frosted limbs
About halfway there I become aware of the concrete
barricade Its about four feet high and extends in a large
rectangle in front of the mansion You would think it would
be empty but its packed with refugees Maybe this is the
group thats been chosen to be sheltered at the mansion
But as I draw closer I notice something else Everyone
inside the barricade is a child Toddlers to teenagers
Scared and frostbitten Huddled in groups or rocking
numbly on the ground They arent being led into the
mansion Theyre penned in guarded on all sides by
Peacekeepers I know immediately its not for their
protection If the Capitol wanted to safeguard them theyd
be down in a bunker somewhere This is for Snows
protection The children form his human shield
Theres a commotion and the crowd surges to the left
Im caught up by larger bodies borne sideways carried off
course I hear shouts of The rebels The rebels and know
they mustve broken through The momentum slams me into
a flagpole and I cling to it Using the rope that hangs from
the top I pull myself up out of the crush of bodies Yes I can
see the rebel army pouring into the Circle driving the
refugees back onto the avenues I scan the area for the
pods that will surely be detonating But that doesnt happen
This is what happens
A hovercraft marked with the Capitols seal
materializes directly over the barricaded children Scores
of silver parachutes rain down on them Even in this chaos
the children know what silver parachutes contain Food
Medicine Gifts They eagerly scoop them up frozen fingers
struggling with the strings The hovercraft vanishes five
seconds pass and then about twenty parachutes
simultaneously explode
A wail rises from the crowd The snows red and
littered with undersized body parts Many of the children die
immediately but others lie in agony on the ground Some
stagger around mutely staring at the remaining silver
parachutes in their hands as if they still might have
something precious inside I can tell the Peacekeepers
didnt know this was coming by the way they are yanking
away the barricades making a path to the children Another
flock of white uniforms sweeps into the opening But these
arent Peacekeepers Theyre medics Rebel medics Id
know the uniforms anywhere They swarm in among the
children wielding medical kits
First I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her back
Then as she yanks off her coat to cover a wailing child I
notice the duck tail formed by her untucked shirt I have the
same reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name at
the reaping At least I must go limp because I find myself
at the base of the flagpole unable to account for the last
few seconds Then I am pushing through the crowd just as I
did before Trying to shout her name above the roar Im
almost there almost to the barricade when I think she
hears me Because for just a moment she catches sight of
me her lips form my name
And thats when the rest of the parachutes go off
25
Real or not real I am on fire The balls of flame that
erupted from the parachutes shot over the barricades
through the snowy air and landed in the crowd I was just
turning away when one caught me ran its tongue up the
back of my body and transformed me into something new
A creature as unquenchable as the sun
A fire mutt knows only a single sensation agony No
sight no sound no feeling except the unrelenting burning of
flesh Perhaps there are periods of unconsciousness but
what can it matter if I cant find refuge in them I am Cinnas
bird ignited flying frantically to escape something
inescapable The feathers of flame that grow from my body
Beating my wings only fans the blaze I consume myself but
to no end
Finally my wings begin to falter I lose height and
gravity pulls me into a foamy sea the color of Finnicks
eyes I float on my back which continues to burn beneath
the water but the agony quiets to pain When I am adrift
and unable to navigate thats when they come The dead
The ones I loved fly as birds in the open sky above me
Soaring weaving calling to me to join them I want so badly
to follow them but the seawater saturates my wings
making it impossible to lift them The ones I hated have
taken to the water horrible scaled things that tear my salty
flesh with needle teeth Biting again and again Dragging
me beneath the surface
The small white bird tinged in pink dives down buries
her claws in my chest and tries to keep me afloat No
Katniss No You cant go
But the ones I hated are winning and if she clings to
me shell be lost as well Prim let go And finally she
doesDeep in the water Im deserted by all Theres only the
sound of my breathing the enormous effort it takes to draw
the water in push it out of my lungs I want to stop I try to
hold my breath but the sea forces its way in and out
against my will Let me die Let me follow the others I
beg whatever holds me here Theres no response
Trapped for days years centuries maybe Dead but
not allowed to die Alive but as good as dead So alone
that anyone anything no matter how loathsome would be
welcome But when I finally have a visitor its sweet
Morphling Coursing through my veins easing the pain
