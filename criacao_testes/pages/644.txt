An army said Ser Jorah If Strong Belwas is so much to your liking you can buy hundreds more like him out of the fighting pits of Meereen… but it is Astapor I’d set my sails for In Astapor you can buy Unsullied

The slaves in the spiked bronze hats Dany had seen Unsullied guards in the Free Cities posted at the gates of magisters archons and dynasts Why should I want Unsullied They don’t even ride horses and most of them are fat

The Unsullied you may have seen in Pentos and Myr were household guards That’s soft service and eunuchs tend to plumpness in any case Food is the only vice allowed them To judge all Unsullied by a few old household slaves is like judging all squires by Arstan Whitebeard Your Grace Do you know the tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor

No The coverlet slipped off Dany’s shoulder and she tugged it back into place

It was four hundred years ago or more when the Dothraki first rode out of the east sacking and burning every town and city in their path The khal who led them was named Temmo His khalasar was not so big as Drogo’s but it was big enough Fifty thousand at the least Half of them braided warriors with bells ringing in their hair

The Qohorik knew he was coming They strengthened their walls doubled the size of their own guard and hired two free companies besides the Bright Banners and the Second Sons And almost as an afterthought they sent a man to Astapor to buy three thousand Unsullied It was a long march back to Qohor however and as they approached they saw the smoke and dust and heard the distant din of battle

By the time the Unsullied reached the city the sun had set Crows and wolves were feasting beneath the walls on what remained of the Qohorik heavy horse The Bright Banners and Second Sons had fled as sellswords are wont to do in the face of hopeless odds With dark falling the Dothraki had retired to their own camps to drink and dance and feast but none doubted that they would return on the morrow to smash the city gates storm the walls and rape loot and slave as they pleased

But when dawn broke and Temmo and his bloodriders led their khalasar out of camp they found three thousand Unsullied drawn up before the gates with the Black Goat standard flying over their heads So small a force could easily have been flanked but you know Dothraki These were men on foot and men on foot are fit only to be ridden down

The Dothraki charged The Unsullied locked their shields lowered their spears and stood firm Against twenty thousand screamers with bells in their hair they stood firm

Eighteen times the Dothraki charged and broke themselves on those shields and spears like waves on a rocky shore Thrice Temmo sent his archers wheeling past and arrows fell like rain upon the Three Thousand but the Unsullied merely lifted their shields above their heads until the squall had passed In the end only six hundred of them remained… but more than twelve thousand Dothraki lay dead upon that field including Khal Temmo his bloodriders his kos and all his sons On the morning of the fourth day the new khal led the survivors past the city gates in a stately procession One by one each man cut off his braid and threw it down before the feet of the Three Thousand

Since that day the city guard of Qohor has been made up solely of Unsullied every one of whom carries a tall spear from which hangs a braid of human hair

That is what you will find in Astapor Your Grace Put ashore there and continue on to Pentos overland It will take longer yes… but when you break bread with Magister Illyrio you will have a thousand swords behind you not just four

There is wisdom in this yes Dany thought but… How am I to buy a thousand slave soldiers All I have of value is the crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood gave me

Dragons will be as great a wonder in Astapor as they were in Qarth It may be that the slavers will shower you with gifts as the Qartheen did If not… these ships carry more than your Dothraki and their horses They took on trade goods at Qarth I’ve been through the holds and seen for myself Bolts of silk and bales of tiger skin amber and jade carvings saffron myrrh… slaves are cheap Your Grace Tiger skins are costly

Those are Illyrio’s tiger skins she objected

And Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen

All the more reason not to steal his goods

What use are wealthy friends if they will not put their wealth at your disposal my queen If Magister Illyrio would deny you he is only Xaro Xhoan Daxos with four chins And if he is sincere in his devotion to your cause he will not begrudge you three shiploads of trade goods What better use for his tiger skins than to buy you the beginnings of an army

That’s true Dany felt a rising excitement There will be dangers on such a long march…

There are dangers at sea as well Corsairs and pirates hunt the southern route and north of Valyria the Smoking Sea is demon-haunted The next storm could sink or scatter us a kraken could pull us under… or we might find ourselves becalmed again and die of thirst as we wait for the wind to rise A march will have different dangers my queen but none greater

What if Captain Groleo refuses to change course though And Arstan Strong Belwas what will they do

Ser Jorah stood Perhaps it’s time you found that out

Yes she decided I’ll do it Dany threw back the coverlets and hopped from the bunk I’ll see the captain at once command him to set course for Astapor She bent over her chest threw open the lid and seized the first garment to hand a pair of loose sandsilk trousers Hand me my medallion belt she commanded Jorah as she pulled the sandsilk up over her hips And my vest— she started to say turning

Ser Jorah slid his arms around her

Oh was all Dany had time to say as he pulled her close and pressed his lips down on hers He smelled of sweat and salt and leather and the iron studs on his jerkin dug into her naked breasts as he crushed her hard against him One hand held her by the shoulder while the other slid down her spine to the small of her back and her mouth opened for his tongue though she never told it to His beard is scratchy she thought but his mouth is sweet The Dothraki wore no beards only long mustaches and only Khal Drogo had ever kissed her before He should not be doing this I am his queen not his woman

It was a long kiss though how long Dany could not have said When it ended Ser Jorah let go of her and she took a quick step backward You… you should not have…

I should not have waited so Iong he finished for her I should have kissed you in Qarth in Vaes Tolorru I should have kissed you in the red waste every night and every day You were made to be kissed often and well His eyes were on her breasts
