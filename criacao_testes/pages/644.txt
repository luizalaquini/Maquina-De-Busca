3233 And they have turned unto me the back and not the face though
I taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction

3234 But they set their abominations in the house which is called by
my name to defile it

3235 And they built the high places of Baal which are in the valley
of the son of Hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass
through the fire unto Molech which I commanded them not neither came
it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause Judah
to sin

3236 And now therefore thus saith the LORD the God of Israel
concerning this city whereof ye say It shall be delivered into the
hand of the king of Babylon by the sword and by the famine and by
the pestilence 3237 Behold I will gather them out of all countries
whither I have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great
wrath and I will bring them again unto this place and I will cause
them to dwell safely 3238 And they shall be my people and I will be
their God 3239 And I will give them one heart and one way that
they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children
after them 3240 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them
that I will not turn away from them to do them good but I will put
my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me

3241 Yea I will rejoice over them to do them good and I will plant
them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole
soul

3242 For thus saith the LORD Like as I have brought all this great
evil upon this people so will I bring upon them all the good that I
have promised them

3243 And fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say It is
desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the
Chaldeans

3244 Men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and
seal them and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the
places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities
of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities
of the south for I will cause their captivity to return saith the
LORD

331 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time
while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying 332 Thus
saith the LORD the maker thereof the LORD that formed it to
establish it the LORD is his name 333 Call unto me and I will
answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest
not

334 For thus saith the LORD the God of Israel concerning the houses
of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which
are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword 335 They come to
fight with the Chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies
of men whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all
whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city

336 Behold I will bring it health and cure and I will cure them
and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth

337 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
Israel to return and will build them as at the first

338 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they
have sinned against me and I will pardon all their iniquities
whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against
me

339 And it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour
before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good
that I do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the
goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it

3310 Thus saith the LORD Again there shall be heard in this place
which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in
the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are
desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast
3311 The voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall
say Praise the LORD of hosts for the LORD is good for his mercy
endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of
praise into the house of the LORD For I will cause to return the
captivity of the land as at the first saith the LORD

3312 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Again in this place which is
desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof
shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down

3313 In the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and
in the cities of the south and in the land of Benjamin and in the
places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah shall the flocks
pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the LORD

3314 Behold the days come saith the LORD that I will perform that
good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the
house of Judah

3315 In those days and at that time will I cause the Branch of
