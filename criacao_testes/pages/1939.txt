This also is guaranteed to be less than 1 and has given good results

Figure 614 shows the implementation of a single section of an analysis
lattice
FC Figure 614
The signals x sup + n and x sup - n-1 are fed to a
correlator which produces a suitable value for k
This value is used to calculate the output of the lattice section
and hence the input to the next lattice section
The reflection coefficient needs to be low-pass filtered because it will
only be transmitted to the synthesizer occasionally say every 20 msec and so a
short-term average is required

One implementation of the correlator is shown in Figure 615 Kang 1974

This calculates the value of k given by the last equation above and does it

Before these are divided to give the final coefficient k they are

It is sometimes useful to think of linear prediction as a kind of
curve-fitting technique
Figure 616 illustrates how four samples of a speech signal can predict
the next one
FC Figure 616
In essence a curve is drawn through four points
to predict the position of the fifth and only the prediction error
is actually transmitted  Now if the order of linear prediction
is high enough at least 10 and if the coefficients are chosen
correctly the prediction will closely model the resonances of the
vocal tract  Thus the error will actually be zero except at pitch
pulses
pp
Figure 617 shows a segment of voiced speech together with the prediction
error often called the prediction residual
FC Figure 617
It is apparent that the
error is indeed small except at pitch pulses
This suggests that a good way to determine the pitch period is to examine
the error signal perhaps by looking at its autocorrelation function
As with all pitch detection methods one must be
careful  spurious peaks can occur especially in nasal sounds when
the all-pole model provided by linear prediction fails  Continuity
constraints which use previous values of pitch period when determining
