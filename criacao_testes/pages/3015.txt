vessel into the house of the LORD

6621 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites saith
the LORD

6622 For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make
shall remain before me saith the LORD so shall your seed and your
name remain

6623 And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another
and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship
before me saith the LORD

6624 And they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men
that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die
neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring
unto all flesh




The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah


11 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah of the priests that
were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin 12 To whom the word of the
LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah in the
thirteenth year of his reign

13 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah
king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the
fifth month

14 Then the word of the LORD came unto me saying 15 Before I
formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out
of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the
nations

16 Then said I Ah Lord GOD behold I cannot speak for I am a
child

17 But the LORD said unto me Say not I am a child for thou shalt
go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou
shalt speak

18 Be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee
saith the LORD

19 Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth And the
LORD said unto me Behold I have put my words in thy mouth

110 See I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw
down to build and to plant

111 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying Jeremiah
what seest thou And I said I see a rod of an almond tree

112 Then said the LORD unto me Thou hast well seen for I will
hasten my word to perform it

113 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time saying
What seest thou And I said I see a seething pot and the face
thereof is toward the north

114 Then the LORD said unto me Out of the north an evil shall break
forth upon all the inhabitants of the land

115 For lo I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
north saith the LORD and they shall come and they shall set every
one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem and against
all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of
Judah

116 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other
gods and worshipped the works of their own hands

117 Thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them
all that I command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest I
confound thee before them

118 For behold I have made thee this day a defenced city and an
iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the
kings of Judah against the princes thereof against the priests
thereof and against the people of the land

119 And they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail
against thee for I am with thee saith the LORD to deliver thee

21 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me saying 22 Go and cry
in the ears of Jerusalem saying Thus saith the LORD I remember
thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when
thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown

23 Israel was holiness unto the LORD and the firstfruits of his
increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them
saith the LORD
