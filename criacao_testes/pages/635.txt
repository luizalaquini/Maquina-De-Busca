The Weeper’s red rheumy eyes gave Jon another look Aye Well he has a wolfish cast to him now as I look close Bring him to Mance might be he’ll keep him He wheeled his horse around and galloped off his riders hard behind him

The wind was blowing wet and heavy as they crossed the valley of the Milkwater and rode singlefile through the river camp Ghost kept close to Jon but the scent of him went before them like a herald and soon there were wildling dogs all around them growling and barking Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet but they paid him no heed They don’t much care for that beast o’ yours Longspear Ryk said to Jon

They’re dogs and he’s a wolf said Jon They know he’s not their kind No more than I am yours But he had his duty to be mindful of the task Qhorin Halfhand had laid upon him as they shared that final fire—to play the part of turncloak and find whatever it was that the wildlings had been seeking in the bleak cold wilderness of the Frostfangs Some power Qhorin had named it to the Old Bear but he had died before learning what it was or whether Mance Rayder had found it with his digging

There were cookfires all along the river amongst wayns and carts and sleds Many of the wildlings had thrown up tents of hide and skin and felted wool Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos or slept beneath their wagons At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and tossing them in a pile Elsewhere two bearded youths in boiled leather were sparring with staffs leaping at each other over the flames grunting each time one landed a blow A dozen women sat nearby in a circle fletching arrows

Arrows for my brothers Jon thought Arrows for my father’s folk for the people of Winterfell and Deepwood Motte and the Last Hearth Arrows for the north

But not all he saw was warlike He saw women dancing as well and heard a baby crying and a little boy ran in front of his garron all bundled up in fur and breathless from play Sheep and goats wandered freely while oxen plodded along the riverbank in search of grass The smell of roast mutton drifted from one cookflre and at another he saw a boar turning on a wooden spit

In an open space surrounded by tall green soldier pines Rattleshirt dismounted We’ll make camp here he told Lenyl and Ragwyle and the others Feed the horses then the dogs then yourself Ygritte Longspear bring the crow so Mance can have his look We’ll gut him after

They walked the rest of the way past more cookflres and more tents with Ghost following at their heels Jon had never seen so many wildlings He wondered if anyone ever had The camp goes on forever he reflected but it’s more a hundred camps than one and each more vulnerable than the last Stretched out over long leagues the wildlings had no defenses to speak of no pits nor sharpened stakes only small groups of outriders patrolling their perimeters Each group or clan or village had simply stopped where they wanted as soon as they saw others stopping or found a likely spot The free folk If his brothers were to catch them in such disarray many of them would pay for that freedom with their life’s blood They had numbers but the Night’s Watch had discipline and in battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten his father had once told him

There was no doubting which tent was the king’s It was thrice the size of the next largest he’d seen and he could hear music drifting from within Like many of the lesser tents it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on but Mance Rayder’s hides were the shaggy white pelts of snow bears The peaked roof was crowned with a huge set of antlers from one of the giant elks that had once roamed freely throughout the Seven Kingdoms in the times of the First Men

Here at least they found defenders two guards at the flap of the tent leaning on tall spears with round leather shields strapped to their arms When they caught sight of Ghost one of them lowered his spearpoint and said That beast stays here

Ghost stay Jon commanded The direwolf sat

Longspear watch the beast Rattleshirt yanked open the tent and gestured Jon and Ygritte inside

The tent was hot and smoky Baskets of burning peat stood in all four corners filling the air with a dim reddish light More skins carpeted the ground Jon felt utterly alone as he stood there in his blacks awaiting the pleasure of the turncloak who called himself King-beyond-the-Wall When his eyes had adjusted to the smoky red gloom he saw six people none of whom paid him any mind A dark young man and a pretty blonde woman were sharing a horn of mead A pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens while a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat crosslegged on a pillow playing a lute and singing





The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun

and her kisses were warmer than spring

But the Dornishman’s blade was made of black steel

and its kiss was a terrible thing





Jon knew the song though it was strange to hear it here in a shaggy hide tent beyond the Wall ten thousand leagues from the red mountains and warm winds of Dorne

Rattleshirt took off his yellowed helm as he waited for the song to end Beneath his bone-and-leather armor he was a small man and the face under the giant’s skull was ordinary with a knobby chin thin mustache and sallow pinched cheeks His eyes were close-set one eyebrow creeping all the way across his forehead dark hair thinning back from a sharp widow’s peak





The Dornishman’s wife would sing as she bathed

in a voice that was sweet as a peach
