Now this is interesting Jaime twisted to see how Brienne might take the accusation but the wench was as singleminded as a mule with a bit between his teeth I know of no betrayal She chafed at the ropes around her wrists Lady Catelyn commanded me to deliver Lannister to his brother at King’s Landing—

She was trying to drown him when we found them said Urswyck the Faithful

She reddened In anger I forgot myself but I would never have killed him If he dies the Lannisters will put my lady’s daughters to the sword

Ser Aenys was unmoved Why should that trouble us

Ransom him back to Riverrun urged Ser Danwell

Casterly Rock has more gold one brother objected

Kill him said another His head for Ned Stark’s

Shagwell the Fool somersaulted to the foot of the steps in his grey and pink motley and began to sing There once was a lion who danced with a bear oh my oh my…

Thilenth fool Vargo Hoat cuffed the man The Kingthlayer ith not for the bear He ith mine

He is no one’s should he die Roose Bolton spoke so softly that men quieted to hear him And pray recall my lord you are not master of Harrenhal till I march north

Fever made Jaime as fearless as he was lightheaded Can this be the Lord of the Dreadfort When last I heard my father had sent you scampering off with your tail betwixt your legs When did you stop running my lord

Bolton’s silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat’s slobbering malevolence Pale as morning mist his eyes concealed more than they told Jaime misliked those eyes They reminded him of the day at King’s Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said You have lost a hand

No said Jaime I have it here hanging round my neck

Roose Bolton reached down snapped the cord and flung the hand at Hoat Take this away The sight of it offends me

I will thend it to hith lord father I will tell him he muth pay one hundred thouthand dragonth or we thall return the Kingthlayer to him pieth by pieth And when we hath hith gold we thall deliver Ther Jaime to Karthark and collect a maiden too A roar of laughter went up from the Brave Companions

A fine plan said Roose Bolton the same way he might say A fine wine to a dinner companion though Lord Karstark will not be giving you his daughter King Robb has shortened him by a head for treason and murder As to Lord Tywin he remains at King’s Landing and there he will stay till the new year when his grandson takes for bride a daughter of Highgarden

Winterfell said Brienne You mean Winterfell King Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark

No longer The Battle of the Blackwater changed all The rose and the lion joined there to shatter Stannis Baratheon’s host and burn his fleet to ashes

I warned you Urswyck Jaime thought and you goat When you bet against the lions you lose more than your purse Is there word of my sister he asked

She is well As is your… nephew Bolton paused before he said nephew a pause that said I know Your brother also lives though he took a wound in the battle He beckoned to a dour northman in a studded brigantine Escort Ser Jaime to Qyburn And unbind this woman’s hands As the rope between Brienne’s wrists was slashed in two he said Pray forgive us my lady In such troubled times it is hard to know friend from foe

Brienne rubbed inside her wrist where the hemp had scraped her skin bloody My lord these men tried to rape me

Did they Lord Bolton turned his pale eyes on Vargo Hoat I am displeased By that and this of Ser Jaime’s hand

There were five northmen and as many Freys in the yard for every Brave Companion The goat might not be as clever as some but he could count that high at least He held his tongue

They took my sword Brienne said my armor…

You shall have no need of armor here my lady Lord Bolton told her In Harrenhal you are under my protection Amabel find suitable rooms for the Lady Brienne Walton you will see to Ser Jaime at once He did not wait for an answer but turned and climbed the steps his fur-trimmed cloak swirling behind Jaime had only enough time to exchange a quick look with Brienne before they were marched away separately

In the maester’s chambers beneath the rookery a grey-haired fatherly man named Qyburn sucked in his breath when he cut away the linen from the stump of Jaime’s hand

That bad Will I die

Qyburn pushed at the wound with a finger and wrinkled his nose at the gush of pus No Though in a few more days… He sliced away Jaime’s sleeve The corruption has spread See how tender the flesh is I must cut it all away The safest course would be to take the arm off

Then you’ll die Jaime promised Clean the stump and sew it up I’ll take my chances

Qyburn frowned I can leave you the upper arm make the cut at your elbow but…

Take any part of my arm and you’d best chop off the other one as well or I’ll strangle you with it afterward

Qyburn looked in his eyes Whatever he saw there gave him pause Very well I will cut away the rotten flesh no more Try to burn out the corruption with boiling wine and a poultice of nettle mustard seed and bread mold Mayhaps that will suffice It is on your head You will want milk of the poppy—

No Jaime dare not let himself be put to sleep he might be short an arm when he woke no matter what the man said

Qyburn was taken aback There will be pain

I’ll scream

A great deal of pain

I’ll scream very loudly

Will you take some wine at least

Does the High Septon ever pray

Of that I am not certain I shall bring the wine Lie back I must needs strap down your arm

With a bowl and a sharp blade Qyburn cleaned the stump while Jaime gulped down strongwine spilling it all over himself in the process His left hand did not seem to know how to find his mouth but there was something to be said for that The smell of wine in his sodden beard helped disguise the stench of pus

Nothing helped when the time came to pare away the rotten flesh Jaime did scream then and pounded his table with his good fist over and over and over again He screamed again when Qyburn poured boiling wine over what remained of his stump Despite all his vows and all his fears he lost consciousness for a time When he woke the maester was sewing at his arm with needle and catgut I left a flap of skin to fold back over your wrist

You have done this before muttered Jaime weakly He could taste blood in his mouth where he’d bitten his tongue

No man who serves with Vargo Hoat is a stranger to stumps He makes them wherever he goes

Qyburn did not look a monster Jaime thought He was spare and soft-spoken with warm brown eyes How does a maester come to ride with the Brave Companions

The Citadel took my chain Qyburn put away his needle I should do something about that wound above your eye as well The flesh is badly inflamed

Jaime closed his eyes and let the wine and Qyburn do their work Tell me of the battle As keeper of Harrenhal’s ravens Qyburn would have been the first to hear the news

Lord Stannis was caught between your father and the fire It’s said the Imp set the river itself aflame

Jaime saw green flames reaching up into the sky higher than the tallest towers as burning men screamed in the streets I have dreamed this dream before It was almost funny but there was no one to share the joke

Open your eye Qyburn soaked a cloth in warm water and dabbed at the crust of dried blood The eyelid was swollen but Jaime found he could force it open halfway Qyburn’s face loomed above How did you come by this one the maester asked
