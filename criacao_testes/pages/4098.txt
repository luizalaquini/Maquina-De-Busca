sciousness that it is quite in isolation
 Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed
through its lower boughs to the windy side A dim mass under
the slope reminded him that a shed occupied a place here
the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill so that at
its back part the roof was almost level with the ground In
front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with
tar as apreservative Through crevices in the roof and side
spread streaks and spots of light a combination of which made
the radiance that had attracted him Oak stepped up behind
whereleaning down upon the roof and putting his eye close
to a hole he could see into the interior clearly
 The place contained two women and two cows By the side
of the latter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket One
of the women was past middle age Her companion was ap+
parently young and graceful he could form no decided opinion

upon her looks her position being almost beneath his eye so
that he saw her in a birds-eye view as Miltons Satan first saw
Paradise She wore no bonnet or het but had enveloped her+
self in a large cloak which was carelessly flung over her head
as a covering
 There now well go home said the elder of the two resting
 her knuckles upon her hips and looking at their goings-on as
a whole I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now I have
never been more frightened in my life but I dont mind break+
ing my rest if she recovers
 The young woman whose eyelids were apparently inclined
to fall together on the smallest provocation of silenceyawned
in sympathy
 I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these
things she said
 As we are not we must do them ourselves said the other
for you must help me if you stay
Well my hat is gone however continued the younger It
went over the hedge I think The idea of such a slight wind
catching it
 The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed and was
encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red as absolutely
uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in
a dye of that colour her long back being mathematically level
The other was spottedgrey and white Beside her Oak now
noticed a little calf about a day old looking idiotically at
the two women which showed that it had not long been
accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight and often turn+
ing to the lantern which it apparently mistook for the moon
inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction
by experience Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had
been busy on Norcombe hill lately
 I think we had better send for some oatmeal said the
Yes aunt and Ill ride over for it as soon as it is
light 
 But theres no side-saddle
P 64
I can ride on the other  trust me
Oak upon hearing these remarks became more
curious to observe her features but this prospect being
denied him by the hooding efect of the cloak and by his
aerial position he felt himself drawing upon his fancy
for their details In making even horizontal and clear
inspections we colour and mould according to the warts
within us whatever our eyes bring in Had Gabriel
been able from the first to get a distinct view of her +
countenance his estimate of it as very handsome or
slightly so would have been as his soul required a
divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
form to fill an increasing void within him his position
moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy he
painted her a beauty
By one of those whimsical coincidences in which
Nature like a busy mother seems to spare a moment
from her unremitting labours to turn and make her
children smile the girl now dropped the cloak and
forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket
Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yellow
waggon myrtles and looking-glass  prosily as the
woman who owed him twopence
They placed the calf beside its mother again took
up the lantern and went out the light sinking down
the hill till it was no more than a nebula Gabriel
Oak returned to his flock

A GIRL ON HORSEBACK -- CONVERSATION
THE sluggish day began to break Even its position
terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest
and for no particular reason save that the incident of
the night had occurred there Oak went again into
the plantation Lingering and musing here he heard
the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill and soon
there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
its back ascending by the path leading past the cattle+
shed She was the young woman of the night before
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned
