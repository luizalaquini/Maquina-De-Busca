The sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries Tyrion peered out cautiously between the curtains They were passing through Cobbler’s Square where a sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers

Corruption the man cried shrilly There is the warning Behold the Father’s scourge He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky From this vantage the distant castle on Aegon’s High Hill was directly behind him with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers A clever choice of stage Tyrion reflected We have become swollen bloated foul Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve Pride comes before prayer maggots rule our castles and gold is all… but no more The Rotten Summer is at an end and the Whoremonger King is brought low When the boar did open him a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly hissing and biting He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle There comes the Harbinger Cleanse yourselves the gods cry out lest ye be cleansed Bathe in the wine of righteousness or you shall be bathed in fire Fire

Fire other voices echoed but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out Tyrion took solace from that He gave the command to continue and the litter rocked like a ship on a rough sea as the Burned Men cleared a path Twisted little monkey demon indeed The wretch did have a point about the High Septon to be sure What was it that Moon Boy had said of him the other day A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table The memory of the fool’s jape made Tyrion smile

He was pleased to reach the Red Keep without further incident As he climbed the steps to his chambers Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn Time that’s all I truly need time to piece it all together Once the chain is done… He opened the door to his solar

Cersei turned away from the window her skirts swirling around her slender hips How dare you ignore my summons

Who admitted you to my tower

Your tower This is my son’s royal castle

So they tell me Tyrion was not amused Crawn would be even less so his Moon Brothers had the guard today I was about to come to you as it happens

Were you

He swung the door shut behind him You doubt me

Always and with good reason

I’m hurt Tyrion waddled to the sideboard for a cup of wine He knew no surer way to work up a thirst than talking with Cersei If I’ve given you offense I would know how

What a disgusting little worm you are Myrcella is my only daughter Did you truly imagine that I would allow you to sell her like a bag of oats 

Myrcella he thought Well that egg has hatched Let’s see what color the chick is Hardly a bag of oats Myrcella is a princess Some would say this is what she was born for Or did you plan to marry her to Tommen

Her hand lashed out knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor Brother or no I should have your tongue out for that I am Joffrey’s regent not you and I say that Myrcella will not be shipped off to this Dornishman the way I was shipped to Robert Baratheon

Tyrion shook wine off his fingers and sighed Why not She’d be a deal safer in Dorne than she is here

Are you utterly ignorant or simply perverse You know as well as I that the Martells have no cause to love us

The Martells have every cause to hate us Nonetheless I expect them to agree Prince Doran’s grievance against House Lannister goes back only a generation but the Dornishmen have warred against Storm’s End and Highgarden for a thousand years and Renly has taken Dorne’s allegiance for granted Myrcella is nine Trystane Martell eleven I have proposed they wed when she reaches her fourteenth year Until such time she would be an honored guest at Sunspear under Prince Doran’s protection

A hostage Cersei said mouth tightening

An honored guest Tyrion insisted and I suspect Martell will treat Myrcella more kindly than Joffrey has treated Sansa Stark I had in mind to send Ser Arys Oakheart with her With a knight of the Kingsguard as her sworn shield no one is like to forget who or what she is

Small good Ser Arys will do her if Doran Martell decides that my daughter’s death would wash out his sister’s

Martell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl particularly one as sweet and innocent as Myrcella So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we’ll keep faith on our side and the terms are too rich to refuse Myrcella is the least part of it I’ve also offered him his sister’s killer a council seat some castles on the Marches…

Too much Cersei paced away from him restless as a lioness skirts swirling You’ve offered too much and without my authority or consent

This is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of If I’d offered less he’d likely spit in my face

Too much Cersei insisted whirling back

What would you have offered him that hole between your legs Tyrion said his own anger flaring

This time he saw the slap coming His head snapped around with a crack Sweet sweet sister he said I promise you that was the last time you will ever strike me

His sister laughed Don’t threaten me little man Do you think Father’s letter keeps you safe A piece of paper Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too for all the good it did him

Eddard Stark did not have the City Watch Tyrion thought nor my clansmen nor the sellswords that Bronn has hired I do Or so he hoped Trusting in Varys in Ser Jacelyn Bywater in Bronn Lord Stark had probably had his delusions as well

Yet he said nothing A wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier Instead he poured a fresh cup of wine How safe do you think Myrcella will be if King’s Landing falls Renly and Stannis will mount her head beside yours

And Cersei began to cry

Tyrion Lannister could not have been more astonished if Aegon the Conqueror himself had burst into the room riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies He had not seen his sister weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock Awkwardly he took a step toward her When your sister cries you were supposed to comfort her… but this was Cersei He reached a tentative hand for her shoulder

Don’t touch me she said wrenching away It should not have hurt yet it did more than any slap Red-faced as angry as she was grief-stricken Cersei struggled for breath Don’t look at me not… not like this… not you

Politely Tyrion turned his back I did not mean to frighten you I promise you nothing will happen to Myrcella

Liar she said behind him I’m not a child to be soothed with empty promises You told me you would free Jaime too Well where is he 

In Riverrun I should imagine Safe and under guard until I find a way to free him

Cersei sniffed I should have been born a man I would have no need of any of you then None of this would have been allowed to happen How could Jaime let himself be captured by that boy And Father I trusted in him fool that I am but where is he now that he’s wanted What is he doing

Making war

From behind the walls of Harrenhal she said scornfully A curious way of fighting It looks suspiciously like hiding

Look again

What else would you call it Father sits in one castle and Robb Stark sits in another and no one does anything

There is sitting and there is sitting Tyrion suggested Each one waits for the other to move but the lion is still poised his tail twitching while the fawn is frozen by fear bowels turned to jelly No matter which way he bounds the lion will have him and he knows it

And you’re quite certain that Father is the lion

Tyrion grinned It’s on all our banners

She ignored the jest If it was Father who’d been taken captive Jaime would not be sitting by idly I promise you

Jaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun and the Others take their chances He never did have any patience no more than you sweet sister Not all of us can be as bold as Jaime but there are other ways to win wars Harrenhal is strong and well situated

And King’s Landing is not as we both know perfectly well While Father plays lion and fawn with the Stark boy Renly marches up the roseroad He could be at our gates any day now

The city will not fall in a day From Harrenhal it is a straight swift march down the kingsroad Renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before Father takes him in the rear His host will be the hammer the city walls the anvil it makes a lovely picture

Cersei’s green eyes bored into him wary yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding her And if Robb Stark marches

Harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose Bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolf’s horse Stark cannot march on King’s Landing without taking Harrenhal first and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do that Tyrion tried his most winning smile Meanwhile Father lives off the fat of the riverlands while our uncle Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock
