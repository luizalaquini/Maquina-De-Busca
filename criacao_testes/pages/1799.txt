prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it and
I feel it is better to die than to live
A silence followed Boldwood aroused himself from
the momentary mood of confidence into which he had
drifted and walked on again resuming his usual reserve
 No Gabriel he resumed with a carelessness which
was like the smile on the countenance of a skull it
was made more of by other people than ever it was by
us I do feel a little regret occasionally but no woman
ever had power over me for any length of time Well
good morning  I can trust you not to mention to others
what has passed between us two here

COMING HOME -- A CRY
ON the turnpke road between Casterbridge and
Weatherbury and about three miles from the former
which pervade the highways of this undulating part of
South Wessex I returning from market it is usual
for the farmers and other gig-gentry to alight at the
bottom and walk up
One Saturday evening in the month of October
Bathshebas vehicle was duly creeping up this incline
She was sitting listlessly in the second seat of the gig
whilst walking beside her in farmers marketing suit
of unusually fashionable cut was an erect welimade
young man Though on foot he held the reins and
whip and occasionally aimed light cuts at the horses
ear with the end of the lash as a recreation This
man was her husband formerly Sergeant Troy who
having bought his discharge with Bathshebas money
was gradually transforming himself into a farmer of a
spirited and very modern school People of unalter+
able ideas still insisted upon calling him Sergeant
when they met him which was in some degree owing
to his having still retained the welishaped moustache
of his military days and the soldierly bearing insepar+
able from his form and training
Yes if it hadnt been for that wretched rain I
should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking
my love he was saying Dont you see it altered
all the chances To speak like a book I once read
wet weather is the narrative and fine days are the
episodes of our countrys history now isnt that
true
 But the time of year is come for changeable weather
Well yes The fact is these autumn races are the
ruin of everybody Never did I see such a day as twas 
Tis a wild open place just out of Budmouth and a
drab sea rolled in
P 318
towards us like liquid misery Wind
and rain -- good Lord  Dark  Why twas as black
as my hat before the last race was run Twas five
oclock and you couldnt see the horses till they were
almost in leave alone colours The ground was as
heavy as lead and all judgment from a fellows experi+
ence went for nothing Horses riders people were
all blown about like ships at sea Three booths were
blown over and the wretched folk inside crawled out
upon their hands and knees and in the next field
were as many as a dozen hats at one time Aye
Pimpernel regularly stuck fast when about sixty yards
off and when I saw Policy stepping on it did knock
my heart against the lining of my ribs I assure you
my love
 And you mean Frank said Bathsheba sadly --
her voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and
vivacity of the previous summer -- that you have lost
more than a hundred pounds in a month by this
dreadful horse-racing  O Frank it is cruel it is
foolish of you to take away my money so We shall
have to leave the farm that will be the end of it 
 Humbug about cruel Now there tis again --
turn on the waterworks  thats just like you
But youll promise me not to go to Budmouth
second meeting wont you   she implored Bathsheba
was at the full depth for tears but she maintained a
dry eye
I dont see why I should in fact if it turns out to
be a fine day I was thinking of taking you
Never never Ill go a hundred miles the other
way first I hate the sound of the very word
But the question of going to see the race or staying
at home has very little to do with the matter Bets are
all booked safely enough before the race begins you
may depend Whether it is a bad race for me or a
good one will have very little to do with our going
there next Monday
But you dont mean to say that you have risked
anything on this one too   she exclaimed with an
agonized look
There now dont you be a little fool Wait till you
are told Why Bathsheba you have lost all the pluck
and sauciness you formerly had and upon my life if I
had known what a
P 319
chicken-hearted creature you were
under all your boldness Id never have-i know what
A flash of indignation might have been seen in
