which was at Ashtaroth

911 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
to us saying Take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet
them and say unto them We are your servants therefore now make ye a
league with us

912 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and
it is mouldy 913 And these bottles of wine which we filled were
new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes
are become old by reason of the very long journey

914 And the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the
mouth of the LORD

915 And Joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to
let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them

916 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours
and that they dwelt among them

917 And the children of Israel journeyed and came unto their cities
on the third day Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and
Beeroth and Kirjathjearim

918 And the children of Israel smote them not because the princes of
the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel And
all the congregation murmured against the princes

919 But all the princes said unto all the congregation We have sworn
unto them by the LORD God of Israel now therefore we may not touch
them

920 This we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath
be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them

921 And the princes said unto them Let them live but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the
princes had promised them

922 And Joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying
Wherefore have ye beguiled us saying We are very far from you when
ye dwell among us  923 Now therefore ye are cursed and there shall
none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the house of my God

924 And they answered Joshua and said Because it was certainly told
thy servants how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to
give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
you and have done this thing

925 And now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and
right unto thee to do unto us do

926 And so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of
the children of Israel that they slew them not

927 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD even unto this
day in the place which he should choose

101 Now it came to pass when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done
to Jericho and her king so he had done to Ai and her king and how
the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among
them 102 That they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city
as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than Ai and
all the men thereof were mighty

103 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron and unto Piram king of Jarmuth and unto Japhia king of
Lachish and unto Debir king of Eglon saying 104 Come up unto me
and help me that we may smite Gibeon for it hath made peace with
Joshua and with the children of Israel

105 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites the king of Jerusalem
the king of Hebron the king of Jarmuth the king of Lachish the king
of Eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all
their hosts and encamped before Gibeon and made war against it

106 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal
saying Slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly
and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell
in the mountains are gathered together against us

107 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal he and all the people of war
with him and all the mighty men of valour

108 And the LORD said unto Joshua Fear them not for I have
delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand
before thee

109 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from Gilgal
all night

1010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel and slew them with
a great slaughter at Gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth
