I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you Tyrion said The Starks are another matter Lord Eddard—

—is our hostage his father said He will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon under the Red Keep

No Ser Kevan agreed but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host around him

No sword is strong until it’s been tempered Lord Tywin declared The Stark boy is a child No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind but in the end it comes down to butcher’s work I doubt he has the stomach for it

Things had gotten interesting while he’d been away Tyrion reflected And what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this ‘butcher’s work’ is being done he wondered How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend Ned

Robert Baratheon is dead his father told him Your nephew reigns in King’s Landing

That did take Tyrion aback My sister you mean He took another gulp of ale The realm would be a much different place with Cersei ruling in place of her husband

If you have a mind to make yourself of use I will give you a command his father said Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear raiding our lands across the Red Fork

Tyrion made a tsking sound The gall of them fighting back Ordinarily I’d be glad to punish such rudeness Father but the truth is I have pressing business elsewhere

Do you Lord Tywin did not seem awed We also have a pair of Ned Stark’s afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties Beric Dondarrion some young lordling with delusions of valor He has that fat jape of a priest with him the one who likes to set his sword on fire Do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off Without making too much a botch of it

Tyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled Father it warms my heart to think that you might entrust me with… what twenty men Fifty Are you sure you can spare so many Well no matter If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric I shall spank them both He climbed down from his chair and waddled to the sideboard where a wheel of veined white cheese sat surrounded by fruit First though I have some promises of my own to keep he said as he sliced off a wedge I shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks plus swords pikes steel spearheads maces battleaxes gauntlets gorgets greaves breastplates wagons to carry all this—

The door behind him opened with a crash so violently that Tyrion almost dropped his cheese Ser Kevan leapt up swearing as the captain of the guard went flying across the room to smash against the hearth As he tumbled down into the cold ashes his lion helm askew Shagga snapped the man’s sword in two over a knee thick as a tree trunk threw down the pieces and lumbered into the common room He was preceded by his stench riper than the cheese and overpowering in the closed space Little redcape he snarled when next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire

What no goats Tyrion said taking a bite of cheese

The other clansmen followed Shagga into the common room Bronn with them The sellsword gave Tyrion a rueful shrug

Who might you be Lord Tywin asked cool as snow

They followed me home Father Tyrion explained May I keep them They don’t eat much

No one was smiling By what right do you savages intrude on our councils demanded Ser Kevan

Savages lowlander Conn might have been handsome if you washed him We are free men and free men by rights sit on all war councils

Which one is the lion lord Chella asked

They are both old men announced Timett son of Timett who had yet to see his twentieth year

Ser Kevan’s hand went to his sword hilt but his brother placed two fingers on his wrist and held him fast Lord Tywin seemed unperturbed Tyrion have you forgotten your courtesies Kindly acquaint us with our… honored guests

Tyrion licked his fingers With pleasure he said The fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears

I’m no maid Chella protested My sons have taken fifty ears among them

May they take fifty more Tyrion waddled away from her This is Conn son of Coratt Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair They are Stone Crows Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers and here Timett son of Timett a red hand of the Burned Men And this is Bronn a sellsword of no particular allegiance He has already changed sides twice in the short time I’ve known him you and he ought to get on famously Father To Bronn and the clansmen he said May I present my lord father Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock Warden of the West Shield of Lannisport and once and future Hand of the King

Lord Tywin rose dignified and correct Even in the west we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon What brings you down from your strongholds my lords

Horses said Shagga

A promise of silk and steel said Timett son of Timett
