and would not let a nurse come in or anybody at all
But I thought ld wait in the next room in case she
should want me I heard her moving about inside
for more than an 
P 443
hour but she only came out once
and that was for more candles because hers had burnt
down into the socket She said we were to let her
know when you or Mr Thirdly came sir
Oak entered with the parson at this moment and
they all went upstairs together preceded by Liddy
Smallbury Everything was silent as the grave when
they paused on the landing Liddy knocked and
Bathshebas dress was heard rustling across the room
the key turned in the lock and she opened the door
Her looks were calm and nearly rigid like a slightly
animated bust of Melpomene
Oh Mr Aldritch you have come at last she
murmured from her lips merely and threw back the
door Ah and Mr Thirdly Well all is done and
anybody in the world may see him now She then
passed by him crossed the landing and entered
another room
Looking into the chamber of death she had vacated
they saw by the light of the candles which were on the
drawers a tall straight shape lying at the further end
of the bedroom wrapped in white Everything around
was quite orderly The doctor went in and after a
few minutes returned to the landing again where
Oak and the parson still waited
It is all done indeed as she says remarked Mr
Aldritch in a subdued voice The body has been
undressed and properly laid out in grave clothes
Gracious Heaven -- this mere girl She must have the
nerve of a stoic
The heart of a wife merely floated in a whisper
about the ears of the three and turning they saw
Bathsheba in the midst of them Then as if at that
instant to prove that her fortitude had been more of
will than of spontaneity she silently sank down between
them and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor
The simple consciousness that superhuman strain was
no longer required had at once put a period to her
power to continue it
They took her away into a further room and the
medical attendance which had been useless in Troys
case was invaluable in Bathshebas who fell into a
series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect for a
time The sufferer was got to bed 
P 444
and Oak finding
from the bulletins that nothing really dreadful was to
be apprehended on her score left the house Liddy
kept watch in Bathshebas chamber where she heard
her mistress moaning in whispers through the dull
slow hours of that wretched night O it is my fault
 -- how can I live O Heaven how can I live

THE MARCH FOLLOWING -- BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD
WE pass rapidly on into the month of March to a
breezy day without sunshine frost or dew On Yai
bury Hill about midway between Weatherbury and
Casterbridge where the turnpike road passes over
the crest a numerous concourse of people had
gathered the eyes of the greater number being fre+
quently stretched afar in a northerly direction The
groups consisted of a throng of idlers a party of
javelin-men and two trumpeters and in the midst
were carriages one of which contained the high
sheriff With the idlers many of whom had mounted
to the top of a cutting formed for the road were several
Weatherbury men and boys -- among others Poorgrass
Coggan and Cain Ball
At the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in
the expected quarter and shortly after a travelling+
carriage bringing one of the two judges on the Western
Circuit came up the hill and halted on the top The
judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown
by the big-cheeked trumpeters and a procession being
formed of the vehicles and javelin-men they all pro+
ceeded towards the town excepting the Weatherbury
men who as soon as they had seen the judge move
off returned home again to their work
 Joseph I zeed you squeezing close to the carriage
said Coggan as they walked Did ye notice my lord
judges face 
I did said Poorgrass I looked hard at en as
if I would read his very soul and there was mercy
in his eyes -- or to speak with the exact truth required
of us at this solemn time in the eye that was towards
me
Well I hope for the best said Coggan though
bad that must be However I shant go to the trial
and Id advise the rest of ye that baint wanted to bide
away Twill disturb his 
P 446
mind more than anything to
see us there staring at him as if he were a show
 The very thing I said this morning observed Joseph
