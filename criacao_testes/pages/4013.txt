mantel I dont have a bow
Check down the hall she says
After she leaves I consider a trip down the hall Rule it
out But after several hours I go anyway walking in silent
sock feet so as not to awaken the ghosts In the study
where I had my tea with President Snow I find a box with
my fathers hunting jacket our plant book my parents
wedding photo the spile Haymitch sent in and the locket
Peeta gave me in the clock arena The two bows and a
sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the
firebombing lie on the desk I put on the hunting jacket and
leave the rest of the stuff untouched I fall asleep on the sofa
in the formal living room A terrible nightmare follows where
Im lying at the bottom of a deep grave and every dead
person I know by name comes by and throws a shovel full of
ashes on me Its quite a long dream considering the list of
people and the deeper Im buried the harder it is to
breathe I try to call out begging them to stop but the ashes
fill my mouth and nose and I cant make any sound Still the
shovel scrapes on and on and on
I wake with a start Pale morning light comes around
the edges of the shutters The scraping of the shovel
continues Still half in the nightmare I run down the hall out
the front door and around the side of the house because
now Im pretty sure I can scream at the dead When I see
him I pull up short His face is flushed from digging up the
ground under the windows In a wheelbarrow are five
scraggly bushes
Youre back I say
Dr Aurelius wouldnt let me leave the Capitol until
yesterday Peeta says By the way he said to tell you he
cant keep pretending hes treating you forever You have to
pick up the phone
He looks well Thin and covered with burn scars like
me but his eyes have lost that clouded tortured look Hes
frowning slightly though as he takes me in I make a
halfhearted effort to push my hair out of my eyes and realize
its matted into clumps I feel defensive What are you
doing
I went to the woods this morning and dug these up
For her he says I thought we could plant them along the
side of the house
I look at the bushes the clods of dirt hanging from their
roots and catch my breath as the word rose registers Im
about to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full name
comes to me Not plain rose but evening primrose The
flower my sister was named for I give Peeta a nod of
assent and hurry back into the house locking the door
behind me But the evil thing is inside not out Trembling
with weakness and anxiety I run up the stairs My foot
catches on the last step and I crash onto the floor I force
myself to rise and enter my room The smells very faint but
still laces the air Its there The white rose among the dried
flowers in the vase Shriveled and fragile but holding on to
that unnatural perfection cultivated in Snows greenhouse I
grab the vase stumble down to the kitchen and throw its
contents into the embers As the flowers flare up a burst of
blue flame envelops the rose and devours it Fire beats
roses again I smash the vase on the floor for good
measure
Back upstairs I throw open the bedroom windows to
clear out the rest of Snows stench But it still lingers on my
clothes and in my pores I strip and flakes of skin the size
of playing cards cling to the garments Avoiding the mirror I
step into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair my
body my mouth Bright pink and tingling I find something
clean to wear It takes half an hour to comb out my hair
Greasy Sae unlocks the front door While she makes
breakfast I feed the clothes I had shed to the fire At her
suggestion I pare off my nails with a knife
Over the eggs I ask her Where did Gale go
District Two Got some fancy job there I see him now
and again on the television she says
I dig around inside myself trying to register anger
hatred longing I find only relief
Im going hunting today I say
Well I wouldnt mind some fresh game at that she
answers
I arm myself with a bow and arrows and head out
intending to exit 12 through the Meadow Near the square
are teams of masked and gloved people with horse-drawn
carts Sifting through what lay under the snow this winter
Gathering remains A carts parked in front of the mayors
house I recognize Thom Gales old crewmate pausing a
moment to wipe the sweat from his face with a rag I
remember seeing him in 13 but he must have come back
His greeting gives me the courage to ask Did they find
anyone in there
Whole family And the two people who worked for
them Thom tells me
Madge Quiet and kind and brave The girl who gave
me the pin that gave me a name I swallow hard Wonder if
shell be joining the cast of my nightmares tonight
Shoveling the ashes into my mouth I thought maybe since
he was the mayor
I dont think being the mayor of Twelve put the odds in
his favor says Thom
I nod and keep moving careful not to look in the back
of the cart All through the town and the Seam its the
same The reaping of the dead As I near the ruins of my
