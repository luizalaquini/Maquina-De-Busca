When I quarrel I do it with a sword coz I was speaking to the lady Tell me wench are all the women on Tarth as homely as you I pity the men if so Perhaps they do not know what real women look like living on a dreary mountain in the sea

Tarth is beautiful the wench grunted between strokes The Sapphire Isle it’s called Be quiet monster unless you mean to make me gag you

She’s rude as well isn’t she coz Jaime asked Ser Cleos Though she has steel in her spine I’ll grant you Not many men dare name me monster to my face Though behind my back they speak freely enough I have no doubt

Ser Cleos coughed nervously Lady Brienne had those lies from Catelyn Stark no doubt The Starks cannot hope to defeat you with swords ser so now they make war with poisoned words

They did defeat me with swords you chinless cretin Jaime smiled knowingly Men will read all sorts of things into a knowing smile if you let them Has cousin Cleos truly swallowed this kettle of dung or is he striving to ingratiate himself What do we have here an honest muttonhead or a lickspittle

Ser Cleos prattled blithely on Any man who’d believe that a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard would harm a child does not know the meaning of honor

Lickspittle If truth be told Jaime had come to rue heaving Brandon Stark out that window Cersei had given him no end of grief afterward when the boy refused to die He was seven Jaime she’d berated him Even if he understood what he saw we should have been able to frighten him into silence

I didn’t think you’d want—

You never think If the boy should wake and tell his father what he saw—

If if if He had pulled her into his lap if he wakes we’ll say he was dreaming we’ll call him a liar and should worse come to worst I’ll kill Ned Stark

And then what do you imagine Robert will do

Let Robert do as he pleases I’ll go to war with him if I must The War for Cersei’s Cunt the singers will call it

Jaime let go of me she raged struggling to rise

Instead he had kissed her For a moment she resisted but then her mouth opened under his He remembered the taste of wine and cloves on her tongue She gave a shudder His hand went to her bodice and yanked tearing the silk so her breasts spilled free and for a time the Stark boy had been forgotten

Had Cersei remembered him afterward and hired this man Lady Catelyn spoke of to make sure the boy never woke If she wanted him dead she would have sent me And it is not like her to chose a catspaw who would make such a royal botch of the killing

Downriver the rising sun shimmered against the wind-whipped surface of the river The south shore was red clay smooth as any road Smaller streams fed into the greater and the rotting trunks of drowned trees clung to the banks The north shore was wilder High rocky bluffs rose twenty feet above them crowned by stands of beech oak and chestnut Jaime spied a watchtower on the heights ahead growing taller with every stroke of the oars Long before they were upon it he knew that it stood abandoned its weathered stones overgrown with climbing roses

When the wind shifted Ser Cleos helped the big wench run up the sail a stiff triangle of striped red-and-blue canvas Tully colors sure to cause them grief if they encountered any Lannister forces on the river but it was the only sail they had Brienne took the rudder Jaime threw out the leeboard his chains rattling as he moved After that they made better speed with wind and current both favoring their flight We could save a deal of traveling if you delivered me to my father instead of my brother he pointed out

Lady Catelyn’s daughters are in King’s Landing I will return with the girls or not at all

Jaime turned to Ser Cleos Cousin lend me your knife

No The woman tensed I will not have you armed Her voice was as unyielding as stone

She fears me even in irons Cleos it seems I must ask you to shave me Leave the beard but take the hair off my head

You’d be shaved bald asked Cleos Frey

The realm knows Jaime Larmister as a beardless knight with long golden hair A bald man with a filthy yellow beard may pass unnoticed I’d sooner not be recognized while I’m in irons

The dagger was not as sharp as it might have been Cleos hacked away manfully sawing and ripping his way through the mats and tossing the hair over the side The golden curls floated on the surface of the water gradually falling astern As the tangles vanished a louse went crawling down his neck Jaime caught it and crushed it against his thumbnail Ser Cleos picked others from his scalp and flicked them into the water Jaime doused his head and made Ser Cleos whet the blade before he let him scrape away the last inch of yellow stubble When that was done they trimmed back his beard as well

The reflection in the water was a man he did not know Not only was he bald but he looked as though he had aged five years in that dungeon his face was thinner with hollows under his eyes and lines he did not remember I don’t look as much like Cersei this way She’ll hate that

By midday Ser Cleos had fallen asleep His snores sounded like ducks mating Jaime stretched out to watch the world flow past after the dark cell every rock and tree was a wonder

A few one-room shacks came and went perched on tall poles that made them look like cranes Of the folk who lived there they saw no sign Birds flew overhead or cried out from the trees along the shore and Jaime glimpsed silvery fish knifing through the water Tully trout there’s a bad omen he thought until he saw a worse—one of the floating logs they passed turned out to be a dead man bloodless and swollen His cloak was tangled in the roots of a fallen tree its color unmistakably Lannister crimson He wondered if the corpse had been someone he knew

The forks of the Trident were the easiest way to move goods or men across the riverlands In times of peace they would have encountered fisherfolk in their skiffs grain barges being poled downstream merchants selling needles and bolts of cloth from floating shops perhaps even a gaily painted mummer’s boat with quilted sails of half a hundred colors making its way upriver from village to village and castle to castle

But the war had taken its toll They sailed past villages but saw no villagers An empty net slashed and torn and hanging from some trees was the only sign of fisherfolk A young girl watering her horse rode off as soon as she glimpsed their sail Later they passed a dozen peasants digging in a field beneath the shell of a burnt towerhouse The men gazed at them with dull eyes and went back to their labors once they decided the skiff was no threat

The Red Fork was wide and slow a meandering river of loops and bends dotted with tiny wooded islets and frequently choked by sandbars and snags that lurked just below the water’s surface Brienne seemed to have a keen eye for the dangers though and always seemed to find the channel When Jaime complimented her on her knowledge of the river she looked at him suspiciously and said I do not know the river Tarth is an island I learned to manage oars and sail before I ever sat a horse

Ser Cleos sat up and rubbed at his eyes Gods my arms are sore I hope the wind lasts He sniffed at it I smell rain

Jaime would welcome a good rain The dungeons of Riverrun were not the cleanest place in the Seven Kingdoms By now he must smell like an overripe cheese

Cleos squinted downriver Smoke

A thin grey finger crooked them on It was rising from the south bank several miles on twisting and curling Below Jaime made out the smouldering remains of a large building and a live oak full of dead women

The crows had scarcely started on their corpses The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats and when the wind blew they twisted and swayed This was not chivalrously done said Brienne when they were close enough to see it clearly No true knight would condone such wanton butchery

True knights see worse every time they ride to war wench said Jaime And do worse yes

Brienne turned the rudder toward the shore I’ll leave no innocents to be food for crows

A heartless wench Crows need to eat as well Stay to the river and leave the dead alone woman

They landed upstream of where the great oak leaned out over the water As Brienne lowered the sail Jaime climbed out clumsy in his chains The Red Fork filled his boots and soaked through the ragged breeches Laughing he dropped to his knees plunged his head under the water and came up drenched and dripping His hands were caked with dirt and when he rubbed them clean in the current they seemed thinner and paler than he remembered His legs were stiff as well and unsteady when he put his weight upon them I was too bloody long in Hoster Tully’s dungeon

Brienne and Cleos dragged the skiff onto the bank The corpses hung above their heads ripening in death like foul fruit One of us will need to cut them down the wench said

I’ll climb Jaime waded ashore clanking Just get these chains off

The wench was staring up at one of the dead women Jaime shuffled closer with small stutter steps the only kind the foot-long chain permitted When he saw the crude sign hung about the neck of the highest corpse he smiled They Lay With Lions he read Oh yes woman this was most unchivalrously done… But by your side not mine I wonder who they were these women

Tavern wenches said Ser Cleos Frey This was an inn I remember it now Some men of my escort spent the night here when we last returned to Riverrun Nothing remained of the building but the stone foundation and a tangle of collapsed beams charred black Smoke still rose from the ashes

Jaime left brothels and whores to his brother Tyrion Cersei was the only woman he had ever wanted The girls pleasured some of my lord father’s soldiers it would seem Perhaps served them food and drink That’s how they earned their traitors’ collars with a kiss and a cup of ale He glanced up and down the river to make certain they were quite alone This is Bracken land Lord Jonos might have ordered them killed My father burned his castle I fear he loves us not

It might be Marq Piper’s work said Ser Cleos Or that wisp o’ the wood Beric Dondarrion though I’d heard he kills only soldiers Perhaps a band of Roose Bolton’s northmen

Bolton was defeated by my father on the Green Fork

But not broken said Ser Cleos He came south again when Lord Tywin marched against the fords The word at Riverrun was that he’d taken Harrenhal from Ser Amory Lorch

Jaime liked the sound of that not at all Brienne he said granting her the courtesy of the name in the hopes that she might listen if Lord Bolton holds Harrenhal both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely watched

He thought he saw a touch of uncertainty in her big blue eyes You are under my protection They’d need to kill me

I shouldn’t think that would trouble them
