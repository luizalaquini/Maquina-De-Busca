The source-filter model of speech production indicates that an electrical
analogue of the vocal tract can be obtained by considering the source
excitation and the filter that produces the formant frequencies separately
This approach was pioneered by Fant 1960 and we shall present much of his
work in this chapter

Fant 1960 Acoustic theory of speech production

There has been some discussion over whether the source-filter model really
is a good one and some
synthesizers
explicitly introduce an element of
sub-glottal coupling which simulates the effect of the lung cavity
on the vocal tract transfer function during the periods when the glottis is
open for an example see Rabiner 1968

Rabiner 1968 Digital formant synthesizer JASA

However this is very much a low-order effect when considering
speech synthesized by rule from a written representation for the software
which calculates parameter values to drive the synthesizer is a far greater
source of degradation in speech quality

Figure 51 shows the source-filter model of speech production
FC Figure 51
For voiced speech the excitation source produces a waveform whose frequency
components decay at about 12 dBoctave as we shall see in a later section
The excitation passes into the vocal tract filter  Conceptually this can best
be viewed as an infinite series of formant filters although for implementation
purposes only the first few are modelled explicitly and the effect of the rest
is lumped together into a higher-formant compensation network  In either case
the overall frequency profile of the filter is a flat one upon which humps are
superimposed at the various formant frequencies  Thus the output of the
vocal tract filter falls off at 12 dBoctave just as the input does
However measurements of actual speech show a 6 dBoctave decay with increasing
frequency  This is explained by the effect of radiation of speech from the
lips which in fact has a differentiating action producing a 6 dBoctave
rise in the frequency spectrum  This 6 dBoctave lift is similar to that
provided by a treble boost control on a radio or amplifier  Speech synthesized
without it sounds unnaturally heavy and bassy
pp
These overall spectral shapes which are derived from considering the human
vocal tract are summarized in the upper annotations in Figure 51  But there
is no real necessity for a synthesizer to model the frequency characteristics
of the human vocal tract at intermediate points  only the output speech is of
any concern  Because the system is a linear one the filter blocks in the
figure can be shuffled around to suit engineering requirements  One such
requirement is the desire to minimize internally-generated noise in the
electrical implementation most of which will arise in the vocal tract filter
because it is much more complicated than the other components  For this
reason an excitation source with a flat spectrum is often preferred as shown
in the lower annotations  This can be generated either by taking the desired
glottal pulse shape with its 12 dBoctave fall-off and passing it through a
filter giving 12 dBoctave lift at higher frequencies or if the pulse shape
is to be stored digitally by storing its second derivative instead
Then the radiation compensation which is now more properly called
spectral equalization will comprise a 6 dBoctave fall-off to give the
required trend in the output spectrum
pp
For a given pitch period this scheme yields exactly the same spectral
characteristics as the original system which modelled the human vocal tract
However when the pitch varies there will be a difference for sounds with
higher excitation frequencies will be attenuated by -6 dBoctave in the new
system and +6 dBoctave in the old by the final spectral equalization
In practice the pitch of the human voice lies quite low in the frequency
region em usually below 400 Hz em and if all filter characteristics begin
their roll-off at this frequency the two systems will be the same  This
simplifies the implementation with a slight compromise in its accuracy in
modelling the spectral trend of human speech for the overall -6 dBoctave
decay actually begins at a frequency of around 100 Hz  If this is
implemented some adjustment will need to be made to the amplitudes to ensure
that high-pitched sounds are not attenuated unduly
pp
The discussion so far pertains to voiced speech only  The source spectrum of
the random excitation in unvoiced sounds is substantially flat and combines
with the radiation from the lips to give a +6 dBoctave rise in the output
spectrum  Hence if spectral equalization is changed to -6 dBoctave to
accomodate a voiced excitation with flat spectrum the noise source should
show a 12 dBoctave rise to give the correct overall effect
sh 52  The excitation sources
pp
In human speech the excitation source for voiced sounds is produced by two
flaps of skin called the vocal cords  These are blown apart by pressure from
the lungs  When they come apart the pressure is relieved and the muscles
tensioning the skin cause the flaps to come together again  Subsequently the
lung pressure em called sub-glottal pressure em builds up once more and the
process is repeated  The factors which influence the rate and nature of
vibration are muscular tension of the cords and the sub-glottal pressure  The detail
of the excitation has considerable importance to speech synthesis because it
greatly influences the apparent naturalness of the sound produced  For example
if you have inflamed vocal cords caused by laryngitis the sound quality
changes dramatically  Old people who do not have proper muscular control over
their vocal cord tension produce a quavering sound  Shouted speech can easily
be distinguished from quiet speech even when the volume cue is absent em you
can verify this by fiddling with the volume control of a tape recorder em because
when shouting the vocal cords stay apart for a much smaller fraction of the
pitch cycle than at normal volumes
