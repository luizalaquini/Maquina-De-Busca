454 And Joseph said unto his brethren Come near to me I pray you
And they came near And he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye
sold into Egypt

455 Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye
sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life

456 For these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet
there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor
harvest

457 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance

458 So now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he hath
made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler
throughout all the land of Egypt

459 Haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him Thus saith
thy son Joseph God hath made me lord of all Egypt come down unto me
tarry not 4510 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen and thou
shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens
children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 4511
And there will I nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine
lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty

4512 And behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you

4513 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all
that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither

4514 And he fell upon his brother Benjamins neck and wept and
Benjamin wept upon his neck

4515 Moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and
after that his brethren talked with him

4516 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaohs house saying
Josephs brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well and his
servants

4517 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph Say unto thy brethren This do ye
lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of Canaan 4518 And
take your father and your households and come unto me and I will
give you the good of the land of Egypt and ye shall eat the fat of
the land

4519 Now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your
father and come

4520 Also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of
Egypt is yours

4521 And the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them wagons
according to the commandment of Pharaoh and gave them provision for
the way

4522 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to
Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of
raiment

4523 And to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden
with the good things of Egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and
bread and meat for his father by the way

4524 So he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said
unto them See that ye fall not out by the way

4525 And they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan
unto Jacob their father 4526 And told him saying Joseph is yet
alive and he is governor over all the land of Egypt And Jacobs
heart fainted for he believed them not

4527 And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said
unto them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry
him the spirit of Jacob their father revived 4528 And Israel said
It is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before
I die

461 And Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to
Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac

462 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said
Jacob Jacob And he said Here am I

463 And he said I am God the God of thy father fear not to go down
into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nation 464 I will
go down with thee into Egypt and I will also surely bring thee up
again and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes

465 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba and the sons of Israel carried
Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him

466 And they took their cattle and their goods which they had
gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and all his
seed with him 467 His sons and his sons sons with him his
daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with
