If the main computer system is time-shared the synthesis-by-rule
procedure is best executed by an independent processor
For example a 16-bit microcomputer controlling a hardware
formant synthesizer has been used to run the
ISP system in real time without too much difficulty Witten and Abbess 1979

An important task is to define an interface between the two which
allows the main process to control relevant aspects of the prosody of
the speech in a way which is appropriate to the state of the interaction
without having to bother about such things as matching the intonation contour
to the utterance and the details of syllable rhythm
Hallidays notation appears to be quite suitable for this purpose
pp
If there is only one synthesizer on the system there will be no
difficulty in addressing it
One way of dealing with multiple synthesizers is to treat them as
assignable devices in the same way that non-spooling peripherals
are in many operating systems
Notice that the data rate to the synthesizer is quite low
if the utterance is represented as text with prosodic markers
and can easily be handled by a low-speed asynchronous serial line
pp
The Votrax ML-I synthesizer which is discussed in the next chapter has an
interface which interposes it between a visual display unit and the serial
port that connects it to the computer
The VDU terminal can be used quite normally except that a special sequence
of two control characters will cause Votrax to intercept the following
message up to another control character and interpret it as speech
The fact that the characters which specify the spoken message do not appear
on the VDU screen means that the operation is invisible to the user
However this transparency can be inhibited by a switch on the synthesizer
to allow visual checking of the sound-segment character sequence
pp
Votrax buffers up to 64 sound segments which is sufficient to generate
isolated spoken messages
For longer passages it can be synchronized with the constant-rate
serial output using the modem control lines of the serial interface
together with appropriate device-driving software
pp
This is a particularly convenient interfacing technique in cases when the
synthesizer should always be associated with a certain terminal 
As an example of how it can be used
one can arrange files each of whose lines contain a printed message
together with its Votrax equivalent bracketed by the appropriate
control characters
When such a file is listed or examined with an editor program the lines
appear simultaneously in spoken and typed English
pp
If a phonetic representation is used for utterances with real-time
synthesis using a separate process or processor it is easy for
the programmer to fiddle about with the interactive dialogue to get
it feeling right
For him each utterance is just a textual string which
can be stored as a string constant within his program just as a VDU prompt
would be  He can edit it as part of his program and print it to
the speech synthesis device to hear it
There are no more technical problems to developing an interactive dialogue
with speech output than there are for a conventional interactive program
Of course there are more human problems and the points discussed
in the last section should always be borne in mind
sh 103  Using the keypad
pp
One of the greatest advantages of speech output from computers is the
ubiquity of the telephone network and the possibility of using it without
the need for special equipment at the terminal
The requirement for input as well as output obviously presents something of a problem
because of the restricted nature of the telephone keypad
pp
Figure 101 shows the layout of the keypad

Signalling is achieved by dual-frequency tones
For example if key 7 is pressed sinusoidal components at 852 Hz and 1209 Hz
are transmitted down the line
During the process of dialling these are received by the telephone exchange
equipment which assembles the digits that form a number and attempts to route
the call appropriately
Once a connection is made either party is free to press keys if desired
and the signals will be transmitted to the other end
where they can be decoded by simple electronic circuits
pp
Dial telephones signal with closely-spaced dial pulses
One pulse is generated for a 1 two for a 2 and so on
Obviously ten pulses are generated for a 0 rather than none  Unfortunately
once the connection is made it is difficult to signal with dial pulses
They cannot be decoded reliably at the other end because the telephone
network is not designed to transmit such low frequencies
However hand-held tone generators can be purchased for use with dial
telephones
Although these are undeniably extra equipment and one purpose of using speech
output is to avoid this they are very cheap and portable compared with other
computer terminal equipment
pp
The small number of keys on the telephone pad makes it rather difficult
to use for communicating with computers
Provision is made for 16 keys but only 12 are implemented em the others
may be used for some military purposes
Of course if a separate tone generator is used then advantage can be taken
