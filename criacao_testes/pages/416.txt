Arya had not known her brother was so near Riverrun was much closer than Winterfell though she was not certain where it lay in relation to Harrenhal I could find out somehow I know I could if only I could get away When she thought of seeing Robb’s face again Arya had to bite her lip And I want to see Jon too and Bran and Rickon and Mother Even Sansa… I’ll kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady she’ll like that

From the courtyard talk she’d learned that the upper chambers of the Tower of Dread housed three dozen captives taken during some battle on the Green Fork of the Trident Most had been given freedom of the castle in return for their pledge not to attempt escape They vowed not to escape Arya told herself but they never swore not to help me escape

The captives ate at their own table in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths and could often be seen about the grounds Four brothers took their exercise together every day fighting with staves and wooden shields in the Flowstone Yard Three of them were Freys of the Crossing the fourth their bastard brother They were only there a short time though one morning two other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold and ransomed them from the knights who’d captured them The six Freys all left together

No one ransomed the northmen though One fat lordling haunted the kitchens Hot Pie told her always looking for a morsel His mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth and the clasp that held his cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident He belonged to Lord Tywin but the fierce bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off him Sansa would have known who he was and the fat one too but Arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done

She did remember Lord Cerwyn though His lands had been close to Winterfell so he and his son Cley had often visited Yet as fate would have it he was the only captive who was never seen he was abed in a tower cell recovering from a wound For days and days Arya tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him If he knew her he would be honor bound to help her A lord would have gold for a certainty they all did perhaps he would pay some of Lord Tywin’s own sellswords to take her to Riverrun Father had always said that most sellswords would betray anyone for enough gold

Then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon The body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk decorated with a battle-axe sigil When Arya asked who it was one of the guards told her that Lord Cerwyn had died The words felt like a kick in the belly He could never have helped you anyway she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate He couldn’t even help himself you stupid mouse

After that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors Lord Tywin would soon march on Riverrun she heard or he would drive south to Highgarden no one would ever expect that No he must defend King’s Landing Stannis was the greatest threat He’d sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger from his back He’d sent ravens to the Eyrie he meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win the Vale He’d bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the Stark wargs He was writing Lady Stark to make a peace the Kingslayer would soon be freed

Though ravens came and went every day Lord Tywin himself spent most of his days behind closed doors with his war council Arya caught glimpses of him but always from afar—once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below He stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword They said Lord Tywin loved gold most of all he even shit gold she heard one squire jest The Lannister lord was strong-looking for an old man with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head There was something in his face that reminded Arya of her own father even though they looked nothing alike He has a lord’s face that’s all she told herself She remembered hearing her lady mother tell Father to put on his lord’s face and go deal with some matter Father had laughed at that She could not imagine Lord Tywin ever laughing at anything

One afternoon while she was waiting her turn to draw a pail of water from the well she heard the hinges of the east gate groaning A party of men rode under the portcullis at a walk When she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader a stab of hate shot through her

In the light of day Ser Amory Lorch looked less frightening than he had by torchlight but he still had the pig’s eyes she recalled One of the women said that his men had ridden all the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and slaying rebels We weren’t rebels Arya thought We were the Night’s Watch the Night’s Watch takes no side Ser Amory had fewer men than she remembered though and many wounded I hope their wounds fester I hope they all die

Then she saw the three near the end of the column

Rorge had donned a black halfhelm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that he did not have a nose Biter rode ponderously beside him on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under his weight Half-healed burns covered his body making him even more hideous than before

But Jaqen H’ghar still smiled His garb was still ragged and filthy but he had found time to wash and brush his hair It streamed down across his shoulders red and white and shiny and Arya heard the girls giggling to each other in admiration

I should have let the fire have them Gendry said to I should have listened If she hadn’t thrown them that axe they’d all be dead For a moment she was afraid but they rode past her without a flicker of interest Only Jaqen H’ghar so much as glanced in her direction and his eyes passed right over her He does not know me she thought Arry was a fierce little boy with a sword and I’m just a grey mouse girl with a pail

She spent the rest of that day scrubbing steps inside the Wailing Tower By evenfall her hands were raw and bleeding and her arms so sore they trembled when she lugged the pail back to the cellar Too tired even for food Arya begged Weese’s pardons and crawled into her straw to sleep Weese she yawned Dunsen Chiswyck Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Gregor Ser Amory Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei She thought she might add three more names to her prayer but she was too tired to decide tonight

Arya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand clamped down over her mouth like smooth warm stone solid and unyielding She woke at once squirming and struggling A girl says nothing a voice whispered close behind her ear A girl keeps her lips closed no one hears and friends may talk in secret Yes

Heart pounding Arya managed the tiniest of nods

Jaqen H’ghar took his hand away The cellar was black as pitch and she could not see his face even inches away She could smell him though his skin smelled clean and soapy and he had scented his hair A boy becomes a girl he murmured

I was always a girl I didn’t think you saw me

A man sees A man knows

She remembered that she hated him You scared me You’re one of them now I should have let you burn What are you doing here Go away or I’ll yell for Weese

A man pays his debts A man owes three

Three

The Red God has his due sweet girl and only death may pay for life This girl took three that were his This girl must give three in their places Speak the names and a man will do the rest

He wants to help me Arya realized with a rush of hope that made her dizzy Take me to Riverrun it’s not far if we stole some horses we could—

He laid a finger on her lips Three lives you shall have of me No more no less Three and we are done So a girl must ponder He kissed her hair softly But not too long

By the time Arya lit her stub of a candle only a faint smell remained of him a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air The woman in the next niche rolled over on her straw and complained of the light so Arya blew it out When she closed her eyes she saw faces swimming before her Joffrey and his mother Ilyn Payne and Meryn Trant and Sandor Clegane… but they were in King’s Landing hundreds of miles away and Ser Gregor had lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging taking Raff and Chiswyck and the Tickler with him Ser Amory Lorch was here though and she hated him almost as much Didn’t she She wasn’t certain And there was always Weese
