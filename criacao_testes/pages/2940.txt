811 For wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be
desired are not to be compared to it

812 I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty
inventions

813 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and
the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate

814 Counsel is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding I have
strength

815 By me kings reign and princes decree justice

816 By me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth

817 I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find
me

818 Riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and
righteousness

819 My fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue
than choice silver

820 I lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of
judgment 821 That I may cause those that love me to inherit
substance and I will fill their treasures

822 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way before his
works of old

823 I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the
earth was

824 When there were no depths I was brought forth when there were
no fountains abounding with water

825 Before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought
forth 826 While as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields
nor the highest part of the dust of the world

827 When he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass
upon the face of the depth 828 When he established the clouds above
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep 829 When he gave to
the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment
when he appointed the foundations of the earth 830 Then I was by
him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight
rejoicing always before him 831 Rejoicing in the habitable part of
his earth and my delights were with the sons of men

832 Now therefore hearken unto me O ye children for blessed are
they that keep my ways

833 Hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not

834 Blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates
waiting at the posts of my doors

835 For whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the
LORD

836 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they
that hate me love death

91 Wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven
pillars 92 She hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine
she hath also furnished her table

93 She hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest
places of the city 94 Whoso is simple let him turn in hither as
for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him 95 Come eat of
my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled

96 Forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding

97 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot

98 Reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and
he will love thee

99 Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a
just man and he will increase in learning

910 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the
knowledge of the holy is understanding

911 For by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life
shall be increased

912 If thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou
scornest thou alone shalt bear it

913 A foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing

914 For she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high
places of the city 915 To call passengers who go right on their
ways 916 Whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him
that wanteth understanding she saith to him 917 Stolen waters are
