You know no one by that name A serving girl a woman from some nearby village Perhaps someone from years past Catelyn had been gone from Riverrun for a very long time

No my lady I can make inquiries if you like Utherydes Wayn would surely know if any such person ever served at Riverrun Tansy did you say The smallfolk often name their daughters after flowers and herbs The maester looked thoughtful There was a widow I recall she used to come to the castle looking for old shoes in need of new soles Her name was Tansy now that I think on it Or was it Pansy Some such But she has not come for many years   

Her name was Violet said Catelyn who remembered the old woman very well

Was it The maester looked apologetic My pardons Lady Catelyn but I may not stay Ser Desmond has decreed that we are to speak to you only so far as our duties require

Then you must do as he commands Catelyn could not blame Ser Desmond she had given him small reason to trust her and no doubt he feared that she might use the loyalty that many of the folk of Riverrun would still feel toward their lord’s daughter to work some further mischief I am free of the war at least she told herself if only for a little while

After the maester had gone she donned a woolen cloak and stepped out onto the balcony once more Sunlight shimmered on the rivers gilding the surface of the waters as they rolled past the castle Catelyn shaded her eyes against the glare searching for a distant sail dreading the sight of one But there was nothing and nothing meant that her hopes were still alive

All that day she watched and well into the night until her legs ached from the standing A raven came to the castle in late afternoon flapping down on great black wings to the rookery Dark wings dark words she thought remembering the last bird that had come and the horror it had brought

Maester Vyman returned at evenfall to minister to Lord Tully and bring Catelyn a modest supper of bread cheese and boiled beef with horseradish I spoke to Utherydes Wayn my lady He is quite certain that no woman by the name of Tansy has ever been at Riverrun during his service

There was a raven today I saw Has Jaime been taken again Or slain gods forbid

No my lady we’ve had no word of the Kingslayer

Is it another battle then Is Edmure in difficulty Or Robb Please be kind put my fears at rest

My lady I should not    Vyman glanced about as if to make certain no one else was in the room Lord Tywin has left the riverlands All’s quiet on the fords

Whence came the raven then

From the west he answered busying himself with Lord Hoster’s bedclothes and avoiding her eyes

Was it news of Robb

He hesitated Yes my lady

Something is wrong She knew it from his manner He was hiding something from her Tell me Is it Robb Is he hurt Not dead gods be good please do not tell me that he is dead

His Grace took a wound storming the Crag Maester Vyman said still evasive but writes that it is no cause for concern and that he hopes to return soon

A wound What sort of wound How serious

No cause for concern he writes

All wounds concern me Is he being cared for

I am certain of it The maester at the Crag will tend to him I have no doubt

Where was he wounded

My lady I am commanded not to speak with you I am sorry Gathering up his potions Vyman made a hurried exit and once again Catelyn was left alone with her father The milk of the poppy had done its work and Lord Hoster was sunk in heavy sleep A thin line of spittle ran down from one corner of his open mouth to dampen his pillow Catelyn took a square of linen and wiped it away gently When she touched him Lord Hoster moaned Forgive me he said so softly she could scarcely hear the words Tansy    blood    the blood    gods be kind   

His words disturbed her more than she could say though she could make no sense of them Blood she thought Must it all come back to blood Father who was this woman and what did you do to her that needs so much forgiveness

That night Catelyn slept fitfully haunted by formless dreams of her children the lost and the dead Well before the break of day she woke with her father’s words echoing in her ears Sweet babes and trueborn    why would he say that unless    could he have fathered a bastard on this woman Tansy She could not believe it Her brother Edmure yes it would not have surprised her to learn that Edmure had a dozen natural children But not her father not Lord Hoster Tully never

Could Tansy be some pet name he called Lysa the way he called me Cat Lord Hoster had mistaken her for her sister before You’ll have others he said Sweet babes and trueborn Lysa had miscarried five times twice in the Eyrie thrice at King’s Landing    but never at Riverrun where Lord Hoster would have been at hand to comfort her Never unless    unless she was with child that first time   

She and her sister had been married on the same day and left in their father’s care when their new husbands had ridden off to rejoin Robert’s rebellion Afterward when their moon blood did not come at the accustomed time Lysa had gushed happily of the sons she was certain they carried Your son will be heir to Winterfell and mine to the Eyrie Oh they’ll be the best of friends like your Ned and Lord Robert They’ll be more brothers than cousins truly I just know it She was so happy

But Lysa’s blood had come not long after and all the joy had gone out of her Catelyn had always thought that Lysa had simply been a little late but if she had been with child   

She remembered the first time she gave her sister Robb to hold small red-faced and squalling but strong even then full of life No sooner had Catelyn placed the babe in her sister’s arms than Lysa’s face dissolved into tears Hurriedly she had thrust the baby back at Catelyn and fled

If she had lost a child before that might explain Father’s words and much else besides    Lysa’s match with Lord Arryn had been hastily arranged and Jon was an old man even then older than their father An old man without an heir His first two wives had left him childless his brother’s son had been murdered with Brandon Stark in King’s Landing his gallant cousin had died in the Battle of the Bells He needed a young wife if House Arryn was to continue    a young wife known to be fertile

Catelyn rose threw on a robe and descended the steps to the darkened solar to stand over her father A sense of helpless dread filled her Father she said Father I know what you did She was no longer an innocent bride with a head full of dreams She was a widow a traitor a grieving mother and wise wise in the ways of the world You made him take her she whispered Lysa was the price Jon Arryn had to pay for the swords and spears of House Tully

Small wonder her sister’s marriage had been so loveless The Arryns were proud and prickly of their honor Lord Jon might wed Lysa to bind the Tullys to the cause of the rebellion and in hopes of a son but it would have been hard for him to love a woman who came to his bed soiled and unwilling He would have been kind no doubt dutiful yes but Lysa needed warmth

The next day as she broke her fast Catelyn asked for quill and paper and began a letter to her sister in the Vale of Arryn She told Lysa of Bran and Rickon struggling with the words but mostly she wrote of their father His thoughts are all of the wrong he did you now that his time grows short Maester Vyman says he dare not make the milk of the poppy any stronger It is time for Father to lay down his sword and shield It is time for him to rest Yet he fights on grimly will not yield It is for your sake I think He needs your forgiveness The war has made the road from the Eyrie to Riverrun dangerous to travel I know but surely a strong force of knights could see you safely through the Mountains of the Moon A hundred men or a thousand And if you cannot come will you not write him at least A few words of love so he might die in peace Write what you will and I shall read it to him and ease his way

Even as she set the quill aside and asked for sealing wax Catelyn sensed that the letter was like to be too little and too late Maester Vyman did not believe Lord Hoster would linger long enough for a raven to reach the Eyrie and return Though he has said much the same before    Tully men did not surrender easily no matter the odds After she entrusted the parchment to the maester’s care Catelyn went to the sept and lit a candle to the Father Above for her own father’s sake a second to the Crone who had let the first raven into the world when she peered through the door of death and a third to the Mother for Lysa and all the children they had both lost

Later that day as she sat at Lord Hoster’s bedside with a book reading the same passage over and over she heard the sound of loud voices and a trumpet’s blare Ser Robin she thought at once flinching She went to the balcony but there was nothing to be seen out on the rivers but she could hear the voices more clearly from outside the sound of many horses the clink of armor and here and there a cheer Catelyn made her way up the winding stairs to the roof of the keep Ser Desmond did not forbid me the roof she told herself as she climbed

The sounds were coming from the far side of the castle by the main gate A knot of men stood before the portcullis as it rose in jerks and starts and in the fields beyond outside the castle were several hundred riders When the wind blew it lifted their banners and she trembled in relief at the sight of the leaping trout of Riverrun Edmure

It was two hours before he saw fit to come to her By then the castle rang to the sound of noisy reunions as men embraced the women and children they had left behind Three ravens had risen from the rookery black wings beating at the air as they took flight Catelyn watched them from her father’s balcony She had washed her hair changed her clothing and prepared herself for her brother’s reproaches    but even so the waiting was hard

When at last she heard sounds outside her door she sat and folded her hands in her lap Dried red mud spattered Edmure’s boots greaves and surcoat To look at him you would never know he had won his battle He was thin and drawn with pale cheeks unkempt beard and too-bright eyes

Edmure Catelyn said worried you look unwell Has something happened Have the Lannisters crossed the river

I threw them back Lord Tywin Gregor Clegane Addam Marbrand I turned them away Stannis though    He grimaced

Stannis What of Stannis

He lost the battle at King’s Landing Edmure said unhappily His fleet was burned his army routed

A Lannister victory was ill tidings but Catelyn could not share her brother’s obvious dismay She still had nightmares about the shadow she had seen slide across Renly’s tent and the way the blood had come flowing out through the steel of his gorget Stannis was no more a friend than Lord Tywin

You do not understand Highgarden has declared for Joffrey Dorne as well All the south His mouth tightened And you see fit to loose the Kingslayer You had no right

I had a mother’s right Her voice was calm though the news about Highgarden was a savage blow to Robb’s hopes She could not think about that now though

No right Edmure repeated He was Robb’s captive your king’s captive and Robb charged me to keep him safe

Brienne will keep him safe She swore it on her sword

That woman

She will deliver Jaime to King’s Landing and bring Arya and Sansa back to us safely
