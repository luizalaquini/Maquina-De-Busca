Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio Gluttons are greedy men as a rule and magisters are devious Illyrio Mopatis is both What do you truly know of him

I know that he gave me my dragon eggs

He snorted If he’d known they were like to hatch he’d would have sat on them himself

That made her smile despite herself Oh I have no doubt of that ser I know Illyrio better than you think I was a child when I left his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars but I was neither deaf nor blind And I am no child now

Even if Illyrio is the friend you think him the knight said stubbornly he is not powerful enough to enthrone you by himself no more than he could your brother

He is rich she said Not so rich as Xaro perhaps but rich enough to hire ships for me and men as well

Sellswords have their uses Ser Jorah admitted but you will not win your father’s throne with sweepings from the Free Cities Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil

I am their rightful queen Dany protested

You are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the Common Tongue The lords of Westeros do not know you and have every reason to fear and mistrust you You must win them over before you sail A few at least

And how am I to do that if I go east as you counsel

He ate an olive and spit out the pit into his palm I do not know Your Grace he admitted but I do know that the longer you remain in one place the easier it will be for your enemies to find you The name Targaryen still frightens them so much so that they sent a man to murder you when they heard you were with child What will they do when they learn of your dragons

Drogon was curled up beneath her arm as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun Rhaegal and Viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat buffeting each other with their wings as smoke hissed from their nostrils My furious children she thought They must not come to harm The comet led me to Qarth for a reason I had hoped to find my army here but it seems that will not be What else remains I ask myself I am afraid she realized but I must be brave Come the morrow you must go to Pyat Pree





TYRION

The girl never wept Young as she was Myrcella Baratheon was a princess born And a Lannister despite her name Tyrion reminded himself as much Jaime’s blood as Cersei’s

To be sure her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on the deck of the Seaswift but the girl knew the proper words to say and she said them with courage and dignity When the time came to part it was Prince Tommen who cried and Myrcella who gave him comfort

Tyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of King Robert’s Hammer a great war galley of four hundred oars Rob’s Hammer as her oarsmen called her would form the main strength of Myrcella’s escort Lionstar Bold Wind and Lady Lyanna would sail with her as well

It made Tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already inadequate fleet depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with Lord Stannis to Dragonstone and never returned but Cersei would hear of nothing less Perhaps she was wise If the girl was captured before she reached Sunspear the Dornish alliance would fall to pieces So far Doran Martell had done no more than call his banners Once Myrcella was safe in Braavos he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes where the threat might make some of the Marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give Stannis pause about marching north It was purely a feint however The Martells would not commit to actual battle unless Dorne itself was attacked and Stannis was not so great a fool Though some of his bannermen may be Tyrion reflected I should think on that

He cleared his throat You know your orders Captain

I do my lord We are to follow the coast staying always in sight of land until we reach Crackclaw Point From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos On no account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone

And if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless

If a single ship we are to run them off or destroy them If there are more the Bold Wind will cleave to the Seaswift to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle

Tyrion nodded If the worst happened the little Seaswift ought to be able to outrun pursuit A small ship with big sails she was faster than any warship afloat or so her captain had claimed Once Myrcella reached Braavos she ought to be safe He was sending Ser Arys Oakheart as her sworn shield and had engaged the Braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to Sunspear Even Lord Stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most powerful of the Free Cities Traveling from King’s Landing to Dorne by way of Braavos was scarcely the most direct of routes but it was the safest… or so he hoped

If Lord Stannis knew of this sailing he could not choose a better time to send his fleet against us Tyrion glanced back to where the Rush emptied out into Blackwater Bay and was relieved to see no signs of sails on the wide green horizon At last report the Baratheon fleet still lay off Storm’s End where Ser Cortnay Penrose continued to defy the besiegers in dead Renly’s name Meanwhile Tyrion’s winch towers stood three-quarters complete Even now men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place no doubt cursing him for making them work through the festivities Let them curse Another fortnight Stannis that’s all I require Another fortnight and it will be done

Tyrion watched his niece kneel before the High Septon to receive his blessing on her voyage Sunlight caught in his crystal crown and spilled rainbows across Myrcella’s upturned face The noise from the riverside made it impossible to hear the prayers He hoped the gods had sharper ears The High Septon was as fat as a house and more pompous and long of wind than even Pycelle Enough old man make an end to it Tyrion thought irritably The gods have better things to do than listen to you and so do I

When at last the droning and mumbling was done Tyrion took his farewell of the captain of Rob’s Hammer Deliver my niece safely to Braavos and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your return he promised
