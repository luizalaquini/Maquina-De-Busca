Behind Glover’s screen of scouts Robb’s line of march stretched several miles The Greatjon led the van Catelyn traveled in the main column surrounded by plodding warhorses with steelclad men on their backs Next came the baggage train a procession of wayns laden with food fodder camp supplies wedding gifts and the wounded too weak to walk under the watchful eye of Ser Wendel Manderly and his White Harbor knights Herds of sheep and goats and scrawny cattle trailed behind and then a little tail of footsore camp followers Even farther back was Robin Flint and the rearguard There was no enemy in back of them for hundreds of leagues but Robb would take no chances

Thirty-five hundred they were thirty-five hundred who had been blooded in the Whispering Wood who had reddened their swords at the Battle of the Camps at Oxcross Ashemark and the Crag and all through the gold-rich hills of the Lannister west Aside from her brother Edmure’s modest retinue of friends the lords of the Trident had remained to hold the riverlands while the king retook the north Ahead awaited Edmure’s bride and Robb’s next battle… and for me two dead sons an empty bed and a castle full of ghosts It was a cheerless prospect Brienne where are you Bring my girls back to me Brienne Bring them back safe

The drizzle that had sent them off turned into a soft steady rain by midday and continued well past nightfall The next day the northmen never saw the sun at all but rode beneath leaden skies with their hoods pulled up to keep the water from their eyes It was a heavy rain turning roads to mud and fields to quagmires swelling the rivers and stripping the trees of their leaves The constant patter made idle chatter more bother than it was worth so men spoke only when they had something to say and that was seldom enough

We are stronger than we seem my lady Lady Maege Mormont said as they rode Catelyn had grown fond of Lady Maege and her eldest daughter Dacey they were more understanding than most in the matter of Jaime Lannister she had found The daughter was tall and lean the mother short and stout but they dressed alike in mail and leather with the black bear of House Mormont on shield and surcoat By Catelyn’s lights that was queer garb for a lady yet Dacey and Lady Maege seemed more comfortable both as warriors and as women than ever the girl from Tarth had been

I have fought beside the Young Wolf in every battle Dacey Mormont said cheerfully He has not lost one yet

No but he has lost everything else Catelyn thought but it would not do to say it aloud The northmen did not lack for courage but they were far from home with little enough to sustain them but for their faith in their young king That faith must be protected at all costs I must be stronger she told herself I must be strong for Robb If I despair my grief will consume me Everything would turn on this marriage If Edmure and Roslin were happy in one another if the Late Lord Frey could be appeased and his power once more wedded to Robb’s… Even then what chance will we have caught between Lannister and Greyjoy It was a question Catelyn dared not dwell on though Robb dwelt on little else She saw how he studied his maps whenever they made camp searching for some plan that might win back the north

Her brother Edmure had other cares You don’t suppose all Lord Walder’s daughters look like him do you he wondered as he sat in his tall striped pavilion with Catelyn and his friends

With so many different mothers a few of the maids are bound to turn up comely said Ser Marq Piper but why should the old wretch give you a pretty one

No reason at all said Edmure in a glum tone

It was more than Catelyn could stand Cersei Lannister is comely she said sharply You’d be wiser to pray that Roslin is strong and healthy with a good head and a loyal heart And with that she left them

Edmure did not take that well The next day he avoided her entirely on the march preferring the company of Marq Piper Lymond Goodbrook Patrek Mallister and the young Vances They do not scold him except in jest Catelyn told herself when they raced by her that afternoon with nary a word I have always been too hard with Edmure and now grief sharpens my every word She regretted her rebuke There was rain enough falling from the sky without her making more And was it really such a terrible thing to want a pretty wife She remembered her own childish disappointment the first time she had laid eyes on Eddard Stark She had pictured him as a younger version of his brother Brandon but that was wrong Ned was shorter and plainer of face and so somber He spoke courteously enough but beneath the words she sensed a coolness that was all at odds with Brandon whose mirths had been as wild as his rages Even when he took her maidenhood their love had more of duty to it than of passion We made Robb that night though we made a king together And after the war at Winterfell I had love enough for any woman once I found the good sweet heart beneath Ned’s solemn face There is no reason Edmure should not find the same with his Roslin

As the gods would have it their route took them through the Whispering Wood where Robb had won his first great victory They followed the course of the twisting stream on the floor of that pinched narrow valley much as Jaime Lannister’s men had done that fateful night It was warmer then Catelyn remembered the trees were still green and the stream did not overflow its banks Fallen leaves choked the flow now and lay in sodden snarls among the rocks and roots and the trees that had once hidden Robb’s army had exchanged their green raiment for leaves of dull gold spotted with brown and a red that reminded her of rust and dry blood Only the spruce and the soldier pines still showed green thrusting up at the belly of the clouds like tall dark spears

More than the trees have died since then she reflected On the night of the Whispering Wood Ned was still alive in his cell beneath Aegon’s High Hill Bran and Rickon were safe behind the walls of Winterfell And Theon Greyjoy fought at Robb’s side and boasted of how he had almost crossed swords with the Kingslayer Would that he had If Theon had died in place of Lord Karstark’s sons how much ill would have been undone

As they passed through the battleground Catelyn glimpsed signs of the carnage that had been an overturned helm filling with rain a splintered lance the bones of a horse Stone cairns had been raised over some of the men who had fallen here but scavengers had already been at them Amidst the tumbles of rock she spied brightly colored cloth and bits of shiny metal Once she saw a face peering out at her the shape of the skull beginning to emerge from beneath the melting brown flesh

It made her wonder where Ned had come to rest The silent sisters had taken his bones north escorted by Hallis Mollen and a small honor guard Had Ned ever reached Winterfell to be interred beside his brother Brandon in the dark crypts beneath the castle Or did the door slam shut at Moat Cailin before Hal and the sisters could pass

Thirty-five hundred riders wound their way along the valley floor through the heart of the Whispering Wood but Catelyn Stark had seldom felt lonelier Every league she crossed took her farther from Riverrun and she found herself wondering whether she would ever see the castle again Or was it lost to her forever like so much else

Five days later their scouts rode back to warn them that the rising waters had washed out the wooden bridge at Fairmarket Galbart Glover and two of his bolder men had tried swimming their mounts across the turbulent Blue Fork at Ramsford Two of the horses had been swept under and drowned and one of the riders Glover himself managed to cling to a rock until they could pull him in The river hasn’t run this high since spring Edmure said And if this rain keeps falling it will go higher yet

There’s a bridge further upstream near Oldstones remembered Catelyn who had often crossed these lands with her father It’s older and smaller but if it still stands—

It’s gone my lady Galbart Glover said Washed away even before the one at Fairmarket

Robb looked to Catelyn Is there another bridge

No And the fords will be impassable She tried to remember If we cannot cross the Blue Fork we’ll have to go around it through Sevenstreams and Hag’s Mire

Bogs and bad roads or none at all warned Edmure The going will be slow but we’ll get there I suppose

Lord Walder will wait I’m sure said Robb Lothar sent him a bird from Riverrun he knows we are coming

Yes but the man is prickly and suspicious by nature said Catelyn He may take this delay as a deliberate insult

Very well I’ll beg his pardon for our tardiness as well A sorry king I’ll be apologizing with every second breath Robb made a wry face I hope Bolton got across the Trident before the rains began The kingsroad runs straight north he’ll have an easy march Even afoot he should reach the Twins before us

And when you’ve joined his men to yours and seen my brother married what then Catelyn asked him

North Robb scratched Grey Wind behind an ear

By the causeway Against Moat Cailin

He gave her an enigmatic smile That’s one way to go he said and she knew from his tone that he would say no more A wise king keeps his own counsel she reminded herself

They reached Oldstones after eight more days of steady rain and made their camp upon the hill overlooking the Blue Fork within a ruined stronghold of the ancient river kings Its foundations remained amongst the weeds to show where the walls and keeps had stood but the local smallfolk had long ago made off with most of the stones to raise their barns and septs and holdfasts Yet in the center of what once would have been the castle’s yard a great carved sepulcher still rested half hidden in waist-high brown grass amongst a stand of ash

The lid of the sepulcher had been carved into a likeness of the man whose bones lay beneath but the rain and the wind had done their work The king had worn a beard they could see but otherwise his face was smooth and featureless with only vague suggestions of a mouth a nose eyes and the crown about the temples His hands folded over the shaft of a stone warhammer that lay upon his chest Once the warhammer would have been carved with runes that told its name and history but all that the centuries had worn away The stone itself was cracked and crumbling at the corners discolored here and there by spreading white splotches of lichen while wild roses crept up over the king’s feet almost to his chest

It was there that Catelyn found Robb standing somber in the gathering dusk with only Grey Wind beside him The rain had stopped for once and he was bareheaded Does this castle have a name he asked quietly when she came up to him

Oldstones all the smallfolk called it when I was a girl but no doubt it had some other name when it was still a hall of kings She had camped here once with her father on their way to Seagard Petyr was with us too…

There’s a song he remembered ‘Jenny of Oldstones with the flowers in her hair’

We’re all just songs in the end If we are lucky She had played at being Jenny that day had even wound flowers in her hair And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies Catelyn could not have been more than twelve Petyr just a boy

Robb studied the sepulcher Whose grave is this

Here lies Tristifer the Fourth of His Name King of the Rivers and the Hills Her father had told her his story once He ruled from the Trident to the Neck thousands of years before Jenny and her prince in the days when the kingdoms of the First Men were falling one after the other before the onslaught of the Andals The Hammer of justice they called him He fought a hundred battles and won nine-and-ninety or so the singers say and when he raised this castle it was the strongest in Westeros She put a hand on her son’s shoulder He died in his hundredth battle when seven Andal kings joined forces against him The fifth Tristifer was not his equal and soon the kingdom was lost and then the castle and last of all the line With Tristifer the Fifth died House Mudd that had ruled the riverlands for a thousand years before the Andals came

His heir failed him Robb ran a hand over the rough weathered stone I had hoped to leave Jeyne with child… we tried often enough but I’m not certain…

It does not always happen the first time Though it did with you Nor even the hundredth You are very young

Young and a king he said A king must have an heir If I should die in my next battle the kingdom must not die with me By law Sansa is next in line of succession so Winterfell and the north would pass to her His mouth tightened To her and her lord husband Tyrion Lannister I cannot allow that I will not allow that That dwarf must never have the north

No Catelyn agreed You must name another heir until such time as Jeyne gives you a son She considered a moment Your father’s father had no siblings but his father had a sister who married a younger son of Lord Raymar Royce of the junior branch They had three daughters all of whom wed Vale lordlings A Waynwood and a Corbray for certain The youngest… it might have been a Templeton but…

Mother There was a sharpness in Robb’s tone You forget My father had four sons

She had not forgotten she had not wanted to look at it yet there it was A Snow is not a Stark

Jon’s more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never so much as set eyes on Winterfell

Jon is a brother of the Night’s Watch sworn to take no wife and hold no lands Those who take the black serve for life

So do the knights of the Kingsguard That did not stop the Lannisters from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros Blount when they had no more use for them If I send the Watch a hundred men in Jon’s place I’ll wager they find some way to release him from his vows

He is set on this Catelyn knew how stubborn her son could be A bastard cannot inherit

Not unless he’s legitimized by a royal decree said Robb There is more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from his oath

Precedent she said bitterly Yes Aegon the Fourth legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed And how much pain grief war and murder grew from that I know you trust Jon But can you trust his sons Or their sons The Blackfyre pretenders troubled the Targaryens for five generations until Barristan the Bold slew the last of them on the Stepstones If you make Jon legitimate there is no way to turn him bastard again Should he wed and breed any sons you may have by Jeyne will never be safe

Jon would never harm a son of mine
