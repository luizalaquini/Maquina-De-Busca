If  R sub 2 C sub 2  is sufficiently small this zero will have
negligible effect at audio frequencies and the filter has

Note first that the centre frequency is proportional to the square root of
the control value k
Hence a non-linear transformation must be implemented on the control
signal after DA conversion to achieve the required logarithmic relationship
between parameter value and resonant frequency
The formant bandwidth is not constant as it should be see Chapter 5
but depends upon the control value k
This dependency can be minimized by selecting component values such that

for the largest value of k which can occur
Then the bandwidth is solely determined by the time constant  R sub 3 C sub 3
pp
The existence of the zero can be exploited for the fricative resonance
This should have zero DC gain and so the component values for the fricative
filter should make the time-constant  R sub 2 C sub 2  large enough to place
the zero sufficiently near the frequency origin
rh Market orientation
As mentioned above Computalker is designed for the computer hobbies market
Figure 114 shows a photograph of the device
FC Figure 114
It plugs into the S-100 bus which has been a
ul
de facto
standard for hobbyists for several years and has recently been adopted
as a standard by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
This makes it immediately accessible to many microcomputer systems
pp
An inexpensive synthesis-by-rule program which runs on
the popular 8080 microprocessor is available to drive Computalker
The input is coded in a machine-readable version of the standard phonetic
alphabet similar to that which was introduced in Chapter 2 Table 21
Stress digits may appear in the transcription and the program caters for
five levels of stress
The punctuation mark at the end of an utterance has some effect on pitch
The program is perhaps remarkable in that it occupies only 6 Kbyte of storage
including phoneme tables and runs on an 8-bit microprocessor
but not in real time
It is however
ul
unc
remarkable in that it produces rather poor speech
According to a demonstration cassette
most people find the speech to be readily intelligible
especially after a little practice listening to it
but this seems extremely optimistic
It also cunningly insinuates that if you dont understand it you yourself
may share the blame with the synthesizer em after all
ul
most
people do
Nevertheless Computalker has made synthetic speech accessible to a large
number of home computer users
sh 112  Sound-segment synthesizer
pp
Votrax was the first fully commercial speech synthesizer and at the time of
writing is still the only off-the-shelf speech output
peripheral as distinct from reading machine which is aimed
specifically at synthesis-by-rule rather than storage of parameter tracks
extracted from natural utterances
Figure 115 shows a photograph of the Votrax ML-I
FC Figure 115
pp
Votrax accepts as input a string of codes representing sound segments
each with additional bits to control the duration and pitch of the segment
In the earlier versions eg model VS-6 there are 63 sound segments specified
by a 6-bit code and two further bits accompany each segment to provide a
4-level control over pitch
Four pitch levels are quite inadequate to generate acceptable intonation
contours for anything but isolated words spoken in citation form
However a later model ML-I uses an 8-level pitch specification
as well as a 4-level duration qualifier
associated with each sound segment
It provides a vocabulary of 80 sound segments together with an additional
code which allows local amplitude modifications and extra duration alterations
to following segments
A further low-cost model VS-K is now available which plugs in to the S-100
bus and
is aimed primarily at
