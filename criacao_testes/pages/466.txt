Melisandre laughed again You are lost in darkness and confusion Ser Davos

And a good thing Davos gestured at the distant lights flickering along the walls of Storm’s End Feel how cold the wind is The guards will huddle close to those torches A little warmth a little light they’re a comfort on a night like this Yet that will blind them so they will not see us pass I hope The god of darkness protects us now my lady Even you

The flames of her eyes seemed to burn a little brighter at that Speak not that name ser Lest you draw his black eye upon us He protects no man I promise you He is the enemy of all that lives It is the torches that hide us you have said so yourself Fire The bright gift of the Lord of Light

Have it your way

His way rather

The wind was shifting Davos could feel it see it in the way the black canvas rippled He reached for the halyards Help me bring in the sail I’ll row us the rest of the way

Together they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath them As Davos unshipped the oars and slid them into the choppy black water he said Who rowed you to Renly

There was no need she said He was unprotected But here… this Storm’s End is an old place There are spells woven into the stones Dark walls that no shadow can pass—ancient forgotten yet still in place

Shadow Davos felt his flesh prickling A shadow is a thing of darkness

You are more ignorant than a child ser knight There are no shadows in the dark Shadows are the servants of light the children of fire The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows

Frowning Davos hushed her then They were coming close to shore once more and voices carried across the water He rowed the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the waves The seaward side of Storm’s End perched upon a pale white cliff the chalky stone sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall A mouth yawned in the cliff and it was that Davos steered for as he had sixteen years before The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle where the storm lords of old had built their landing

The passage was navigable only during high tide and was never less than treacherous but his smuggler’s skills had not deserted him Davos threaded their way deftly between the jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before them He let the waves carry them inside They crashed around him slamming the boat this way and that and soaking them to the skin A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom snarling foam and Davos barely kept them off it with an oar

Then they were past engulfed in darkness and the waters smoothed

The little boat slowed and swirled The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to surround them Davos had not expected the blackness The last time torches had burned all along the tunnel and the eyes of starving men had peered down through the murder holes in the ceiling The portcullis was somewhere ahead he knew Davos used the oars to slow them and they drifted against it almost gently

This is as far as we go unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us His whispers scurried across the lapping water like a line of mice on soft pink feet

Have we passed within the walls

Yes Beneath But we can go no farther The portcullis goes all the way to the bottom And the bars are too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through

There was no answer but a soft rustling And then a light bloomed amidst the darkness

Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes and his breath caught in his throat Melisandre had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe Beneath she was naked and huge with child Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest and her belly bulged as if near to bursting Gods preserve us he whispered and heard her answering laugh deep and throaty Her eyes were hot coals and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a light of its own Melisandre shone

Panting she squatted and spread her legs Blood ran down her thighs black as ink Her cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both And Davos saw the crown of the child’s head push its way out of her Two arms wriggled free grasping black fingers coiling around Melisandre’s straining thighs pushing until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world and rose taller than Davos tall as the tunnel towering above the boat He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water but that instant was long enough

He knew that shadow As he knew the man who’d cast it





JON

The call came drifting through the black of night Jon pushed himself onto an elbow his hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir The horn that wakes the sleepers he thought

The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing The sentries at the ringwall stood still in their footsteps breath frosting and heads turned toward the west As the sound of the horn faded even the wind ceased to blow Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts moving quietly listening A horse whickered and was hushed For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath The brothers of the Night’s Watch waited for a second blast praying they should not hear it fearing that they would

When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again they grinned at one another sheepishly as if to deny that they had been anxious Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire buckled on his swordbelt pulled on his boots shook the dirt and dew from the cloak and fastened it around his shoulders The flames blazed up beside him welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed He could hear the Lord Commander moving inside the tent After a moment Mormont lifted the flap One blast On his shoulder his raven sat fluffed and silent looking miserable
