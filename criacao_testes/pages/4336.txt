It is fairly obvious that a pth order lattice filter will give the
required all-pole pth order synthesis form

We have not shown that the algorithm given in Procedure 63 for producing
reflection coefficients from filter coefficients gives those values
for k sub i which are necessary to make the lattice filter equivalent
to the ordinary synthesis filter  However this is the case and it is
easy to verify by hand for the first second and third-order cases
rh Different lattice configurations
The lattice filters of Figures 68 69 and 610 have two multipliers
per section
This is called a two-multiplier configuration
However there are other configurations which achieve
the same effect but require different numbers of multiplies
Figure 611 shows one-multiplier and four-multiplier configurations
along with the familiar two-multiplier one

It is easy to verify that the three configurations can be modelled in
matrix terms by

Each of the three has the same frequency-domain response although
a different constant factor is involved in each case
The effect of this can be annulled by performing a single multiply
operation on the output of a complete lattice chain
The multiplier has the form

There are important differences between these three configurations
If multiplication is time-consuming the one-multiplier model has obvious
