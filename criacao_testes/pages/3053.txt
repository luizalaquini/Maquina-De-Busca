go and to sojourn

431 And it came to pass that when Jeremiah had made an end of
speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God for
which the LORD their God had sent him to them even all these words
432 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah and Johanan the son of
Kareah and all the proud men saying unto Jeremiah Thou speakest
falsely the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say Go not into Egypt
to sojourn there 433 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on
against us for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans that
they might put us to death and carry us away captives into Babylon

434 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces
and all the people obeyed not the voice of the LORD to dwell in the
land of Judah

435 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the
forces took all the remnant of Judah that were returned from all
nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of Judah
436 Even men and women and children and the kings daughters and
every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan and Jeremiah the
prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah

437 So they came into the land of Egypt for they obeyed not the
voice of the LORD thus came they even to Tahpanhes

438 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes
saying 439 Take great stones in thine hand and hide them in the
clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of Pharaohs house in
Tahpanhes in the sight of the men of Judah 4310 And say unto them
Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I will send
and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will set
his throne upon these stones that I have hid and he shall spread his
royal pavilion over them

4311 And when he cometh he shall smite the land of Egypt and
deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity
to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword

4312 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt and
he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array
himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment
and he shall go forth from thence in peace

4313 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh that is in the
land of Egypt and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he
burn with fire

441 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
dwell in the land of Egypt which dwell at Migdol and at Tahpanhes
and at Noph and in the country of Pathros saying 442 Thus saith
the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Ye have seen all the evil that I
have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah and
behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein
443 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke
me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other
gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers

444 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising
early and sending them saying Oh do not this abominable thing that
I hate

445 But they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their
wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods

446 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was
kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem and
they are wasted and desolate as at this day

447 Therefore now thus saith the LORD the God of hosts the God of
Israel Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut
off from you man and woman child and suckling out of Judah to leave
you none to remain 448 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the
works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of
Egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off
and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of
the earth  449 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and
the wickedness of the kings of Judah and the wickedness of their
wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives
which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem  4410 They are not humbled even unto this day neither
have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that I set
before you and before your fathers

4411 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel
Behold I will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all
Judah

4412 And I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces
to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be
consumed and fall in the land of Egypt they shall even be consumed
by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even
unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be
an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach

4413 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I
have punished Jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence 4414 So that none of the remnant of Judah which are gone
into the land of Egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that
