The Hound said Bronn Not dead only gone The gold cloaks say he turned craven and you led a sortie in his place

Not one of my better notions Tyrion could feel the scar tissue pull tight when he frowned He waved Bronn toward a chair My sister has mistaken me for a mushroom She keeps me in the dark and feeds me shit Pod’s a good lad but the knot in his tongue is the size of Casterly Rock and I don’t trust half of what he tells me I sent him to bring Ser Jacelyn and he came back and told me he’s dead

Him and thousands more Bronn sat

How Tyrion demanded feeling that much sicker

During the battle Your sister sent the Kettleblacks to fetch the king back to the Red Keep the way I hear it When the gold cloaks saw him leavin’ half of them decided they’d leave with him Ironhand put himself in their path and tried to order them back to the walls They say Bywater was blistering them good and almost had ’em ready to turn when someone put an arrow through his neck He didn’t seem so fearsome then so they dragged him off his horse and killed him

Another debt to lay at Cersei’s door My nephew he said Joffrey Was he in any danger

No more’n some and less than most

Had he suffered any harm Taken a wound Mussed his hair stubbed his toe cracked a nail

Not as I heard

I warned Cersei what would happen Who commands the gold cloaks now

Your lord father’s given them to one of his westermen some knight named Addam Marbrand

In most cases the gold cloaks would have resented having an outsider placed over them but Ser Addam Marbrand was a shrewd choice Like Jaime he was the sort of man other men liked to follow I have lost the City Watch I sent Pod looking for Shagga but he’s had no luck

The Stone Crows are still in the kingswood Shagga seems to have taken a fancy to the place Timett led the Burned Men home with all the plunder they took from Stannis’s camp after the fighting Chella turned up with a dozen Black Ears at the River Gate one morning but your father’s red cloaks chased them off while the Kingslanders threw dung and cheered

Ingrates The Black Ears died for them Whilst Tyrion lay drugged and dreaming his own blood had pulled his claws out one by one I want you to go to my sister Her precious son made it through the battle unscathed so Cersei has no more need of a hostage She swore to free Alayaya once—

She did Eight nine days ago after the whipping

Tyrion shoved himself up higher ignoring the sudden stab of pain through his shoulder Whipping

They tied her to a post in the yard and scourged her then shoved her out the gate naked and bloody

She was learning to read Tyrion thought absurdly Across his face the scar stretched tight and for a moment it felt as though his head would burst with rage Alayaya was a whore true enough but a sweeter braver more innocent girl he had seldom met Tyrion had never touched her she had been no more than a veil to hide Shae In his carelessness he had never thought what the role might cost her I promised my sister I would treat Tommen as she treated Alayaya he remembered aloud He felt as though he might retch How can I scourge an eight-year-old boy But if I don’t Cersei wins

You don’t have Tommen Bronn said bluntly Once she learned that Ironhand was dead the queen sent the Kettleblacks after him and no one at Rosby had the balls to say them nay

Another blow yet a relief as well he must admit it He was fond of Tommen The Kettleblacks were supposed to be ours he reminded Bronn with more than a touch of irritation

They were so long as I could give them two of your pennies for every one they had from the queen but now she’s raised the stakes Osney and Osfryd were made knights after the battle same as me Gods know what for no one saw them do any fighting

My hirelings betray me my friends are scourged and shamed and I lie here rotting Tyrion thought I thought I won the bloody battle Is this what triumph tastes like Is it true that Stannis was put to rout by Renly’s ghost

Bronn smiled thinly From the winch towers all we saw was banners in the mud and men throwing down their spears to run but there’s hundreds in the pot shops and brothels who’ll tell you how they saw Lord Renly kill this one or that one Most of Stannis’s host had been Renly’s to start and they went right back over at the sight of him in that shiny green armor

After all his planning after the sortie and the bridge of ships after getting his face slashed in two Tyrion had been eclipsed by a dead man If indeed Renly is dead Something else he would need to look into How did Stannis escape

His Lyseni kept their galleys out in the bay beyond your chain When the battle turned bad they put in along the bay shore and took off as many as they could Men were killing each other to get aboard toward the end

What of Robb Stark what has he been doing

There’s some of his wolves burning their way down toward Duskendale Your father’s sending this Lord Tarly to sort them out I’d half a mind to join him It’s said he’s a good soldier and openhanded with the plunder

The thought of losing Bronn was the final straw No Your place is here You’re the captain of the Hand’s guard

You’re not the Hand Bronn reminded him sharply Your father is and he’s got his own bloody guard

What happened to all the men you hired for me

Some died at the winch towers That uncle of yours Ser Kevan he paid the rest of us and tossed us out

How good of him Tyrion said acidly Does that mean you’ve lost your taste for gold

Not bloody likely

Good said Tyrion because as it happens I still have need of you What do you know of Ser Mandon Moore

Bronn laughed I know he’s bloody well drowned

I owe him a great debt but how to pay it He touched his face feeling the scar I know precious little of the man if truth be told

He had eyes like a fish and he wore a white cloak What else do you need to know

Everything said Tyrion for a start What he wanted was proof that Ser Mandon had been Cersei’s but he dare not say so aloud In the Red Keep a man did best to hold his tongue There were rats in the walls and little birds who talked too much and spiders Help me up he said struggling with the bedclothes It’s time I paid a call on my father and past time I let myself be seen again

Such a pretty sight mocked Bronn

What’s half a nose on a face like mine But speaking of pretty is Margaery Tyrell in King’s Landing yet

No She’s coming though and the city’s mad with love for her The Tyrells have been carting food up from Highgarden and giving it away in her name Hundreds of wayns each day There’s thousands of Tyrell men swaggering about with little golden roses sewn on their doublets and not a one is buying his own wine Wife widow or whore the women are all giving up their virtue to every peach-fuzz boy with a gold rose on his teat

They spit on me and buy drinks for the Tyrells Tyrion slid from the bed to the floor His legs turned wobbly beneath him the room spun and he had to grasp Bronn’s arm to keep from pitching headlong into the rushes Pod he shouted Podrick Payne Where in the seven hells are you Pain gnawed at him like a toothless dog Tyrion hated weakness especially his own It shamed him and shame made him angry Pod get in here

The boy came running When he saw Tyrion standing and clutching Bronn’s arm he gaped at them My lord You stood Is that… do you… do you need wine Dreamwine Should I get the maester He said you must stay Abed I mean

I have stayed abed too long Bring me some clean garb

Garb

How the boy could be so clearheaded and resourceful in battle and so confused at all other times Tyrion could never comprehend Clothing he repeated Tunic doublet breeches hose For me To dress in So I can leave this bloody cell

It took all three of them to clothe him Hideous though his face might be the worst of his wounds was the one at the juncture of shoulder and arm where his own mail had been driven back into his armpit by an arrow Pus and blood still seeped from the discolored flesh whenever Maester Frenken changed his dressing and any movement sent a stab of agony through him

In the end Tyrion settled for a pair of breeches and an oversized bed robe that hung loosely about his shoulders Bronn yanked his boots onto his feet while Pod went in search of a stick for him to lean on He drank a cup of dreamwine to fortify himself The wine was sweetened with honey with just enough of the poppy to make his wounds bearable for a time

Even so he was dizzy by the time he turned the latch and the descent down the twisting stone steps made his legs tremble He walked with the stick in one hand and the other on Pod’s shoulder A serving girl was coming up as they were going down She stared at them with wide white eyes as if she were looking at a ghost The dwarf has risen from the dead Tyrion thought And look he’s uglier than ever run tell your friends

Maegor’s Holdfast was the strongest place in the Red Keep a castle within the castle surrounded by a deep dry moat lined with spikes The drawbridge was up for the night when they reached the door Ser Meryn Trant stood before it in his pale armor and white cloak Lower the bridge Tyrion commanded him
