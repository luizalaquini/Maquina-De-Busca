By then Urzen was back The wolves be gone

Theon told himself he must be as cold and deliberate as Lord Eddard Rouse the castle he said Herd them out into the yard everyone we’ll see who’s missing And have Lorren make a round of the gates Wex with me

He wondered if Stygg had reached Deepwood Motte yet The man was not as skilled a rider as he claimed—none of the ironmen were much good in the saddle—but there’d been time enough Asha might well be on her way And if she learns that I have lost the Starks… It did not bear thinking about

Bran’s bedchamber was empty as was Rickon’s half a turn below Theon cursed himself He should have kept a guard on them but he’d deemed it more important to have men walking the walls and protecting the gates than to nursemaid a couple of children one a cripple

Outside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from their beds and driven into the yard I’ll give them reason to sob I’ve used them gently and this is how they repay me He’d even had two of his own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl to show them he meant to be just They still blame me for the rape though And the rest He deemed that unfair Mikken had killed himself with his mouth just as Benfred had As for Chayle he had to give someone to the Drowned God his men expected it I bear you no ill will he’d told the septon before they threw him down the well but you and your gods have no place here now You’d think the others might be grateful he hadn’t chosen one of them but no He wondered how many of them were part of this plot against him

Urzen returned with Black Lorren The Hunter’s Gate Lorren said Best come see

The Hunter’s Gate was conveniently sited close to the kennels and kitchens It opened directly on fields and forests allowing riders to come and go without first passing through the winter town and so was favored by hunting parties Who had the guard here Theon demanded

Drennan and Squint

Drennan was one of the men who’d raped Palla If they’ve let the boys escape I’ll have more than a little skin off their back this time I swear it

No need for that Black Lorren said curtly

Nor was there They found Squint floating facedown in the moat his entrails drifting behind him like a nest of pale snakes Drennan lay half naked in the gatehouse in the snug room where the drawbridge was worked His throat had been opened ear to ear A ragged tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back but his boots were scattered amidst the rushes and his breeches tangled about his feet There was cheese on a small table near the door beside an empty flagon And two cups

Theon picked one up and sniffed at the dregs of wine in the bottom Squint was up on the wallwalk no

Aye said Lorren

Theon flung the cup into the hearth I’d say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to stick it in the woman when she stuck it in him His own cheese knife by the look of it Someone find a pike and fish the other fool out of the moat

The other fool was in a deal worse shape than Drennan When Black Lorren drew him out of the water they saw that one of his arms had been wrenched off at the elbow half of his neck was missing and there was a ragged hole where his navel and groin once had been The pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling him in The stench was awful

The direwolves Theon said Both of them at a guess Disgusted he walked back to the drawbridge Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls with a wide moat between them The outer wall stood eighty feet high the inner more than a hundred Lacking men Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post his guards along the higher inner walls He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the castle rise against him

There had to be two or more he decided While the woman was entertaining Drennan the others freed the wolves

Theon called for a torch and led them up the steps to the wallwalk He swept the flame low before him looking for… there On the inside of the rampart and in the wide crenel between two upthrust merlons Blood he announced clumsily mopped up At a guess the woman killed Drennan and lowered the drawbridge Squint heard the clank of chains came to have a look and got this far They pushed the corpse through the crenel into the moat so he wouldn’t be found by another sentry

Urzen peered along the walls The other watch turrets are not far I see torches burning—

Torches but no guards Theon said testily Winterfell has more turrets than I have men

Four guards at the main gate said Black Lorren and five walking the walls beside Squint

Urzen said If he had sounded his horn—

I am served by fools Try and imagine it was you up here Urzen It’s dark and cold You have been walking sentry for hours looking forward to the end of your watch Then you hear a noise and move toward the gate and suddenly you see eyes at the top of the stair glowing green and gold in the torchlight Two shadows come rushing toward you faster than you can believe You catch a glimpse of teeth start to level your spear and they slam into you and open your belly tearing through leather as if it were cheesecloth He gave Urzen a hard shove And now you’re down on your back your guts are spilling out and one of them has his teeth around your neck Theon grabbed the man’s scrawny throat tightened his fingers and smiled Tell me at what moment during all of this do you stop to blow your fucking horn He shoved Urzen away roughly sending him stumbling back against a merlon The man rubbed his throat I should have had those beasts put down the day we took the castle he thought angrily I’d seen them kill I knew how dangerous they were

We must go after them Black Lorren said

Not in the dark Theon did not relish the idea of chasing direwolves through the wood by night the hunters could easily become the hunted We’ll wait for daylight Until then I had best go speak with my loyal subjects

Down in the yard a uneasy crowd of men women and children had been pushed up against the wall Many had not been given time to dress they covered themselves with woolen blankets or huddled naked under cloaks or bedrobes A dozen ironmen hemmed them in torches in one hand and weapons in the other The wind was gusting and the flickering orange light reflected dully off steel helms thick beards and unsmiling eyes

Theon walked up and down before the prisoners studying the faces They all looked guilty to him How many are missing

Six Reek stepped up behind him smelling of soap his long hair moving in the wind Both Starks that bog boy and his sister the halfwit from the stables and your wildling woman

Osha He had suspected her from the moment he saw that second cup I should have known better than to trust that one She’s as unnatural as Asha Even their names sound alike

Has anyone had a look at the stables

Aggar says no horses are missing

Dancer is still in his stall

Dancer Reek frowned Aggar says the horses are all there Only the halfwit is missing

They’re afoot then That was the best news he’d heard since he woke Bran would be riding in his basket on Hodor’s back no doubt Osha would need to carry Rickon his little legs wouldn’t take him far on their own Theon was confident that he’d soon have them back in his hands Bran and Rickon have fled he told the castle folk watching their eyes Who knows where they’ve gone No one answered They could not have escaped without help Theon went on Without food clothing weapons He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell but no doubt some had been hidden from him I’ll have the names of all those who aided them All those who turned a blind eye The only sound was the wind Come first light I mean to bring them back He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt I need huntsmen Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter Gage The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt to ask whether he’d brought anything choice for the table but he had nothing to say now Theon walked back the way he had come searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge The wild is no place for a cripple And Rickon young as he is how long will he last out there Nan think how frightened he must be The old woman had nattered at him for ten years telling her endless stories but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger I might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure but instead I protected you Is this the thanks you offer Joseth who’d groomed his horses Farlen who’d taught him all he knew of hounds Barth the brewer’s wife who’d been his first—not one of them would meet his eyes They hate me he realized

Reek stepped close Strip off their skins he urged his thick lips glistening Lord Bolton he used to say a naked man has few secrets but a flayed man’s got none

The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton Theon knew ages past certain of their lords had gone so far as to cloak themselves in the skins of dead enemies A number of Starks had ended thus Supposedly all that had stopped a thousand years ago when the Boltons had bent their knees to Winterfell Or so they say but old ways die hard as well I know

There will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell Theon said loudly I am your only protection against the likes of him he wanted to scream He could not be that blatant but perhaps some were clever enough to take the lesson

The sky was greying over the castle walls Dawn could not be far off Joseth saddle Smiler and a horse for yourself Murch Gariss Poxy Tym you’ll come as well Murch and Gariss were the best huntsmen in the castle and Tym was a fine bowman Aggar Rednose Gelmarr Reek Wex He needed his own to watch his back Farlen I’ll want hounds and you to handle them

The grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms And why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn lords and babes at that

Theon moved close I am your trueborn lord now and the man who keeps Palla safe

He saw the defiance die in Farlen’s eyes Aye m’lord

Stepping back Theon glanced about to see who else he might add Maester Luwin he announced

I know nothing of hunting

No but I don’t trust you in the castle in my absence Then it’s past time you learned

Let me come too I want that wolfskin cloak A boy stepped forward no older than Bran It took Theon a moment to remember him I’ve hunted lots of times before Walder Frey said Red deer and elk and even boar

His cousin laughed at him He rode on a boar hunt with his father but they never let him near the boar

Theon look at the boy doubtfully Come if you like but if you can’t keep up don’t think that I’ll nurse you along He turned back to Black Lorren Winterfell is yours in my absence If we do not return do with it as you will That bloody well ought to have them praying for my success

They assembled by the Hunter’s Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower their breath frosting in the cold morning air Gelmarr had equipped himself with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him The blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow Aggar wore steel greaves Reek arrived carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack bulging with god knows what Theon had his bow he needed nothing else Once he had saved Bran’s life with an arrow He hoped he would not need to take it with another but if it came to that he would

Eleven men two boys and a dozen dogs crossed the moat Beyond the outer wall the tracks were plain to read in the soft ground the pawprints of the wolves Hodor’s heavy tread the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds Once under the trees the stony ground and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see but by then Farlen’s red bitch had the scent The rest of the dogs were close behind the hounds sniffing and barking a pair of monstrous mastiffs bringing up the rear Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a cornered direwolf

He’d have guessed that Osha might run south to Ser Rodrik but the trail led north by northwest into the very heart of the wolfswood Theon did not like that one bit It would be a bitter irony if the Starks made for Deepwood Motte and delivered themselves right into Asha’s hands I’d sooner have them dead he thought bitterly It is better to be seen as cruel than foolish
