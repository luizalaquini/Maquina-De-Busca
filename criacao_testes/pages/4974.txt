1818 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren like
unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto
them all that I shall command him

1819 And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto
my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him

1820 But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name
which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the
name of other gods even that prophet shall die

1821 And if thou say in thine heart How shall we know the word which
the LORD hath not spoken  1822 When a prophet speaketh in the name
of the LORD if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the
thing which the LORD hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him

191 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations whose land the
LORD thy God giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in
their cities and in their houses 192 Thou shalt separate three
cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the LORD thy God
giveth thee to possess it

193 Thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit into three parts that
every slayer may flee thither

194 And this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither
that he may live Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he
hated not in time past 195 As when a man goeth into the wood with
his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe
to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and
lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of
those cities and live 196 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the
slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is
long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he
hated him not in time past

197 Wherefore I command thee saying Thou shalt separate three
cities for thee

198 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto
thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto
thy fathers 199 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do
them which I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God and to
walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee
beside these three 1910 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be
upon thee

1911 But if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and
rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth
into one of these cities 1912 Then the elders of his city shall send
and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of
blood that he may die

1913 Thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt
of innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with thee

1914 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they of
old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it

1915 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or
for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two
witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be
established

1916 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
him that which is wrong 1917 Then both the men between whom the
controversy is shall stand before the LORD before the priests and
the judges which shall be in those days 1918 And the judges shall
make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false
witness and hath testified falsely against his brother 1919 Then
shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother
so shalt thou put the evil away from among you

1920 And those which remain shall hear and fear and shall
henceforth commit no more any such evil among you

1921 And thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye
for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot

201 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest
horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of
them for the LORD thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of
the land of Egypt

202 And it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the
priest shall approach and speak unto the people 203 And shall say
unto them Hear O Israel ye approach this day unto battle against
your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble
neither be ye terrified because of them 204 For the LORD your God is
he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save
you

205 And the officers shall speak unto the people saying What man is
there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him
go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man
