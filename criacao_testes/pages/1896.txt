multiplier
If the transform of xn is defined as
LB
EQ
Xz  =  sum from n=- infinity to infinity xn z sup -n 
EN
LE
then on multiplication by z sup -1 we get a new transform say Vz
LB
EQ
Vz  =  z sup -1 Xz  =
 z sup -1 sum from n=- infinity to infinity xn z sup -n  =
 sum xnz sup -n-1  =
 sum xn-1z sup -n 
EN
LE
Vz can also be expressed as the transform of a new sequence say vn by
LB
EQ
Vz  =  sum from n=- infinity to infinity vn z sup -n 
EN
LE
from which it becomes apparent that
LB
EQ
vn  =  xn-1
EN
LE
Thus vn is a delayed version of xn and we have accomplished what we
set out to do namely to show that the delay

operator
z sup -1 can be treated as an ordinary

multiplier
in the z-transform domain where z-transforms are defined as the infinite
sums given above

In terms of z-transforms the filter can be written
LB
EQ
Yz  =  1 - az sup -1 Xz
EN
LE
where z sup -1 is now treated as a multiplier
The transfer function of the filter is
LB
EQ
Hz  =  Yz over Xz  =  1 - az sup -1 
EN
LE
the ratio of the output to the input transform
pp
It may seem that little has been gained by inventing this rather abstract
notion of transform simply to change an operator to a multiplier  After
all the equation of the filter is no simpler in the transform domain than
it was in the time domain using z sup -1 as an operator  However we will
need to go on to examine more complex filters  Consider for example the
transfer function
LB
EQ
Hz  =  1+az sup -1 +bz sup -2 over 1+cz sup -1 +dz sup -2  
EN
LE
If z sup -1 is treated as an operator it is not immediately obvious how
this transfer function can be realized by a time-domain recurrence relation
However with z sup -1 as an ordinary multiplier in the transform domain we can
make purely mechanical manipulations with infinite sums to see what the transfer
function means as a recurrence relation
pp
It is worth noting the similarity between the z-transform in the discrete
domain and the Fourier and Laplace transforms in the continuous domains
In fact the z-transform plays an analogous role in digital signal processing
to the Laplace transform in continuous theory for the delay operator
z sup -1
performs a similar service to the differentiation operator s
Recall first the continuous Fourier transform
LB

Gf  = 
integral from - infinity to infinity gte sup -j2 pi ft dt
    where f is real
LE
and the Laplace transform
LB

Fs  = 
integral from 0 to infinity fte sup -st dt
    where s is complex
LE
The main difference between these two transforms is that the range of integration
begins at -infinity for the Fourier transform and at 0 for the Laplace
Advocates of the Fourier transform which typically include people involved with
telecommunications enjoy the freedom from initial conditions which is bestowed
by an origin way back in the mists of time  Advocates of Laplace including
most analogue filter theorists invariably
consider systems where all is quiet before t=0 em altering the origin
of measurement of time to achieve this if necessary em and welcome the opportunity
to include initial conditions explicitly
