I do not know this Lord of Light Davos admitted but I knew the gods we burned this morning The Smith has kept my ships safe while the Mother has given me seven strong sons

Your wife has given you seven strong sons Do you pray to her It was wood we burned this morning

That may be so Davos said but when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a copper sometimes the septons would feed me

I feed you now

You have given me an honored place at your table And in return I give you truth Your people will not love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped and give them one whose very name sounds queer on their tongues

Stannis stood abruptly R’hllor Why is that so hard They will not love me you say When have they ever loved me How can I lose something I have never owned He moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea I stopped believing in gods the day I saw the Windproud break up across the bay Any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship I vowed In King’s Landing the High Septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the Seven but all I ever saw of either was made by men

If you do not believe in gods—

—why trouble with this new one Stannis broke in I have asked myself as well I know little and care less of gods but the red priestess has power

Yes but what sort of power Cressen had wisdom

I trusted in his wisdom and your wiles and what did they avail me smuggler The storm lords sent you packing I went to them a beggar and they laughed at me Well there will be no more begging and no more laughing either The Iron Throne is mine by rights but how am I to take it There are four kings in the realm and three of them have more men and more gold than I do I have ships    and I have her The red woman Half my knights are afraid even to say her name did you know If she can do nothing else a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised A frightened man is a beaten man And perhaps she can do more I mean to find out

When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health Proudwing I named her She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand but she would not soar Time and again I would take her hawking but she never flew higher than the treetops Robert called her Weakwing He owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap who never missed her strike One day our great-uncle Ser Harbert told me to try a different bird I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing he said and he was right Stannis Baratheon turned away from the window and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea The Seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow It is time I tried another hawk Davos A red hawk





THEON

There was no safe anchorage at Pyke but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on his father’s castle from the sea to see it as he had seen it last ten years before when Robert Baratheon’s war galley had borne him away to be a ward of Eddard Stark On that day he had stood beside the rail listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master’s drum while he watched Pyke dwindle in the distance Now he wanted to see it grow larger to rise from the sea before him

Obedient to his wishes the Myraham beat her way past the point with her sails snapping and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings Theon drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray and looked for home

The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs and the castle seemed one with the rest its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone wet by the same salt waves festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered thousands of years past All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god’s temple while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them

Drear dark forbidding Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars almost a part of them its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep each on its own island Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not

The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword the oldest part of the castle round and tall the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire

Above the Sea Tower snapped his father’s banner The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself but he knew the device it bore the golden kraken of House Greyjoy arms writhing and reaching against a black field The banner streamed from an iron mast shivering and twisting as the wind gusted like a bird struggling to take flight And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above casting its shadow down upon the Greyjoy kraken

Theon had never seen a more stirring sight In the sky behind the castle the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin scuttling clouds All the way from Riverrun to Seagard the Mallisters had argued about its meaning It is my comet Theon told himself sliding a hand into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given him paper as good as a crown

Does the castle look as you remember it milord the captain’s daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm

It looks smaller Theon confessed though perhaps that is only the distance The Myraham was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver so he stayed well out farther than Theon would have liked An ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the Great Keep but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft the crew nor the courage to attempt such a thing So they sailed past at a safe distance and Theon must content himself with seeing Pyke from afar Even so the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks

It must be windy there the captain’s daughter observed

He laughed Windy and cold and damp A miserable hard place in truth    but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men and hard men rule the world

The captain’s face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked May we make for port now milord

You may Theon said a faint smile playing about his lips The promise of gold had turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he’d hoped Ironborn captains were proud and willful and did not go in awe of a man’s blood The islands were too small for awe and a longship smaller still If every captain was a king aboard his own ship as was often said it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings And when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods The Drowned God makes men old King Urron Redhand had once said thousands of years ago but it’s men who make crowns

A longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well The Myraham was a wallowing tub if truth be told and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm Still Theon could not be too unhappy He was here undrowned and the voyage had offered certain other amusements He put an arm around the captain’s daughter Summon me when we make Lordsport he told her father We’ll be below in my cabin He led the girl away aft while her father watched them go in sullen silence

The cabin was the captain’s in truth but it had been turned over to Theon’s use when they sailed from Seagard The captain’s daughter had not been turned over to his use but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same A cup of wine a few whispers and there she was The girl was a shade plump for his taste with skin as splotchy as oatmeal but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her That was surprising at her age but Theon found it diverting He did not think the captain approved and that was amusing as well watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord the rich purse of gold he’d been promised never far from his thoughts

As Theon shrugged out of his wet cloak the girl said You must be so happy to see your home again milord How many years have you been away

Ten or close as makes no matter he told her I was a boy of ten when I was taken to Winterfell as a ward of Eddard Stark A ward in name a hostage in truth Half his days a hostage    but no longer His life was his own again and nowhere a Stark to be seen He drew the captain’s daughter close and kissed her on her ear Take off your cloak

She dropped her eyes suddenly shy but did as he bid her When the heavy garment sodden with spray fell from her shoulders to the deck she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously She looked rather stupid when she smiled but he had never required a woman to be clever Come here he told her

She did I have never seen the Iron Islands

Count yourself fortunate Theon stroked her hair It was fine and dark though the wind had made a tangle of it The islands are stern and stony places scant of comfort and bleak of prospect Death is never far here and life is mean and meager Men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil If truth be told the miners have it worse than either breaking their backs down in the dark and for what Iron lead tin those are our treasures Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding

The stupid girl did not seem to be listening I could go ashore with you she said I would if it please you   

You could go ashore Theon agreed squeezing her breast but not with me I fear

I’d work in your castle milord I can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter Father says my peppercrab stew is the best he’s ever tasted You could find me a place in your kitchens and I could make you peppercrab stew

And warm my bed by night He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo them his fingers deft and practiced Once I might have carried you home as a prize and kept you to wife whether you willed it or no The ironmen of old did such things A man had his rock wife his true bride ironborn like himself but he had his salt wives too women captured on raids

The girl’s eyes grew wide and not because he had bared her breasts I would be your salt wife milord

I fear those days are gone Theon’s finger circled one heavy teat spiraling in toward the fat brown nipple No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword taking what we want Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter He took her nipple in his mouth and bit it until she gasped

You can put it in me again if it please you she whispered in his ear as he sucked

When he raised his head from her breast the skin was dark red where his mouth had marked her It would please me to teach you something new Unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth

With my mouth

His thumb brushed lightly over her full lips It’s what those lips were made for sweetling If you were my salt wife you’d do as I command

She was timid at first but learned quickly for such a stupid girl which pleased him Her mouth was as wet and sweet as her cunt and this way he did not have to listen to her mindless prattle Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair Once When we still kept the Old Way lived by the axe instead of the pick taking what we would be it wealth women or glory In those days the ironborn did not work mines that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep War was an ironman’s proper trade The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song

Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren gave Harren’s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands even behind the high stone halls of Pyke Theon’s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow

It had been to bring back the Old Way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that Lord Balon had staged his great rebellion Robert Baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope with the help of his friend Eddard Stark but both men were dead now Mere boys ruled in their stead and the realm that Aegon the Conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered This is the season Theon thought as the captain’s daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him the season the year the day and I am the man He smiled crookedly wondering what his father would say when Theon told him that he the last-born babe and hostage he had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed

His climax came on him sudden as a storm and he filled the girl’s mouth with his seed Startled she tried to pull away but Theon held her tight by the hair Afterward she crawled up beside him Did I please milord

Well enough he told her

It tasted salty she murmured
