1838 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are
fallen under my feet

1839 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me

1840 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that I might
destroy them that hate me

1841 They cried but there was none to save them even unto the LORD
but he answered them not

1842 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets

1843 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom I have not
known shall serve me

1844 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me

1845 The strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close
places

1846 The LORD liveth and blessed be my rock and let the God of my
salvation be exalted

1847 It is God that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me

1848 He delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the
violent man

1849 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee O LORD among the
heathen and sing praises unto thy name

1850 Great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to
his anointed to David and to his seed for evermore



191 The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth
his handywork

192 Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth
knowledge

193 There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard

194 Their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to
the end of the world In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun

195 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race

196 His going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit
unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof

197 The law of the LORD is perfect converting the soul the
testimony of the LORD is sure making wise the simple

198 The statutes of the LORD are right rejoicing the heart the
commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyes

199 The fear of the LORD is clean enduring for ever the judgments
of the LORD are true and righteous altogether

1910 More to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb

1911 Moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them
there is great reward

1912 Who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret
faults

1913 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not
have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be
innocent from the great transgression

1914 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be
acceptable in thy sight O LORD my strength and my redeemer



201 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the God of
Jacob defend thee

202 Send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of
Zion

203 Remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice
Selah

204 Grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy
counsel

205 We will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we
