Yes And yet Summerhall was the place the prince loved best He would go there from time to time with only his harp for company Even the knights of the Kingsguard did not attend him there He liked to sleep in the ruined hall beneath the moon and stars and whenever he came back he would bring a song When you heard him play his high harp with the silver strings and sing of twilights and tears and the death of kings you could not but feel that he was singing of himself and those he loved

What of the Usurper Did he play sad songs as well

Arstan chuckled Robert Robert liked songs that made him laugh the bawdier the better He only sang when he was drunk and then it was like to be ‘A Cask of Ale’ or ‘Fifty-Four Tuns’ or ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ Robert was much—

As one her dragons lifted their heads and roared

Horses Dany leapt to her feet clutching the lion pelt Outside she heard Strong Belwas bellow something and then other voices and the sounds of many horses Irri go see who…

The tent flap pushed open and Ser Jorah Mormont entered He was dusty and spattered with blood but otherwise none the worse for battle The exile knight went to one knee before Dany and said Your Grace I bring you victory The Stormcrows turned their cloaks the slaves broke and the Second Sons were too drunk to fight just as you said Two hundred dead Yunkai’i for the most part Their slaves threw down their spears and ran and their sellswords yielded We have several thousand captives

Our own losses

A dozen If that many

Only then did she allow herself to smile Rise my good brave bear Was Grazdan taken Or the Titan’s Bastard

Grazdan went to Yunkai to deliver your terms Ser Jorah got to his feet Mero fled once he realized the Stormcrows had turned I have men hunting him He shouldn’t escape us long

Very well Dany said Sellsword or slave spare all those who will pledge me their faith If enough of the Second Sons will join us keep the company intact

The next day they marched the last three leagues to Yunkai The city was built of yellow bricks instead of red elsewise it was Astapor all over again with the same crumbling walls and high stepped pyramids and a great harpy mounted above its gates The wall and towers swarmed with crossbowmen and slingers Ser Jorah and Grey Worm deployed her men Irri and Jhiqui raised her pavilion and Dany sat down to wait

On the morning of the third day the city gates swung open and a line of slaves began to emerge Dany mounted her silver to greet them As they passed little Missandei told them that they owed their freedom to Daenerys Stormborn the Unburnt Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and Mother of Dragons

Mhysa a brown-skinned man shouted out at her He had a child on his shoulder a little girl and she screamed the same word in her thin voice Mhysa Mhysa

Dany looked at Missandei What are they shouting

It is Ghiscari the old pure tongue It means ‘Mother’

Dany felt a lightness in her chest I will never bear a living child she remembered Her hand trembled as she raised it Perhaps she smiled She must have because the man grinned and shouted again and others took up the cry Mhysa they called Mhysa MHYSA They were all smiling at her reaching for her kneeling before her Maela some called her while others cried Aelalla or Qathei or Tato but whatever the tongue it all meant the same thing Mother They are calling me Mother

The chant grew spread swelled It swelled so loud that it frightened her horse and the mare backed and shook her head and lashed her silver-grey tail It swelled until it seemed to shake the yellow walls of Yunkai More slaves were streaming from the gates every moment and as they came they took up the call They were running toward her now pushing stumbling wanting to touch her hand to stroke her horse’s mane to kiss her feet Her poor bloodriders could not keep them all away and even Strong Belwas grunted and growled in dismay

Ser Jorah urged her to go but Dany remembered a dream she had dreamed in the House of the Undying They will not hurt me she told him They are my children Jorah She laughed put her heels into her horse and rode to them the bells in her hair ringing sweet victory She trotted then cantered then broke into a gallop her braid streaming behind The freed slaves parted before her Mother they called from a hundred throats a thousand ten thousand Mother they sang their fingers brushing her legs as she flew by Mother Mother Mother





Arya


When Arya saw the shape of a great hill looming in the distance golden in the afternoon sun she knew it at once They had come all the way back to High Heart

By sunset they were at the top making camp where no harm could come to them Arya walked around the circle of weirwood stumps with Lord Beric’s squire Ned and they stood on top of one watching the last light fade in the west From up here she could see a storm raging to the north but High Heart stood above the rain It wasn’t above the wind though the gusts were blowing so strongly that it felt like someone was behind her yanking on her cloak Only when she turned no one was there

Ghosts she remembered High Heart is haunted

They built a great fire atop the hill and Thoros of Myr sat crosslegged beside it gazing deep into the flames as if there was nothing else in all the world
