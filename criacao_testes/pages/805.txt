88 So they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken
meat that was left seven baskets

89 And they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them
away

810 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and
came into the parts of Dalmanutha

811 And the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him
seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him

812 And he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith Why doth this
generation seek after a sign verily I say unto you There shall no
sign be given unto this generation

813 And he left them and entering into the ship again departed to
the other side

814 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they
in the ship with them more than one loaf

815 And he charged them saying Take heed beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod

816 And they reasoned among themselves saying It is because we have
no bread

817 And when Jesus knew it he saith unto them Why reason ye
because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand
have ye your heart yet hardened  818 Having eyes see ye not and
having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember  819 When I brake
the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up They say unto him Twelve

820 And when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up And they said Seven

821 And he said unto them How is it that ye do not understand  822
And he cometh to Bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and
besought him to touch him

823 And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the
town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he
asked him if he saw ought

824 And he looked up and said I see men as trees walking

825 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him
look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly

826 And he sent him away to his house saying Neither go into the
town nor tell it to any in the town

827 And Jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them
Whom do men say that I am  828 And they answered John the Baptist
but some say Elias and others One of the prophets

829 And he saith unto them But whom say ye that I am And Peter
answereth and saith unto him Thou art the Christ

830 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him

831 And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many
things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and
scribes and be killed and after three days rise again

832 And he spake that saying openly And Peter took him and began to
rebuke him

833 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he
rebuked Peter saying Get thee behind me Satan for thou savourest
not the things that be of God but the things that be of men

834 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
also he said unto them Whosoever will come after me let him deny
himself and take up his cross and follow me

835 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save
it

836 For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world
and lose his own soul  837 Or what shall a man give in exchange for
his soul  838 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my
words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the
Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels

91 And he said unto them Verily I say unto you That there be some
of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they
have seen the kingdom of God come with power

92 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and
John and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and he was transfigured before them

93 And his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no
