95 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto
those that hated them

96 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men

97 And Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha 98 And Poratha and
Adalia and Aridatha 99 And Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and
Vajezatha 910 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha the enemy
of the Jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand

911 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
palace was brought before the king

912 And the king said unto Esther the queen The Jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace and the ten sons of
Haman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now
what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy
request further and it shall be done

913 Then said Esther If it please the king let it be granted to the
Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
days decree and let Hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows

914 And the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given
at Shushan and they hanged Hamans ten sons

915 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on
the fourteenth day also of the month Adar and slew three hundred men
at Shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand

916 But the other Jews that were in the kings provinces gathered
themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from
their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but
they laid not their hands on the prey 917 On the thirteenth day of
the month Adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and
made it a day of feasting and gladness

918 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting
and gladness

919 Therefore the Jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled
towns made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another

920 And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the
Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus both nigh
and far 921 To stablish this among them that they should keep the
fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same
yearly 922 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies
and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from
mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting
and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the
poor

923 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun and as Mordecai
had written unto them 924 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha the
Agagite the enemy of all the Jews had devised against the Jews to
destroy them and had cast Pur that is the lot to consume them and
to destroy them 925 But when Esther came before the king he
commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against
the Jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons
should be hanged on the gallows

926 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur

Therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them 927 The
Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all
such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that
they would keep these two days according to their writing and
according to their appointed time every year 928 And that these days
should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every
family every province and every city and that these days of Purim
should not fail from among the Jews nor the memorial of them perish
from their seed

929 Then Esther the queen the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the
Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim

930 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews to the hundred twenty
and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with words of peace
and truth 931 To confirm these days of Purim in their times
appointed according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their
seed the matters of the fastings and their cry

932 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim and it
was written in the book

101 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the
isles of the sea

102 And all the acts of his power and of his might and the
declaration of the greatness of Mordecai whereunto the king advanced
him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
