Yes I thought perhaps we could arrange other matches for Lord Walder’s daughters Ser Wendel Manderly has offered to take one and the Greatjon tells me his uncles wish to wed again If Lord Walder will be reasonable—

He is not reasonable said Catelyn He is proud and prickly to a fault You know that He wanted to be grandfather to a king You will not appease him with the offer of two hoary old brigands and the second son of the fattest man in the Seven Kingdoms Not only have you broken your oath but you’ve slighted the honor of the Twins by choosing a bride from a lesser house

Robb bristled at that The Westerlings are better blood than the Freys They’re an ancient line descended from the First Men The Kings of the Rock sometimes wed Westerlings before the Conquest and there was another Jeyne Westerling who was queen to King Maegor three hundred years ago

All of which will only salt Lord Walder’s wounds It has always rankled him that older houses look down on the Freys as upstarts This insult is not the first he’s borne to hear him tell it Jon Arryn was disinclined to foster his grandsons and my father refused the offer of one of his daughters for Edmure She inclined her head toward her brother as he rejoined them

Your Grace Brynden Blackflsh said perhaps we had best continue this in private

Yes Robb sounded tired I would kill for a cup of wine The audience chamber I think

As they started up the steps Catelyn asked the question that had been troubling her since she entered the hall Robb where is Grey Wind

In the yard with a haunch of mutton I told the kennelmaster to see that he was fed

You always kept him with you before

A hall is no place for a wolf He gets restless you’ve seen Growling and snapping I should never have taken him into battle with me He’s killed too many men to fear them now Jeyne’s anxious around him and he terrifies her mother

And there’s the heart of it Catelyn thought He is part of you Robb To fear him is to fear you

I am not a wolf no matter what they call me Robb sounded cross Grey Wind killed a man at the Crag another at Ashemark and six or seven at Oxcross If you had seen—

I saw Bran’s wolf tear out a man’s throat at Winterfell she said sharply and loved him for it

That’s different The man at the Crag was a knight Jeyne had known all her life You can’t blame her for being afraid Grey Wind doesn’t like her uncle either He bares his teeth every time Ser Rolph comes near him

A chill went through her Send Ser Rolph away At once

Where Back to the Crag so the Lannisters can mount his head on a spike Jeyne loves him He’s her uncle and a fair knight besides I need more men like Rolph Spicer not fewer I am not going to banish him just because my wolf doesn’t seem to like the way he smells

Robb She stopped and held his arm I told you once to keep Theon Greyjoy close and you did not listen Listen now Send this man away I am not saying you must banish him Find some task that requires a man of courage some honorable duty what it is matters not… but do not keep him near you

He frowned Should I have Grey Wind sniff all my knights There might be others whose smell he mislikes

Any man Grey Wind mislikes is a man I do not want close to you These wolves are more than wolves Robb You must know that I think perhaps the gods sent them to us Your father’s gods the old gods of the north Five wolf pups Robb five for five Stark children

Six said Robb There was a wolf for Jon as well I found them remember I know how many there were and where they came from I used to think the same as you that the wolves were our guardians our protectors until…

Until she prompted

Robb’s mouth tightened …Until they told me that Theon had murdered Bran and Rickon Small good their wolves did them I am no longer a boy Mother I’m a king and I can protect myself He sighed I will find some duty for Ser Rolph some pretext to send him away Not because of his smell but to ease your mind You have suffered enough

Relieved Catelyn kissed him lightly on the cheek before the others could come around the turn of the stair and for a moment he was her boy again and not her king

Lord Hoster’s private audience chamber was a small room above the Great Hall better suited to intimate discussions Robb took the high seat removed his crown and set it on the floor beside him as Catelyn rang for wine Edmure was filling his uncle’s ear with the whole story of the fight at the Stone Mill It was only after the servants had come and gone that the Blackfish cleared his throat and said I think we’ve all heard sufficient of your boasting Nephew

Edmure was taken aback Boasting What do you mean

I mean said the Blackfish that you owe His Grace your thanks for his forbearance He played out that mummer’s farce in the Great Hall so as not to shame you before your own people Had it been me I would have flayed you for your stupidity rather than praising this folly of the fords

Good men died to defend those fords Uncle Edmure sounded outraged What is no one to win victories but the Young Wolf Did I steal some glory meant for you Robb

Your Grace Robb corrected icy You took me for your king Uncle Or have you forgotten that as well

The Blackfish said You were commanded to hold Riverrun Edmure no more

I held Riverrun and I bloodied Lord Tywin’s nose—

So you did said Robb But a bloody nose won’t win the war will it Did you ever think to ask yourself why we remained in the west so long after Oxcross You knew I did not have enough men to threaten Lannisport or Casterly Rock

Why… there were other castles… gold cattle…

You think we stayed for plunder Robb was incredulous Uncle I wanted Lord Tywin to come west

We were all horsed Ser Brynden said The Lannister host was mainly foot We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast then slip behind him to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in our favor If he had come at us there he would have paid a grievous price But if he did not attack he would have been trapped in the west a thousand leagues from where he needed to be All the while we would have lived off his land instead of him living off ours

Lord Stannis was about to fall upon King’s Landing Robb said He might have rid us of Joffrey the queen and the Imp in one red stroke Then we might have been able to make a peace

Edmure looked from uncle to nephew You never told me

I told you to hold Riverrun said Robb What part of that command did you fail to comprehend

When you stopped Lord Tywin on the Red Fork said the Blackfish you delayed him just long enough for riders out of Bitterbridge to reach him with word of what was happening to the east Lord Tywin turned his host at once joined up with Matthis Rowan and Randyll Tarly near the headwaters of the Blackwater and made a forced march to Tumbler’s Falls where he found Mace Tyrell and two of his sons waiting with a huge host and a fleet of barges They floated down the river disembarked half a day’s ride from the city and took Stannis in the rear

Catelyn remembered King Renly’s court as she had seen it at Bitterbridge A thousand golden roses streaming in the wind Queen Margaery’s shy smile and soft words her brother the Knight of Flowers with the bloody linen around his temples If you had to fall into a woman’s arms my son why couldn’t they have been Margaery Tyrell’s The wealth and power of Highgarden could have made all the difference in the fighting yet to come And perhaps Grey Wind would have liked the smell of her as well

Edmure looked ill I never meant… never Robb you must let me make amends I will lead the van in the next battle

For amends Brother Or for glory Catelyn wondered

The next battle Robb said Well that will be soon enough Once Joffrey is wed the Lannisters will take the fleld against me once more I don’t doubt and this time the Tyrells will march beside them And I may need to fight the Freys as well if Black Walder has his way…

So long as Theon Greyjoy sits in your father’s seat with your brothers’ blood on his hands these other foes must wait Catelyn told her son Your first duty is to defend your own people win back Winterfell and hang Theon in a crow’s cage to die slowly Or else put off that crown for good Robb for men will know that you are no true king at all

From the way Robb looked at her she could tell that it had been a long while since anyone had dared speak to him so bluntly When they told me Winterfell had fallen I wanted to go north at once he said with a hint of defensiveness I wanted to free Bran and Rickon but I thought… I never dreamed that Theon could harm them truly If I had…

It is too late for ifs and too late for rescues Catelyn said All that remains is vengeance

The last word we had from the north Ser Rodrik had defeated a force of ironmen near Torrhen’s Square and was assembling a host at Castle Cerwyn to retake Winterfell said Robb By now he may have done it There has been no news for a long while And what of the Trident if I turn north I can’t ask the river lords to abandon their own people

No said Catelyn Leave them to guard their own and win back the north with northmen

How will you get the northmen to the north her brother Edmure asked The ironmen control the sunset sea The Greyjoys hold Moat Cailin as well No army has ever taken Moat Cailin from the south Even to march against it is madness We could be trapped on the causeway with the ironborn before us and angry Freys at our backs

We must win back the Freys said Robb With them we still have some chance of success however small Without them I see no hope I am willing to give Lord Walder whatever he requires… apologies honors lands gold… there must be something that would soothe his pride…

Not something said Catelyn Someone
