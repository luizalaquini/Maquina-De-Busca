honour preferring one another 1211 Not slothful in business fervent
in spirit serving the Lord 1212 Rejoicing in hope patient in
tribulation continuing instant in prayer 1213 Distributing to the
necessity of saints given to hospitality

1214 Bless them which persecute you bless and curse not

1215 Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep

1216 Be of the same mind one toward another Mind not high things
but condescend to men of low estate Be not wise in your own conceits

1217 Recompense to no man evil for evil Provide things honest in the
sight of all men

1218 If it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with
all men

1219 Dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place
unto wrath for it is written Vengeance is mine I will repay saith
the Lord

1220 Therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give
him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head

1221 Be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good

131 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no
power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God

132 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance
of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation

133 For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil Wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou
shalt have praise of the same 134 For he is the minister of God to
thee for good But if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he
beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God a
revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil

135 Wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also
for conscience sake

136 For for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are Gods
ministers attending continually upon this very thing

137 Render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is
due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour

138 Owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law

139 For this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt
not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly
comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself

1310 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law

1311 And that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake
out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed

1312 The night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light

1313 Let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and
drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and
envying

1314 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for
the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof

141 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful
disputations

142 For one believeth that he may eat all things another who is
weak eateth herbs

143 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not
him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him

144 Who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own
master he standeth or falleth Yea he shall be holden up for God is
able to make him stand

145 One man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every
day alike Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind

146 He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and he
that regardeth not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it He that
eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that
eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks

147 For none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself

148 For whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die
we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the
Lords
