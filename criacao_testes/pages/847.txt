Queen Selyse was adamant None of these was the chosen of R’hllor No red comet blazed across the heavens to herald their coming None wielded Lightbringer the red sword of heroes And none of them paid the price Lady Melisandre will tell you my lord Only death can pay for life

The boy The king almost spat the words

The boy agreed the queen

The boy Ser Axell echoed

I was sick unto death of this wretched boy before he was even born the king complained His very name is a roaring in my ears and a dark cloud upon my soul

Give the boy to me and you need never hear his name spoken again Melisandre promised

No but you’ll hear him screaming when she burns him Davos held his tongue It was wiser not to speak until the king commanded it

Give me the boy for R’hllor the red woman said and the ancient prophecy shall be fulfilled Your dragon shall awaken and spread his stony wings The kingdom shall be yours

Ser Axell went to one knee On bended knee I beg you sire Wake the stone dragon and let the traitors tremble Like Aegon you begin as Lord of Dragonstone Like Aegon you shall conquer Let the false and the fickle feel your flames

Your own wife begs as well lord husband Queen Selyse went down on both knees before the king hands clasped as if in prayer Robert and Delena defiled our bed and laid a curse upon our union This boy is the foul fruit of their fomications Lift his shadow from my womb and I will bear you many trueborn sons I know it She threw her arms around his legs He is only one boy born of your brother’s lust and my cousin’s shame

He is mine own blood Stop clutching me woman King Stannis put a hand on her shoulder awkwardly untangling himself from her grasp Perhaps Robert did curse our marriage bed He swore to me that he never meant to shame me that he was drunk and never knew which bedchamber he entered that night But does it matter The boy was not at fault whatever the truth

Melisandre put her hand on the king’s arm The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent There is no sacrifice more precious From his king’s blood and his untainted fire a dragon shall be born

Stannis did not pull away from Melisandre’s touch as he had from his queen’s The red woman was all Selyse was not young full-bodied and strangely beautiful with her heart-shaped face coppery hair and unearthly red eyes It would be a wondrous thing to see stone come to life he admitted grudging And to mount a dragon… I remember the first time my father took me to court Robert had to hold my hand I could not have been older than four which would have made him five or six We agreed afterward that the king had been as noble as the dragons were fearsome Stannis snorted Years later our father told us that Aerys had cut himself on the throne that morning so his Hand had taken his place It was Tywin Lannister who’d so impressed us His fingers touched the surface of the table tracing a path lightly across the varnished hills Robert took the skulls down when he donned the crown but he could not bear to have them destroyed Dragon wings over Westeros… there would be such a…

Your Grace Davos edged forward Might I speak

Stannis closed his mouth so hard his teeth snapped My lord of the Rainwood Why do you think I made you Hand if not to speak The king waved a hand Say what you will

Warrior make me brave I know little of dragons and less of gods… but the queen spoke of curses No man is as cursed as the kinslayer in the eyes of gods and men

There are no gods save R’hllor and the Other whose name must not be spoken Melisandre’s mouth made a hard red line And small men curse what they cannot understand

I am a small man Davos admitted so tell me why you need this boy Edric Storm to wake your great stone dragon my lady He was determined to say the boy’s name as often as he could

Only death can pay for life my lord A great gift requires a great sacrifice

Where is the greatness in a baseborn child

He has kings’ blood in his veins You have seen what even a little of that blood could do—

I saw you burn some leeches

And two false kings are dead

Robb Stark was murdered by Lord Walder of the Crossing and we have heard that Balon Greyjoy fell from a bridge Who did your leeches kill

Do you doubt the power of R’hllor

No Davos remembered too well the living shadow that had squirmed from out her womb that night beneath Storm’s End its black hands pressing at her thighs I must go carefully here or some shadow may come seeking me as well Even an onion smuggler knows two onions from three You are short a king my lady

Stannis gave a snort of laughter He has you there my lady Two is not three
