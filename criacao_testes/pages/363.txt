We’re all hungry said Arya

You’re not Lommy spat from the ground Worm breath

Arya could have kicked him in his wound I said I’d dig worms for you too if you wanted

Lommy made a disgusted face If it wasn’t for my leg I’d hunt us some boars

Some boars she mocked You need a boarspear to hunt boars and horses and dogs and men to flush the boar from its lair Her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with Robb and Jon Once he even took Bran but never Arya even though she was older Septa Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies and Mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own hawk She was older now but if she had a hawk she’d eat it

What do you know about hunting boars said Hot Pie

More than you

Gendry was in no mood to hear it Quiet both of you I need to think what to do He always looked pained when he tried to think like it hurt him something fierce

Yield Lommy said

I told you to shut up about the yielding We don’t even know who’s in there Maybe we can steal some food

Lommy could steal if it wasn’t for his leg said Hot Pie He was a thief in the city

A bad thief Arya said or he wouldn’t have got caught

Gendry squinted up at the sun Evenfall will be the best time to sneak in I’ll go scout come dark

No I’ll go Arya said You’re too noisy

Gendry got that look on his face We’ll both go

Arry should go said Lommy He’s sneakier than you are

We’ll both go I said

But what if you don’t come back Hot Pie can’t carry me by himself you know he can’t…

And there’s wolves Hot Pie said I heard them last night when I had the watch They sounded close

Arya had heard them too She’d been asleep in the branches of an elm but the howling had woken her She’d sat awake for a good hour listening to them prickles creeping up her spine

And you won’t even let us have a fire to keep them off Hot Pie said It’s not right leaving us for the wolves

No one is leaving you Gendry said in disgust Lommy has his spear if the wolves come and you’ll be with him We’re just going to go see that’s all we’re coming back

Whoever it is you should yield to them Lommy whined I need some potion for my leg it hurts bad

If we see any leg potion we’ll bring it Gendry said Arry let’s go I want to get near before the sun is down Hot Pie you keep Weasel here I don’t want her following

Last time she kicked me

I’ll kick you if you don’t keep her here Without waiting for an answer Gendry donned his steel helm and walked off

Arya had to scamper to keep up Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she was and long of leg as well For a while he said nothing just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on his face making too much noise But finally he stopped and said I think Lommy’s going to die
