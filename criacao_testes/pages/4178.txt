fierce quarrel would be the consequence She panted with
solicitude when she thought of possible injury to Troy The
least spark would kindle the farmers swift feelings of rage
and jealousy he would lose his self-mastery as he had this
evening Troys blitheness might become aggressive it might
take the direction of derision and Boldwoods anger might
then take the direction of revenge
 With almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing
girl this guideless woman too well concealed from the world
under a manner of carelessness the warm depths of her strong
emotions But now there was no reserve In fer
 
her distractioninstead of advancing further she
walked up and downbeating
the air with her fingerspressing on her brow and sobbing
brokenly to herself Then she sat down on a heap of stones by
the wayside to think There she remained long Above the
dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontor+
ies of coppery cloudbounding a green and pellucid expanse
in the western sky Amaranthine glosses came over them then
and the unresting world wheeled her round to a contrasting
prospect eastward in the shape of indecisive and palpitating
stars She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of
space but realised none at all Her troubled spirit was far
away with Troy

NIGHT -- HORSES TRAMPING
THE village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard
in its midst and the living were lying welinigh as still
as the dead The church clock struck eleven The
air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the
clock-work immediately before the strokes was distinct
and so was also the click of the same at their close
The notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness
of inanimate things -- flapping and rebounding among
walls undulating against the scattered clouds spreading
through their interstices into unexplored miles of space
Bathshebas crannied and mouldy halls were to-night
occupied only by Maryann Liddy being as was stated
with her sister whom Bathsheba had set out to visit
A few minutes after eleven had struck Maryann turned
in her bed with a sense of being disturbed She was
totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to
her sleep It led to a dream and the dream to an
awakening with an uneasy sensation that something
had happened She left her bed and looked out of
the window The paddock abutted on this end of the
building and in the paddock she could just discern by
the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the
horse that was feeding there The figure seized the
horse by the forelock and led it to the corner of the
field Here she could see some object which circum+
stances proved to be a vehicle for after a few minutes
the horse down the road mingled with the sound of
light wheels
Two varieties only of humanity could have entered
the paddock with the ghostiike glide of that mysterious
figure They were a woman and a gipsy man A woman
was out of the question in such an occupation at this
hour and the comer could be no less than a thief who
might probably have known the weakness of the house+
hold on this particular night and have

chosen it on
that account for his daring attempt Moreover to
raise suspicion to conviction itself there were gipsies in 
Weatherbury Bottom
Maryann who had been afraid to shout in the robbers
presence having seen him depart had no fear She
hastily slipped on her clothes stumped down the dis+
jointed staircase with its hundred creaks ran to Coggans
the nearest house and raised an alarm Coggan called
Gabriel who now again lodged in his house as at first
and together they went to the paddock Beyond all
doubt the horse was gone
 Hark   said Gabriel
They listened Distinct upon the stagnant air came
the sounds of a trotting horse passing up Longpuddle
Lane -- just beyond the gipsies encampment in Weather+
bury Bottom
 Thats our Dainty-ill swear to her step said Jan
 Mighty me  Wont misess storm and call us stupids
wen she comes back   moaned Maryann How I
wish it had happened when she was at home and none
of us had been answerable  
 We must ride after said Gabriel decisively
be responsible to Miss Everdene for what we do Yes
well follow 
 Faith I dont see how said Coggan  All our
horses are too heavy for that trick except little Poppet
and whats she between two of us-if we only had that
 pair over the hedge we might do something
Which pair  
Mr Boldwoods Tidy and Moll
 Then wait here till I come hither again said Gabriel
He ran down the hill towards Farmer Boldwoods
 Farmer Boldwood is not at home said Maryann
All the better said Coggan I know what hes
gone for
