Margaery the hall shouted back at him Margaery Margaery To the queen A thousand cups rang together and the wedding feast was well and truly begun Tyrion Lannister drank with the rest emptying his cup on that first toast and signaling for it to be refilled as soon as he was seated again

The first dish was a creamy soup of mushrooms and buttered snails served in gilded bowls Tyrion had scarcely touched the breakfast and the wine had already gone to his head so the food was welcome He finished quickly One done seventy-six to come Seventy-seven dishes while there are still starving children in this city and men who would kill for a radish They might not love the Tyrells half so well if they could see us now

Sansa tasted a spoonful of soup and pushed the bowl away Not to your liking my lady Tyrion asked

There’s to be so much my lord I have a little tummy She fiddled nervously with her hair and looked down the table to where Joffrey sat with his Tyrell queen

Does she wish it were her in Margaery’s place Tyrion frowned Even a child should have better sense He turned away wanting distraction but everywhere he looked were women fair fine beautiful happy women who belonged to other men Margaery of course smiling sweetly as she and Joffrey shared a drink from the great seven-sided wedding chalice Her mother Lady Alerie silver-haired and handsome still proud beside Mace Tyrell The queen’s three young cousins bright as birds Lord Merryweather’s dark-haired Myrish wife with her big black sultry eyes Ellaria Sand among the Dornishmen Cersei had placed them at their own table just below the dais in a place of high honor but as far from the Tyrells as the width of the hall would allow laughing at something the Red Viper had told her

And there was one woman sitting almost at the foot of the third table on the left… the wife of one of the Fossoways he thought and heavy with his child Her delicate beauty was in no way diminished by her belly nor was her pleasure in the food and frolics Tyrion watched as her husband fed her morsels off his plate They drank from the same cup and would kiss often and unpredictably Whenever they did his hand would gently rest upon her stomach a tender and protective gesture

He wondered what Sansa would do if he leaned over and kissed her right now Flinch away most likely Or be brave and suffer through it as was her duty She is nothing if not dutiful this wife of mine If he told her that he wished to have her maidenhead tonight she would suffer that dutifully as well and weep no more than she had to

He called for more wine By the time he got it the second course was being served a pastry coffyn filled with pork pine nuts and eggs Sansa ate no more than a bite of hers as the heralds were summoning the first of the seven singers

Grey-bearded Hamish the Harper announced that he would perform for the ears of gods and men a song ne’er heard before in all the Seven Kingdoms He called it Lord Renly’s Ride

His fingers moved across the strings of the high harp filling the throne room with sweet sound From his throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the murdered lord Hamish began and went on to tell how Renly repenting his attempt to usurp his nephew’s crown had defied the Lord of Death himself and crossed back to the land of the living to defend the realm against his brother

And for this poor Symon wound up in a bowl of brown Tyrion mused Queen Margaery was teary-eyed by the end when the shade of brave Lord Renly flew to Highgarden to steal one last look at his true love’s face Renly Baratheon never repented of anything in his life the Imp told Sansa but if I’m any judge Hamish just won himself a gilded lute

The Harper also gave them several more familiar songs A Rose of Gold was for the Tyrells no doubt as The Rains of Castamere was meant to flatter his father Maiden Mother and Crone delighted the High Septon and My Lady Wife pleased all the little girls with romance in their hearts and no doubt some little boys as well Tyrion listened with half a ear as he sampled sweetcorn fritters and hot oatbread baked with bits of date apple and orange and gnawed on the rib of a wild boar

Thereafter dishes and diversions succeeded one another in a staggering profusion buoyed along upon a flood of wine and ale Hamish left them his place taken by a smallish elderly bear who danced clumsily to pipe and drum while the wedding guests ate trout cooked in a crust of crushed almonds Moon Boy mounted his stilts and strode around the tables in pursuit of Lord Tyrell’s ludicrously fat fool Butterbumps and the lords and ladies sampled roast herons and cheese-and-onion pies A troupe of Pentoshi tumblers performed cartwheels and handstands balanced platters on their bare feet and stood upon each other’s shoulders to form a pyramid Their feats were accompanied by crabs boiled in fiery eastern spices trenchers filled with chunks of chopped mutton stewed in almond milk with carrots raisins and onions and fish tarts fresh from the ovens served so hot they burned the fingers

Then the heralds summoned another singer Collio Quaynis of Tyrosh who had a vermilion beard and an accent as ludicrous as Symon had promised Collio began with his version of The Dance of the Dragons which was more properly a song for two singers male and female Tyrion suffered through it with a double helping of honey-ginger partridge and several cups of wine A haunting ballad of two dying lovers amidst the Doom of Valyria might have pleased the hall more if Collio had not sung it in High Valyrian which most of the guests could not speak But Bessa the Barmaid won them back with its ribald lyrics Peacocks were served in their plumage roasted whole and stuffed with dates while Collio summoned a drummer bowed low before Lord Tywin and launched into The Rains of Castamere

If I have to hear seven versions of that I may go down to Flea Bottom and apologize to the stew Tyrion turned to his wife So which did you prefer

Sansa blinked at him My lord

The singers Which did you prefer

I… I’m sorry my lord I was not listening

She was not eating either Sansa is aught amiss He spoke without thinking and instantly felt the fool All her kin are slaughtered and she’s wed to me and I wonder what’s amiss

No my lord She looked away from him and feigned an unconvincing interest in Moon Boy pelting Ser Dontos with dates

Four master pyromancers conjured up beasts of living flame to tear at each other with fiery claws whilst the serving men ladeled out bowls of blandissory a mixture of beef broth and boiled wine sweetened with honey and dotted with blanched almonds and chunks of capon Then came some strolling pipers and clever dogs and sword swallowers with buttered pease chopped nuts and slivers of swan poached in a sauce of saffron and peaches Not swan again Tyrion muttered remembering his supper with his sister on the eve of battle A juggler kept a half-dozen swords and axes whirling through the air as skewers of blood sausage were brought sizzling to the tables a juxtaposition that Tyrion thought passing clever though not perhaps in the best of taste

The heralds blew their trumpets To sing for the golden lute one cried we give you Galyeon of Cuy

Galyeon was a big barrel-chested man with a black beard a bald head and a thunderous voice that filled every corner of the throne room He brought no fewer than six musicians to play for him Noble lords and ladies fair I sing but one song for you this night he announced It is the song of the Blackwater and how a realm was saved The drummer began a slow ominous beat

The dark lord brooded high in his tower Galyeon began in a castle as black as the night

Black was his hair and black was his soul the musicians chanted in unison A flute came in

He feasted on bloodlust and envy and filled his cup full up with spite sang Galyeon My brother once ruled seven kingdoms he said to his harridan wife I’ll take what was his and make it all mine Let his son feel the point of my knife

A brave young boy with hair of gold his players chanted as a woodharp and a fiddle began to play

if I am ever Hand again the first thing I’ll do is hang all the singers said Tyrion too loudly

Lady Leonette laughed lightly beside him and Ser Garlan leaned over to say A valiant deed unsung is no less valiant

The dark lord assembled his legions they gathered around him like crows And thirsty for blood they boarded their ships…

…and cut off poor Tyrion’s nose Tyrion finished

Lady Leonette giggled Perhaps you should be a singer my lord You rhyme as well as this Galyeon

No my lady Ser Garlan said My lord of Lannister was made to do great deeds not to sing of them But for his chain and his wildfire the foe would have been across the river And if Tyrion’s wildlings had not slain most of Lord Stannis’s scouts we would never have been able to take him unawares

His words made Tyrion feel absurdly grateful and helped to mollify him as Galyeon sang endless verses about the valor of the boy king and his mother the golden queen

She never did that Sansa blurted out suddenly

Never believe anything you hear in a song my lady Tyrion summoned a serving man to refill their wine cups

Soon it was full night outside the tall windows and still Galyeon sang on His song had seventy-seven verses though it seemed more like a thousand One for every guest in the hall Tyrion drank his way through the last twenty or so to help resist the urge to stuff mushrooms in his ears By the time the singer had taken his bows some of the guests were drunk enough to begin providing unintentional entertainments of their own Grand Maester Pycelle fell asleep while dancers from the Summer Isles swirled and spun in robes made of bright feathers and smoky silk Roundels of elk stuffed with ripe blue cheese were being brought out when one of Lord Rowan’s knights stabbed a Dornishman The gold cloaks dragged them both away one to a cell to rot and the other to get sewn up by Maester Ballabar

Tyrion was toying with a leche of brawn spiced with cinnamon cloves sugar and almond milk when King Joffrey lurched suddenly to his feet Bring on my royal jousters he shouted in a voice thick with wine clapping his hands together

My nephew is drunker than I am Tyrion thought as the gold cloaks opened the great doors at the end of the hall From where he sat he could only see the tops of two striped lances as a pair of riders entered side by side A wave of laughter followed them down the center aisle toward the king They must be riding ponies he concluded… until they came into full view

The jousters were a pair of dwarfs One was mounted on an ugly grey dog long of leg and heavy of jaw The other rode an immense spotted sow Painted wooden armor clattered and clacked as the little knights bounced up and down in their saddles Their shields were bigger than they were and they wrestled manfully with their lances as they clomped along swaying this way and that and eliciting gusts of mirth One knight was all in gold with a black stag painted on his shield the other wore grey and white and bore a wolf device Their mounts were barded likewise Tyrion glanced along the dais at all the laughing faces Joffrey was red and breathless Tommen was hooting and hopping up and down in his seat Cersei was chuckling politely and even Lord Tywin looked mildly amused Of all those at the high table only Sansa Stark was not smiling He could have loved her for that but if truth be told the Stark girl’s eyes were far away as if she had not even seen the ludicrous riders loping toward her

The dwarfs are not to blame Tyrion decided When they are done I shall compliment them and give them a fat purse of silver And come the morrow I will find whoever planned this little diversion and arrange for a different sort of thanks

When the dwarfs reined up beneath the dais to salute the king the wolf knight dropped his shield As he leaned over to grab for it the stag knight lost control of his heavy lance and slammed him across the back The wolf knight fell off his pig and his lance tumbled over and boinked his foe on the head They both wound up on the floor in a great tangle When they rose both tried to mount the dog Much shouting and shoving followed Finally they regained their saddles only mounted on each other’s steed holding the wrong shield and facing backward

It took some time to sort that out but in the end they spurred to opposite ends of the hall and wheeled about for the tilt As the lords and ladies guffawed and giggled the little men came together with a crash and a clatter and the wolf knight’s lance struck the helm of the stag knight and knocked his head clean off It spun through the air spattering blood to land in the lap of Lord Gyles The headless dwarf careened around the tables flailing his arms Dogs barked women shrieked and Moon Boy made a great show of swaying perilously back and forth on his stilts until Lord Gyles pulled a dripping red melon out of the shattered helm at which point the stag knight poked his face up out of his armor and another storm of laughter rocked the hall The knights waited for it to die circled around each other trading colorful insults and were about to separate for another joust when the dog threw its rider to the floor and mounted the sow The huge pig squealed in distress while the wedding guests squealed with laughter especially when the stag knight leapt onto the wolf knight let down his wooden breeches and started to pump away frantically at the other’s nether portions

I yield I yield the dwarf on the bottom screamed Good ser put up your sword

I would I would if you’ll stop moving the sheath the dwarf on the top replied to the merriment of all

Joffrey was snorting wine from both nostrils Gasping he lurched to his feet almost knocking over his tall two-handed chalice A champion he shouted We have a champion The hall began to quiet when it was seen that the king was speaking The dwarfs untangled no doubt anticipating the royal thanks Not a true champion though said Joff A true champion defeats all challengers The king climbed up on the table Who else will challenge our tiny champion With a gleeful smile he turned toward Tyrion Uncle You’ll defend the honor of my realm won’t you You can ride the pig

The laughter crashed over him like a wave Tyrion Lannister did not remember rising nor climbing on his chair but he found himself standing on the table The hall was a torchlit blur of leering faces He twisted his face into the most hideous mockery of a smile the Seven Kingdoms had ever seen Your Grace he called I’ll ride the pig… but only if you ride the dog

Joff scowled confused Me I’m no dwarf Why me

Stepped right into the cut Joff Why you’re the only man in the hall that I’m certain of defeating

He could not have said which was sweeter the instant of shocked silence the gale of laughter that followed or the look of blind rage on his nephew’s face The dwarf hopped back to the floor well satisfied and by the time he looked back Ser Osmund and Ser Meryn were helping Joff climb down as well When he noticed Cersei glaring at him Tyrion blew her a kiss
