875 And of Zion it shall be said This and that man was born in her
and the highest himself shall establish her

876 The LORD shall count when he writeth up the people that this
man was born there Selah

877 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there
all my springs are in thee



881 O lord God of my salvation I have cried day and night before
thee

882 Let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry

883 For my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto
the grave

884 I am counted with them that go down into the pit I am as a man
that hath no strength

885 Free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom
thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand

886 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps

887 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all
thy waves Selah

888 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made
me an abomination unto them I am shut up and I cannot come forth

889 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction LORD I have called
daily upon thee I have stretched out my hands unto thee

8810 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and
praise thee Selah

8811 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy
faithfulness in destruction

8812 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in
the land of forgetfulness

8813 But unto thee have I cried O LORD and in the morning shall my
prayer prevent thee

8814 LORD why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face
from me

8815 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while I suffer
thy terrors I am distracted

8816 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off

8817 They came round about me daily like water they compassed me
about together

8818 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine
acquaintance into darkness



891 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever with my mouth
will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations

892 For I have said Mercy shall be built up for ever thy
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens

893 I have made a covenant with my chosen I have sworn unto David my
servant

894 Thy seed will I establish for ever and build up thy throne to
all generations Selah

895 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders O LORD thy
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints

896 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD who among
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD

897 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to
be had in reverence of all them that are about him

898 O LORD God of hosts who is a strong LORD like unto thee or to
thy faithfulness round about thee

899 Thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise
thou stillest them

8910 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm

8911 The heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world
and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them

8912 The north and the south thou hast created them Tabor and Hermon
shall rejoice in thy name
