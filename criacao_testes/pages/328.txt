827 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in
the sight of the LORD as did the house of Ahab for he was the son in
law of the house of Ahab

828 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
king of Syria in Ramothgilead and the Syrians wounded Joram

829 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him at Ramah when he fought against
Hazael king of Syria And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah
went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was
sick

91 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets
and said unto him Gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in
thine hand and go to Ramothgilead 92 And when thou comest thither
look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi and go
in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an
inner chamber 93 Then take the box of oil and pour it on his head
and say Thus saith the LORD I have anointed thee king over Israel
Then open the door and flee and tarry not

94 So the young man even the young man the prophet went to
Ramothgilead

95 And when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting
and he said I have an errand to thee O captain And Jehu said Unto
which of all us And he said To thee O captain

96 And he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on
his head and said unto him Thus saith the LORD God of Israel I have
anointed thee king over the people of the LORD even over Israel

97 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master that I may
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the
servants of the LORD at the hand of Jezebel

98 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and
left in Israel 99 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of
Ahijah 910 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel
and there shall be none to bury her And he opened the door and fled

911 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said
unto him Is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee And he
said unto them Ye know the man and his communication

912 And they said It is false tell us now And he said Thus and
thus spake he to me saying Thus saith the LORD I have anointed thee
king over Israel

913 Then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it
under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying
Jehu is king

914 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
against Joram Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead he and all Israel
because of Hazael king of Syria

915 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria  And Jehu said If it be your minds then let none go forth
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel

916 So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel for Joram lay
there

And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram

917 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came and said I see a company And Joram
said Take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say Is it
peace  918 So there went one on horseback to meet him and said
Thus saith the king Is it peace And Jehu said What hast thou to do
with peace turn thee behind me And the watchman told saying The
messenger came to them but he cometh not again

919 Then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and
said Thus saith the king Is it peace And Jehu answered What hast
thou to do with peace turn thee behind me

920 And the watchman told saying He came even unto them and cometh
not again and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi for he driveth furiously

921 And Joram said Make ready And his chariot was made ready And
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out each in his
chariot and they went out against Jehu and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite

922 And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu that he said Is it
peace Jehu And he answered What peace so long as the whoredoms of
thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many  923 And Joram
turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah There is treachery O
Ahaziah

924 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram
between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk
down in his chariot
