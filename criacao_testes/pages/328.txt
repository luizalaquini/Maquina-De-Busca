Robb has broken fealty with the Iron Throne and crowned himself King in the North There’s war

The maester’s ravens fly over salt as soon as rock This news is old and cold

It means a new day Uncle

Every morning brings a new day much like the old

In Riverrun they would tell you different They say the red comet is a herald of a new age A messenger from the gods

A sign it is the priest agreed but from our god not theirs A burning brand it is such as our people carried of old It is the flame the Drowned God brought from the sea and it proclaims a rising tide It is time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and sword as he did

Theon smiled I could not agree more

A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm

This raindrop will one day be a king old man Theon had suffered quite enough of his uncle’s gloom He put his spurs into his horse and trotted on ahead smiling

It was nigh on sunset when they reached the walls of Pyke a crescent of dark stone that ran from cliff to cliff with the gatehouse in the center and three square towers to either side Theon could still make out the scars left by the stones of Robert Baratheon’s catapults A new south tower had risen from the ruins of the old its stone a paler shade of grey and as yet unmarred by patches of lichen That was where Robert had made his breach swarming in over the rubble and corpses with his warharnmer in hand and Ned Stark at his side Theon had watched from the safety of the Sea Tower and sometimes he still saw the torches in his dreams and heard the dull thunder of the collapse

The gates stood open to him the rusted iron portcullis drawn up The guards atop the battlements watched with strangers’ eyes as Theon Greyjoy came home at last

Beyond the curtain wall were half a hundred acres of headland hard against the sky and the sea The stables were here and the kennels and a scatter of other outbuildings Sheep and swine huddled in their pens while the castle dogs ran free To the south were the cliffs and the wide stone bridge to the Great Keep Theon could hear the crashing of waves as he swung down from his saddle A stableman came to take his horse A pair of gaunt children and some thralls stared at him with dull eyes but there was no sign of his lord father nor anyone else he recalled from boyhood A bleak and bitter homecoming he thought

The priest had not dismounted Will you not stay the night and share our meat and mead Uncle

Bring you I was told You are brought Now I return to our god’s business Aeron Greyjoy turned his horse and rode slowly out beneath the muddy spikes of the portcullis

A bentback old crone in a shapeless grey dress approached him warily M’lord I am sent to show you to chambers

By whose bidding

Your lord father m’lord

Theon pulled off his gloves So you do know who I am Why is my father not here to greet me

He awaits you in the Sea Tower m’lord When you are rested from your trip

And I thought Ned Stark cold And who are you

Helya who keeps this castle for your lord father

Sylas was steward here They called him Sourmouth Even now Theon could recall the winey stench of the old man’s breath

Dead these five years m’lord

And what of Maester Qalen where is he

He sleeps in the sea Wendamyr keeps the ravens now

It is as if I were a stranger here Theon thought Nothing has changed and yet everything has changed Show me to my chambers woman he commanded Bowing stiffly she led him across the headland to the bridge That at least was as he remembered the ancient stones slick with spray and spotted by lichen the sea foaming under their feet like some great wild beast the salt wind clutching at their clothes

Whenever he’d imagined his homecoming he had always pictured himself returning to the snug bedchamber in the Sea Tower where he’d slept as a child Instead the old woman led him to the Bloody Keep The halls here were larger and better furnished if no less cold nor damp Theon was given a suite of chilly rooms with ceilings so high that they were lost in gloom He might have been more impressed if he had not known that these were the very chambers that had given the Bloody Keep its name A thousand years before the sons of the River King had been slaughtered here hacked to bits in their beds so that pieces of their bodies might be sent back to their father on the mainland
