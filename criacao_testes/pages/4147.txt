angry crimson of a danby sunset But she forbore
to utter this feeling and the reticence of her tongue
only made the loquacity of her face the more notice+
able
The next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake
Perhaps you dont like the rudeness of my repri+
manding you for I know it is rudeness but I thought
it would do good
She instantly replied sarcastically --
On the contrary my opinion of you is so low that
I see in your abuse the praise of discerning people
I am glad you dont mind it for I said it honestly
and with every serious meaning
  I see But unfortunately when you try not to
speak in jest you are amusing -- just as when you wish
to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a sensible word
It was a hard hit but Bathsheba had unmistakably
lost her temper and on that account Gabriel had
never in his life kept his own better He said nothing
She then broke out --
  I may ask I suppose where in particular my
unworthiness lies In my not marrying you perhaps
Not by any means said Gabriel quietly I have
long given up thinking of that matter
Or wishing it I suppose she said and it was
apparent that she expected an unhesitating denial of
this supposition
Whatever Gabriel felt he coolly echoed her words --
Or wishing it either
  A woman may be treated with a bitterness which
is sweet to her and with a rudeness which is not
offensive Bathsheba would have submitted to an
indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel pro+
tested that he was loving her at the same time the
impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable even if
it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the
humiliation and a tenderness in the strife This was
what she had been expecting and what she had not

because the lecturer saw her in
the cold morning light of open-shuttered disillusion
was exasperating He had not finished either He
continued in a more agitated voice --
My opinion is since you ask it that you are
greatly to blame for playing pranks upon a man like
Mr Boldwood merely as a pastime Leading on a
man you dont care for is not a praiseworthy action
And even Miss Everdene if you seriously inclined
towards him you might have let him find it out in
some way of true loving-kindness and not by sending
him a valentines letter
Bathsheba laid down the shears
 I cannot allow any man to -- to criticise my private
Conduct she exclaimed Nor will I for a minute
So youll please leave the farm at the end of the week
It may have been a peculiarity -- at any rate it was
a fact -- that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion
of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled when by a
refined emotion her upper or heavenward one Her
nether lip quivered now
Very well so I will said Gabriel calmly He had
been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained
him to spoil by breaking rather than by a chain he
could not break I should be even better pleased to
go at once he added
Go at once then in Heavens name said sheher
eyes flashing at his though never meeting them
Dont let me see your face any more
Very well Miss Everdene -- so it shall be
And he took his shears and went away from her in
placid dignity as Moses left the presence of Pharaoh

TROUBLES IN THE FOLD -- A MESSAGE
GABRIEL OAK had ceased to feed the Weatherbury
flock for about four-and-twenty hours when on Sunday
afternoon the elderly gentlemen Joseph Poorgrass
Matthew Moon Fray and half-a-dozen others came
running up to the house of the mistress of the Upper
Farm
 Whatever is the matter men she said meeting
them at the door just as she was coming out on her
way to church and ceasing in a moment from the close
compression of her two red lips with which she had
accompanied the exertion of pelling on a tight glove
Sixty said Joseph Poorgrass
Seventy said Moon
Fifty-nine said Susan Talls husband
 -- Sheep have broke fence said Fray
 -- And got into a field of young clover said Tall
 -- Young clover said Moon
 -- Clover said Joseph Poorgrass
And they be getting blasted said Henery Fray
That they be said Joseph
And will all die as dead as nits if they baint got
out and curedsaid Tall
Josephs countenance was drawn into lines and
puckers by his concern Frays forehead was wrinkled
both perpendicularly and crosswise after the pattern of
