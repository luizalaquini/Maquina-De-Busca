2512 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the
land to be vinedressers and husbandmen

2513 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD and
the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD did
the Chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to
Babylon

2514 And the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons
and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they
away

2515 And the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of
gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took
away

2516 The two pillars one sea and the bases which Solomon had made
for the house of the LORD the brass of all these vessels was without
weight

2517 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the
chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three
cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter
round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar
with wreathen work

2518 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and
Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 2519
And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
war and five men of them that were in the kings presence which were
found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which
mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of
the land that were found in the city 2520 And Nebuzaradan captain of
the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon to
Riblah 2521 And the king of Babylon smote them and slew them at
Riblah in the land of Hamath So Judah was carried away out of their
land

2522 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left even over them he made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ruler

2523 And when all the captains of the armies they and their men
heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor there came
to Gedaliah to Mizpah even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and Johanan
the son of Careah and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite
and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite they and their men

2524 And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto
them Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees dwell in the land
and serve the king of Babylon and it shall be well with you

2525 But it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah the son of Elishama of the seed royal came and ten
men with him and smote Gedaliah that he died and the Jews and the
Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah

2526 And all the people both small and great and the captains of
the armies arose and came to Egypt for they were afraid of the
Chaldees

2527 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah in the twelfth month on the
seven and twentieth day of the month that Evilmerodach king of
Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of
Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison 2528 And he spake kindly to
him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with
him in Babylon 2529 And changed his prison garments and he did eat
bread continually before him all the days of his life

2530 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life
