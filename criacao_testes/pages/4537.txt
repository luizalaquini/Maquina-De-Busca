There’s been only the one trail my lord I swear it said Gariss defensively And the direwolves would never have parted from them boys Not for long

That’s so Theon thought Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt but soon or late they would return to Bran and Rickon Gariss Murch take four dogs and double back find where we lost them Aggar you watch them I’ll have no trickery Farlen and I will follow the direwolves Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail Two blasts if you catch sight of the beasts themselves Once we find where they went they’ll lead us back to their masters

He took Wex the Frey boy and Gynir Rednose to search upstream He and Wex rode on one side of the brook Rednose and Walder Frey on the other each with a pair of hounds The wolves might have come out on either bank Theon kept an eye out for tracks spoor broken branches any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water He spied the prints of deer elk and badger easily enough Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch But of the direwolves there was no sign

A little farther Theon told himself Past that oak over that rise past the next bend of the stream we’ll find something there He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly It was midday when he wrenched Smiler’s head round in disgust and gave up

Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him It should not have been possible not on foot burdened with a cripple and a young child Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape If they reach a village    The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark’s sons Robb’s brothers They’d have mounts to speed them on their way food Men would fight for the honor of protecting them The whole bloody north would rally around them

The wolves went downstream that’s all He clung to that thought That red bitch will sniff where they came out of the water and we’ll be after them again

But when they joined up with Farlen’s party one look at the kennelmaster’s face smashed all of Theon’s hopes to shards The only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear baiting he said angrily Would that I had a bear

The dogs are not at fault Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch a hand on each Running water don’t hold no scents m’lord

The wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere

No doubt they did Upstream or down We keep on we’ll find the place but which way

I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles said Reek A man might If he knew he was being hunted he might But a wolf

Yet Theon wondered These beasts were not as other wolves I should have skinned the cursed things

It was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss Murch and Aggar The huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the Starks might have parted company with the direwolves Farlen’s hounds seemed as frustrated as their masters sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other

Theon dared not admit defeat We’ll return to the brook Search again This time we’ll go as far as we must

We won’t find them the Frey boy said suddenly Not so long as the frogeaters are with them Mudmen are sneaks they won’t fight like decent folks they skulk and use poison arrows You never see them but they see you Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out Their houses move even the castles like Greywater Watch He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides They might be out there right now listening to everything we say

Farlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion My dogs would smell anything in them bushes Be all over them before you could break wind boy

Frogeaters don’t smell like men Frey insisted They have a boggy stink like frogs and trees and scummy water Moss grows under their arms in place of hair and they can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water

Theon was about to tell him what he ought to do with his wet nurse’s fable when Maester Luwin spoke up The histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck It may be that they have secret knowledge

Suddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than it had a moment before as if a cloud had passed before the sun It was one thing to have some fool boy spouting folly but maesters were supposed to be wise The only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon Theon said Back to the stream Now

For a moment he did not think they were going to obey but in the end old habit asserted itself They followed sullenly but they followed The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits he’d flushed earlier Theon put men on either bank and followed the current They rode for miles going slow and careful dismounting to lead the horses over treacherous ground letting the good-for-bear-bait hounds sniff at every bush Where a fallen tree dammed the flow the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool but if the direwolves had done the same they’d left neither print nor spoor The beasts had taken to swimming it seemed When I catch them they’ll have all the swimming they can stomach I’ll give them both to the Drowned God

When the woods began to darken Theon Greyjoy knew he was beaten Either the crannogmen did know the magic of the children of the forest or else Osha had deceived them with some wildling trick He made them press on through the dusk but when the last light faded Joseth finally worked up the courage to say This is fruitless my lord We will lame a horse break a leg

Joseth has the right of it said Maester Luwin Groping through the woods by torchlight will avail us nothing

Theon could taste bile at the back of his throat and his stomach was a nest of snakes twining and snapping at each other If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed he might as well dress in motley henceforth and wear a pointed hat the whole north would know him for a fool And when my father hears and Asha   

M’lord prince Reek urged his horse near Might be them Starks never came this way If I was them I would have gone north and east maybe To the Umbers Good Stark men they are But their lands are a long way The boys will shelter someplace nearer Might be I know where

Theon looked at him suspiciously Tell me

You know that old mill sitting lonely on the Acorn Water We stopped there when I was being dragged to Winterfell a captive The miller’s wife sold us hay for our horses while that old knight clucked over her brats Might be the Starks are hiding there

Theon knew the mill He had even tumbled the miller’s wife a time or two There was nothing special about it or her Why there There are a dozen villages and holdfasts just as close

Amusement shone in those pale eyes Why Now that’s past knowing But they’re there I have a feeling

He was growing sick of the man’s sly answers His lips look like two worms fucking What are you saying If you’ve kept some knowledge from me—

M’lord prince Reek dismounted and beckoned Theon to do the same When they were both afoot he pulled open the cloth sack he’d fetched from Winterfell Have a look here

It was growing hard to see Theon thrust his hand into the sack impatiently groping amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool A sharp point pricked his skin and his fingers closed around something cold and hard He drew out a wolf’s-head brooch silver and jet Understanding came suddenly His hand closed into a fist Gelmarr he said wondering whom he could trust None of them Aggar Rednose With us The rest of you may return to Winterfell with the hounds I’ll have no further need of them I know where Bran and Rickon are hiding now

Prince Theon Maester Luwin entreated you will remember your promise Mercy you said

Mercy was for this morning said Theon It is better to be feared than laughed at Before they made me angry





JON

They could see the fire in the night glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star It burned redder than the other stars and did not twinkle though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark dull and faint

Half a mile ahead and two thousand feet up Jon judged and perfectly placed to see anything moving in the pass below

Watchers in the Skirling Pass wondered the oldest among them In the spring of his youth he had been squire to a king so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge What is it Mance Rayder fears I wonder

If he knew they’d lit a fire he’d flay the poor bastards said Ebben a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks

Fire is life up here said Qhorin Halfhand but it can be death as well By his command they’d risked no open flames since entering the mountains They ate cold salt beef hard bread and harder cheese and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs grateful for each other’s warmth It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell when he’d shared a bed with his brothers These men were brothers too though the bed they shared was stone and earth

They’ll have a horn said Stonesnake

The Halfhand said A horn they must not blow

That’s a long cruel climb by night Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them The sky was cloudless the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight

And a longer fall said Qhorin Halfhand Two men I think There are like to be two up there sharing the watch

Me The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber among them It would have to be him

And me said Jon Snow

Qhorin Halfhand looked at him Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through the high pass above them One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter The wolf will remain with us Qhorin said White fur is seen too easily by moonlight He turned to Stonesnake When it’s done throw down a burning brand We’ll come when we see it fall

No better time to start than now said Stonesnake

They each took a long coil of rope Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt Their garrons they left behind along with their helms mail and Ghost Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off Stay he commanded I’ll be back for you
