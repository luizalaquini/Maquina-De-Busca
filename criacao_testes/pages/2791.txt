2316 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the
people and between the king that they should be the LORDs people

2317 Then all the people went to the house of Baal and brake it
down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew Mattan
the priest of Baal before the altars

2318 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had distributed in the
house of the LORD to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD as it is
written in the law of Moses with rejoicing and with singing as it
was ordained by David

2319 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD
that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in

2320 And he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the
governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought
down the king from the house of the LORD and they came through the
high gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne of
the kingdom

2321 And all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet
after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword

241 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned
forty years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was Zibiah of
Beersheba

242 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
the days of Jehoiada the priest

243 And Jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and
daughters

244 And it came to pass after this that Joash was minded to repair
the house of the LORD

245 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites and said to
them Go out unto the cities of Judah and gather of all Israel money
to repair the house of your God from year to year and see that ye
hasten the matter Howbeit the Levites hastened it not

246 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief and said unto him
Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and
out of Jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of Moses
the servant of the LORD and of the congregation of Israel for the
tabernacle of witness  247 For the sons of Athaliah that wicked
woman had broken up the house of God and also all the dedicated
things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim

248 And at the kings commandment they made a chest and set it
without at the gate of the house of the LORD

249 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to
bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid
upon Israel in the wilderness

2410 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in
and cast into the chest until they had made an end

2411 Now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought
unto the kings office by the hand of the Levites and when they saw
that there was much money the kings scribe and the high priests
officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his
place again Thus they did day by day and gathered money in
abundance

2412 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the LORD and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the LORD and also such as wrought iron and brass
to mend the house of the LORD

2413 So the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and
they set the house of God in his state and strengthened it

2414 And when they had finished it they brought the rest of the
money before the king and Jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the
house of the LORD even vessels to minister and to offer withal and
spoons and vessels of gold and silver And they offered burnt
offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of
Jehoiada

2415 But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an
hundred and thirty years old was he when he died

2416 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings
because he had done good in Israel both toward God and toward his
house

2417 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and
made obeisance to the king Then the king hearkened unto them

2418 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers and
served groves and idols and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for
this their trespass

2419 Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the LORD
and they testified against them but they would not give ear
