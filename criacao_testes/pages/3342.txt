612 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they
constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of Christ

613 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but
desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh

614 But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the
world

615 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but a new creature

616 And as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and
mercy and upon the Israel of God

617 From henceforth let no man trouble me for I bear in my body the
marks of the Lord Jesus

618 Brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit

Amen




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians


11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
12 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ

13 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ
14 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
15 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will 16 To
the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted
in the beloved

17 In whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of
sins according to the riches of his grace 18 Wherein he hath
abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence 19 Having made known
unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which
he hath purposed in himself 110 That in the dispensation of the
fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ
both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him 111 In
whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated
according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
counsel of his own will 112 That we should be to the praise of his
glory who first trusted in Christ

113 In whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth
the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye
were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise 114 Which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession unto the praise of his glory

115 Wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
and love unto all the saints 116 Cease not to give thanks for you
making mention of you in my prayers 117 That the God of our Lord
Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him 118 The eyes of your
understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of
his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
the saints 119 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to
us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power
120 Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 121 Far above
all principality and power and might and dominion and every name
that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to
come 122 And hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be
the head over all things to the church 123 Which is his body the
fulness of him that filleth all in all

21 And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
22 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience 23 Among whom also
we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by
nature the children of wrath even as others

24 But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he
loved us 25 Even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us
together with Christ by grace ye are saved 26 And hath raised us
up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus 27 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches
of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus

28 For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of
yourselves it is the gift of God 29 Not of works lest any man
should boast

210 For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good
