The Book of Daniel


11 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it

12 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand with part
of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of
Shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the
treasure house of his god

13 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that
he should bring certain of the children of Israel and of the kings
seed and of the princes 14 Children in whom was no blemish but
well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge
and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in
the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the
tongue of the Chaldeans

15 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat
and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that
at the end thereof they might stand before the king

16 Now among these were of the children of Judah Daniel Hananiah
Mishael and Azariah 17 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave
names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar and to
Hananiah of Shadrach and to Mishael of Meshach and to Azariah of
Abednego

18 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank
therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
defile himself

19 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the
prince of the eunuchs

110 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel I fear my lord
the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should
he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your
sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king

111 Then said Daniel to Melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had
set over Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah 112 Prove thy
servants I beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat
and water to drink

113 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings
meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants

114 So he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days

115 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
kings meat

116 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine
that they should drink and gave them pulse

117 As for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill in
all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions
and dreams

118 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring
them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
Nebuchadnezzar

119 And the king communed with them and among them all was found
none like Daniel Hananiah Mishael and Azariah therefore stood they
before the king

120 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king
enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the
magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm

121 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus

21 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and
his sleep brake from him
