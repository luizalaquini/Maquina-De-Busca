None of us wants trouble but I fear these are troubled times Master Mott Ned said You know who the boy is

I am only an armorer my lord I know what I’m told

You know who the boy is Ned repeated patiently That is not a question

The boy is my apprentice the master said He looked Ned in the eye stubborn as old iron Who he was before he came to me that’s none of my concern

Ned nodded He decided that he liked Tobho Mott master armorer If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one send him to me He has the look of a warrior Until then you have my thanks Master Mott and my promise Should I ever want a helm to frighten children this will be the first place I visit

His guard was waiting outside with the horses Did you find anything my lord Jacks asked as Ned mounted up

I did Ned told him wondering What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard and why was it worth his life





CATELYN

My lady you ought cover your head Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north You will take a chill

It is only water Ser Rodrik Catelyn replied Her hair hung wet and heavy a loose strand stuck to her forehead and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look but for once she did not care The southern rain was soft and warm Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face gentle as a mother’s kisses It took her back to her childhood to long grey days at Riverrun She remembered the godswood drooping branches heavy with moisture and the sound of her brother’s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves She remembered making mud pies with Lysa the weight of them the mud slick and brown between her fingers They had served them to Littlefinger giggling and he’d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week How young they all had been

Catelyn had almost forgotten In the north the rain fell cold and hard and sometimes at night it turned to ice It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter That was no rain for little girls to play in

I am soaked through Ser Rodrik complained Even my bones are wet The woods pressed close around them and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud We will want a fire tonight my lady and a hot meal would serve us both

There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead Catelyn told him She had slept many a night there in her youth traveling with her father Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime always riding somewhere She still remembered the innkeep a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey rich and heavy on the tongue but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles The sourleaf had stained Masha’s teeth a dark red and made her smile a bloody horror

An inn Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully If only… but we dare not risk it If we wish to remain unknown I think it best we seek out some small holdfast… He broke off as they heard sounds up the road splashing water the clink of mail a horse’s whinny Riders he warned his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword Even on the kingsroad it never hurt to be wary

They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream Catelyn reined up to let them pass The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard Mallisters Ser Rodrik whispered to her as if she had not known My lady best pull up your hood

Catelyn made no move Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them surrounded by his knights his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind They were riding for King’s Landing and the Hand’s tourney she knew For the past week the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad knights and freeriders singers with their harps and drums heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey traders and craftsmen and whores and all of them moving south

She studied Lord Jason boldly The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys and his gifts had been lavish His brown hair was salted with white now his face chiseled gaunt by time yet the years had not touched his pride He rode like a man who feared nothing Catelyn envied him that she had come to fear so much As the riders passed Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting but it was only a high lord’s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road There was no recognition in those fierce eyes and his son did not even waste a look

He did not know you Ser Rodrik said after wondering

He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road wet and tired It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord I think we shall be safe enough at the inn Ser Rodrik

It was near dark when they reached it at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered still chewing her sourleaf but she gave them only the most cursory of looks with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile Two rooms at the top of the stair that’s all there is she said chewing all the while They’re under the bell tower you won’t be missing meals though there’s some thinks it too noisy Can’t be helped We’re full up or near as makes no matter It’s those rooms or the road

It was those rooms low dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase Leave your boots down here Masha told them after she’d taken their coin The boy will clean them I won’t have you tracking mud up my stairs Mind the bell Those who come late to meals don’t eat There were no smiles and no mention of sweet cakes

When the supper bell rang the sound was deafening Catelyn had changed into dry clothes She sat by the window watching rain run down the pane The glass was milky and full of bubbles and a wet dusk was falling outside Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met

The crossroads gave her pause If they turned west from here it was an easy ride down to Riverrun Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most and she yearned to talk to him to warn him of the gathering storm If Winterfell needed to brace for war how much more so Riverrun so much closer to King’s Landing with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow If only her father had been stronger she might have chanced it but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years and Catelyn was loath to tax him now

The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond Above the Vale the Eyrie stood high and impregnable its towers reaching for the sky There she would find her sister… and perhaps some of the answers Ned sought Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin and if it came to war they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service

Yet the mountain road was perilous Shadowcats prowled those passes rock slides were common and the mountain clans were lawless brigands descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them Even Jon Arryn as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains Catelyn’s only strength was one elderly knight armored in loyalty
