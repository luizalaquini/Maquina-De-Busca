Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man’s smallclothes

The old man is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch Sam reminded him You’ll be with him day and night Yes you’ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh but you’ll also take his letters attend him at meetings squire for him in battle You’ll be as close to him as his shadow You’ll know everything be a part of everything… and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself

When I was little my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell he made me come Later though he started to take Dickon and leave me at home and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences so long as Dickon was there He wanted his heir at his side don’t you see To watch and listen and learn from all he did I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you Jon What else could it be He wants to groom you for command

Jon was taken aback It was true Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell Could Sam be right Even a bastard could rise high in the Night’s Watch they said I never asked for this he said stubbornly

None of us are here for asking Sam reminded him

And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed

Craven or not Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man On the Wall a man gets only what he earns Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive You’re no ranger Jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you He’d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children on the Wall you grew up or you died

Jon let out a deep sigh You have the right of it I was acting the boy

Then you’ll stay and say your words with me

The old gods will be expecting us He made himself smile

They set out late that afternoon The Wall had no gates as such neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned Three times their way was blocked by iron bars and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward The air was colder than a tomb and more still He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall

Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively The wildlings… they wouldn’t… they’d never dare come this close to the Wall Would they

They never have Jon climbed into his saddle When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled Ghost came loping out of the tunnel

The Lord Steward’s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf Do you mean to take that beast

Yes my lord Jon said Ghost’s head lifted He seemed to taste the air In the blink of an eye he was off racing across the broad weed-choked field to vanish in the trees

Once they had entered the forest they were in a different world Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man The haunted forest was much the same and yet the feel of it was very different

Perhaps it was all in the knowing They had ridden past the end of the world somehow that changed everything Every shadow seemed darker every sound more ominous The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses with a sound like breaking bones When the wind set the leaves to rustling it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon’s spine The Wall was at their backs and only the gods knew what lay ahead

The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle Jon drew in a breath and he saw Sam Tarly staring Even in the wolfswood you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together a grove of nine was unheard of The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves bloodred on top black rot beneath The wide smooth trunks were bone pale and nine faces stared inward The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle This is a sacred place we will not defile it

When they entered the grove Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn No two were quite alike They’re watching us he whispered The old gods

Yes Jon knelt and Sam knelt beside him

They said the words together as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night

Hear my words and bear witness to my vow they recited their voices filling the twilit grove Night gathers and now my watch begins It shall not end until my death I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children I shall wear no crowns and win no glory I shall live and die at my post I am the sword in the darkness I am the watcher on the walls I am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers the shield that guards the realms of men I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch for this night and all the nights to come

The woods fell silent You knelt as boys Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch

Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations all but the gnarled old forester Dywen Best we be starting back m’lord he said to Bowen Marsh Dark’s falling and there’s something in the smell o’ the night that I mislike

And suddenly Ghost was back stalking softly between two weirwoods White fur and red eyes Jon realized disquieted Like the trees…

The wolf had something in his jaws Something black What’s he got there asked Bowen Marsh frowning

To me Ghost Jon knelt Bring it here
