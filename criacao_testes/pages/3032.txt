roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have
poured out drink offerings unto other gods

1914 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet whither the LORD had sent him to
prophesy and he stood in the court of the LORDs house and said to
all the people 1915 Thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel
Behold I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the
evil that I have pronounced against it because they have hardened
their necks that they might not hear my words

201 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest who was also chief
governor in the house of the LORD heard that Jeremiah prophesied
these things

202 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks
that were in the high gate of Benjamin which was by the house of the
LORD

203 And it came to pass on the morrow that Pashur brought forth
Jeremiah out of the stocks Then said Jeremiah unto him The LORD hath
not called thy name Pashur but Magormissabib

204 For thus saith the LORD Behold I will make thee a terror to
thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of
their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and I will give all
Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall carry them
captive into Babylon and shall slay them with the sword

205 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city and all
the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the
treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their
enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to
Babylon

206 And thou Pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
captivity and thou shalt come to Babylon and there thou shalt die
and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou
hast prophesied lies

207 O LORD thou hast deceived me and I was deceived thou art
stronger than I and hast prevailed I am in derision daily every one
mocketh me

208 For since I spake I cried out I cried violence and spoil
because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me and a
derision daily

209 Then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak any more
in his name But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up
in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay

2010 For I heard the defaming of many fear on every side Report
say they and we will report it All my familiars watched for my
halting saying Peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail
against him and we shall take our revenge on him

2011 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my
persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be
greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting
confusion shall never be forgotten

2012 But O LORD of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the
reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee
have I opened my cause

2013 Sing unto the LORD praise ye the LORD for he hath delivered
the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers

2014 Cursed be the day wherein I was born let not the day wherein my
mother bare me be blessed

2015 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying A
man child is born unto thee making him very glad

2016 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew and
repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the
shouting at noontide 2017 Because he slew me not from the womb or
that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always
great with me

2018 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow
that my days should be consumed with shame  211 The word which came
unto Jeremiah from the LORD when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur
the son of Melchiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest
saying 212 Enquire I pray thee of the LORD for us for
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us if so be that
the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that
he may go up from us

213 Then said Jeremiah unto them Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah 214
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Behold I will turn back the
weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the
king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans which besiege you without
the walls and I will assemble them into the midst of this city

215 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath

216 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and
beast they shall die of a great pestilence
