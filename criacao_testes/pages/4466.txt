How many jars do you have at present

This morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys’s day to be sure

Our overripe fruits

Hallyne bobbed his head Wisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars as was promised the queen I concur The pyromancer looked indecently pleased with that prospect

Assuming our enemies give you the time The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy dangerous and time-consuming process He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two If they can truly give us ten thousand   

He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified Perhaps a smidge of both I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste Wisdom We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire nor even one    and we most certainly do not want any mishaps

There will be no mishaps my lord Hand The substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant it is ready Above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand A protective spell has been laid on the floors hmmm most powerful Any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away and the sand smothers the blaze at once

Not to mention the careless acolyte By spell Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant clever trick He thought he would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it worked but this was not the time Perhaps when the war was won

My brethren are never careless Hallyne insisted If I may be hmmmm frank   

Oh do

The substance flows through my veins and lives in the heart of every pyromancer We respect its power But the common soldier hmmmm the crew of one of the queen’s spitfires say in the unthinking frenzy of battle    any little mistake can bring catastrophe That cannot be said too often My father often told King Aerys as much as his father told old King Jaehaerys

They must have listened Tyrion said If they had burned the city down someone would have told me So your counsel is that we had best be careful

Be very careful said Hallyne Be very very careful

These clay jars    do you have an ample supply

We do my lord and thank you for asking

You won’t mind if I take some then A few thousand

A few thousand

Or however many your guild can spare without interfering with production It’s empty pots I’m asking for understand Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates

I will my lord but why    

Tyrion smiled up at him When you tell me to dress warmly I dress warmly When you tell me to be careful well    He gave a shrug I’ve seen enough Perhaps you would be so good as to escort me back up to my litter

It would be my great hmmm pleasure my lord Hallyne lifted the lamp and led the way back to the stairs It was good of you to visit us A great honor hmmm It has been too long since the King’s Hand graced us with his presence Not since Lord Rossart and he was of our order That was back in King Aerys’s day King Aerys took a great interest in our work

King Aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies His brother Jaime had told him a few stories of the Mad King and his pet pyromancers Joffrey will be interested as well I have no doubt Which is why I’d best keep him well away from you

It is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in his own royal person I have spoken of it to your royal sister A great feast   

It was growing warmer as they climbed His Grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war is won At my insistence The king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people go without bread

A most hmmm loving gesture my lord Perhaps instead some few of us might call upon the king at the Red Keep A small demonstration of our powers as it were to distract His Grace from his many cares for an evening Wildfire is but one of the dread secrets of our ancient order Many and wondrous are the things we might show you

I will take it up with my sister Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks but Joff’s fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough he had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning them alive

When at last they reached the top of the steps Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the Iron Torches a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance Tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadn’t known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him Wildfire was too costly to squander

They emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the Street of the Sisters near the foot of Visenya’s Hill He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men Given his purpose today it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard Besides their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble That was all to the good these days Only three nights past another mob had gathered at the gates of the Red Keep chanting for food Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them slaying four and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead Winning us still more friends

Tyrion was surprised to see Bronn standing beside the litter as well What are you doing here

Delivering your messages Bronn said Ironhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the Gods He won’t say why And you’ve been summoned to Maegor’s too

Summoned Tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word And what does Cersei want of me

Bronn shrugged The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her chambers That stripling cousin of yours delivered the message Four hairs on his lip and he thinks he’s a man

Four hairs and a knighthood He’s Ser Lancel now never forget Tyrion knew that Ser Jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import I’d best see what Bywater wants Inform my sister that I will attend her on my return

She won’t like that Bronn warned

Good The longer Cersei waits the angrier she’ll become and anger makes her stupid I much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning Tyrion tossed his folded cloak into his litter and Timett helped him up after it

The market square inside the Gate of the Gods which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables was near deserted when Tyrion crossed it Ser Jacelyn met him at the gate and raised his iron hand in brusque salute My lord Your cousin Cleos Frey is here come from Riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark

Peace terms

So he says

Sweet cousin Show me to him

The gold cloaks had confined Ser Cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse He rose when they entered Tyrion you are a most welcome sight

That’s not something I hear often cousin

Has Cersei come with you

My sister is otherwise occupied Is this Stark’s letter He plucked it off the table Ser Jacelyn you may leave us

Bywater bowed and departed I was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent Ser Cleos said as the door shut

I shall Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with his letter All in good time cousin Sit Rest You look gaunt and haggard He looked worse than that in truth

Yes Ser Cleos lowered himself onto a bench It is bad in the riverlands Tyrion Around the Gods Eye and along the kingsroad especially The river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us and your father’s foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword

That was the way of war The smallfolk were slaughtered while the highborn were held for ransom Remind me to thank the gods that I was born a Lannister

Ser Cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair Even with a peace banner we were attacked twice Wolves in mail hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves The gods alone know what side they started on but they’re on their own side now Lost three men and twice as many wounded

What news of our foe Tyrion turned his attention back to Stark’s terms The boy does not want too much Only half the realm the release of our captives hostages his father’s sword    oh yes and his sisters

The boy sits idle at Riverrun Ser Cleos said I think he fears to face your father in the field His strength grows less each day The river lords have departed each to defend his own lands
