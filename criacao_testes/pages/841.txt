Boom the drum sounded boom doom boom doom The old man’s lips went in and out The knife trembled in Catelyn’s hand slippery with sweat A son for a son heh he repeated But that’s a grandson… and he never was much use

A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb Jaime Lannister sends his regards He thrust his longsword through her son’s heart and twisted

Robb had broken his word but Catelyn kept hers She tugged hard on Aegon’s hair and sawed at his neck until the blade grated on bone Blood ran hot over her fingers His little bells were ringing ringing ringing and the drum went boom doom boom

Finally someone took the knife away from her The tears burned like vinegar as they ran down her cheeks Ten flerce ravens were raking her face with sharp talons and tearing off strips of flesh leaving deep furrows that ran red with blood She could taste it on her lips

It hurts so much she thought Our children Ned all our sweet babes Rickon Bran Arya Sansa Robb… Robb… please Ned please make it stop make it stop hurting… the white tears and the red ones ran together until her face was torn and tattered the face that Ned had loved Catelyn Stark raised her hands and watched the blood run down her long fingers over her wrists beneath the sleeves of her gown Slow red worms crawled along her arms and under her clothes It tickles That made her laugh until she screamed Mad someone said she’s lost her wits and someone else said Make an end and a hand grabbed her scalp just as she’d done with Jinglebell and she thought No don’t don’t cut my hair Ned loves my hair Then the steel was at her throat and its bite was red and cold





Arya


The feast tents were behind them now They squished over wet clay and torn grass out of the light and back into the gloom Ahead loomed the castle gatehouse She could see torches moving on the walls their flames dancing and blowing in the wind The light shone dully against the wet mail and helms More torches were moving on the dark stone bridge that joined the Twins a column of them streaming from the west bank to the east

The castle’s not closed Arya said suddenly The sergeant had said it would be but he was wrong The portcullis was being drawn upward even as she watched and the drawbridge had already been lowered to span the swollen moat She had been afraid that Lord Frey’s guardsmen would refuse to let them in For half a heartbeat she chewed her lip too anxious to smile

The Hound reined up so suddenly that she almost fell off the wayn Seven bloody buggering hells Arya heard him curse as their left wheel began to sink in soft mud The wayn tilted slowly Get down Clegane roared at her slamming the heel of his hand into her shoulder to knock her sideways She landed light the way Syrio had taught her and bounced up at once with a face full of mud Why did you do that she screamed The Hound had leapt down as well He tore the seat off the front of the wayn and reached in for the swordbelt he’d hidden beneath it

It was only then that she heard the riders pouring out the castle gate in a river of steel and fire the thunder of their destriers crossing the drawbridge almost lost beneath the drumming from the castles Men and mounts wore plate armor and one in every ten carried a torch The rest had axes longaxes with spiked heads and heavy bone-crushing armor-smashing blades

Somewhere far off she heard a wolf howling It wasn’t very loud compared to the camp noise and the music and the low ominous growl of the river running wild but she heard it all the same Only maybe it wasn’t her ears that heard it The sound shivered through Arya like a knife sharp with rage and grief More and more riders were emerging from the castle a column four wide with no end to it knights and squires and freeriders torches and longaxes And there was noise coming from behind as well

When Arya looked around she saw that there were only two of the huge feast tents where once there had been three The one in the middle had collapsed For a moment she did not understand what she was seeing Then the flames went licking up from the fallen tent and now the other two were collapsing heavy oiled cloth settling down on the men beneath A flight of fire arrows streaked through the air The second tent took fire and then the third The screams grew so loud she could hear words through the music Dark shapes moved in front of the flames the steel of their armor shining orange from afar

A battle Arya knew It’s a battle And the riders…

She had no more time to watch the tents then With the river overflowing its banks the dark swirling waters at the end of the drawbridge reached as high as a horse’s belly but the riders splashed through them all the same spurred on by the music For once the same song was coming from both castles I know this song Arya realized suddenly Tom o’ Sevens had sung it for them that rainy night the outlaws had sheltered in the brewhouse with the brothers And who are you the proud lord said that I must bow so low

The Frey riders were struggling through the mud and reeds but some of them had seen the wayn She watched as three riders left the main column pounding through the shallows Only a cat of a different coat that’s all the truth I know

Clegane cut Stranger loose with a single slash of his sword and leapt onto his back The courser knew what was wanted of him He pricked up his ears and wheeled toward the charging destriers In a coat of gold or a coat of red a lion still has claws And mine are long and sharp my lord as long and sharp as yours Arya had prayed a hundred hundred times for the Hound to die but now… there was a rock in her hand slimy with mud and she didn’t even remember picking it up Who do I throw it at

She jumped at the clash of metal as Clegane turned aside the first longaxe While he was engaged with the first man the second circled behind him and aimed a blow for the small of his back Stranger was wheeling so the Hound took only a glancing blow enough to rip a great gash in his baggy peasant’s blouse and expose the mail below He is one against three Arya still clutched her rock They’re sure to kill him She thought of Mycah the butcher’s boy who had been her friend so briefly

Then she saw the third rider coming her way Arya moved behind the wayn Fear cuts deeper than swords She could hear drums and warhorns and pipes stallions trumpeting the shriek of steel on steel but all the sounds seemed so far away There was only the oncoming horseman and the longaxe in his hand He wore a surcoat over his armor and she saw the two towers that marked him for a Frey She did not understand Her uncle was marrying Lord Frey’s daughter the Freys were her brother’s friends Don’t she screamed as he rode around the wayn but he paid no mind

When he charged Arya threw the rock the way she’d once thrown a crabapple at Gendry She’d gotten Gendry right between the eyes but this time her aim was off and the stone caromed sideways off his temple It was enough to break his charge but no more She retreated darting across the muddy ground on the balls of her feet putting the wayn between them once more The knight followed at a trot only darkness behind his eyeslit She hadn’t even dented his helm They went round once twice a third time The knight cursed her You can’t run for—

The axehead caught him square in the back of the head crashing through his helm and the skull beneath and sending him flying face first from his saddle Behind him was the Hound still mounted on Stranger How did you get an axe she almost asked before she saw One of the other Freys was trapped beneath his dying horse drowning in a foot of water The third man was sprawled on his back unmoving He hadn’t worn a gorget and a foot of broken sword jutted from beneath his chin

Get my helm Clegane growled at her

It was stuffed at the bottom of a sack of dried apples in the back of the wayn behind the pickled pigs’ feet Arya upended the sack and tossed it to him He snatched it one-handed from the air and lowered it over his head and where the man had sat only a steel dog remained snarling at the fires

My brother…

Dead he shouted back at her Do you think they’d slaughter his men and leave him alive He turned his head back toward the camp Look Look damn you

The camp had become a battlefield No a butcher’s den The flames from the feasting tents reached halfway up the sky Some of the barracks tents were burning too and half a hundred silk pavilions Everywhere swords were singing And now the rains weep o’er his hall with not a soul to hear She saw two knights ride down a running man A wooden barrel came crashing onto one of the burning tents and burst apart and the flames leapt twice as high A catapult she knew The castle was flinging oil or pitch or something
