Care must be taken with the analogue interface to ensure that the precision
implied by the resolution of the AD and DA converters is not compromised
by inadequate analogue circuitry  It is especially important to eliminate
high-frequency noise caused by fast edges on nearby computer buses
sh 32  Coding in the time domain
pp
There are several methods of coding the time waveform of a speech signal to
reduce the data rate for a given signal-to-noise ratio or alternatively to
reduce the signal-to-noise ratio for a given data rate  They almost all require
more processing both at the encoding for storage and decoding for
regeneration ends of the digitization process  They are sometimes used to
economize on memory in systems using stored speech
for example the System X telephone exchange and the travel consultant described
in Chapter 1 and so will be described here  However it is to be expected
that simple time-domain coding techniques will be superseded by the more complex
linear predictive method which is covered in Chapter 6 because this
can give a much more substantial reduction in the data rate for only a small
degradation in speech quality  Hence the aim of this section is to introduce
the ideas in a qualitative way  theoretical development and summaries of
results of listening tests can be found elsewhere eg Rabiner and Schafer 1978

rh Syllabic companding
We have already studied one time-domain encoding technique namely logarithmic
quantization or log PCM sometimes called instantaneous companding  A more
sophisticated encoder could track slowly varying trends in the overall amplitude
of the speech signal and use this information to adjust the quantization
levels dynamically  Speech coding methods based on this principle are called
adaptive pulse code modulation systems APCM  Because the overall amplitude
changes slowly it is sufficient to adjust the quantization relatively infrequently
compared with the sampling rate and this is often done at rates approximating
the syllable rate of running speech leading to the term syllabic companding
A block floating-point format can be used with a common exponent being
stored every M samples with M say 125 for a 100 msec block rate at 8 kHz
sampling but the mantissa being stored at the regular sample rate  The overall
energy in the block
LB
sum from n=h to h+M-1 xn sup 2    M = 125 say
LE
is used to determine a suitable exponent and every sample
in the block em namely
xh xh+1  xh+M-1 em is scaled according to that exponent
Note that for speech transmission systems this method necessitates a delay of
M samples at the encoder and indeed some methods base the exponent on the
energy in the last block to avoid this  For speech storage however the delay
is irrelevant  A rather different nonsyllabic method of adaptive PCM is
continually to change the step size of a uniform quantizer by multiplying it by
a constant at each sample which is based on the magnitude of the previous code
word
pp
Adaptive quantization exploits information about the amplitude of the signal
and as a rough generalization yields a reduction of one bit per sample
in the data rate for telephone-quality speech over ordinary logarithmic
quantization for a given signal-to-noise ratio  Alternatively for the
same data rate an improvement of 6 dB in signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained
Some results for actual schemes are given by Rabiner and Schafer 1978

Rabiner Schafer 1978 Digital processing of speech signals

However there is other information in the time waveform of speech namely the
sample-to-sample correlation which can be exploited to give further reductions
rh Differential coding
Differential pulse code modulation DPCM in its simplest form uses the
present speech sample as a prediction of the next one
and stores the prediction error em that is the sample-to-sample difference
