Wylla Yes The king grinned She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor even for an hour You never told me what she looked like…

Ned’s mouth tightened in anger Nor will I Leave it be Robert for the love you say you bear me I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn in the sight of gods and men

Gods have mercy you scarcely knew Catelyn

I had taken her to wife She was carrying my child

You are too hard on yourself Ned You always were Damn it no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed He slapped a hand on his knee Well I’ll not press you if you feel so strong about it though I swear at times you’re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil

The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn A wide plain spread out beneath them bare and brown its flatness here and there relieved by long low hummocks Ned pointed them out to his king The barrows of the First Men

Robert frowned Have we ridden onto a graveyard

There are barrows everywhere in the north Your Grace Ned told him This land is old

And cold Robert grumbled pulling his cloak more tightly around himself The guard had reined up well behind them at the bottom of the ridge Well I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard There was a rider in the night from Lord Varys in King’s Landing Here The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned

Varys the eunuch was the king’s master of whisperers He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation but the message did not concern Lady Arryn What is the source for this information

Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont

Would that I might forget him Ned said bluntly The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks his crime had dishonored the north Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king’s justice Five years had passed since then

Ser Jorah is now in Pentos anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile Robert explained Lord Varys makes good use of him

So the slaver has become a spy Ned said with distaste He handed the letter back I would rather he become a corpse

Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses Robert said Jorah aside what do you make of his report

Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord What of it Shall we send her a wedding gift

The king frowned A knife perhaps A good sharp one and a bold man to wield it

Ned did not feign surprise Robert’s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar’s wife and children as a token of fealty Ned had named that murder Robert called it war When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes his new-made king had replied I see no babes Only dragonspawn Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south It had taken another death to reconcile them Lyanna’s death and the grief they had shared over her passing

This time Ned resolved to keep his temper Your Grace the girl is scarcely more than a child You are no Tywin Lannister to slaughter innocents It was said that Rhaegar’s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords The boy had been no more than a babe in arms yet Lord Tywin’s soldiers had torn him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall

And how long will this one remain an innocent Robert’s mouth grew hard This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me

Nonetheless Ned said the murder of children… it would be vile… unspeakable…

Unspeakable the king roared What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable The way your lord father died that was unspeakable And Rhaegar… how many times do you think he raped your sister How many hundreds of times His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him The king jerked the reins hard quieting the animal and pointed an angry finger at Ned I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on until they are as dead as their dragons and then I will piss on their graves

Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him If the years had not quenched Robert’s thirst for revenge no words of his would help You can’t get your hands on this one can you he said quietly

The king’s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace No gods be cursed Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them and now he’s handed them over to the Dothraki I should have had them both killed years ago when it was easy to get at them but Jon was as bad as you More fool I I listened to him

Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand

Robert snorted The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde What would Jon say to that

He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea Ned replied calmly The barbarians have no ships They hate and fear the open sea
