He’s going to wet his pants Hot Pie suggested

Leave him be said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them Lommy had named him the Bull on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore Lommy didn’t dare mock the Bull He was older and big for his age with a broad chest and strong-looking arms

You better give Hot Pie the sword Arry Lommy said Hot Pie wants it bad He kicked a boy to death He’ll do the same to you I bet

I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him there until he was dead Hot Pie boasted I kicked him all to pieces His balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black You better gimme the sword

Arya slid her practice sword from her belt You can have this one she told Hot Pie not wanting to fight

That’s just some stick He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle’s hilt

Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey’s hindquarters The animal hawed and bucked dumping Hot Pie on the ground She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking Blood dribbled from his nostrils When Hot Pie began to wail Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed You want some sword too she yelled but he didn’t He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away

The Bull shouted Behind you and Arya spun Hot Pie was on his knees his fist closing around a big jagged rock She let him throw it ducking her head as it sailed past Then she flew at him He raised a hand and she hit it and then his cheek and then his knee He grabbed for her and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head He fell down and got up and stumbled after her his red face all smeared with dirt and blood Arya slid into a water dancer’s stance and waited When he came close enough she lunged right between his legs so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks

By the time Yoren pulled her off him Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over Enough the black brother roared prying the stick sword from her fingers you want to kill the fool When Lommy and some others started to squeal the old man turned on them too Shut your mouths or I’ll be shutting them for you Any more o’ this I’ll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall He spat And that goes twice for you Arry You come with me boy Now

They were all looking at her even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed but Arya ignored him

The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees cursing and muttering all the while If I had a thimble o’ sense I would’ve left you in King’s Landing You hear me boy He always snarled that word putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear Unlace your breeches and pull ’em down Go on there’s no one here to see Do it Sullenly Arya did as he said Over there against the oak Yes like that She wrapped her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood You scream now You scream loud

I won’t Arya thought stubbornly but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs the shriek burst out of her anyway Think that hurt he said Try this one The stick came whistling Arya shrieked again clutching the tree to keep from falling One more She held on tight chewing her lip flinching when she heard it coming The stroke made her jump and howl I won’t cry she thought I won’t do that I’m a Stark of Winterfell our sigil is the direwolf direwolves don’t cry She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain Might be I got your attention now Yoren said Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers you’ll get twice what you give you hear me Now cover yourself

They’re not my brothers Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches but she knew better than to say so Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces

Yoren was looking at her You hurt

Calm as still water she told herself the way Syrio Forel had taught her Some

He spat That pie boy’s hurting worse It wasn’t him as killed your father girl nor that thieving Lommy neither Hitting them won’t bring him back

I know Arya muttered sullenly

Here’s something you don’t know It wasn’t supposed to happen like it did I was set to leave wagons bought and loaded and a man comes with a boy for me and a purse of coin and a message never mind who it’s from Lord Eddard’s to take the black he says to me wait he’ll be going with you Why d’you think I was there Only something went queer

Joffrey Arya breathed Someone should kill him

Someone will but it won’t be me nor you neither Yoren tossed back her stick sword Got sourleaf back at the wagons he said as they made their way back to the road You’ll chew some it’ll help with the sting

It did help some though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood Even so she walked for the rest of that day and the day after and the day after that too raw to sit a donkey Hot Pie was worse off Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock Lommy Greenhands wasn’t even hurt yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get Every time you look at him he twitches the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey She did not answer It seemed safer not to talk to anyone

That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground staring up at the great red comet The comet was splendid and scary all at once The Red Sword the Bull named it he claimed it looked like a sword the blade still red-hot from the forge When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too only it wasn’t a new sword it was Ice her father’s greatsword all ripply Valyrian steel and the red was Lord Eddard’s blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King’s Justice had cut off his head Yoren had made her look away when it happened yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have after

When at last she slept she dreamed of home The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall and Yoren had promised he’d leave her there with no one any wiser about who she’d been She yearned to see her mother again and Robb and Bran and Rickon    but it was Jon Snow she thought of most She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell so Jon might muss up her hair and call her little sister She’d tell him I missed you and he’d say it too at the very same moment the way they always used to say things together She would have liked that She would have liked that better than anything





SANSA

The morning of King Joffrey’s name day dawned bright and windy with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds What do you think it means she asked him

Glory to your betrothed Ser Arys answered at once See how it flames across the sky today on His Grace’s name day as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey’s Comet

Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey Sansa was not so sure I’ve heard servants calling it the Dragon’s Tail

King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat in the castle built by his son Ser Arys said He is the dragon’s heir—and crimson is the color of House Lannister another sign This comet is sent to herald Joffrey’s ascent to the throne I have no doubt It means that he will triumph over his enemies

Is it true she wondered Would the gods be so cruel Her mother was one of Joffrey’s enemies now her brother Robb another Her father had died by the king’s command Must Robb and her lady mother die next The comet was red but Joffrey was Baratheon as much as Lannister and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field Shouldn’t the gods have sent Joff a golden comet

Sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window You look very lovely today my lady Ser Arys said

Thank you ser Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes She wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from Joffrey The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms Those were Joffrey’s gifts as well When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North his rage had been a fearsome thing and he had sent Ser Boros to beat her

Shall we go Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber If she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging her steps Sansa preferred that it be him Ser Boros was short-tempered Ser Meryn cold and Ser Mandon’s strange dead eyes made her uneasy while Ser Preston treated her like a lackwit child Arys Oakheart was courteous and would talk to her cordially Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded him to hit her He did hit her in the end but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have and at least he had argued The others obeyed without question    except for the Hound but Joff never asked the Hound to punish her He used the other five for that

Ser Arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon Today he made quite the dashing figure with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread Who do you think will win the day’s honors Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm

I will Ser Arys answered smiling Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor This will be a small field and poor No more than two score will enter the lists including squires and freeriders There is small honor in unhorsing green boys

The last tourney had been different Sansa reflected King Robert had staged it in her father’s honor High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete and the whole city had turned out to watch She remembered the splendor of it the field of pavilions along the river with a knight’s shield hung before each door the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves and the nights had been full of feasts and song Those had been the most magical days of her life but they seemed a memory from another age now Robert Baratheon was dead and her father as well beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor Now there were three kings in the land and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men Small wonder that they had to hold Joff’s tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep

Will the queen attend do you think Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to restrain her son

I fear not my lady The council is meeting some urgent business Ser Arys dropped his voice Lord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded Her Grace is furious He fell silent as a column of Lannister guardsmen marched past in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms Ser Arys was fond of gossip but only when he was certain that no one was listening

The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey It was a poor thing indeed and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats Most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few the handful that remained at court Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk Lady Tanda was bracketed by her daughters placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse’s lap The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen’s cousins so the Lannisters might claim her lands

The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen sat behind him In the back of the royal box Sandor Clegane stood at guard his hands resting on his swordbelt The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin Lady Sansa the Hound announced curtly when he saw her His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke

Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa’s name but plump little Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly Sansa did you hear I’m to ride in the tourney today Mother said I could Tommen was all of eight He reminded her of her own little brother Bran They were of an age Bran was back at Winterfell a cripple yet safe

Sansa would have given anything to be with him I fear for the life of your foeman she told Tommen solemnly

His foeman will be stuffed with straw Joff said as he rose The king was clad in a gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest as if he expected the war to engulf them at any moment He was thirteen today and tall for his age with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters

Your Grace she said dipping in a curtsy

Ser Arys bowed Pray pardon me Your Grace I must equip myself for the lists

Joffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied Sansa from head to heels I’m pleased you wore my stones

So the king had decided to play the gallant today Sansa was relieved I thank you for them    and for your tender words I pray you a lucky name day Your Grace

Sit Joff commanded gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own Have you heard The Beggar King is dead

Who For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb
