on no account dance sing or take any active part in
the proceedings
Her allotted hour having been passed in chatting
and looking on Bathsheba told Liddy not to hurry her+
self and went to the small parlour to prepare for
departure which like the hall was decorated with holly
and ivy and well lighted up
Nobody was in the room but she had hardly
HORAE MOMENTO
been there a moment when the master of the house
entered
Mrs Troy -- you are not going he said Weve
hardly begun
If youll excuse me I should like to go now Her
manner was restive for she remembered her promise
and imagined what he was about to say But as it is
not late she added I can walk home and leave my
man and Liddy to come when they choose
Ive been trying to get an opportunity of speaking
to you said Boldwood You know perhaps what I
long to say
Bathsheba silently looked on the floor
You do give it he said eagerly
What she whispered
Now thats evasion Why the promise I dont
want to intrude upon you at all or to let it become
known to anybody But do give your word A
mere business compact you know between two people
who are beyond the influence of passicn Boldwood
knew how false this picture was as regarded himself
but he had proved that it was the only tone in which
she would allow him to approach her A promise to
marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters
You owe it to me
I feel that I do said Bathsheba  that is if you
demand it But I am a changed woman -- an unhappy
woman -- and not -- not --  -- 
 You are still a very beautiful woman said Boldwood
Honesty and pure conviction suggested the remark
unaccompanied by any perception that it might have
been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her
However it had not much effect now for for she said
in a
P 435
passionless murmur which was in itself a proof of
her words I have no feeling in the matter at all
And I dont at all know what is right to do in my
diddicult Position and I have nobody to advise me But
I give my promise if I must I give it as the rendering of
a debt conditionally of course on my being a widow
Youll marry me between five and six years hence  
Dont press me too hard Ill marry nobody
else
 But surely you will name the time or theres nothing
in the promise at all
O I dont know pray let me go she said her
bosom beginning to rise I am afraid what to do
want to be just to you and to be that seems to be wrong+
ing myself and perhaps it is breaking the commandments
There is considerable doubt of his death and then it
is dreadful let me ask a solicitor Mr Boldwood if I
ought or no
Say the words dear one and the subject shall be
dismissed  a blissrul loving intimacy of six years and
then marriage -- O Bathsheba say them he begged in
a husky voice unable to sustain the forms of mere
friendship any longer Promise yourself to me I
deserve it indeed I do for I have loved you more than
anybody in the world And if I said hasty words and
showed uncalled-for heat of manner towards you believe
me dear I did not mean to distress you  I was in
agony Bathsheba and I did not know what I said
You wouldnt let a dog suffer what I have suffered
could you but know it Sometimes I shrink from your
knowing what I have felt for you and sometimes I am
distressed that all of it you never will know Be
gracious and give up a little to me when I would give
up mylife for you
The trimmings of her dress as they quivered against
the light showed how agitated she was and at last she
burst out crying And youll not -- press me -- about
anything more -- if I say in five or six years she
sobbed when she had power to frame the words
Yes then Ill leave it to time
Very well If he does not return Ill marry you
in six years from this day if we both live she said
solemnly
P 436
And youll take this as a token from me
Boldwood had come close to her side and now he
clasped one of her hands in both his own and lifted it
to his breast
What is it Oh I cannot wear a ring she ex+
claimed on seeing what he held besides I wouldnt
have a soul know that its an engagement Perhaps it
is improper Besides we are not engaged in the usual
sense are we  Dont insist Mr Boldwood -- dont
In her trouble at not being able to get her hand away
from him at once she stamped passionately on the floor
with one foot and tears crowded to her eyes again
