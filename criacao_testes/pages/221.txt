His father’s eyes were on him pale green flecked with gold so cool they gave Tyrion a chill Did that surprise you Father he asked Did it upset your plans We were supposed to be butchered were we not

Lord Tywin drained his cup his face expressionless I put the least disciplined men on the left yes I anticipated that they would break Robb Stark is a green boy more like to be brave than wise I’d hoped that if he saw our left collapse he might plunge into the gap eager for a rout Once he was fully committed Ser Kevan’s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve

And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage yet keep me ignorant of your plans

A feigned rout is less convincing his father said and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages

A pity my savages ruined your dance Tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet and let it fall to the ground wincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm

The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years Lord Tywin admitted but a victory is a victory You appear to be wounded

Tyrion’s right arm was soaked with blood Good of you to notice Father he said through clenched teeth Might I trouble you to send for your maesters Unless you relish the notion of having a one-armed dwarf for a son…

An urgent shout of Lord Tywin turned his father’s head before he could reply Tywin Lannister rose to his feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his courser The horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth Ser Addam dropped to one knee a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate My liege we have taken some of their commanders Lord Cerwyn Ser Wylis Manderly Harrion Karstark four Freys Lord Hornwood is dead and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us

And the boy Lord Tywin asked

Ser Addam hesitated The Stark boy was not with them my lord They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse riding hard for Riverrun

A green boy Tyrion remembered more like to be brave than wise He would have laughed if he hadn’t hurt so much





CATELYN

The woods were full of whispers

Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley Beneath the trees warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist leafy ground while men made nervous jests in hushed voices Now and again she heard the chink of spears the faint metallic slither of chain mail but even those sounds were muffled

It should not be long now my lady Hallis Mollen said He had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come it was his right as Winterfell’s captain of guards and Robb had not refused it to him She had thirty men around her charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if the fighting went against them Robb had wanted fifty Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough that he would need every sword for the fight They made their peace at thirty neither happy with it

It will come when it comes Catelyn told him When it came she knew it would mean death Hal’s death perhaps… or hers or Robb’s No one was safe No life was certain Catelyn was content to wait to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook to feel the warm wind in her hair

She was no stranger to waiting after all Her men had always made her wait Watch for me little cat her father would always tell her when he rode off to court or fair or battle And she would standing patiently on the battlements of Riverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by He did not always come when he said he would and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding trotting along the rivershore toward the landing Did you watch for me he’d ask when he bent to bug her Did you little cat

Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well I shall not be long my lady he had vowed We will be wed on my return Yet when the day came at last it was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the sept

Ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with promises on his lips At least he had left her with more than words he had given her a son Nine moons had waxed and waned and Robb had been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south She had brought him forth in blood and pain not knowing whether Ned would ever see him Her son He had been so small…

And now it was for Robb that she waited… for Robb and for Jaime Lannister the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all The Kingslayer is restless and quick to anger her uncle Brynden had told Robb And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said

If Robb was frightened he gave no sign of it Catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men touching one on the shoulder sharing a jest with another helping a third to gentle an anxious horse His armor clinked softly when he moved Only his head was bare Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair so like her own and wondered when her son had grown so big Fifteen and near as tall as she was

Let him grow taller she asked the gods Let him know sixteen and twenty and fifty Let him grow as tall as his father and hold his own son in his arms Please please please As she watched him this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels all she could see was the babe they had laid at her breast at Riverrun so long ago

The night was warm but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her shiver Where are they she wondered Could her uncle have been wrong So much rested on the truth of what he had told them Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men and sent them ahead to screen his march Jaime does not know Ser Brynden said when he rode back I’ll stake my life on that No bird has reached him my archers have seen to that We’ve seen a few of his outriders but those that saw us did not live to tell of it He ought to have sent out more He does not know

How large is his host her son asked

Twelve thousand foot scattered around the castle in three separate camps with the rivers between her uncle said with the craggy smile she remembered so well There is no other way to besiege Riverrun yet still that will be their undoing Two or three thousand horse
