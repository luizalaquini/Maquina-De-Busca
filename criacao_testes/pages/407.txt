310 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
LORD they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the
Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals to praise the LORD after the
ordinance of David king of Israel

311 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
unto the LORD because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
toward Israel

And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the
LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid

312 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who
were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation
of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and
many shouted aloud for joy 313 So that the people could not discern
the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the
people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was
heard afar off

41 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of
Israel 42 Then they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief of the
fathers and said unto them Let us build with you for we seek your
God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
Esarhaddon king of Assur which brought us up hither

43 But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief of the
fathers of Israel said unto them Ye have nothing to do with us to
build an house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto
the LORD God of Israel as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath
commanded us

44 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of
Judah and troubled them in building 45 And hired counsellors
against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king
of Persia even until the reign of Darius king of Persia

46 And in the reign of Ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign
wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and
Jerusalem

47 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam Mithredath Tabeel
and the rest of their companions unto Artaxerxes king of Persia and
the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue and
interpreted in the Syrian tongue

48 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort 49 Then wrote
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their
companions the Dinaites the Apharsathchites the Tarpelites the
Apharsites the Archevites the Babylonians the Susanchites the
Dehavites and the Elamites 410 And the rest of the nations whom the
great and noble Asnapper brought over and set in the cities of
Samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a
time

411 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto
Artaxerxes the king Thy servants the men on this side the river and
at such a time

412 Be it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee
to us are come unto Jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad
city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations

413 Be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and
the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and
custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings

414 Now because we have maintenance from the kings palace and it
was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have we
sent and certified the king 415 That search may be made in the book
of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the
records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful
unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the
same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed

416 We certify the king that if this city be builded again and the
walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this
side the river

417 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor and to
Shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in
Samaria and unto the rest beyond the river Peace and at such a
time

418 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
me

419 And I commanded and search hath been made and it is found that
this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that
rebellion and sedition have been made therein

420 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem which have
ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and
custom was paid unto them

421 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that
this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given
from me
