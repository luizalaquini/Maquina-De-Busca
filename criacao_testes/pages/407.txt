She wins her brother Jojen said Summer’s snared

He was right Bran saw Thrashing and growling at the net trying to rip free Summer was only ensnaring himself worse Nor could he bite through Let him out

Laughing the Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both Summer gave a piteous whine his legs kicking against the cords that bound them Meera knelt undid a twist pulled at a corner tugged deftly here and there and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free

Summer to me Bran spread his arms Watch he said an instant before the wolf bowled into him He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other one snarling and yapping the other laughing In the end it was Bran sprawled on top the mud-spattered direwolf under him Good wolf he panted Summer licked him across the ear

Meera shook her head Does he never grow angry

Not with me Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely but it was all in play Sometimes he tears my garb but he’s never drawn blood

Your blood you mean If he’d gotten past my net…

He wouldn’t hurt you He knows I like you All of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran’s constant companions Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him little grandfather but Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya She wasn’t scared to get dirty and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy She was older than Arya though almost sixteen a woman grown They were both older than Bran even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone but they never treated him like a child

I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders He began to struggle toward the nearest tree His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch but when Meera moved to lift him he said No don’t help me He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward using the strength of his arms until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash See I told you Summer lay down with his head in Bran’s lap I never knew anyone who fought with a net before he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting

My father taught me We have no knights at Greywater No master-at-arms and no maester

Who keeps your ravens

She smiled Ravens can’t find Greywater Watch no more than our enemies can

Why not

Because it moves she told him

Bran had never heard of a moving castle before He looked at her uncertainly but he couldn’t tell whether she was teasing him or not I wish I could see it Do you think your lord father would let me come visit when the war is over

You would be most welcome my prince Then or now

Now Bran had spent his whole life at Winterfell He yearned to see far places I could ask Ser Rodrik when he returns The old knight was off east trying to set to rights the trouble there Roose Bolton’s bastard had started it by seizing Lady Hornwood as she returned from the harvest feast marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be her son Then Lord Manderly had taken her castle To protect the Hornwood holdings from the Boltons he had written but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the bastard Ser Rodrik might let me go Maester Luwin never would

Sitting cross-legged under the weirwood Jojen Reed regarded him solemnly It would be good if you left Winterfell Bran

It would

Yes And sooner rather than later

My brother has the greensight said Meera He dreams things that haven’t happened but sometimes they do

There is no sometimes Meera A look passed between them him sad her defiant

Tell me what’s going to happen Bran said

I will said Jojen if you’ll tell me about your dreams

The godswood grew quiet Bran could hear leaves rustling and Hodor’s distant splashing from the hot pools He thought of the golden man and the three-eyed crow remembered the crunch of bones between his jaws and the coppery taste of blood I don’t have dreams Maester Luwin gives me sleeping draughts

Do they help

Sometimes
