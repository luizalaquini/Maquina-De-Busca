BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER
THE arrangement for getting back again to Weather+
bury had been that Oak should take the place of Poor+
grass in Bathshebas conveyance and drive her home
it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph
was suffering from his old complaint a multiplying eye
and was therefore hardly trustworthy as coachman and
protector to a woman But Oak had found himself so
occupied and was full of so many cares relative to
those portions of Boldwoods flocks that were not
disposed of that Bathsheba without telling Oak or
anybody resolved to drive home herself as she had
many times done from Casterbridge Market and trust
to her good angel for performing the journey un+
molested But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood
accidentally on her part at least at the refreshment+
tent she found it impossible to refuse his offer to ride
on horseback beside her as escort It had grown
twilight before she was aware but Boldwood assured
her that there was no cause for uneasiness as the
moon would be up in half-an-hour
Immediately after the incident in the tent she had
risen to go -- now absolutely alarmed and really grateful
for her old lovers protection -- though regretting Gabriels
absence whose company she would have much preferred
as being more proper as well as more pleasant since he
was her own managing-man and servant This how+
ever could not be helped she would not on any
consideration treat Boldwood harshly having once
already iliused him and the moon having risen and
the gig being ready she drove across the hilitop in
the wending ways which led downwards -- to oblivious
obscurity as it seemed for the moon and the hill it
flooded with light were in appearance on a level the
rest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between
them Boldwood mounted his horse and

followed in
close attendance behind Thus they descended into
the lowlands and the sounds of those left on the
hill came like voices from the sky and the lights were
as those of a camp in heaven They soon passed the
merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill
traversed Kingsbere and got upon the high road
The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that
the farmers staunch devotion to herself was still un+
diminished and she sympathized deeply The sight
had quite depressed her this evening had reminded
her of her folly she wished anew as she had wished
many months ago for some means of making repara+
tion for her fault Hence her pity for the man who
so persistently loved on to his own injury and per+
manent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudi+
cious considerateness of manner which appeared
almost like tenderness and gave new vigour to the
exquisite dream of a Jacobs seven years service in
poor Boldwoods mind
He soon found an excuse for advancing from his
position in the rear and rode close by her side They
had gone two or three miles in the moonlight speaking
desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning the
fair farming Oaks usefulness to them both and other
indifferent subjects when Boldwood said suddenly
and simply --
Mrs Troy you will marry again some day
This point-blank query unmistakably confused her
it was not till a minute or more had elapsed that
she said I have not seriously thought of any such
subject
I quite understand that Yet your late husband
has been dead nearly one year and -- 
 You forget that his death was never absolutely
proved and may not have taken place so that I may
not be really a widow she said catching at the straw of
escape that the fact afforded
Not absolutely proved perhaps but it was proved
circumstantially A man saw him drowning too No
reasonable person has any doubt of his death nor
have you maam I should imagine
O yes I have or I should have acted differently
she said gently From the first I have had a strange
uaccountable
P 412
feeling that he could not have perished
but I have been able to explain that in several ways
since Even were I half persuaded that I shall see
him no more I am far from thinking of marriage with
another I should be very contemptible to indulge in
such a thought
They were silent now awhile and having struck into
an unfrequented track across a common the creaks of
Boldwoods saddle and gig springs were all the
sounds to be heard Boldwood ended the pause
Do you remember when I carried you fainting in
my arms into the Kings Arms in Casterbridge Every
dog has his day that was mine
I know-i know it all she said hurriedly
I for one shall never cease regretting that events
so fell out as to deny you to me
