profit

29 Wherefore I will yet plead with you saith the LORD and with your
childrens children will I plead

210 For pass over the isles of Chittim and see and send unto Kedar
and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing

211 Hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my
people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit

212 Be astonished O ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be
ye very desolate saith the LORD

213 For my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the
fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken
cisterns that can hold no water

214 Is Israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled
215 The young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his
land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant

216 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
thy head

217 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast
forsaken the LORD thy God when he led thee by the way  218 And now
what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt to drink the waters of
Sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria to drink the
waters of the river  219 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee
and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that
it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy
God and that my fear is not in thee saith the Lord GOD of hosts

220 For of old time I have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and
thou saidst I will not transgress when upon every high hill and
under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot

221 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how
then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto
me  222 For though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much
soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the Lord GOD

223 How canst thou say I am not polluted I have not gone after
Baalim  see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art
a swift dromedary traversing her ways 224 A wild ass used to the
wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion
who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary
themselves in her month they shall find her

225 Withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst
but thou saidst There is no hope no for I have loved strangers and
after them will I go

226 As the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of
Israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests
and their prophets

227 Saying to a stock Thou art my father and to a stone Thou hast
brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not
their face but in the time of their trouble they will say Arise and
save us

228 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise
if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the
number of thy cities are thy gods O Judah

229 Wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against
me saith the LORD

230 In vain have I smitten your children they received no
correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a
destroying lion

231 O generation see ye the word of the LORD Have I been a
wilderness unto Israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people
We are lords we will come no more unto thee  232 Can a maid forget
her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me
days without number

233 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways

234 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents I have not found it by secret search but upon all these

235 Yet thou sayest Because I am innocent surely his anger shall
turn from me Behold I will plead with thee because thou sayest I
have not sinned

236 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt
be ashamed of Egypt as thou wast ashamed of Assyria

237 Yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine
head for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not
prosper in them

31 They say If a man put away his wife and she go from him and
become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that
land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many
