Forgive me… the blood… oh please… Tansy…

Could there have been another woman in her father’s life Some village maiden he had wronged when he was young perhaps Could he have found comfort in some serving wench’s arms after Mother died It was a queer thought unsettling Suddenly she felt as though she had not known her father at all Who is Tansy my lord Do you want me to send for her Father Where would I find the woman Does she still live

Lord Hoster groaned Dead His hand groped for hers You’ll have others… Sweet babes and trueborn

Others Catelyn thought Has he forgotten that Ned is gone Is he still talking to Tansy or is it me now or Lysa or Mother

When he coughed the sputum came up bloody He clutched her fingers  Be a good wife and the gods will bless you… sons… trueborn sons… aaahhh The sudden spasm of pain made Lord Hoster’s hand tighten His nails dug into her hand and he gave a muffled scream

Maester Vyman came quickly to mix another dose of milk of the poppy and help his lord swallow it down Soon enough Lord Hoster Tully had fallen back into a heavy sleep

He was asking after a woman said Cat Tansy

Tansy The maester looked at her blankly

You know no one by that name A serving girl a woman from some nearby village Perhaps someone from years past Catelyn had been gone from Riverrun for a very long time

No my lady I can make inquiries if you like Utherydes Wayn would surely know if any such person ever served at Riverrun Tansy did you say The smallfolk often name their daughters after flowers and herbs The maester looked thoughtful There was a widow I recall she used to come to the castle looking for old shoes in need of new soles Her name was Tansy now that I think on it Or was it Pansy Some such But she has not come for many years…

Her name was Violet said Catelyn who remembered the old woman very well

Was it The maester looked apologetic My pardons Lady Catelyn but I may not stay Ser Desmond has decreed that we are to speak to you only so far as our duties require

Then you must do as he commands Catelyn could not blame Ser Desmond she had given him small reason to trust her and no doubt he feared that she might use the loyalty that many of the folk of Riverrun would still feel toward their lord’s daughter to work some further mischief I am free of the war at least she told herself if only for a little while

After the maester had gone she donned a woolen cloak and stepped out onto the balcony once more Sunlight shimmered on the rivers gilding the surface of the waters as they rolled past the castle Catelyn shaded her eyes against the glare searching for a distant sail dreading the sight of one But there was nothing and nothing meant that her hopes were still alive

All that day she watched and well into the night until her legs ached from the standing A raven came to the castle in late afternoon flapping down on great black wings to the rookery Dark wings dark words she thought remembering the last bird that had come and the horror it had brought

Maester Vyman returned at evenfall to minister to Lord Tully and bring Catelyn a modest supper of bread cheese and boiled beef with horseradish I spoke to Utherydes Wayn my lady He is quite certain that no woman by the name of Tansy has ever been at Riverrun during his service

There was a raven today I saw Has Jaime been taken again Or slain gods forbid

No my lady we’ve had no word of the Kingslayer

Is it another battle then is Edmure in difficulty Or Robb Please be kind put my fears at rest

My lady I should not… Vyman glanced about as if to make certain no one else was in the room Lord Tywin has left the riverlands All’s quiet on the fords

Whence came the raven then

From the west he answered busying himself with Lord Hoster’s bedclothes and avoiding her eyes

Was it news of Robb

He hesitated Yes my lady

Something is wrong She knew it from his manner He was hiding something from her Tell me Is it Robb Is he hurt Not dead gods be good please do not tell me that he is dead

His Grace took a wound storming the Crag Maester Vyman said still evasive but writes that it is no cause for concern and that he hopes to return soon

A wound What sort of wound How serious
