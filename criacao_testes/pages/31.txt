I came to see Bran Jon said To say good-bye

Her face did not change Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled She looked as though she had aged twenty years You’ve said it Now go away

Part of him wanted only to flee but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again He took a nervous step into the room Please he said

Something cold moved in her eyes I told you to leave she said We don’t want you here

Once that would have sent him running Once that might even have made him cry Now it only made him angry He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch soon and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark He’s my brother he said

Shall I call the guards

Call them Jon said defiant You can’t stop me from seeing him He crossed the room keeping the bed between them and looked down on Bran where he lay

She was holding one of his hands It looked like a claw This was not the Bran he remembered The flesh had all gone from him His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks Under the blanket his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick His eyes were sunken deep into black pits open but they saw nothing The fall had shrunken him somehow He looked half a leaf as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave

Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath

Bran he said I’m sorry I didn’t come before I was afraid He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks Jon no longer cared Don’t die Bran Please We’re all waiting for you to wake up Me and Robb and the girls everyone…

Lady Stark was watching She had not raised a cry Jon took that for acceptance Outside the window the direwolf howled again The wolf that Bran had not had time to name

I have to go now Jon said Uncle Benjen is waiting I’m to go north to the Wall We have to leave today before the snows come He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey It was more than he could bear the thought of leaving him behind like this Jon brushed away his tears leaned over and kissed his brother lightly on the lips

I wanted him to stay here with me Lady Stark said softly

Jon watched her wary She was not even looking at him She was talking to him but for a part of her it was as though he were not even in the room

I prayed for it she said dully He was my special boy I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me Sometimes prayers are answered

Jon did not know what to say It wasn’t your fault he managed after an awkward silence

Her eyes found him They were full of poison I need none of your absolution bastard

Jon lowered his eyes She was cradling one of Bran’s hands He took the other squeezed it Fingers like the bones of birds Good-bye he said

He was at the door when she called out to him Jon she said He should have kept going but she had never called him by his name before He turned to find her looking at his face as if she were seeing it for the first time

Yes he said

It should have been you she told him Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep her whole body shaking with the sobs Jon had never seen her cry before

It was a long walk down to the yard

Outside everything was noise and confusion Wagons were being loaded men were shouting horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables A light snow had begun to fall and everyone was in an uproar to be off

Robb was in the middle of it shouting commands with the best of them He seemed to have grown of late as if Bran’s fall and his mother’s collapse had somehow made him stronger Grey Wind was at his side

Uncle Benjen is looking for you he told Jon He wanted to be gone an hour ago

I know Jon said Soon He looked around at all the noise and confusion Leaving is harder than I thought

For me too Robb said He had snow in his hair melting from the heat of his body Did you see him
