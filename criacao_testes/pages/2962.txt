45 The fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh

46 Better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with
travail and vexation of spirit

47 Then I returned and I saw vanity under the sun

48 There is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath
neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour
neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he For whom
do I labour and bereave my soul of good This is also vanity yea it
is a sore travail

49 Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their
labour

410 For if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him
that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up

411 Again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one
be warm alone  412 And if one prevail against him two shall
withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken

413 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king
who will no more be admonished

414 For out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor

415 I considered all the living which walk under the sun with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead

416 There is no end of all the people even of all that have been
before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him
Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit

51 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more
ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider
not that they do evil

52 Be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to
utter any thing before God for God is in heaven and thou upon earth
therefore let thy words be few

53 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fools
voice is known by multitude of words

54 When thou vowest a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath
no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed

55 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest
vow and not pay

56 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou
before the angel that it was an error wherefore should God be angry
at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands  57 For in the
multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but
fear thou God

58 If thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting
of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for
he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than
they

59 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is
served by the field

510 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he
that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity

511 When goods increase they are increased that eat them and what
good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with
their eyes  512 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he
eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep

513 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun namely
riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt

514 But those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son
and there is nothing in his hand

515 As he came forth of his mothers womb naked shall he return to
go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may
carry away in his hand

516 And this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so
shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind
517 All his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow
and wrath with his sickness

518 Behold that which I have seen it is good and comely for one to
eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he
taketh under the sun all the days of his life which God giveth him
for it is his portion

519 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth and hath
given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to
rejoice in his labour this is the gift of God
