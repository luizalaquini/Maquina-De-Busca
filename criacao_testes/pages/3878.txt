He turned abruptly and galloped back to find Brienne Gods know why I bother She is the least companionable creature I’ve ever had the misfortune to meet The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side as if to proclaim that she was no part of them They had found men’s garb for her along the way a tunic here a mantle there a pair of breeches and a cowled cloak even an old iron breastplate She looked more comfortable dressed as a man but nothing would ever make her look handsome Nor happy Once out of Harrenhal her usual pighead stubbornness had soon reasserted itself I want my arms and armor back she had insisted Oh by all means let us have you back in steel Jaime replied A helm especially We’ll all be happier if you keep your mouth shut and your visor down

That much Brienne could do but her sullen silences soon began to fray his good humor almost as much as Qyburn’s endless attempts to be ingratiating I never thought I would find myself missing the company of Cleos Frey gods help me He was beginning to wish he had left her for the bear after all

King’s Landing Jaime announced when he found her Our journey’s done my lady You’ve kept your vow and delivered me to King’s Landing All but a few fingers and a hand

Brienne’s eyes were listless That was only half my vow I told Lady Catelyn I would bring her back her daughters Or Sansa at the least And now…

She never met Robb Stark yet her grief for him runs deeper than mine for Joff Or perhaps it was Lady Catelyn she mourned They had been at Brindlewood when they had that news from a red-faced tub of a knight named Ser Bertram Beesbury whose arms were three beehives on a field striped black and yellow A troop of Lord Piper’s men had passed through Brindlewood only yesterday Beesbury told them rushing to King’s Landing beneath a peace banner of their own With the Young Wolf dead Piper saw no point to fighting on His son is captive at the Twins Brienne gaped like a cow about to choke on her cud so it fell to Jaime to draw out the tale of the Red Wedding

Every great lord has unruly bannermen who envy him his place he told her afterward My father had the Reynes and Tarbecks the Tyrells have the Florents Hoster Tully had Walder Frey Only strength keeps such men in their place The moment they smell weakness… during the Age of Heroes the Boltons used to flay the Starks and wear their skins as cloaks She looked so miserable that Jaime almost found himself wanting to comfort her

Since that day Brienne had been like one half-dead Even calling her wench failed to provoke any response The strength is gone from her The woman had dropped a rock on Robin Ryger battled a bear with a tourney sword bitten off Vargo Hoat’s ear and fought Jaime to exhaustion… but she was broken now done I’ll speak to my father about returning you to Tarth if it please you he told her Or if you would rather stay I could perchance find some place for you at court

As a lady companion to the queen she said dully

Jaime remembered the sight of her in that pink satin gown and tried not to imagine what his sister might say of such a companion Perhaps a post with the City Watch…

I will not serve with oathbreakers and murderers

Then why did you ever bother putting on a sword he might have said but he bit back the words As you will Brienne One-handed he wheeled his horse about and left her

The Gate of the Gods was open when they reached it but two dozen wayns were lined up along the roadside loaded with casks of cider barrels of apples bales of hay and some of the biggest pumpkins Jaime had ever seen Almost every wagon had its guards men-at-arms wearing the badges of small lordlings sellswords in mail and boiled leather sometimes only a pink-cheeked farmer’s son clutching a homemade spear with a fire-hardened point Jaime smiled at them all as he trotted past At the gate the gold cloaks were collecting coin from each driver before waving the wagons through What’s this Steelshanks demanded

They got to pay for the right to sell inside the city By command of the King’s Hand and the master of coin

Jaime looked at the long line of wayns carts and laden horses Yet they still line up to pay

There’s good coin to be made here now that the fighting’s done the miller in the nearest wagon told them cheerfully It’s the Lannisters hold the city now old Lord Tywin of the Rock They say he shits silver

Gold Jaime corrected dryly And Littlefinger mints the stuff from goldenrod I vow

The Imp is master of coin now said the captain of the gate Or was till they arrested him for murdering the king The man looked the northmen over suspiciously Who are you lot

Lord Bolton’s men come to see the King’s Hand

The captain glanced at Nage with his peace banner Come to bend the knee you mean You’re not the first Go straight up to the castle and see you make no trouble He waved them through and turned back to the wagons

If King’s Landing mourned its dead boy king Jaime would never have known it On the Street of Seeds a begging brother in threadbare robes was praying loudly for Joffrey’s soul but the passersby paid him no more heed than they would a loose shutter banging in the wind Elsewhere milled the usual crowds gold cloaks in their black mail bakers’ boys selling tarts and breads and hot pies whores leaning out of windows with their bodices half unlaced gutters redolent of nightsoil They passed five men trying to drag a dead horse from the mouth of an alley and elsewhere a juggler spinning knives through the air to delight a throng of drunken Tyrell soldiers and small children

Riding down familiar streets with two hundred northmen a chainless maester and an ugly freak of a woman at his side Jaime found he scarcely drew a second look He did not know whether he ought to be amused or annoyed They do not know me he said to Steelshanks as they rode through Cobbler’s Square

Your face is changed and your arms as well the northman said and they have a new Kingslayer now

The gates to the Red Keep were open but a dozen gold cloaks armed with pikes barred the way They lowered their points as Steelshanks came trotting up but Jaime recognized the white knight commanding them Ser Meryn

Ser Meryn Trant’s droopy eyes went wide Ser Jaime

How nice to be remembered Move these men aside

It had been a long time since anyone had leapt to obey him quite so fast Jaime had forgotten how well he liked it

They found two more Kingsguard in the outer ward two who had not worn white cloaks when Jaime last served here How like Cersei to name me Lord Commander and then choose my colleagues without consulting me Someone has given me two new brothers I see he said as he dismounted

We have that honor ser The Knight of Flowers shone so fine and pure in his white scales and silk that Jaime felt a tattered and tawdry thing by contrast

Jaime turned to Meryn Trant Ser you’ve been remiss in teaching our new brothers their duties

What duties said Meryn Trant defensively

Keeping the king alive How many monarchs have you lost since I left the city Two is it

Then Ser Balon saw the stump Your hand…

Jaime made himself smile I fight with my left now It makes for more of a contest Where will I find my lord father

In the solar with Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn

Mace Tyrell and the Red Viper breaking bread together Strange and stranger Is the queen with them as well

No my lord Ser Balon answered You’ll find her in the sept praying over King Joff—

You

The last of the northmen had dismounted Jaime saw and now Loras Tyrell had seen Brienne

Ser Loras She stood stupidly holding her bridle

Loras Tyrell strode toward her Why he said You will tell me why He treated you kindly gave you a rainbow cloak Why would you kill him

I never did I would have died for him

You will Ser Loras drew his longsword

It was not me

Emmon Cuy swore it was with his dying breath

He was outside the tent he never saw—

There was no one in the tent but you and Lady Stark Do you claim that old woman could cut through hardened steel

There was a shadow I know how mad it sounds but… I was helping Renly into his armor and the candles blew out and there was blood everywhere It was Stannis Lady Catelyn said His… his shadow I had no part in it on my honor…

You have no honor Draw your sword I won’t have it said that I slew you while your hand was empty

Jaime stepped between them Put the sword away ser

Ser Loras edged around him Are you a craven as well as a killer Brienne Is that why you ran with his blood on your hands Draw your sword woman
