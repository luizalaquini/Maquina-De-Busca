needed  Although several different sibilant sound types must be simulated
dynamical movement is less important in fricative sound spectra than
for voiced and aspirated sounds because
smooth transitions between one fricative and another are not important
in speech
However fricative timing and amplitude must be controlled rather precisely
pp
The speech synthesizer is controlled by several parameters
These include fundamental frequency if voiced amplitude of voicing
frequency of the first few em typically three em formants
aspiration amplitude sibilance amplitude and frequency of one or more
sibilance filters
Additionally if the synthesizer is a parallel one parameters for the
amplitudes of individual formants will need to be included
It may be that some control over formant bandwidths is provided too
Thus synthesizers have from eight up to about 20 parameters Klatt 1980
describes one with 20 parameters

pp
The parameters are supplied to the synthesizer at regular intervals of time
For a 10-parameter synthesizer the control can be thought of as a set of
10 graphs each representing the time evolution of one parameter
They are usually called parameter
ul
tracks
the terminology dating from the days when a track was painted on a glass
slide for each parameter to provide dynamic control of the synthesizer
Lawrence 1953

Lawrence 1953

The pitch track is often called a pitch
ul
contour
this is a common phoneticians usage
Do not confuse this with the everyday meaning of contour
as a line joining points of equal height on a map em a pitch contour is
just the time evolution of the pitch frequency
pp
For computer-controlled synthesizers of course the parameter tracks
are sampled typically every 5 to 20 msec
The rate is determined by the need to generate fast amplitude transitions
for nasals and stop consonants
Contrast it with the 125 musec sampling period needed to digitize
telephone-quality speech
The raw data rate for a 10-parameter synthesizer updated every 10 msec
is 1000 parameterssec or 6 Kbits if each parameter is represented
by 6 bits
This is a substantial reduction over the 56 Kbits needed for PCM representation
For speech synthesis by rule Chapter 7 these parameter tracks
are generated by a computer program from a phonetic or English
version of the utterance lowering the data rate by a further one or two
orders of magnitude
pp
Filters for speech
synthesizers can be implemented in either analogue or digital form
High-order filters are usually broken down into second-order sections in
parallel or in series  A third possibility which has not been discussed
above is to implement a single high-order filter directly  Finally the
action of formant filters can be synthesized in the time domain  This gives
eight possibilities which are summarized in Table 52
