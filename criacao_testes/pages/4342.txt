Linear prediction is often thought of as a relatively new technique
but it is only its application to speech processing that is novel
Wiener develops all of the basic mathematics used in linear prediction
of speech except the lattice filter structure

The obvious way to provide speech output from computers
is to select the basic acoustic units to be used record them
and generate utterances by concatenating together appropriate segments
from this pre-stored inventory
The crucial question then becomes what are the basic units
Should they be whole sentences words syllables or phonemes
pp
There are several trade-offs to be considered here
The larger the units the more utterances have to be stored
It is not so much the length of individual utterances that is of concern
but rather their variety which tends to increase exponentially instead
of linearly with the size of the basic unit  Numbers provide an
easy example  there are 10 sup 7 7-digit telephone numbers and it is
certainly infeasible to record each one individually
Note that as storage technology improves the limitation is becoming
more and more one of recording the utterances in the first place rather
than finding somewhere to store them
At a PCM data rate of 50 Kbits a 100 Mbyte disk can hold over 4 hours
of continuous speech
With linear predictive coding at 1 Kbits it holds 08 of a
megasecond em well over a week  And this is a 24-hour 7-day week
which corresponds to a working month and continuous speech em without
pauses em which probably requires another factor of five for
production by a person
Setting up a recording session to fill the disk would be a formidable
task indeed
Furthermore the use of videodisks em which will be common domestic items
by the end of the decade em could increase these figures by a factor of 50
