You promised me a song little bird Have you forgotten

She didn’t know what he meant She couldn’t sing for him now here with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands I can’t she said Let me go you’re scaring me

Everything scares you Look at me Look at me

The blood masked the worst of his scars but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again Sansa could smell him a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit and over it all the reek of blood blood blood

I could keep you safe he rasped They’re all afraid of me No one would hurt you again or I’d kill them He yanked her closer and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss her He was too strong to fight She closed her eyes wanting it to be over but nothing happened Still can’t bear to look can you she heard him say He gave her arm a hard wrench pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed I’ll have that song Florian and Jonquil you said His dagger was out poised at her throat Sing little bird Sing for your little life

Her throat was dry and tight with fear and every song she had ever known had fled from her mind Please don’t kill me she wanted to scream please don’t She could feel him twisting the point pushing it into her throat and she almost closed her eyes again but then she remembered It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil but it was a song Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

She had forgotten the other verses When her voice trailed off she feared he might kill her but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat never speaking

Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers The room was too dark for her to see him but she could feel the stickiness of the blood and a wetness that was not blood Little bird he said once more his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone Then he rose from the bed Sansa heard cloth ripping followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps

When she crawled out of bed long moments later she was alone She found his cloak on the floor twisted up tight the white wool stained by blood and fire The sky outside was darker by then with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars A chill wind was blowing banging the shutters Sansa was cold She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor shivering

How long she stayed there she could not have said but after a time she heard a bell ringing far off across the city The sound was a deep-throated bronze booming coming faster with each knell Sansa was wondering what it might mean when a second bell joined in and a third their voices calling across the hills and hollows the alleys and towers to every corner of King’s Landing She threw off the cloak and went to her window

The first faint hint of dawn was visible in the east and the Red Keep’s own bells were ringing now joining in the swelling river of sound that flowed from the seven crystal towers of the Great Sept of Baelor They had rung the bells when King Robert died she remembered but this was different no slow dolorous death knell but a joyful thunder She could hear men shouting in the streets as well and something that could only be cheers

It was Ser Dontos who brought her the word He staggered through her open door wrapped her in his flabby arms and whirled her around and around the room whooping so incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of it He was as drunk as the Hound had been but in him it was a dancing happy drunk She was breathless and dizzy when he let her down What is it She clutched at a bedpost What’s happened Tell me

It’s done Done Done The city is saved Lord Stannis is dead  Lord Stannis is fled no one knows no one cares his host is broken the danger’s done Slaughtered scattered or gone over they say Oh the bright banners The banners Jonquil the banners Do you have any wine We ought to drink to this day yes It means you’re safe don’t you see

Tell me what’s happened Sansa shook him

Ser Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other almost falling They came up through the ashes while the river was burning The river Stannis was neck deep in the river and they took him from the rear Oh to be a knight again to have been part of it His own men hardly fought they say Some ran but more bent the knee and went over shouting for Lord Renly What must Stannis have thought when he heard that I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the same and the gold cloaks as well We’re delivered sweetling They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank through all the fields Stannis had burned the ashes puffing up around their boots and turning all their armor grey but oh the banners must have been bright the golden rose and golden lion and all the others the Marbrand tree and the Rowan Tarly’s huntsman and Redwyne’s grapes and Lady Oakheart’s leaf All the westermen all the power of Highgarden and Casterly Rock Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side of the river with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left but the vanguard won the fight They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin every man of them howling like some demon in steel And do you know who led the vanguard Do you Do you Do you

Robb It was too much to be hoped but…

It was Lord Renly Lord Renly in his green armor with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand They say he killed Ser Guyard Morrigen himself in single combat and a dozen other great knights as well It was Renly it was Renly it was Renly Oh the banners darling Sansa Oh to be a knight





DAENERYS

She was breaking her fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought her a Qartheen gown an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls Take it away Dany said The docks are no place for lady’s finery

If the Milk Men thought her such a savage she would dress the part for them When she went to the stables she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki fashion and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid I have won no victories she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly

Jhiqui disagreed You burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell

That was Drogon’s victory not mine Dany wanted to say but she held her tongue The Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair She chimed as she mounted her silver mare and again with every stride but neither Ser Jorah nor her bloodriders made mention of it To guard her people and her dragons in her absence she chose Rakharo Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront

They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street There were fewer horses and camels to be seen and a dearth of palanquins but the streets teemed with children beggars and skinny dogs the color of sand Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch them pass They know who I am and they do not love me Dany could tell from the way they looked at her

Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin safely hidden behind silken curtains but she refused him She had reclined too long on satin cushions letting oxen bear her hither and yon At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere

It was not by choice that she sought the waterfront She was fleeing again Her whole life had been one long flight it seemed She had begun running in her mother’s womb and never once stopped How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night a bare step ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives But it was run or die Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her

Dany had laughed when he told her Was it not you who told me warlocks were no more than old soldiers vainly boasting of forgotten deeds and lost prowess

Xaro looked troubled And so it was then But now I am less certain It is said that the glass candles are burning in the house of Urrathon Night-Walker that have not burned in a hundred years Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock’s Way and all the rats in the city are chewing off their tails The wife of Mathos Mallarawan who once mocked a warlock’s drab moth-eaten robe has gone mad and will wear no clothes at all Even fresh-washed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again or so his slaves do swear A man must wonder He sighed These are strange times in Qarth And strange times are bad for trade It grieves me to say so yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely and sooner rather than later Xaro stroked her fingers reassuringly You need not go alone though You have seen dark visions in the Palace of Dust but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams I see you happily abed with our child at your breast Sail with me around the Jade Sea and we can yet make it so It is not too late Give me a son my sweet song of joy

Give you a dragon you mean I will not wed you Xaro

His face had grown cold at that Then go

But where

Somewhere far from here

Well perhaps it was time The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste but now that they were plump and rested once again they began to grow unruly Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place They were a warrior people not made for cities Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long seduced by its comforts and its beauties It was a city that always promised more than it would give you it seemed to her and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame Overnight the Qartheen had come to remember that dragons were dangerous No longer did they vie with each other to give her gifts Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from joining them

But where am I to go Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east away from her enemies in the Seven Kingdoms Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea even if it meant braving the red waste again Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong But her heart was full of doubts Each of these felt wrong somehow… and even when she decided where to go the question of how she would get there remained troublesome

Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her she knew that now For all his professions of devotion he was playing his own game not unlike Pyat Pree The night he asked her to leave Dany had begged one last favor of him An army is it Xaro asked A kettle of gold A galley perhaps

Dany blushed She hated begging A ship yes

Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose I am a trader Khaleesi So perhaps we should speak no more of giving but rather of trade For one of your dragons you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet You need only say that one sweet word

No she said

Alas Xaro sobbed that was not the word I meant

Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children

Whyever not They can always make more Mothers sell their children every day
