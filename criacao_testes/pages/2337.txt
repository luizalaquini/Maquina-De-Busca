We know Davos said Come lad we must not dawdle

Edric donned a thick hooded cloak of undyed wool Maester Pylos helped him fasten it and pulled the hood up to shadow his face Are you coming with us Maester the boy asked

No Pylos touched the chain of many metals he wore about his neck My place is here on Dragonstone Go with Lord Davos now and do as he says He is the King’s Hand remember What did I tell you about the King’s Hand

The Hand speaks with the king’s voice

The young maester smiled That’s so Go now

Davos had been uncertain of Pylos Perhaps he resented him for taking old Cressen’s place But now he could only admire the man’s courage This could mean his life as well

Outside the maester’s chambers Ser Gerald Gower waited by the steps Edric Storm looked at him curiously As they made their descent he asked Where are we going Lord Davos

To the water A ship awaits you

The boy stopped suddenly A ship

One of Salladhor Saan’s Salla is a good friend of mine

I shall go with you Cousin Ser Andrew assured him There’s nothing to be frightened of

I am not frightened Edric said indignantly Only    is Shireen coming too

No said Davos The princess must remain here with her father and mother

I have to see her then Edric explained To say my farewells Otherwise she’ll be sad

Not so sad as if she sees you burn There is no time Davos said I will tell the princess that you were thinking of her And you can write her when you get to where you’re going

The boy frowned Are you sure I must go Why would my uncle send me from Dragonstone Did I displease him I never meant to He got that stubborn look again I want to see my uncle I want to see King Stannis

Ser Andrew and Ser Gerald exchanged a look There’s no time for that Cousin Ser Andrew said

I want to see him Edric insisted louder

He does not want to see you Davos had to say something to get the boy moving I am his Hand I speak with his voice Must I go to the king and tell him that you would not do as you were told Do you know how angry that will make him Have you ever seen your uncle angry He pulled off his glove and showed the boy the four fingers that Stannis had shortened I have

It was all lies there had been no anger in Stannis Baratheon when he cut the ends off his onion knight’s fingers only an iron sense of justice But Edric Storm had not been born then and could not know that And the threat had the desired effect He should not have done that the boy said but he let Davos take him by the hand and draw him down the steps

The Bastard of Nightsong joined them at the cellar door They walked quickly across a shadowed yard and down some steps under the stone tail of a frozen dragon Lewys the Fishwife and Omer Blackberry waited at the postern gate two guards bound and trussed at their feet The boat Davos asked them

It’s there Lewys said Four oarsmen The galley is anchored just past the point Mad Prendos

Davos chuckled A ship named after a madman Yes that’s fitting Salla had a streak of the pirate’s black humor

He went to one knee before Edric Storm I must leave you now he said There’s a boat waiting to row you out to a galley Then it’s off across the sea You are Robert’s son so I know you will be brave no matter what happens

I will Only    The boy hesitated

Think of this as an adventure my lord Davos tried to sound hale and cheerful It’s the start of your life’s great adventure May the Warrior defend you

And may the Father judge you justly Lord Davos The boy went with his cousin Ser Andrew out the postern gate The others followed all but the Bastard of Nightsong May the Father judge me justly Davos thought ruefully But it was the king’s judgment that concerned him now

These two asked Ser Rolland of the guards when he had closed and barred the gate

Drag them into a cellar said Davos You can cut them free when Edric’s safely under way

The Bastard gave a curt nod There were no more words to say the easy part was done Davos pulled his glove on wishing he had not lost his luck He had been a better man and a braver one with that bag of bones around his neck He ran his shortened fingers through thinning brown hair and wondered if it needed to be cut He must look presentable when he stood before the king

Dragonstone had never seemed so dark and fearsome He walked slowly his footsteps echoing off black walls and dragons Stone dragons who will never wake I pray The Stone Drum loomed huge ahead of him The guards at the door uncrossed their spears as he approached Not for the onion knight but for the King’s Hand Davos was the Hand going in at least He wondered what he would be coming out If I ever do   

The steps seemed longer and steeper than before or perhaps it was just that he was tired The Mother never made me for tasks like this He had risen too high and too fast and up here on the mountain the air was too thin for him to breathe As a boy he’d dreamed of riches but that was long ago Later grown all he had wanted was a few acres of good land a hall to grow old in a better life for his sons The Blind Bastard used to tell him that a clever smuggler did not overreach nor draw too much attention to himself A few acres a timbered roof a ser before my name I should have been content If he survived this night he would take Devan and sail home to Cape Wrath and his gentle Marya We will grieve together for our dead sons raise the living ones to be good men and speak no more of kings

The Chamber of the Painted Table was dark and empty when Davos entered the king would still be at the nightfire with Melisandre and the queen’s men He knelt and made a fire in the hearth to drive the chill from the round chamber and chase the shadows back into their corners Then he went around the room to each window in turn opening the heavy velvet curtains and unlatching the wooden shutters The wind came in strong with the smell of salt and sea and pulled at his plain brown cloak

At the north window he leaned against the sill for a breath of the cold night air hoping to catch a glimpse of Mad Prendos raising sail but the sea seemed black and empty as far as the eye could see Is she gone already He could only pray that she was and the boy with her A half moon was sliding in and out amongst thin high clouds and Davos could see familiar stars There was the Galley sailing west there the Crone’s Lantern four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze The clouds hid most of the Ice Dragon all but the bright blue eye that marked due north The sky is full of smugglers’ stars They were old friends those stars Davos hoped that meant good luck

But when he lowered his gaze from the sky to the castle ramparts he was not so certain The wings of the stone dragons cast great black shadows in the light from the nightfire He tried to tell himself that they were no more than carvings cold and lifeless This was their place once A place of dragons and dragonlords the seat of House Targaryen The Targaryens were the blood of old Valyria   

The wind sighed through the chamber and in the hearth the flames gusted and swirled He listened to the logs crackle and spit When Davos left the window his shadow went before him tall and thin and fell across the Painted Table like a sword And there he stood for a long time waiting He heard their boots on the stone steps as they ascended The king’s voice went before him    is not three he was saying

Three is three came Melisandre’s answer I swear to you Your Grace I saw him die and heard his mother’s wail

In the nightfire Stannis and Melisandre came through the door together The flames are full of tricks What is what will be what may be You cannot tell me for a certainty   

Your Grace Davos stepped forward Lady Melisandre saw it true Your nephew Joffrey is dead

If the king was surprised to find him at the Painted Table he gave no sign Lord Davos he said He was not my nephew Though for years I believed he was

He choked on a morsel of food at his wedding feast Davos said It may be that he was poisoned

He is the third said Melisandre

I can count woman Stannis walked along the table past Oldtown and the Arbor up toward the Shield Islands and the mouth of the Mander Weddings have become more perilous than battles it would seem Who was the poisoner Is it known

His uncle it’s said The Imp

Stannis ground his teeth A dangerous man I learned that on the Blackwater How do you come by this report

The Lyseni still trade at King’s Landing Salladhor Saan has no reason to lie to me

I suppose not The king ran his fingers across the table Joffrey    I remember once this kitchen cat    the cooks were wont to feed her scraps and fish heads One told the boy that she had kittens in her belly thinking he might want one Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if it were true When he found the kittens he brought them to show to his father Robert hit the boy so hard I thought he’d killed him The king took off his crown and placed it on the table Dwarf or leech this killer served the kingdom well They must send for me now

They will not said Melisandre Joffrey has a brother

Tommen The king said the name grudgingly

They will crown Tommen and rule in his name
