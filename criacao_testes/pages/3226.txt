themselves being not baptized of him

731 And the Lord said Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation and to what are they like  732 They are like unto
children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and
saying We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have
mourned to you and ye have not wept

733 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
and ye say He hath a devil

734 The Son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say Behold a
gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
735 But wisdom is justified of all her children

736 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him
And he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meat

737 And behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she
knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an
alabaster box of ointment 738 And stood at his feet behind him
weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the
ointment

739 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake
within himself saying This man if he were a prophet would have
known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she
is a sinner

740 And Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say
unto thee And he saith Master say on

741 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed
five hundred pence and the other fifty

742 And when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both
Tell me therefore which of them will love him most  743 Simon
answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most

And he said unto him Thou hast rightly judged

744 And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon Seest thou this
woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my
feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the
hairs of her head

745 Thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in
hath not ceased to kiss my feet

746 My head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath
anointed my feet with ointment

747 Wherefore I say unto thee Her sins which are many are
forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same
loveth little

748 And he said unto her Thy sins are forgiven

749 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
themselves Who is this that forgiveth sins also  750 And he said to
the woman Thy faith hath saved thee go in peace

81 And it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city
and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of
God and the twelve were with him 82 And certain women which had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene
out of whom went seven devils 83 And Joanna the wife of Chuza
Herods steward and Susanna and many others which ministered unto
him of their substance

84 And when much people were gathered together and were come to him
out of every city he spake by a parable 85 A sower went out to sow
his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was
trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it

86 And some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
withered away because it lacked moisture

87 And some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and
choked it

88 And other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an
hundredfold And when he had said these things he cried He that hath
ears to hear let him hear

89 And his disciples asked him saying What might this parable be
810 And he said Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God but to others in parables that seeing they might not
see and hearing they might not understand

811 Now the parable is this The seed is the word of God

812 Those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil
and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe
and be saved

813 They on the rock are they which when they hear receive the
word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and
in time of temptation fall away
