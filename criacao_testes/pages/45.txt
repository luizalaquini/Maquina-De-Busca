Robb stood a little taller Put one man in the sickroom night and day one outside the door two at the bottom of the stairs No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother’s

As you say m’lord

Do it now Catelyn suggested

And let his wolf stay in the room with him Robb added

Yes Catelyn said And then again Yes

Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room

Lady Stark Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used

The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely but I can vouch for its edge Catelyn replied with a dry smile Why do you ask

We found the knife still in the villain’s grasp It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man so I looked at it long and hard The blade is Valyrian steel the hilt dragonbone A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him Someone gave it to him

Catelyn nodded thoughtful Robb close the door

He looked at her strangely but did as she told him

What I am about to tell you must not leave this room she told them I want your oaths on that If even part of what I suspect is true Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives

Lord Eddard is a second father to me said Theon Greyjoy I do so swear

You have my oath Maester Luwin said

And mine my lady echoed Ser Rodrik

She looked at her son And you Robb

He nodded his consent

My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband Lord Arryn the Hand of the King Catelyn told them It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell He remained here in the castle The room was deathly quiet I do not think Bran fell from that tower she said into the stillness I think he was thrown

The shock was plain on their faces My lady that is a monstrous suggestion said Rodrik Cassel Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child

Oh would he Theon Greyjoy asked I wonder

There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition Catelyn said

The boy had always been surehanded in the past Maester Luwin said thoughtfully He knew every stone in Winterfell

Gods Robb swore his young face dark with anger If this is true he will pay for it He drew his sword and waved it in the air I’ll kill him myself

Ser Rodrik bristled at him Put that away The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it How many times must I tell you foolish boy

Abashed Robb sheathed his sword suddenly a child again Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik I see my son is wearing steel now

The old master-at-arms said I thought it was time

Robb was looking at her anxiously Past time she said Winterfell may have need of all its swords soon and they had best not be made of wood
