519 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments
and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven

520 For I say unto you That except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven

521 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt
not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
522 But I say unto you That whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever
shall say to his brother Raca shall be in danger of the council but
whosoever shall say Thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire

523 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there
rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee 524 Leave there
thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy
brother and then come and offer thy gift

525 Agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way
with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into
prison

526 Verily I say unto thee Thou shalt by no means come out thence
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing

527 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt
not commit adultery 528 But I say unto you That whosoever looketh
on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart

529 And if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell

530 And if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from
thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell

531 It hath been said Whosoever shall put away his wife let him
give her a writing of divorcement 532 But I say unto you That
whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of
fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry
her that is divorced committeth adultery

533 Again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time
Thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths 534 But I say unto you Swear not at all neither by heaven
for it is Gods throne 535 Nor by the earth for it is his
footstool neither by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King

536 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make
one hair white or black

537 But let your communication be Yea yea Nay nay for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil

538 Ye have heard that it hath been said An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth 539 But I say unto you That ye resist not evil
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the
other also

540 And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat
let him have thy cloak also

541 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain

542 Give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away

543 Ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy
neighbour and hate thine enemy

544 But I say unto you Love your enemies bless them that curse you
do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully
use you and persecute you 545 That ye may be the children of your
Father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust

546 For if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not
even the publicans the same  547 And if ye salute your brethren
only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so  548
Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect

61 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them
otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven

62 Therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet
before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets that they may have glory of men Verily I say unto you They
have their reward

63 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth 64 That thine alms may be in secret and thy Father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
