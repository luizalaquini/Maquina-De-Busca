Do you think I have forgotten that

I don’t know Have you

Catelyn had never struck her children in anger but she almost struck Robb then It was an effort to remind herself how frightened and alone he must feel You are King in the North the choice is yours I only ask that you think on what I’ve said The singers make much of kings who die valiantly in battle but your life is worth more than a song To me at least who gave it to you She lowered her head Do I have your leave to go

Yes He turned away and drew his sword What he meant to do with it she could not say There was no enemy there no one to fight Only her and him amongst tall trees and fallen leaves There are fights no sword can win Catelyn wanted to tell him but she feared the king was deaf to such words

Hours later she was sewing in her bedchamber when young Rollam Westerling came running with the summons to supper Good Catelyn thought relieved She had not been certain that her son would want her there after their quarrel A dutiful squire she said to Rollam gravely Bran would have been the same

If Robb seemed cool at table and Edmure surly Lame Lothar made up for them both He was the model of courtesy reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill and thanking Robb for the swift sure justice he had meted out to Rickard Karstark Lothar’s bastard brother Walder Rivers was another matter a harsh sour man with old Lord Walder’s suspicious face he spoke but seldom and devoted most of his attention to the meat and mead that was set before him

When all the empty words were said the queen and the other Westerlings excused themselves the remains of the meal were cleared away and Lothar Frey cleared his throat Before we turn to the business that brings us here there is another matter he said solemnly A grave matter I fear I had hoped it would not fall to me to bring you these tidings but it seems I must My lord father has had a letter from his grandsons

Catelyn had been so lost in grief for her own that she had almost forgotten the two Freys she had agreed to foster No more she thought Mother have mercy how many more blows can we bear Somehow she knew the next words she heard would plunge yet another blade into her heart The grandsons at Winterfell she made herself ask My wards

Walder and Walder yes But they are presently at the Dreadfort my lady I grieve to tell you this but there has been a battle Winterfell is burned

Burned Robb’s voice was incredulous

Your northern lords tried to retake it from the ironmen When Theon Greyjoy saw that his prize was lost he put the castle to the torch

We have heard naught of any battle said Ser Brynden

My nephews are young I grant you but they were there Big Walder wrote the letter though his cousin signed as well It was a bloody bit of business by their account Your castellan was slain Ser Rodrik was that his name

Ser Rodrik Cassel said Catelyn numbly That dear brave loyal old soul She could almost see him tugging on his fierce white whiskers What of our other people

The ironmen put many of them to the sword I fear

Wordless with rage Robb slammed a fist down on the table and turned his face away so the Freys would not see his tears

But his mother saw them The world grows a little darker every day Catelyn’s thoughts went to Ser Rodrik’s little daughter Beth to tireless Maester Luwin and cheerful Septon Chayle Mikken at the forge Farlen and Palla in the kennels Old Nan and simple Hodor Her heart was sick Please not all

No said Lame Lothar The women and children hid my nephews Walder and Walder among them With Winterfell in ruins the survivors were carried back to the Dreadfort by this son of Lord Bolton’s

Bolton’s son Robb’s voice was strained

Walder Rivers spoke up A bastard son I believe

Not Ramsay Snow Does Lord Roose have another bastard Robb scowled This Ramsay was a monster and a murderer and he died a coward Or so I was told

I cannot speak to that There is much confusion in any war Many false reports All I can tell you is that my nephews claim it was this bastard son of Bolton’s who saved the women of Winterfell and the little ones They are safe at the Dreadfort now all those who remain

Theon Robb said suddenly What happened to Theon Greyjoy Was he slain

Lame Lothar spread his hands That I cannot say Your Grace Walder and Walder made no mention of his fate Perhaps Lord Bolton might know if he has had word from this son of his

Ser Brynden said We will be certain to ask him

You are all distraught I see I am sorry to have brought you such fresh grief Perhaps we should adjourn until the morrow Our business can wait until you have composed yourselves…

No said Robb I want the matter settled
