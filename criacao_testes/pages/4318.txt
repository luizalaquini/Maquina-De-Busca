However the need for tracking resistors and the inverse square root variation
of the formant frequency with R sub 1 makes it rather unsuitable for serious
applications

A better analogue filter is the ring-of-three configuration
shown in Figure 512
FC Figure 512
Ignore the secondary output for now  Control
is achieved over the centre frequency by two multipliers driven from
the same control input k  These have a high-impedance output producing a
current kx if the input voltage is x
It is not too difficult to show that the transfer function of the circuit is

Suppose that R is chosen so that  k sup 2 R sup 2   1  Then this is a
unity-gain resonator with constant bandwidth  1 pi RC Hz  and centre
frequency  k2 pi C Hz  Note that it is the combination of both multipliers that
makes the centre frequency grow linearly with k  with one multiplier there
would be a square-root relationship

The ring-of-three filter of Figure 512 is arranged in a slightly unusual
way with an inverting stage at the beginning and the two resonant stages
following it  This ensures that the signal level at intermediate
points in the filter does not exceed that at the output and gives the filter
the best chance of coping with a wide range of input amplitudes without
clipping  This contrasts markedly with the resonator of Figure 511 where
the voltage at the output of the first integrator is wb times the final output em a
factor of 50 in the worst case

For a digital implementation of a formant consider the recurrence relation

EQ
yn =  a sub 1 yn-1 - a sub 2 yn-2 + a sub 0 xn

where xn is the input and yn the output at time n
yn-1 and yn-2 are the previous two values of the output
and a sub 0 a sub 1 and a sub 2 are real constants
The minus sign is in front of the second term because it makes a sub 2
turn out to be
positive  To calculate the z-transform version of this relationship multiply
through by z sup -n and sum from n=- infinity to infinity

Writing this in terms of z-transforms

We learned in the previous chapter that the frequency response is obtained
from the z-transform of a system by replacing z sup -1
by  e sup -j2 pi fT  where f is the frequency variable in Hz
Hence the amplitude response of the digital formant filter is

It is fairly obvious from this that a DC gain of 1 is obtained if

for  e sup -j2 pi fT  is 1 at a frequency of 0 Hz  Some manipulation is
required to show that under the usual assumption that the bandwidth is
small the centre frequency is
