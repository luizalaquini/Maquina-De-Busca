TYRION

Janos Slynt was a butcher’s son and he laughed like a man chopping meat More wine Tyrion asked him

I should not object Lord Janos said holding out his cup He was built like a keg and had a similar capacity I should not object at all That’s a fine red From the Arbor

Dornish Tyrion gestured and his serving man poured But for the servants he and Lord Janos were alone in the Small Hall at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness Quite the find Dornish wines are not often so rich

Rich said the big frog-faced man taking a healthy gulp He was not a man for sipping Janos Slynt Tyrion had made note of that at once Yes rich that’s the very word I was searching for the very word You have a gift for words Lord Tyrion if I might say so And you tell a droll tale Droll yes

I’m pleased you think so… but I’m not a lord as you are A simple Tyrion will suffice for me Lord Janos

As you wish He took another swallow dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear its point enameled in dark red And he was well and truly drunk

Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine but he was very full The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service This evening they had supped on oxtail soup summer greens tossed with pecans grapes red fennel and crumbled cheese hot crab pie spiced squash and quails drowned in butter Each dish had come with its own wine Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal Tyrion said

For a certainty Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service what do you say

Wars have been fought over less he said and they both had a good long laugh You’re a bold man to take Harrenhal for your seat Such a grim place and huge… costly to maintain And some say cursed as well

Should I fear a pile of stone He hooted at the notion A bold man you said You must be bold to rise As I have To Harrenhal yes And why not You know You are a bold man too I sense Small mayhap but bold

You are too kind More wine

No No truly I… oh gods be damned yes Why not A bold man drinks his fill

Truly Tyrion filled Lord Slynt’s cup to the brim I have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch

Good men Fine men Any of the six will do but I’d choose Allar Deem My right arm Good good man Loyal Pick him and you won’t be sorry If he pleases the king

To be sure Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater He’s been captain on the Mud Gate for three years and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion King Robert knighted him at Pyke And yet his name does not appear on your list

Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before swallowing Bywater Well Brave man to be sure yet… he’s rigid that one A queer dog The men don’t like him A cripple too lost his hand at Pyke that’s what got him knighted A poor trade if you ask me a hand for a ser He laughed Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor as I see it You’ll do better leaving that one where he is my lor—Tyrion Allar Deem’s the man for you

Deem is little loved in the streets I am told

He’s feared That’s better

What was it I heard of him Some trouble in a brothel

That Not his fault my lor—Tyrion No He never meant to kill the woman that was her own doing He warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty

Still… mothers and children he might have expected she’d try to save the babe Tyrion smiled Have some of this cheese it goes splendidly with the wine Tell me why did you choose Deem for that unhappy task

A good commander knows his men Tyrion Some are good for one job some for another Doing for a babe and her still on the tit that takes a certain sort Not every man’d do it Even if it was only some whore and her whelp

I suppose that’s so said Tyrion hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae and Tysha long ago and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years

Slynt went on oblivious A hard man for a hard job is Deem Does as he’s told and never a word afterward He cut a slice off the cheese This is fine Sharp Give me a good sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and I’m a happy man

Tyrion shrugged Enjoy it while you can With the riverlands in flame and Renly king in Highgarden good cheese will soon be hard to come by So who sent you after the whore’s bastard

Lord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him You’re a sly one Tyrion Thought you could trick me did you it takes more than wine and cheese to make Janos Slynt tell more than he should I pride myself Never a question and never a word afterward not with me

As with Deem

Just the same You make him your Commander when I’m off to Harrenhal and you won’t regret it

Tyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese It was sharp indeed and veined with wine very choice Whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor I can tell Lord Mormont faces the same problem

Lord Janos looked puzzled I thought she was a lady Mormont Beds down with bears that’s the one

It was her brother I was speaking of Jeor Mormont the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch When I was visiting with him on the Wall he mentioned how concerned he was about finding a good man to take his place The Watch gets so few good men these days Tyrion grinned He’d sleep easier if he had a man like you I imagine Or the valiant Allar Deem

Lord Janos roared Small chance of that

One would think Tyrion said but life does take queer turns Consider Eddard Stark my lord I don’t suppose he ever imagined his life would end on the steps of Baelor’s Sept

There were damn few as did Lord Janos allowed chuckling

Tyrion chuckled too A pity I wasn’t here to see it They say even Varys was surprised

Lord Janos laughed so hard his gut shook The Spider he said Knows everything they say Well he didn’t know that

How could he Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone He had helped persuade my sister that Stark should be pardoned on the condition that he take the black

Eh Janos Slynt blinked vaguely at Tyrion

My sister Cersei Tyrion repeated a shade more strongly in case the fool had some doubt who he meant The Queen Regent

Yes Slynt took a swallow As to that well… the king commanded it m’lord The king himself

The king is thirteen Tyrion reminded him

Still He is the king Slynt’s jowls quivered when he frowned The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

Well one or two of them at least Tyrion said with a sour smile Might I have a look at your spear

My spear Lord Janos blinked in confusion

Tyrion pointed The clasp that fastens your cape

Hesitantly Lord Janos drew out the ornament and handed it to Tyrion

We have goldsmiths in Lannisport who do better work he opined The red enamel blood is a shade much if you don’t mind my saying Tell me my lord did you drive the spear into the man’s back yourself or did you only give the command

I gave the command and I’d give it again Lord Stark was a traitor The bald spot in the middle of Slynt’s head was beet-red and his cloth-of-gold cape had slithered off his shoulders onto the floor The man tried to buy me
