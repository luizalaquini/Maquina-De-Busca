Aye said Lem Lord Beric don’t hold with caging men to die of thirst Why don’t you hang them decent

There was nothing decent ’bout them things they did at Tumbler’s Falls the townsman growled right back at him

The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through but Harwin and Gendry offered her a leg up She planted a foot in Harwin’s cupped hands vaulted onto Gendry’s shoulders and grabbed the bars on top of the cage The fat man turned his face up and pressed his cheek to the iron and Arya poured the water over him He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over his head and cheeks and hands and then he licked the dampness off the bars He would have licked Arya’s fingers if she hadn’t snatched them back By the time she served the other two the same a crowd had gathered to watch her The Mad Huntsman will hear of this a man threatened He won’t like it No he won’t

He’ll like this even less then Anguy strung his longbow slid an arrow from his quiver nocked drew loosed The fat man shuddered as the shaft drove up between his chins but the cage would not let him fall Two more arrows ended the other two northmen The only sound in the market square was the splash of falling water and the buzzing of flies

Valar morghulis Arya thought

On the east side of the market square stood a modest inn with whitewashed walls and broken windows Half its roof had burnt off recently but the hole had been patched over Above the door hung a wooden shingle painted as a peach with a big bite taken out of it They dismounted at the stables sitting catty-corner and Greenbeard bellowed for grooms

The buxom red-haired innkeep howled with pleasure at the sight of them then promptly set to tweaking them Greenbeard is it Or Greybeard Mother take mercy when did you get so old Lem is that you Still wearing the same ratty cloak are you I know why you never wash it I do You’re afraid all the piss will wash out and we’ll see you’re really a knight o’ the Kingsguard And Tom o’ Sevens you randy old goat You come to see that son o’ yours Well you’re too late he’s off riding with that bloody Huntsman And don’t tell me he’s not yours

He hasn’t got my voice Tom protested weakly

He’s got your nose though Aye and t’other parts as well to hear the girls talk She spied Gendry then and pinched him on the check Look at this fine young ox Wait till Alyce sees those arms Oh and he blushes like a maid too Well Alyce will fix that for you boy see if she don’t

Arya had never seen Gendry turn so red Tansy you leave the Bull alone he’s a good lad said Tom Sevenstrings All we need from you is safe beds for a night

Speak for yourself singer Anguy slid his arm around a strapping young serving girl as freckly as he was

Beds we got said red-haired Tansy There’s never been no lack o’ beds at the Peach But you’ll all climb in a tub first Last time you lot stayed under my roof you left your fleas behind She poked Greenbeard in the chest And yours was green too You want food

If you can spare it we won’t say no Tom conceded

Now when did you ever say no to anything Tom the woman hooted I’ll roast some mutton for your friends and an old dry rat for you It’s more than you deserve but if you gargle me a song or three might be I’ll weaken I always pity the afflicted Come on come on Cass Lanna put some kettles on Jyzene help me get the clothes off them we’ll need to boil those too

She made good on all her threats Arya tried to tell them that she’d been bathed twice at Acorn Hall not a fortnight past but the red-haired woman was having none of it Two serving wenches carried her up the stairs bodily arguing about whether she was a girl or a boy The one called Helly won so the other had to fetch the hot water and scrub Arya’s back with a stiff bristly brush that almost took her skin off Then they stole all the clothes that Lady Smallwood had given her and dressed her up like one of Sansa’s dolls in linen and lace But at least when they were done she got to go down and eat

As she sat in the common room in her stupid girl clothes Arya remembered what Syrio Forel had told her the trick of looking and seeing what was there When she looked she saw more serving wenches than any inn could want and most of them young and comely And come evenfall lots of men started coming and going at the Peach They did not linger long in the common room not even when Tom took out his woodharp and began to sing Six Maids in a Pool The wooden steps were old and steep and creaked something fierce whenever one of the men took a girl upstairs I bet this is a brothel she whispered to Gendry

You don’t even know what a brothel is

I do so she insisted It’s like an inn with girls

He was turning red again What are you doing here then he demanded A brothel’s no fit place for no bloody highborn lady everybody knows that

One of the girls sat down on the bench beside him Who’s a highborn lady The little skinny one She looked at Arya and laughed I’m a king’s daughter myself

Arya knew she was being mocked You are not

Well I might be When the girl shrugged her gown slipped off one shoulder They say King Robert fucked my mother when he hid here back before the battle Not that he didn’t have all the other girls too but Leslyn says he liked my ma the best

The girl did have hair like the old king’s Arya thought a great thick mop of it as black as coal That doesn’t mean anything though Gendry has the same kind of hair too Lots of people have black hair

I’m named Bella the girl told Gendry For the battle I bet I could ring your bell too You want to

No he said gruffly

I bet you do She ran a hand along his arm I don’t cost nothing to friends of Thoros and the lightning lord

No I said Gendry rose abruptly and stalked away from the table out into the night
