battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their
faces were as the faces of men

98 And they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as
the teeth of lions

99 And they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and
the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle

910 And they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in
their tails and their power was to hurt men five months

911 And they had a king over them which is the angel of the
bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in the
Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon

912 One woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter

913 And the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is before God 914 Saying to the
sixth angel which had the trumpet Loose the four angels which are
bound in the great river Euphrates

915 And the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour
and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men

916 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
thousand thousand and I heard the number of them

917 And thus I saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on
them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and
the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their
mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone

918 By these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and
by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths

919 For their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their
tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do
hurt

920 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not
worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone
and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk 921 Neither
repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their
fornication nor of their thefts

101 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed
with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it
were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire 102 And he had in his
hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and
his left foot on the earth 103 And cried with a loud voice as when
a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their
voices

104 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about
to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not

105 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven 106 And sware by him that liveth for
ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are
and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the
things which are therein that there should be time no longer 107
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin
to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared
to his servants the prophets

108 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and
said Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the
angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth

109 And I went unto the angel and said unto him Give me the little
book And he said unto me Take it and eat it up and it shall make
thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey

1010 And I took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it
up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten
it my belly was bitter

1011 And he said unto me Thou must prophesy again before many
peoples and nations and tongues and kings

111 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel
stood saying Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and
them that worship therein

112 But the court which is without the temple leave out and measure
it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall
they tread under foot forty and two months

113 And I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in
sackcloth

114 These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing
before the God of the earth
