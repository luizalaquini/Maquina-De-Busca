Tyrion was surprised to see Bronn standing beside the litter as well What are you doing here

Delivering your messages Bronn said Ironhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the Gods He won’t say why And you’ve been summoned to Maegor’s too

Summoned Tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word And what does Cersei want of me

Bronn shrugged The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her chambers That stripling cousin of yours delivered the message Four hairs on his lip and he thinks he’s a man

Four hairs and a knighthood He’s Ser Lancel now never forget Tyrion knew that Ser Jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import I’d best see what Bywater wants Inform my sister that I will attend her on my return

She won’t like that Bronn warned

Good The longer Cersei waits the angrier she’ll become and anger makes her stupid I much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning Tyrion tossed his folded cloak into his litter and Timett helped him up after it

The market square inside the Gate of the Gods which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables was near deserted when Tyrion crossed it Ser Jacelyn met him at the gate and raised his iron hand in brusque salute My lord Your cousin Cleos Frey is here come from Riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark

Peace terms

So he says

Sweet cousin Show me to him

The gold cloaks had confined Ser Cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse He rose when they entered Tyrion you are a most welcome sight

That’s not something I hear often cousin

Has Cersei come with you

My sister is otherwise occupied Is this Stark’s letter He plucked it off the table Ser Jacelyn you may leave us

Bywater bowed and departed I was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent Ser Cleos said as the door shut

I shall Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with his letter All in good time cousin Sit Rest You look gaunt and haggard He looked worse than that in truth

Yes Ser Cleos lowered himself onto a bench It is bad in the riverlands Tyrion Around the Gods Eye and along the kingsroad especially The river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us and your father’s foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword

That was the way of war The smallfolk were slaughtered while the highborn were held for ransom Remind me to thank the gods that I was bom a Lannister

Ser Cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair Even with a peace banner we were attacked twice Wolves in mail hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves The gods alone know what side they started on but they’re on their own side now Lost three men and twice as many wounded

What news of our foe Tyrion turned his attention back to Stark’s terms The boy does not want too much Only half the realm the release of our captives hostages his father’s sword… oh yes and his sisters

The boy sits idle at Riverrun Ser Cleos said I think he fears to face your father in the field His strength grows less each day The river lords have departed each to defend his own lands

Is this what Father intended Tyrion rolled up Stark’s map These terms will never do

Will you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem Ser Cleos asked plaintively

Tion Frey was his younger brother Tyrion recalled No he said gently but we’ll propose our own exchange of captives Let me consult with Cersei and the council We shall send you back to Riverrun with our terms

Clearly the prospect did not cheer him My lord I do not believe Robb Stark will yield easily It is Lady Catelyn who wants this peace not the boy

Lady Catelyn wants her daughters Tyrion pushed himself down from the bench letter and map in hand Ser Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire You look in dire need of sleep cousin I will send for you when we know more
