12 victor has possibly made a televised reference to an
attack on 13 tonight
Thats when the first bomb hits Theres an initial sense
of impact followed by an explosion that resonates in my
innermost parts the lining of my intestines the marrow of
my bones the roots of my teeth Were all going to die I
think My eyes turn upward expecting to see giant cracks
race across the ceiling massive chunks of stone raining
down on us but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudder
The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of total
darkness Speechless human sounds--spontaneous
shrieks ragged breaths baby whimpers one musical bit of
insane laughter--dance around in the charged air Then
theres a hum of a generator and a dim wavering glow
replaces the stark lighting that is the norm in 13 Its closer
to what we had in our homes in 12 when the candles and
fire burned low on a winters night
I reach for Prim in the twilight clamp my hand on her
leg and pull myself over to her Her voice remains steady
as she croons to Buttercup Its all right baby its all right
Well be okay down here
My mother wraps her arms around us I allow myself to
feel young for a moment and rest my head on her shoulder
That was nothing like the bombs in Eight I say
Probably a bunker missile says Prim keeping her
voice soothing for the cats sake We learned about them
during the orientation for new citizens Theyre designed to
penetrate deep in the ground before they go off Because
theres no point in bombing Thirteen on the surface
anymore
Nuclear I ask feeling a chill run through me
Not necessarily says Prim Some just have a lot of
explosives in them Butit could be either kind I guess
The gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doors
at the end of the bunker Would they be any protection
against a nuclear attack And even if they were one
hundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation which
is really unlikely would we ever be able to leave this place
The thought of spending whatever remains of my life in this
stone vault horrifies me I want to run madly for the door and
demand to be released into whatever lies above Its
pointless They would never let me out and I might start
some kind of stampede
Were so far down Im sure were safe says my
mother wanly Is she thinking of my fathers being blown to
nothingness in the mines It was a close call though
Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us
The wherewithal A general term that somehow
includes everything that was needed for him to sound the
alarm The knowledge the opportunity the courage And
something else I cant define Peeta seemed to have been
waging a sort of battle in his mind fighting to get the
message out Why The ease with which he manipulates
words is his greatest talent Was his difficulty a result of his
torture Something more Like madness
Coins voice perhaps a shade grimmer fills the
bunker the volume level flickering with the lights
Apparently Peeta Mellarks information was sound and we
owe him a great debt of gratitude Sensors indicate the first
missile was not nuclear but very powerful We expect more
will follow For the duration of the attack citizens are to stay
in their assigned areas unless otherwise notified
A soldier alerts my mother that shes needed in the
first-aid station Shes reluctant to leave us even though
shell only be thirty yards away
Well be fine really I tell her Do you think anything
could get past him I point to Buttercup who gives me
such a halfhearted hiss we all have to laugh a little Even I
feel sorry for him After my mother goes I suggest Why
dont you climb in with him Prim
I know its sillybut Im afraid the bunk might collapse
on us during the attack she says
If the bunks collapse the whole bunker will have given
way and buried us but I decide this kind of logic wont
actually be helpful Instead I clean out the storage cube and
make Buttercup a bed inside Then I pull a mattress in front
of it for my sister and me to share
Were given clearance in small groups to use the
bathroom and brush our teeth although showering has
been canceled for the day I curl up with Prim on the
mattress double layering the blankets because the cavern
emits a dank chill Buttercup miserable even with Prims
constant attention huddles in the cube and exhales cat
breath in my face
Despite the disagreeable conditions Im glad to have
time with my sister My extreme preoccupation since I
came here--no since the first Games really--has left little
attention for her I havent been watching over her the way I
should the way I used to After all it was Gale who checked
our compartment not me Something to make up for
I realize Ive never even bothered to ask her about how
shes handling the shock of coming here So how are you
liking Thirteen Prim I offer
Right now she asks We both laugh I miss home
badly sometimes But then I remember theres nothing left
to miss anymore I feel safer here We dont have to worry
about you Well not the same way She pauses and then
a shy smile crosses her lips I think theyre going to train
me to be a doctor
Its the first Ive heard of it Well of course they are
