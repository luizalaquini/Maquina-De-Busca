Sam was staring at him You’re Jon Snow’s brother The one who fell   

No said Jojen That boy is dead

Don’t tell Bran warned Please

Sam looked confused for a moment but finally he said I    I can keep a secret Gilly too When he looked at her the girl nodded Jon    Jon was my brother too He was the best friend I ever had but he went off with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Frostfangs and never came back We were waiting for him on the Fist when    when   

Jon’s here Bran said Summer saw him He was with some wildlings but they killed a man and Jon took his horse and escaped I bet he went to Castle Black

Sam turned big eyes on Meera You’re certain it was Jon You saw him

I’m Meera Meera said with a smile Summer is   

A shadow detached itself from the broken dome above and leapt down through the moonlight Even with his injured leg the wolf landed as light and quiet as a snowfall The girl Gilly made a frightened sound and clutched her babe so hard against her that it began to cry again

He won’t hurt you Bran said That’s Summer

Jon said you all had wolves Sam pulled off a glove I know Ghost He held out a shaky hand the fingers white and soft and fat as little sausages Summer padded closer sniffed them and gave the hand a lick

That was when Bran made up his mind We’ll go with you

All of you Sam seemed surprised by that

Meera ruffled Bran’s hair He’s our prince

Summer circled the well sniffing He paused by the top step and looked back at Bran He wants to go

Will Gilly be safe if I leave her here till I come back Sam asked them

She should be said Meera She’s welcome to our fire

Jojen said The castle is empty

Gilly looked around Craster used to tell us tales of castles but I never knew they’d be so big

It’s only the kitchens Bran wondered what she’d think when she saw Winterfell if she ever did

It took them a few minutes to gather their things and hoist Bran into his wicker seat on Hodor’s back By the time they were ready to go Gilly sat nursing her babe by the fire You’ll come back for me she said to Sam

As soon as I can he promised then we’ll go somewhere warm When he heard that part of Bran wondered what he was doing Will I ever go someplace warm again

I’ll go first I know the way Sam hesitated at the top There’s just so many steps he sighed before he started down Jojen followed then Summer then Hodor with Bran riding on his back Meera took the rear with her spear and net in hand

It was a long way down The top of the well was bathed in moonlight but it grew smaller and dimmer every time they went around Their footsteps echoed off the damp stones and the water sounds grew louder Should we have brought torches Jojen asked

Your eyes will adjust said Sam Keep one hand on the wall and you won’t fall

The well grew darker and colder with every turn When Bran finally lifted his head around to look back up the shaft the top of the well was no bigger than a half-moon Hodor Hodor whispered Hodorhodorhodorhodorhodorhodor the well whispered back The water sounds were close but when Bran peered down he saw only blackness

A turn or two later Sam stopped suddenly He was a quarter of the way around the well from Bran and Hodor and six feet farther down yet Bran could barely see him He could see the door though The Black Gate Sam had called it but it wasn’t black at all

It was white weirwood and there was a face on it

A glow came from the wood like milk and moonlight so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself not even Sam standing right before it The face was old and pale wrinkled and shrunken It looks dead Its mouth was closed and its eyes its cheeks were sunken its brow withered its chin sagging If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older his face might come to look like that

The door opened its eyes

They were white too and blind Who are you the door asked and the well whispered Who-who-who-who-who-who-who

I am the sword in the darkness Samwell Tarly said I am the watcher on the walls I am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers I am the shield that guards the realms of men

Then pass the door said Its lips opened wide and wider and wider still until nothing at all remained but a great gaping mouth in a ring of wrinkles Sam stepped aside and waved Jojen through ahead of him Summer followed sniffing as he went and then it was Bran’s turn Hodor ducked but not low enough The door’s upper lip brushed softly against the top of Bran’s head and a drop of water fell on him and ran slowly down his nose It was strangely warm and salty as a tear





DAENERYS

Meereen was as large as Astapor and Yunkai combined Like her sister cities she was built of brick but where Astapor had been red and Yunkai yellow Meereen was made with bricks of many colors Her walls were higher than Yunkai’s and in better repair studded with bastions and anchored by great defensive towers at every angle Behind them huge against the sky could be seen the top of the Great Pyramid a monstrous thing eight hundred feet tall with a towering bronze harpy at its top

The harpy is a craven thing Daario Naharis said when he saw it She has a woman’s heart and a chicken’s legs Small wonder her sons hide behind their walls

But the hero did not hide He rode out the city gates armored in scales of copper and jet and mounted upon a white charger whose striped pink-and-white barding matched the silk cloak flowing from the hero’s shoulders The lance he bore was fourteen feet long swirled in pink and white and his hair was shaped and teased and lacquered into two great curling ram’s horns Back and forth he rode beneath the walls of multicolored bricks challenging the besiegers to send a champion forth to meet him in single combat

Her bloodriders were in such a fever to go meet him that they almost came to blows Blood of my blood Dany told them your place is here by me This man is a buzzing fly no more Ignore him he will soon be gone Aggo Jhogo and Rakharo were brave warriors but they were young and too valuable to risk They kept her khalasar together and were her best scouts too

That was wisely done Ser Jorah said as they watched from the front of her pavilion Let the fool ride back and forth and shout until his horse goes lame He does us no harm

He does Arstan Whitebeard insisted Wars are not won with swords and spears alone ser Two hosts of equal strength may come together but one will break and run whilst the other stands This hero builds courage in the hearts of his own men and plants the seeds of doubt in ours

Ser Jorah snorted And if our champion were to lose what sort of seed would that plant

A man who fears battle wins no victories ser

We’re not speaking of battle Meereen’s gates will not open if that fool falls Why risk a life for naught

For honor I would say

I have heard enough Dany did not need their squabbling on top of all the other troubles that plagued her Meereen posed dangers far more serious than one pink-and-white hero shouting insults and she could not let herself be distracted Her host numbered more than eighty thousand after Yunkai but fewer than a quarter of them were soldiers The rest    well Ser Jorah called them mouths with feet and soon they would be starving

The Great Masters of Meereen had withdrawn before Dany’s advance harvesting all they could and burning what they could not harvest Scorched fields and poisoned wells had greeted her at every hand Worst of all they had nailed a slave child up on every milepost along the coast road from Yunkai nailed them up still living with their entrails hanging out and one arm always outstretched to point the way to Meereen Leading her van Daario had given orders for the children to be taken down before Dany had to see them but she had countermanded him as soon as she was told I will see them she said I will see every one and count them and look upon their faces And I will remember

By the time they came to Meereen sitting on the salt coast beside her river the count stood at one hundred and sixty-three I will have this city Dany pledged to herself once more

The pink-and-white hero taunted the besiegers for an hour mocking their manhood mothers wives and gods Meereen’s defenders cheered him on from the city walls His name is Oznak zo Pahl Brown Ben Plumm told her when he arrived for the war council He was the new commander of the Second Sons chosen by a vote of his fellow sellswords I was bodyguard to his uncle once before I joined the Second Sons The Great Masters what a ripe lot o’ maggots The women weren’t so bad though it was worth your life to look at the wrong one the wrong way I knew a man Scarb this Oznak cut his liver out Claimed to be defending a lady’s honor he did said Scarb had raped her with his eyes How do you rape a wench with eyes I ask you But his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard so I had to run like a rat before he killed me too

They watched Oznak zo Pahl dismount his white charger undo his robes pull out his manhood and direct a stream of urine in the general direction of the olive grove where Dany’s gold pavilion stood among the burnt trees He was still pissing when Daario Naharis rode up arakh in hand Shall I cut that off for you and stuff it down his mouth Your Grace His tooth shone gold amidst the blue of his forked beard
