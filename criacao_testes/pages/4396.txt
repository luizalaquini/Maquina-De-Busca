Moreover the dialogue designer must do his utmost to ensure that the user
is always aware of the current state of the interaction
for there is no opportunity to refresh the memory by glancing at earlier
entries and responses
pp
There are two separate aspects to the man-computer interface in a voice
response system
The first is the relationship between the system and the end user
that is the consumer of the synthesized dialogue
The second is the relationship between the system and the applications
programmer who creates the dialogue
These are treated separately in the next two sections
We will have more to say about the former aspect
for it is ultimately more important to more people
But the applications programmers view is important too for without him
no systems would exist
The technical difficulties in creating synthetic dialogues
for the majority of voice systems probably
explain why speech output technology is still greatly under-used
Finally we look at techniques for using small keypads such as those on
touch-tone telephones
for they are an essential part of many voice response systems

Special attention must be paid to be details of the man-machine interface
in speech-output systems
This section summarizes experience of human factors considerations
gained in developing the remote
telephone enquiry service described in Chapter 1 Witten and Madams 1977
which employs an ordinary touch-tone keypad for input in conjunction with
synthetic voice response

Witten Madams 1977 Telephone Enquiry Service

Most of the principles which emerged were the result of natural evolution
of the system and were not clear at the outset
Basically they stem from the fact that speech is both more intrusive
and more ephemeral than writing and so they are applicable in general to
speech output information retrieval systems with keyboard or even voice
input
Be warned however that they are based upon casual observation and
speculation rather than empirical research
There is a desperate need for proper studies of user psychology in speech
systems
rh Echoing
Most alphanumeric input peripherals echo on a character-by-character basis
Although one can expect quite a high proportion of mistakes with
unconventional keyboards especially when entering alphabetic data on a
basically numeric keypad audio character echoing is distracting and annoying
If you type 123 and the computer echoes
LB
NI
one  two  three
LE
after the individual key-presses it is liable to divert your
attention for voice output is much more intrusive than a purely visual echo
pp
Instead an immediate response to a completed input line is preferable
This response can take the form or a reply to a query or if successive
data items are being typed confirmation of the data entered
In the latter case it is helpful if the information can be generated in
the same way that the user himself would be likely to verbalize it
Thus for example when entering numbers
LB
nr x0 wCOMPUTER
nr x1 wUSER
NI
USERhnx0u-nx1u 123	 is the end-of-line character
NI
COMPUTER One hundred and twenty-three
LE
For a query which requires lengthy processing the input should be
repeated in a neat meaningful format to give the user a chance to abort
the request
rh Retracting actions
Because commands are entered directly without explicit confirmation
it must always be easy for the user to revoke his actions
The utility of an undo command is now commonly recognized for
any interactive system and it becomes even more important in speech
systems because it is easier for the user to lose his place in the
dialogue and so make errors
rh Interrupting
A command which interrupts output and returns to a known state
should be recognized at every level of the system
It is essential that voice output be terminated immediately
rather than at the end of the utterance
We do not want the user to live in fear of the system embarking on
a long boring monologue that is impossible to interrupt
Again the same is true of interactive dialogues which do not use speech
but becomes particularly important with voice response because it takes
longer to transmit information
rh Forestalling prompts
Computer-generated prompts must be explicit and frequent enough
to allow new users to understand what they are expected to do
Experienced users will type ahead quite naturally
and the system should suppress unnecessary prompts under these conditions
by inspecting the input buffer before prompting
This allows the user to concatenate frequently-used commands into chunks whose
size is entirely at his own discretion
