He called Bronn to his side Assemble a hundred men and burn everything you see here between the water’s edge and the city walls He waved his stubby fingers taking in all the waterfront squalor I want nothing left standing do you understand

The black-haired sellsword turned his head considering the task Them as own all this won’t like that much

I never imagined they would So be it they’ll have something else to curse the evil monkey demon for

Some may fight

See that they lose

What do we do with those that live here

Let them have a reasonable time to remove their property and then move them out Try not to kill any of them they’re not the enemy And no more rapes Keep your men in line damn it

They’re sellswords not septons said Bronn Next you’ll be telling me you want them sober

It couldn’t hurt

Tyrion only wished he could as easily make city walls twice as tall and three times as thick Though perhaps it did not matter Massive walls and tall towers had not saved Storm’s End nor Harrenhal nor even Winterfell

He remembered Winterfell as he had last seen it Not as grotesquely huge as Harrenhal nor as solid and impregnable to look at as Storm’s End yet there had been a great strength in those stones a sense that within those walls a man might feel safe The news of the castle’s fall had come as a wrenching shock The gods give with one hand and take with the other he muttered under his breath when Varys told him They had given the Starks Harrenhal and taken Winterfell a dismal exchange

No doubt he should be rejoicing Robb Stark would have to turn north now If he could not defend his own home and hearth he was no sort of king at all It meant reprieve for the west for House Lannister and yet…

Tyrion had only the vaguest memory of Theon Greyjoy from his time with the Starks A callow youth always smiling skilled with a bow it was hard to imagine him as Lord of Winterfell The Lord of Winterfell would always be a Stark

He remembered their godswood the tall sentinels armored in their grey-green needles the great oaks the hawthorn and ash and soldier pines and at the center the heart tree standing like some pale giant frozen in time He could almost smell the place earthy and brooding the smell of centuries and he remembered how dark the wood had been even by day That wood was Winterfell It was the north I never felt so out of place as I did when I walked there so much an unwelcome intruder He wondered if the Greyjoys would feel it too The castle might well be theirs but never that godswood Not in a year or ten or fifty

Tyrion Lannister walked his horse slowly toward the Mud Gate Winterfell is nothing to you he reminded himself Be glad the place has fallen and look to your own walls The gate was open Inside three great trebuchets stood side by side in the market square peering over the battlements like three huge birds Their throwing arms were made from the trunks of old oaks and banded with iron to keep them from splitting The gold cloaks had named them the Three Whores because they’d be giving Lord Stannis such a lusty welcome Or so we hope

Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted through the Mud Gate breasting the human tide Once beyond the Whores the press grew thinner and the street opened up around him

The ride back to the Red Keep was uneventful but at the Tower of the Hand he found a dozen angry trader captains waiting in his audience chamber to protest the seizure of their ships He gave them a sincere apology and promised compensation once the war was done That did little to appease them What if you should lose my lord one Braavosi asked

Then apply to King Stannis for your compensation

By the time he rid himself of them bells were ringing and Tyrion knew he would be late for the installation He waddled across the yard almost at a run and crowded into the back of the castle sept as Joffrey fastened white silk cloaks about the shoulders of the two newest members of his Kingsguard The rite seemed to require that everyone stand so Tyrion saw nothing but a wall of courtly arses On the other hand once the new High Septon was finished leading the two knights through their solemn vows and anointing them in the names of the Seven he would be well positioned to be first out the doors

He approved of his sister’s choice of Ser Balon Swann to take the place of the slain Preston Greenfield The Swanns were Marcher lords proud powerful and cautious Pleading illness Lord Gulian Swann had remained in his castle taking no part in the war but his eldest son had ridden with Renly and now Stannis while Balon the younger served at King’s Landing If he’d had a third son Tyrion suspected he’d be off with Robb Stark It was not perhaps the most honorable course but it showed good sense whoever won the iron Throne the Swanns intended to survive In addition to being well born young Ser Balon was valiant courtly and skilled at arms good with a lance better with a morningstar superb with the bow He would serve with honor and courage

Alas Tyrion could not say the same for Cersei’s second choice Ser Osmund Kettleblack looked formidable enough He stood six feet and six inches most of it sinew and muscle and his hook nose bushy eyebrows and spade-shaped brown beard gave his face a fierce aspect so long as he did not smile Lowborn no more than a hedge knight Kettleblack was utterly dependent on Cersei for his advancement which was doubtless why she’d picked him Ser Osmund is as loyal as he is brave she’d told Joffrey when she put forward his name It was true unfortunately The good Ser Osmund had been selling her secrets to Bronn since the day she’d hired him but Tyrion could scarcely tell her that

He supposed he ought not complain The appointment gave him another ear close to the king unbeknownst to his sister And even if Ser Osmund proved an utter craven he would be no worse than Ser Boros Blount currently residing in a dungeon at Rosby Ser Boros had been escorting Tommen and Lord Gyles when Ser Jacelyn Bywater and his gold cloaks had surprised them and had yielded up his charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old Ser Barristan Selmy as much as it did Cersei a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die in defense of the king and royal family His sister had insisted that Joffrey strip Blount of his white cloak on the grounds of treason and cowardice And now she replaces him with another man just as hollow

The praying vowing and anointing seemed to take most of the morning Tyrion’s legs soon began to ache He shifted his weight from one foot to the other restless Lady Tanda stood several rows up he saw but her daughter was not with her He had been half hoping to catch a glimpse of Shae Varys said she was doing well but he would prefer to see for himself

Better a lady’s maid than a pot girl Shae had said when Tyrion told her the eunuch’s scheme Can I take my belt of silver flowers and my gold collar with the black diamonds you said looked like my eyes I won’t wear them if you say I shouldn’t

Loath as he was to disappoint her Tyrion had to point out that while Lady Tanda was by no means a clever woman even she might wonder if her daughter’s bedmaid seemed to own more jewelry than her daughter Choose two or three dresses no more he commanded her Good wool no silk no samite and no fur The rest I’ll keep in my own chambers for when you visit me It was not the answer Shae had wanted but at least she was safe

When the investiture was finally done Joffrey marched out between Ser Balon and Ser Osmund in their new white cloaks while Tyrion lingered for a word with the new High Septon who was his choice and wise enough to know who put the honey on his bread I want the gods on our side Tyrion told him bluntly Tell them that Stannis has vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor

Is it true my lord asked the High Septon a small shrewd man with a wispy white beard and wizened face
