Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard Snow Oh the Stark bastard I think not The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them the brothers and mothers and all that A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone I know these things My own blood kin… my sister Maege rules Bear Island now since my son’s dishonor I have nieces I have never seen He took a swallow Besides Jon Snow is only a boy You shall have three strong swords to keep you safe

I am touched by your concern Lord Mormont The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him I hope I can repay your kindness

You can Mormont said bluntly Your sister sits beside the king Your brother is a great knight and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms Speak to them for us Tell them of our need here You have seen for yourself my lord The Night’s Watch is dying Our strength is less than a thousand now Six hundred here two hundred in the Shadow Tower even fewer at Eastwatch and a scant third of those fighting men The Wall is a hundred leagues long Think on that Should an attack come I have three men to defend each mile of wall

Three and a third Tyrion said with a yawn

Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him The old man warmed his hands before the fire I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce’s son lost on his first ranging The Royce boy was green as summer grass yet he insisted on the honor of his own command saying it was his due as a knight I did not wish to offend his lord father so I yielded I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch More fool I

Fool the raven agreed Tyrion glanced up The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes ruffling its wings Fool it called again Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature A pity

The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall he went on yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled I should never have believed it not of him but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell Of Royce there is no word One deserter and two men lost and now Ben Stark too has gone missing He sighed deeply Who am I to send searching after him In two years I will be seventy Too old and too weary for the burden I bear yet if I set it down who will pick it up Alliser Thorne Bowen Marsh I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are The Night’s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men Apart from the men at my table tonight I have perhaps twenty who can read and even fewer who can think or plan or lead Once the Watch spent its summers building and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it Now it is all we can do to stay alive

He was in deadly earnest Tyrion realized He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning I promise the king will hear of your need Tyrion said gravely and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well And he would Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word He left the rest unsaid that King Robert would ignore him Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses and Jaime would only laugh

You are a young man Tyrion Mormont said How many winters have you seen

He shrugged Eight nine I misremember

And all of them short

As you say my lord He had been born in the dead of winter a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years but Tyrion’s earliest memories were of spring

When I was a boy it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come This summer has lasted nine years Tyrion and a tenth will soon be upon us Think on that

When I was a boy Tyrion replied my wet nurse told me that one day if men were good the gods would give the world a summer without ending Perhaps we’ve been better than we thought and the Great Summer is finally at hand He grinned

The Lord Commander did not seem amused You are not fool enough to believe that my lord Already the days grow shorter There can be no mistake Aemon has had letters from the Citadel findings in accord with his own The end of summer stares us in the face Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand You must make them understand I tell you my lord the darkness is coming There are wild things in the woods direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams

In your dreams Tyrion echoed thinking how badly he needed another strong drink

Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore

This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings

Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before They are running my lord… but running from what Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night These are old bones Lannister but they have never felt a chill like this Tell the king what I say I pray you Winter is coming and when the Long Night falls only the Night’s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north The gods help us all if we are not ready

The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight Yoren is determined to ride at first light Tyrion got to his feet sleepy from wine and tired of doom I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me Lord Mormont

Tell them Tyrion Tell them and make them believe That is all the thanks I need He whistled and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket and that was how Tyrion left him

It was bitter cold outside Bundled thickly in his furs Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander’s Keep He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King’s Tower walking as briskly as his legs could manage Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night’s crust and his breath steamed before him like a banner He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire

Behind the King’s Tower the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon immense and mysterious Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it His legs ached of cold and haste

Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him a yearning to look once more off the end of the world It would be his last chance he thought tomorrow he would ride south and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation The King’s Tower was before him with its promise of warmth and a soft bed yet Tyrion found himself walking past it toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall

A wooden stair ascended the south face anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place Back and forth it switched clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked but Tyrion’s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent He went instead to the iron cage beside the well clambered inside and yanked hard on the bell rope three quick pulls

He had to wait what seemed an eternity standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend

He moved upward slowly by fits and starts at first then more smoothly The ground fell away beneath him the cage swung and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves Morrec had a fire burning in his room he noted with approval but the Lord Commander’s tower was dark The Old Bear had more sense than he did it seemed
