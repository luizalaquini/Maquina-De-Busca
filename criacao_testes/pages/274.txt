1017 And when it was told David he gathered all Israel together and
passed over Jordan and came to Helam And the Syrians set themselves
in array against David and fought with him

1018 And the Syrians fled before Israel and David slew the men of
seven hundred chariots of the Syrians and forty thousand horsemen
and smote Shobach the captain of their host who died there

1019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that
they were smitten before Israel they made peace with Israel and
served them So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any
more

111 And it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when
kings go forth to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with
him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and
besieged Rabbah But David tarried still at Jerusalem

112 And it came to pass in an eveningtide that David arose from off
his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the
roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful
to look upon

113 And David sent and enquired after the woman And one said Is not
this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife of Uriah the Hittite
114 And David sent messengers and took her and she came in unto
him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness
and she returned unto her house

115 And the woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am
with child

116 And David sent to Joab saying Send me Uriah the Hittite And
Joab sent Uriah to David

117 And when Uriah was come unto him David demanded of him how Joab
did and how the people did and how the war prospered

118 And David said to Uriah Go down to thy house and wash thy feet
And Uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a
mess of meat from the king

119 But Uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the
servants of his lord and went not down to his house

1110 And when they had told David saying Uriah went not down unto
his house David said unto Uriah Camest thou not from thy journey
why then didst thou not go down unto thine house  1111 And Uriah
said unto David The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents and
my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open
fields shall I then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to
lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth I will not
do this thing

1112 And David said to Uriah Tarry here to day also and to morrow I
will let thee depart So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the
morrow

1113 And when David had called him he did eat and drink before him
and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with
the servants of his lord but went not down to his house

1114 And it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to
Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah

1115 And he wrote in the letter saying Set ye Uriah in the
forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may
be smitten and die

1116 And it came to pass when Joab observed the city that he
assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were

1117 And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab and
there fell some of the people of the servants of David and Uriah the
Hittite died also

1118 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war
1119 And charged the messenger saying When thou hast made an end of
telling the matters of the war unto the king 1120 And if so be that
the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee Wherefore approached ye
so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would
shoot from the wall  1121 Who smote Abimelech the son of
Jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him
from the wall that he died in Thebez why went ye nigh the wall then
say thou Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also

1122 So the messenger went and came and shewed David all that Joab
had sent him for

1123 And the messenger said unto David Surely the men prevailed
against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them
even unto the entering of the gate

1124 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and
some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also

1125 Then David said unto the messenger Thus shalt thou say unto
Joab Let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one
as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and
