2010 But when the first came they supposed that they should have
received more and they likewise received every man a penny

2011 And when they had received it they murmured against the goodman
of the house 2012 Saying These last have wrought but one hour and
thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and
heat of the day

2013 But he answered one of them and said Friend I do thee no
wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny  2014 Take that
thine is and go thy way I will give unto this last even as unto
thee

2015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own Is
thine eye evil because I am good  2016 So the last shall be first
and the first last for many be called but few chosen

2017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
in the way and said unto them 2018 Behold we go up to Jerusalem
and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto
the scribes and they shall condemn him to death 2019 And shall
deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify
him and the third day he shall rise again

2020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons
worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him

2021 And he said unto her What wilt thou She saith unto him Grant
that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the
other on the left in thy kingdom

2022 But Jesus answered and said Ye know not what ye ask Are ye
able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with They say unto him We are
able

2023 And he saith unto them Ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my
right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepared of my Father

2024 And when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation
against the two brethren

2025 But Jesus called them unto him and said Ye know that the
princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are
great exercise authority upon them

2026 But it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great
among you let him be your minister 2027 And whosoever will be chief
among you let him be your servant 2028 Even as the Son of man came
not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a
ransom for many

2029 And as they departed from Jericho a great multitude followed
him

2030 And behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they
heard that Jesus passed by cried out saying Have mercy on us O
Lord thou son of David

2031 And the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their
peace but they cried the more saying Have mercy on us O Lord thou
son of David

2032 And Jesus stood still and called them and said What will ye
that I shall do unto you  2033 They say unto him Lord that our
eyes may be opened

2034 So Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and
immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him

211 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to
Bethphage unto the mount of Olives then sent Jesus two disciples
212 Saying unto them Go into the village over against you and
straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose
them and bring them unto me

213 And if any man say ought unto you ye shall say The Lord hath
need of them and straightway he will send them

214 All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet saying 215 Tell ye the daughter of Sion Behold thy
King cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the
foal of an ass

216 And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them 217 And
brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they
set him thereon

218 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way
others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way

219 And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried
saying Hosanna to the son of David Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest

2110 And when he was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved
saying Who is this  2111 And the multitude said This is Jesus the
