Savages lowlander Conn might have been handsome if you washed him We are free men and free men by rights sit on all war councils

Which one is the lion lord Chella asked

They are both old men announced Timett son of Timett who had yet to see his twentieth year

Ser Kevan’s hand went to his sword hilt but his brother placed two fingers on his wrist and held him fast Lord Tywin seemed unperturbed Tyrion have you forgotten your courtesies Kindly acquaint us with our… honored guests

Tyrion licked his fingers With pleasure he said The fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears

I’m no maid Chella protested My sons have taken fifty ears among them

May they take fifty more Tyrion waddled away from her This is Conn son of Coratt Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair They are Stone Crows Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers and here Timett son of Timett a red hand of the Burned Men And this is Bronn a sellsword of no particular allegiance He has already changed sides twice in the short time I’ve known him you and he ought to get on famously Father To Bronn and the clansmen he said May I present my lord father Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock Warden of the West Shield of Lannisport and once and future Hand of the King

Lord Tywin rose dignified and correct Even in the west we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon What brings you down from your strongholds my lords

Horses said Shagga

A promise of silk and steel said Timett son of Timett

Tyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland but he was never given the chance The door banged open again The messenger gave Tyrion’s clansmen a quick queer look as he dropped to one knee before Lord Tywin My lord he said Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway

Lord Tywin Lannister did not smile Lord Tywin never smiled but Tyrion had learned to read his father’s pleasure all the same and it was there on his face So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions he said in a voice of quiet satisfaction Splendid Return to Ser Addam and tell him to fall back He is not to engage the northerners until we arrive but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south

It will be as you command The rider took his leave

We are well situated here Ser Kevan pointed out Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes If they are coming south I say let them come and break themselves against us

The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers Lord Tywin replied The sooner the Starks are broken the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon Tell the drummers to beat assembly and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark

As you will Ser Kevan said

Tyrion watched with a grim fascination as his lord father turned next to the half-wild clansmen It is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear

It is said truly Conn of the Stone Crows answered

And the women Chella added

Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more Lord Tywin told them

Would you pay us with our own coin Ulf son of Umar said Why should we need the father’s promise when we have the son’s

I said nothing of need Lord Tywin replied My words were courtesy nothing more You need not join us The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice and even my boldest knights fear to face them

Oh deftly done Tyrion thought smiling crookedly

The Burned Men fear nothing Timett son of Timett will ride with the lions

Wherever the Burned Men go the Stone Crows have been there first Conn declared hotly We ride as well

Shagga son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed them to the crows

We will ride with you lion lord Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed but only if your halfman son goes with us He has bought his breath with promises Until we hold the steel he has pledged us his life is ours

Lord Tywin turned his gold-flecked eyes on his son

Joy Tyrion said with a resigned smile





SANSA

The walls of the throne room had been stripped bare the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap

Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard Sansa hovered by the door for once unguarded The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good yet even so she was escorted everywhere she went Honor guards for my daughter-to-be the queen called them but they did not make Sansa feel honored

Freedom of the castle meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give She couldn’t have gone beyond the walls anyway The gates were watched day and night by Janos Slynt’s gold cloaks and Lannister house guards were always about as well Besides even if she could leave the castle where would she go It was enough that she could walk in the yard pick flowers in Myrcella’s garden and visit the sept to pray for her father Sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well since the Starks kept the old gods

This was the first court session of Joffrey’s reign so Sansa looked about nervously A line of Lannister house guards stood beneath the western windows a line of gold-cloaked City Watchmen beneath the east Of smallfolk and commoners she saw no sign but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly There were no more than twenty where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon King Robert

Sansa slipped in among them murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho gloomy Ser Aron Santagar the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber… only none of them seemed to recognize her Or if they did they shied away as if she had the grey plague Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away

And so many others were missing Where had the rest of them gone Sansa wondered Vainly she searched for friendly faces Not one of them would meet her eyes It was as if she had become a ghost dead before her time

Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table seemingly asleep his hands clasped together atop his beard She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall his feet making no sound A moment later Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear smiling He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa’s stomach I shouldn’t be afraid she told herself I have nothing to be afraid of it will all come out well Joff loves me and the queen does too she said so

A herald’s voice rang out All hail His Grace Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister the First of his Name King of the Andals the Rhoynar and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms All hail his lady mother Cersei of House Lannister Queen Regent Light of the West and Protector of the Realm

Ser Barristan Selmy resplendent in white plate led them in Ser Arys Oakheart escorted the queen while Ser Boros Blount walked beside Joffrey so six of the Kingsguard were now in the hall all the White Swords save Jaime Lannister alone Her prince—no her king now—took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time while his mother was seated with the council Joff wore plush black velvets slashed with crimson a shimmering cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar and on his head a golden crown crusted with rubies and black diamonds

When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall his eye caught Sansa’s He smiled seated himself and spoke It is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true Grand Maester Pycelle I command you to read my decrees

Pycelle pushed himself to his feet He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet with an ermine collar and shiny gold fastenings From a drooping sleeve heavy with gilded scrollwork he drew a parchment unrolled it and began to read a long list of names commanding each in the name of king and council to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey Failing that they would be adjudged traitors their lands and titles forfeit to the throne

The names he read made Sansa hold her breath Lord Stannis Baratheon his lady wife his daughter Lord Renly Baratheon Both Lord Royces and their sons Ser Loras Tyrell Lord Mace Tyrell his brothers uncles sons The red priest Thoros of Myr Lord Beric Dondarrion Lady Lysa Arryn and her son the little Lord Robert Lord Hoster Tully his brother Ser Brynden his son Ser Edmure Lord Jason Mallister Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches Lord Tytos Blackwood Lord Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stevron Lord Karyl Vance Lord Jonos Bracken Lady Sheila Whent Doran Martell Prince of Dorne and all his sons So many she thought as Pycelle read on and on it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands

And at the end near last came the names Sansa had been dreading Lady Catelyn Stark Robb Stark Brandon Stark Rickon Stark Arya Stark Sansa stifled a gasp Arya They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath… it must mean her sister had fled on the galley she must be safe at Winterfell by now…

Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list tucked it up his left sleeve and pulled another parchment from his right He cleared his throat and resumed In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West take up the office of Hand of the King to speak with his voice lead his armies against his enemies and carry out his royal will So the king has decreed The small council consents

In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister who has ever been his staunchest support be seated upon his small council that she may help him rule wisely and with justice So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her but it was quickly stilled Pycelle continued

It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt Commander of the City Watch of King’s Landing be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council to assist in the governance of the realm So the king has decreed The small council consents

Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance This time the muttering was louder and angrier Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding frog-faced commoner as he marched past Golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step His cloak was checked black-and-gold satin Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear gold on a night-black field The sight of it raised goose prickles up and down Sansa’s arms
