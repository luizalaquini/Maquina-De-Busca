Then he saw it a shadow in the shadows sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont’s sleeping cell a man-shape all in black cloaked and hooded… but beneath the hood its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance…

Ghost leapt Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl rolling smashing into a chair knocking over a table laden with papers Mormont’s raven was flapping overhead screaming Corn corn corn corn Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon Keeping the wall to his back he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain Moonlight flooded the solar He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf’s throat Ghost was twisting and snapping legs flailing in the air but he could not break free

Jon had no time to be afraid He threw himself forward shouting bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone yet the sound was wrong somehow The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged He saw arm and hand on the floor black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away red tongue lolling from his mouth

The hooded man lifted his pale moon face and Jon slashed at it without hesitation The sword laid the intruder open to the bone taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes eyes eyes like blue stars burning Jon knew that face Othor he thought reeling back Gods he’s dead he’s dead I saw him dead

He felt something scrabble at his ankle Black fingers clawed at his calf The arm was crawling up his leg ripping at wool and flesh Shouting with revulsion Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away It lay writhing fingers opening and closing

The corpse lurched forward There was no blood One-armed face cut near in half it seemed to feel nothing Jon held the longsword before him Stay away he commanded his voice gone shrill Corn screamed the raven corn corn The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve a pale snake with a black five-fingered head Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth Finger bones crunched Jon hacked at the corpse’s neck felt the steel bite deep and hard

Dead Othor slammed into him knocking him off his feet

Jon’s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades The sword where was the sword He’d lost the damned sword When he opened his mouth to scream the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon’s mouth Gagging he tried to shove it off but the dead man was too heavy Its hand forced itself farther down his throat icy cold choking him Its face was against his own filling the world Frost covered its eyes sparkling blue Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing’s legs He tried to bite tried to punch tried to breathe…

And suddenly the corpse’s weight was gone its fingers ripped from his throat It was all Jon could do to roll over retching and shaking

Ghost had it again He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight’s gut and began to rip and tear He watched only half conscious for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword…

… and saw Lord Mormont naked and groggy from sleep standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand Gnawed and fingerless the arm thrashed on the floor wriggling toward him

Jon tried to shout but his voice was gone Staggering to his feet he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear’s fingers The flame flickered and almost died Burn the raven cawed Burn burn burn

Spinning Jon saw the drapes he’d ripped from the window He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands Metal crunched glass shattered oil spewed and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known Ghost he shouted

The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly Jon plunged his hand into the flames grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes and whipped them at the dead man Let it burn he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse gods please please let it burn





BRAN

The Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from their castle at Karhold The steel points of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as the column approached A man went before them pounding out a slow deep-throated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than he was boom boom boom

Bran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall peering through Maester Luwin’s bronze far-eye while perched on Hodor’s shoulders Lord Rickard himself led them his sons Harrion and Eddard and Torrhen riding beside him beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of their House Old Nan said they had Stark blood in them going back hundreds of years but they did not look like Starks to Bran They were big men and fierce faces covered with thick beards hair worn loose past the shoulders Their cloaks were made of skins the pelts of bear and seal and wolf

They were the last he knew The other lords were already here with their hosts Bran yearned to ride out among them to see the winter houses full to bursting the jostling crowds in the market square every morning the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle We have no men to spare to guard you his brother had explained

I’ll take Summer Bran argued

Don’t act the boy with me Bran Robb said You know better than that Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton’s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn’s at the Smoking Log Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when he said it Bran knew that meant there was no appeal

It was because of what had happened in the wolfswood he knew The memory still gave him bad dreams He had been as helpless as a baby no more able to defend himself than Rickon would have been Less even… Rickon would have kicked them at the least It shamed him He was only a few years younger than Robb if his brother was almost a man grown so was he He should have been able to protect himself

A year ago before he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the walls by himself In those days he could run down stairs get on and off his pony by himself and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt Now he could only watch peering out through Maester Luwin’s lens tube The maester had taught him all the banners the mailed fist of the Glovers silver on scarlet Lady Mormont’s black bear the hideous flayed man that went before Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort a bull moose for the Hornwoods a battle-axe for the Cerwyns three sentinel trees for the Tallharts and the fearsome sigil of House Umber a roaring giant in shattered chains

And soon enough he learned the faces too when the lords and their sons and knights retainer came to Winterfell to feast Even the Great Hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once so Robb hosted each of the principal bannermen in turn Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother’s right hand Some of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there as if they wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them and him a cripple too

How many is it now Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his sons rode through the gates in the outer wall

Twelve thousand men or near enough as makes no matter

How many knights

Few enough the maester said with a touch of impatience To be a knight you must stand your vigil in a sept and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows In the north only a few of the great houses worship the Seven The rest honor the old gods and name no knights… but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable A man’s worth is not marked by a ser before his name As I have told you a hundred times before

Still said Bran how many knights

Maester Luwin sighed Three hundred perhaps four… among three thousand armored lances who are not knights

Lord Karstark is the last Bran said thoughtfully Robb will feast him tonight

No doubt he will

How long before… before they go

He must march soon or not at all Maester Luwin said The winter town is full to bursting and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint The fighting has begun in the riverlands and your brother has many leagues to go

I know Bran felt as miserable as he sounded He handed the bronze tube back to the maester and noticed how thin Luwin’s hair had grown on top He could see the pink of scalp showing through It felt queer to look down on him this way when he’d spent his whole life looking up at him but when you sat on Hodor’s back you looked down on everyone I don’t want to watch anymore Hodor take me back to the keep

Hodor said Hodor

Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve Bran your lord brother will not have time to see you now He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome

I won’t trouble Robb I want to visit the godswood He put his hand on Hodor’s shoulder Hodor

A series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower’s inner wall Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for him Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran’s weight more evenly It was not as good as riding Dancer but there were places Dancer could not go and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby Hodor seemed to like it too though with Hodor it was hard to tell The only tricky part was doors Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back and that could be painful when he went through a door

For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them even in the dead of night A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower Karstark men following their lords into the castle They wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst Hodor trotted along beside them smiling to himself his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge The riders gave them queer looks as they went by and once Bran heard someone guffaw He refused to let it trouble him Men will look at you Maester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor’s chest They will look and they will talk and some will mock you Let them mock Bran thought No one mocked him in his bedchamber but he would not live his life in bed

As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled Summer came loping across the yard Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay One stallion reared screaming his rider cursing and hanging on desperately The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it but they’d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone The godswood Bran reminded Hodor

Even Winterfell itself was crowded The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe the rumble of wagons and the barking of dogs The armory doors were open and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his years not even when King Robert had come to visit Father

He tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door They walked down a long dim hallway Summer padding easily beside them The wolf glanced up from time to time eyes smoldering like liquid gold Bran would have liked to touch him but he was riding too high for his hand to reach

The godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become Hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels to the still pool beside the heart tree He stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood humming Bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out of his seat drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker basket He hung for a moment dangling the dark red leaves brushing against his face until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water I want to be by myself for a while he said You go soak Go to the pools

Hodor Hodor stomped through the trees and vanished Across the godswood beneath the windows of the Guest House an underground hot spring fed three small ponds Steam rose from the water day and night and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss Hodor hated cold water and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface

Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran’s side He rubbed the wolf under the jaw and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace Bran had always liked the godswood even before but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him yet somehow he took comfort from that now The gods were looking over him he told himself the old gods gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest his father’s gods He felt safe in their sight and the deep silence of the trees helped him think Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall thinking and dreaming and talking with the gods

Please make it so Robb won’t go away he prayed softly He moved his hand through the cold water sending ripples across the pool Please make him stay Or if he has to go bring him home safe with Mother and Father and the girls And make it… make it so Rickon understands

His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was riding off to war weeping and angry by turns He’d refused to eat cried and screamed for most of a night even punched Old Nan when she tried to sing him to sleep and the next day he’d vanished Robb had set half the castle searching for him and when at last they’d found him down in the crypts Rickon had slashed at them with a rusted iron sword he’d snatched from a dead king’s hand and Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon The wolf was near as wild as Rickon he’d bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken’s thigh It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring him to bay Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now and Rickon cried all the more for being without him

Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell and Bran pleaded with him too for his own sake as much as Rickon’s but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said I don’t want to go I have to
