It was meant as a slight Cersei said

Shall we raise a cup to brotherly love

Yes she answered breathless Oh gods yes

His back was to her as he filled two cups with sweet Arbor red It was the easiest thing in the world to sprinkle a pinch of fine powder into hers To Stannis he said as he handed her the wine Harmless when I’m alone am I

To Renly she replied laughing May they battle long and hard and the Others take them both

Is this the Cersei that Jaime sees When she smiled you saw how beautiful she was truly I loved a maid as fair as summer with sunlight in her hair He almost felt sorry for poisoning her

It was the next morning as he broke his fast that her messenger arrived The queen was indisposed and would not be able to leave her chambers Not able to leave her privy more like Tyrion made the proper sympathetic noises and sent word to Cersei to rest easy he would treat with Ser Cleos as they’d planned

The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably and the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be Yet there was one thing to be said for it It was high

Lannister guardsmen stood silent in their crimson cloaks and lioncrested halfhelms Ser Jacelyn’s gold cloaks faced them across the hall The steps to the throne were flanked by Bronn and Ser Preston of the Kingsguard Courtiers filled the gallery while supplicants clustered near the towering oak-and-bronze doors Sansa Stark looked especially lovely this morning though her face was as pale as milk Lord Gyles stood coughing while poor cousin Tyrek wore his bridegroom’s mantle of miniver and velvet Since his marriage to little Lady Ermesande three days past the other squires had taken to calling him Wet Nurse and asking him what sort of swaddling clothes his bride wore on their wedding night

Tyrion looked down on them all and found he liked it Call forth Ser Cleos Frey His voice rang off the stone walls and down the length of the hall He liked that too A pity Shae could not be here to see this he reflected She’d asked to come but it was impossible

Ser Cleos made the long walk between the gold cloaks and the crimson looking neither right nor left As he knelt Tyrion observed that his cousin was losing his hair

Ser Cleos Littlefinger said from the council table you have our thanks for bringing us this peace offer from Lord Stark

Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat The Queen Regent the King’s Hand and the small council have considered the terms offered by this self-styled King in the North Sad to say they will not do and you must tell these northmen so ser

Here are our terms said Tyrion Robb Stark must lay down his sword swear fealty and return to Winterfell He must free my brother unharmed and place his host under Jaime’s command to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis Baratheon Each of Stark’s bannermen must send us a son as hostage A daughter will suffice where there is no son They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court so long as their fathers commit no new treasons

Cleos Frey looked ill My lord Hand he said Lord Stark will never consent to these terms

We never expected he would Cleos Tell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east Tell him that he stands alone without hope of allies Stannis and Renly Baratheon war against each other and the Prince of Dorne has consented to wed his son Trystane to the Princess Myrcella Murmurs of delight and consternation alike arose from the gallery and the back of the hall

As to this of my cousins Tyrion went on we offer Harrion Karstark and Ser Wylis Manderly for Willem Lannister and Lord Cerwyn and Ser Donnel Locke for your brother Tion Tell Stark that two Lannisters are worth four northmen in any season He waited for the laughter to die His father’s bones he shall have as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith

Lord Stark asked for his sisters and his father’s sword as well Ser Cleos reminded him

Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute the hilt of Eddard Stark’s greatsword rising over one shoulder Ice said Tyrion He’ll have that when he makes his peace with us not before

As you say And his sisters

Tyrion glanced toward Sansa and felt a stab of pity as he said Until such time as he frees my brother Jaime unharmed they shall remain here as hostages How well they are treated depends on him And if the gods are good Bywater will find Arya alive before Robb learns she’s gone missing

I shall bring him your message my lord

Tyrion plucked at one of the twisted blades that sprang from the arm of the throne And now the thrust Vylarr he called

My lord

The men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddard’s bones but a Lannister should have a Lannister escort Tyrion declared Ser Cleos is the queen’s cousin and mine We shall sleep more easily if you would see him safely back to Riverrun

As you command How many men should I take

Why all of them
