Their palanquin was stopped at the gate the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied He looked them over coldly Magister Illyrio growled something to him in the rough Dothraki tongue the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates

Dany noticed that her brother’s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword He looked almost as frightened as she felt Insolent eunuch Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse

Magister Illyrio’s words were honey Many important men will be at the feast tonight Such men have enemies The khal must protect his guests yourself chief among them Your Grace No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head

Oh yes Viserys said darkly He has tried Illyrio I promise you that His hired knives follow us everywhere I am the last dragon and he will not sleep easy while I live

The palanquin slowed and stopped The curtains were thrown back and a slave offered a hand to help Daenerys out His collar she noted was ordinary bronze Her brother followed one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet

Inside the manse the air was heavy with the scent of spices pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon They were escorted across the entry hall where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves a eunuch sang their coming Viserys of the House Targaryen the Third of his Name he called in a high sweet voice King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm His sister Daenerys Stormborn Princess of Dragonstone His honorable host Illyrio Mopatis Magister of the Free City of Pentos

They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them Many were Dothraki horselords big men with red-brown skin their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh a red priest even fatter than Illyrio hairy men from the Port of Ibben and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony Daenerys looked at them all in wonder… and realized with a sudden start of fear that she was the only woman there

Illyrio whispered to them Those three are Drogo’s bloodriders there he said By the pillar is Khal Moro with his son Rhogoro The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont

The last name caught Daenerys A knight

No less Illyrio smiled through his beard Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself

What is he doing here she blurted

The Usurper wanted his head Illyrio told them Some trifling affront He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night’s Watch Absurd law A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel

I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done her brother said Dany found herself looking at the knight curiously He was an older man past forty and balding but still strong and fit Instead of silks and cottons he wore wool and leather His tunic was a dark green embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs

She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder Over there sweet princess he whispered there is the khal himself

Dany wanted to run and hide but her brother was looking at her and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon Anxiously she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done

The slave girl had not been far wrong she thought Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room yet somehow light on his feet as graceful as the panther in Illyrio’s menagerie He was younger than she’d thought no more than thirty His skin was the color of polished copper his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings

I must go and make my submissions Magister Illyrio said Wait here I shall bring him to you

Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt Do you see his braid sweet sister

Drogo’s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved It swung well past his belt below even his buttocks the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs

You see how long it is Viserys said When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braids in disgrace so the world will know their shame Khal Drogo has never lost a fight He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again and you will be his queen

Dany looked at Khal Drogo His face was hard and cruel his eyes as cold and dark as onyx Her brother hurt her sometimes when she woke the dragon but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her I don’t want to be his queen she heard herself say in a small thin voice Please please Viserys I don’t want to I want to go home

Home He kept his voice low but she could hear the fury in his tone How are we to go home sweet sister They took our home from us He drew her into the shadows out of sight his fingers digging into her skin How are we to go home he repeated meaning King’s Landing and Dragonstone and all the realm they had lost

Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio’s estate no true home surely though all they had but her brother did not want to hear that There was no home there for him Even the big house with the red door had not been home for him His fingers dug hard into her arm demanding an answer I don’t know…she said at last her voice breaking Tears welled in her eyes

I do he said sharply We go home with an army sweet sister With Khal Drogo’s army that is how we go home And if you must wed him and bed him for that you will He smiled at her I’d let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be sweet sister all forty thousand men and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army Be grateful it is only Drogo In time you may even learn to like him Now dry your eyes Illyrio is bringing him over and he will not see you crying

Dany turned and saw that it was true Magister Illyrio all smiles and bows was escorting Khal Drogo over to where they stood She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand

Smile Viserys whispered nervously his hand failing to the hilt of his sword And stand up straight Let him see that you have breasts Gods know you have little enough as is

Daenerys smiled and stood up straight
