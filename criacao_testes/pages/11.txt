in a good old age

1516 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for
the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full

1517 And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was
dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces

1518 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram saying
Unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the
great river the river Euphrates 1519 The Kenites and the
Kenizzites and the Kadmonites 1520 And the Hittites and the
Perizzites and the Rephaims 1521 And the Amorites and the
Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites

161 Now Sarai Abrams wife bare him no children and she had an
handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar

162 And Sarai said unto Abram Behold now the LORD hath restrained
me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may
obtain children by her And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai

163 And Sarai Abrams wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her
husband Abram to be his wife

164 And he went in unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw
that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes

165 And Sarai said unto Abram My wrong be upon thee I have given my
maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was
despised in her eyes the LORD judge between me and thee

166 But Abram said unto Sarai Behold thy maid is in thine hand do
to her as it pleaseth thee And when Sarai dealt hardly with her she
fled from her face

167 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shur

168 And he said Hagar Sarais maid whence camest thou and whither
wilt thou go And she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai

169 And the angel of the LORD said unto her Return to thy mistress
and submit thyself under her hands

1610 And the angel of the LORD said unto her I will multiply thy
seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude

1611 And the angel of the LORD said unto her Behold thou art with
child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael because
the LORD hath heard thy affliction

1612 And he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man
and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren

1613 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her Thou
God seest me for she said Have I also here looked after him that
seeth me  1614 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi behold
it is between Kadesh and Bered

1615 And Hagar bare Abram a son and Abram called his sons name
which Hagar bare Ishmael

1616 And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bare
Ishmael to Abram

171 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine the LORD appeared
to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me
and be thou perfect

172 And I will make my covenant between me and thee and will
multiply thee exceedingly

173 And Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying 174
As for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a
father of many nations

175 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name
shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee

176 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations
of thee and kings shall come out of thee

177 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a
God unto thee and to thy seed after thee

178 And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land
wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an
everlasting possession and I will be their God

179 And God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore
thou and thy seed after thee in their generations

1710 This is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and
thy seed after thee Every man child among you shall be circumcised
