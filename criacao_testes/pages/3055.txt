466 Let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they
shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates

467 Who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as
the rivers  468 Egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are
moved like the rivers and he saith I will go up and will cover the
earth I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof

469 Come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men
come forth the Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield
and the Lydians that handle and bend the bow

4610 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts a day of
vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword
shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood
for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the
river Euphrates

4611 Go up into Gilead and take balm O virgin the daughter of
Egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be
cured

4612 The nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the
land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they
are fallen both together

4613 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet how
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of
Egypt

4614 Declare ye in Egypt and publish in Migdol and publish in Noph
and in Tahpanhes say ye Stand fast and prepare thee for the sword
shall devour round about thee

4615 Why are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the
LORD did drive them

4616 He made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said
Arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our
nativity from the oppressing sword

4617 They did cry there Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise he
hath passed the time appointed

4618 As I live saith the King whose name is the LORD of hosts
Surely as Tabor is among the mountains and as Carmel by the sea so
shall he come

4619 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt furnish thyself to go into
captivity for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant

4620 Egypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it
cometh out of the north

4621 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks
for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did
not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and
the time of their visitation

4622 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march
with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood

4623 They shall cut down her forest saith the LORD though it cannot
be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are
innumerable

4624 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded she shall be
delivered into the hand of the people of the north

4625 The LORD of hosts the God of Israel saith Behold I will
punish the multitude of No and Pharaoh and Egypt with their gods
and their kings even Pharaoh and all them that trust in him 4626
And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives
and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand
of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days
of old saith the LORD

4627 But fear not thou O my servant Jacob and be not dismayed O
Israel for behold I will save thee from afar off and thy seed from
the land of their captivity and Jacob shall return and be in rest
and at ease and none shall make him afraid

4628 Fear thou not O Jacob my servant saith the LORD for I am with
thee for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have
driven thee but I will not make a full end of thee but correct thee
in measure yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished

471 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
the Philistines before that Pharaoh smote Gaza

472 Thus saith the LORD Behold waters rise up out of the north and
shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all
that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men
shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl

473 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses
at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the
fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands
474 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines and
to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth for the
