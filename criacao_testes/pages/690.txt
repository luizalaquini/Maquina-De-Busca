I carried a calf once was heavier than him I carried him down to his mother so he could get a drink of milk

Sam’s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took Stop it he muttered put me down I’m not a baby I’m a man of the Night’s Watch He sobbed Just let me die

Be quiet Sam said Grenn Save your strength Think about your sisters and brother Maester Aemon Your favorite foods Sing a song if you like

Aloud

In your head

Sam knew a hundred songs but when he tried to think of one he couldn’t The words had all gone from his head He sobbed again and said I don’t know any songs Grenn I did know some but now I don’t

Yes you do said Grenn How about ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ everybody knows that one A bear there was a bear a bear All black and brown and covered with hair

No not that one Sam pleaded The bear that had come up the Fist had no hair left on its rotted flesh He didn’t want to think about bears No songs Please Grenn

Think about your ravens then

They were never mine They were the Lord Commander’s ravens the ravens of the Night’s Watch They belonged to Castle Black and the Shadow Tower

Small Paul frowned Chett said I could have the Old Bear’s raven the one that talks I saved food for it and everything He shook his head I forgot though I left the food where I hid it He plodded onward pale white breath coming from his mouth with every step then suddenly said Could I have one of your ravens Just the one I’d never let Lark eat it

They’re gone said Sam I’m sorry So sorry They’re flying back to the Wall now He had set the birds free when he’d heard the warhorns sound once more calling the Watch to horse Two short blasts and a long one that was the call to mount up But there was no reason to mount unless to abandon the Fist and that meant the battle was lost The fear bit him so strong then that it was all Sam could do to open the cages Only as he watched the last raven flap up into the snowstorm did he realize that he had forgotten to send any of the messages he’d written

No he’d squealed oh no oh no The snow fell and the horns blew ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo they cried to horse to horse to horse Sam saw two ravens perched on a rock and ran after them but the birds flapped off lazily through the swirling snow in opposite directions He chased one his breath puffing out his nose in thick white clouds stumbled and found himself ten feet from the ringwall

After that… he remembered the dead coming over the stones with arrows in their faces and through their throats Some were all in ringmail and some were almost naked… wildlings most of them but a few wore faded blacks He remembered one of the Shadow Tower men shoving his spear through a wight’s pale soft belly and out his back and how the thing staggered right up the shaft and reached out his black hands and twisted the brother’s head around until blood came out his mouth That was when his bladder let go the first time he was almost sure

He did not remember running but he must have because the next he knew he was near the fire half a camp away with old Ser Ottyn Wythers and some archers Ser Ottyn was on his knees in the snow staring at the chaos around them until a riderless horse came by and kicked him in the face The archers paid him no mind They were loosing fire arrows at shadows in the dark Sam saw one wight hit saw the flames engulf it but there were a dozen more behind it and a huge pale shape that must have been the bear and soon enough the bowmen had no arrows

And then Sam found himself on a horse It wasn’t his own horse and he never recalled mounting up either Maybe it was the horse that had smashed Ser Ottyn’s face in The horns were still blowing so he kicked the horse and turned him toward the sound

In the midst of carnage and chaos and blowing snow he found Dolorous Edd sitting on his garron with a plain black banner on a spear Sam Edd said when he saw him would you wake me please I am having this terrible nightmare

More men were mounting up every moment The warhorns called them back Ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo They’re over the west wall m’lord Thoren Smallwood screamed at the Old Bear as he fought to control his horse I’ll send reserves…

NO Mormont had to bellow at the top of his lungs to be heard over the horns Call them back we have to cut our way out He stood in his stirrups his black cloak snapping in the wind the fire shining off his armor Spearhead he roared Form wedge we ride Down the south face then east

My lord the south slope’s crawling with them

The others are too steep Mormont said We have—

His garron screamed and reared and almost threw him as the bear came staggering through the snow Sam pissed himself all over again I didn’t think I had any more left inside me The bear was dead pale and rotting its fur and skin all sloughed off and half its right arm burned to bone yet still it came on Only its eyes lived Bright blue just as Jon said They shone like frozen stars Thoren Smallwood charged his longsword shining all orange and red from the light of the fire His swing near took the bear’s head off And then the bear took his

RIDE the Lord Commander shouted wheeling

They were at the gallop by the time they reached the ring Sam had always been too frightened to jump a horse before but when the low stone wall loomed up before him he knew he had no choice He kicked and closed his eyes and whimpered and the garron took him over somehow somehow the garron took him over The rider to his right came crashing down in a tangle of steel and leather and screaming horseflesh and then the wights were swarming over him and the wedge was closing up They plunged down the hillside at a run through clutching black hands and burning blue eyes and blowing snow Horses stumbled and rolled men were swept from their saddles torches spun through the air axes and swords hacked at dead flesh and Samwell Tarly sobbed clutching desperately to his horse with a strength he never knew he had

He was in the middle of the flying spearhead with brothers on either side and before and behind him as well A dog ran with them for a ways bounding down the snowy slope and in and out among the horses but it could not keep up The wights stood their ground and were ridden down and trampled underhoof Even as they fell they clutched at swords and stirrups and the legs of passing horses Sam saw one claw open a garron’s belly with its right hand while it clung to the saddle with its left

Suddenly the trees were all about them and Sam was splashing through a frozen stream with the sounds of slaughter dwindling behind He turned breathless with relief… until a man in black leapt from the brush and yanked him out of the saddle Who he was Sam never saw he was up in an instant and galloping away the next When he tried to run after the horse his feet tangled in a root and he fell hard on his face and lay weeping like a baby until Dolorous Edd found him there

That was his last coherent memory of the Fist of the First Men Later hours later he stood shivering among the other survivors half mounted and half afoot They were miles from the Fist by then though Sam did not remember how Dywen had led down five packhorses heavy laden with food and oil and torches and three had made it this far The Old Bear made them redistribute the loads so the loss of any one horse and its provisions would not be such a catastrophe He took garrons from the healthy men and gave them to the wounded organized the walkers and set torches to guard their flanks and rear All I need do is walk Sam told himself as he took that first step toward home But before an hour was gone he had begun to struggle and to lag…
