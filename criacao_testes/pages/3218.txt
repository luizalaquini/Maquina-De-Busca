153 He hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath
sent empty away

154 He hath holpen his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy
155 As he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed for ever

156 And Mary abode with her about three months and returned to her
own house

157 Now Elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and
she brought forth a son

158 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her

159 And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child and they called him Zacharias after the name of
his father

160 And his mother answered and said Not so but he shall be called
John

161 And they said unto her There is none of thy kindred that is
called by this name

162 And they made signs to his father how he would have him called

163 And he asked for a writing table and wrote saying His name is
John And they marvelled all

164 And his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and
he spake and praised God

165 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these
sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea

166 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts
saying What manner of child shall this be And the hand of the Lord
was with him

167 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and
prophesied saying 168 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he
hath visited and redeemed his people 169 And hath raised up an horn
of salvation for us in the house of his servant David 170 As he
spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the
world began 171 That we should be saved from our enemies and from
the hand of all that hate us 172 To perform the mercy promised to
our fathers and to remember his holy covenant 173 The oath which he
sware to our father Abraham 174 That he would grant unto us that we
being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without
fear 175 In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
our life

176 And thou child shalt be called the prophet of the Highest for
thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways 177 To
give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their
sins 178 Through the tender mercy of our God whereby the dayspring
from on high hath visited us 179 To give light to them that sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of
peace

180 And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the
deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel

21 And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed

22 And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria  23 And all went to be taxed every one into his own city

24 And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
into Judaea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem
because he was of the house and lineage of David 25 To be taxed
with Mary his espoused wife being great with child

26 And so it was that while they were there the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered

27 And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room
for them in the inn

28 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field
keeping watch over their flock by night

29 And lo the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of
the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid

210 And the angel said unto them Fear not for behold I bring you
good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people

211 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour
which is Christ the Lord

212 And this shall be a sign unto you Ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes lying in a manger

213 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God and saying 214 Glory to God in the highest and
