the Mockingjay suit has disappeared In its place is a paper
robe A meal has been sent up from the mysterious kitchen
with a container of my medications for dessert I go ahead
and eat the food take the pills rub the salve on my skin I
need to focus now on the manner of my suicide
I curl back up on the bloodstained mattress not cold
but feeling so naked with just the paper to cover my tender
flesh Jumping to my deaths not an option--the window
glass must be a foot thick I can make an excellent noose
but theres nothing to hang myself from Its possible I could
hoard my pills and then knock myself off with a lethal dose
except that Im sure Im being watched round the clock For
all I know Im on live television at this very moment while
commentators try to analyze what could possibly have
motivated me to kill Coin The surveillance makes almost
any suicide attempt impossible Taking my life is the
Capitols privilege Again
What I can do is give up I resolve to lie on the bed
without eating drinking or taking my medications I could
do it too Just die If it werent for the morphling withdrawal
Not bit by bit like in the hospital in 13 but cold turkey I must
have been on a fairly large dose because when the craving
for it hits accompanied by tremors and shooting pains
and unbearable cold my resolves crushed like an eggshell
Im on my knees raking the carpet with my fingernails to
find those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment I
revise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling I will
become a yellow-skinned bag of bones with enormous
eyes Im a couple of days into the plan making good
progress when something unexpected happens
I begin to sing At the window in the shower in my
sleep Hour after hour of ballads love songs mountain airs
All the songs my father taught me before he died for
certainly there has been very little music in my life since
Whats amazing is how clearly I remember them The tunes
the lyrics My voice at first rough and breaking on the high
notes warms up into something splendid A voice that
would make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble over
themselves to join in Days pass weeks I watch the snows
fall on the ledge outside my window And in all that time
mine is the only voice I hear
What are they doing anyway Whats the holdup out
there How difficult can it be to arrange the execution of
one murderous girl I continue with my own annihilation My
bodys thinner than its ever been and my battle against
hunger is so fierce that sometimes the animal part of me
gives in to the temptation of buttered bread or roasted
meat But still Im winning For a few days I feel quite unwell
and think I may finally be traveling out of this life when I
realize my morphling tablets are shrinking They are trying
to slowly wean me off the stuff But why Surely a drugged
Mockingjay will be easier to dispose of in front of a crowd
And then a terrible thought hits me What if theyre not going
to kill me What if they have more plans for me A new way
to remake train and use me
I wont do it If I cant kill myself in this room I will take
the first opportunity outside of it to finish the job They can
fatten me up They can give me a full body polish dress me
up and make me beautiful again They can design dream
weapons that come to life in my hands but they will never
again brainwash me into the necessity of using them I no
longer feel any allegiance to these monsters called human
beings despise being one myself I think that Peeta was
onto something about us destroying one another and letting
some decent species take over Because something is
significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its
childrens lives to settle its differences You can spin it any
way you like Snow thought the Hunger Games were an
efficient means of control Coin thought the parachutes
would expedite the war But in the end who does it benefit
No one The truth is it benefits no one to live in a world
where these things happen
After two days of my lying on my mattress with no
attempt to eat drink or even take a morphling tablet the
door to my room opens Someone crosses around the bed
into my field of vision Haymitch Your trials over he says
Come on Were going home
Home Whats he talking about My homes gone
And even if it were possible to go to this imaginary place I
am too weak to move Strangers appear Rehydrate and
feed me Bathe and clothe me One lifts me like a rag doll
and carries me up to the roof onto a hovercraft and
fastens me into a seat Haymitch and Plutarch sit across
from me In a few moments were airborne
Ive never seen Plutarch in such a good mood Hes
positively glowing You must have a million questions
When I dont respond he answers them anyway
After I shot Coin there was pandemonium When the
ruckus died down they discovered Snows body still
tethered to the post Opinions differ on whether he choked
to death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd No
one really cares An emergency election was thrown
together and Paylor was voted in as president Plutarch
was appointed secretary of communications which means
he sets the programming for the airwaves The first big
televised event was my trial in which he was also a star
witness In my defense of course Although most of the
credit for my exoneration must be given to Dr Aurelius who
apparently earned his naps by presenting me as a
hopeless shell-shocked lunatic One condition for my
