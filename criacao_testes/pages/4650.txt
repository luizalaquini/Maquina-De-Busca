With a smile and swirl of scarlet skirts she was gone Only her scent lingered after That and the torch Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped his arms about his knees The shifting torchlight washed over him Once Melisandre’s footsteps faded away the only sound was the scrabbling of rats Ice and fire he thought Black and white Dark and light Davos could not deny the power of her god He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre’s womb and the priestess knew things she had no way of knowing She saw my purpose in her flames It was good to learn that Salla had not sold him but the thought of the red woman spying out his secrets with her fires disquieted him more than he could say And what did she mean when she said that I had served her god and would serve him again He did not like that either

He lifted his eyes to stare up at the torch He looked for a long time never blinking watching the flames shift and shimmer He tried to see beyond them to peer through the fiery curtain and glimpse whatever lived back there    but there was nothing only fire and after a time his eyes began to water

God-blind and tired Davos curled up on the straw and gave himself to sleep

Three days later—well Porridge had come thrice and Lamprey twice—Davos heard voices outside his cell He sat up at once his back to the stone wall listening to the sounds of struggle This was new a change in his unchanging world The noise was coming from the left where the steps led up to daylight He could hear a man’s voice pleading and shouting

   madness the man was saying as he came into view dragged along between two guardsmen with fiery hearts on their breasts Porridge went before them jangling a ring of keys and Ser Axell Florent walked behind Axell the prisoner said desperately for the love you bear me unhand me You cannot do this I’m no traitor He was an older man tall and slender with silvery grey hair a pointed beard and a long elegant face twisted in fear Where is Selyse where is the queen I demand to see her The Others take you all Release me

The guards paid no mind to his outcries Here Porridge asked in front of the cell Davos got to his feet For an instant he considered trying to rush them when the door was opened but that was madness There were too many the guards wore swords and Porridge was strong as a bull

Ser Axell gave the gaoler a curt nod Let the traitors enjoy each other’s company

I am no traitor screeched the prisoner as Porridge was unlocking the door Though he was plainly dressed in grey wool doublet and black breeches his speech marked him as highborn His birth will not serve him here thought Davos

Porridge swung the bars wide Ser Axell gave a nod and the guards flung their charge in headlong The man stumbled and might have fallen but Davos caught him At once he wrenched away and staggered back toward the door only to have it slammed in his pale pampered face No he shouted Nooooo All the strength suddenly left his legs and he slid slowly to the floor clutching at the iron bars Ser Axell Porridge and the guards had already turned to leave You cannot do this the prisoner shouted at their retreating backs I am the King’s Hand

It was then that Davos knew him You are Alester Florent

The man turned his head Who    

Ser Davos Seaworth

Lord Alester blinked Seaworth    the onion knight You tried to murder Melisandre

Davos did not deny it At Storm’s End you wore red-gold armor with inlaid lapis flowers on your breastplate He reached down a hand to help the other man to his feet

Lord Alester brushed the filthy straw from his clothing I    I must apologize for my appearance ser My chests were lost when the Lannisters overran our camp I escaped with no more than the mail on my back and the rings on my fingers

He still wears those rings noted Davos who had lacked even all of his fingers

No doubt some cook’s boy or groom is prancing around King’s Landing just now in my slashed velvet doublet and jeweled cloak Lord Alester went on oblivious But war has its horrors as all men know No doubt you suffered your own losses

My ship said Davos All my men Four of my sons

May the    may the Lord of Light lead them through the darkness to a better world the other man said

May the Father judge them justly and the Mother grant them mercy Davos thought but he kept his prayer to himself The Seven had no place on Dragonstone now

My own son is safe at Brightwater the lord went on but I lost a nephew on the Fury Ser Imry my brother Ryam’s son

It had been Ser Imry Florent who led them blindly up the Blackwater Rush with all oars pulling paying no heed to the small stone towers at the mouth of the river Davos was not like to forget him My son Maric was your nephew’s oarmaster He remembered his last sight of Fury engulfed in wildfire Has there been any word of survivors

The Fury burned and sank with all hands his lordship said Your son and my nephew were lost with countless other good men The war itself was lost that day ser

This man is defeated Davos remembered Melisandre’s talk of embers in the ashes igniting great blazes Small wonder he ended here His Grace will never yield my lord

Folly that’s folly Lord Alester sat on the floor again as if the effort of standing for a moment had been too much for him Stannis Baratheon will never sit the Iron Throne Is it treason to say the truth A bitter truth but no less true for that His fleet is gone save for the Lyseni and Salladhor Saan will flee at the first sight of a Lannister sail Most of the lords who supported Stannis have gone over to Joffrey or died   

Even the lords of the narrow sea The lords sworn to Dragonstone

Lord Alester waved his hand feebly Lord Celtigar was captured and bent the knee Monford Velaryon died with his ship the red woman burned Sunglass and Lord Bar Emmon is fifteen fat and feeble Those are your lords of the narrow sea Only the strength of House Florent is left to Stannis against all the might of Highgarden Sunspear and Casterly Rock and now most of the storm lords as well The best hope that remains is to try and salvage something with a peace That is all I meant to do Gods be good how can they call it treason

Davos stood frowning My lord what did you do

Not treason Never treason I love His Grace as much as any man My own niece is his queen and I remained loyal to him when wiser men fled I am his Hand the Hand of the King how can I be a traitor I only meant to save our lives and    honor    yes He licked his lips I penned a letter Salladhor Saan swore that he had a man who could get it to King’s Landing to Lord Tywin His lordship is a    a man of reason and my terms    the terms were fair    more than fair

What terms were these my lord

It is filthy here Lord Alester said suddenly And that odor    what is that odor

The pail said Davos gesturing We have no privy here What terms

His lordship stared at the pail in horror That Lord Stannis give up his claim to the Iron Throne and retract all he said of Joffrey’s bastardy on the condition that he be accepted back into the king’s peace and confirmed as Lord of Dragonstone and Storm’s End I vowed to do the same for the return of Brightwater Keep and all our lands I thought    Lord Tywin would see the sense in my proposal He still has the Starks to deal with and the ironmen as well I offered to seal the bargain by wedding Shireen to Joffrey’s brother Tommen He shook his head The terms    they are as good as we are ever like to get Even you can see that surely

Yes said Davos even me Unless Stannis should father a son such a marriage would mean that Dragonstone and Storm’s End would one day pass to Tommen which would doubtless please Lord Tywin Meanwhile the Lannisters would have Shireen as hostage to make certain Stannis raised no new rebellions And what did His Grace say when you proposed these terms to him

He is always with the red woman and    he is not in his right mind I fear This talk of a stone dragon    madness I tell you sheer madness Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire from the nine mages from the alchemists Did we learn nothing from Summerhall No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons I told Axell as much My way was better Surer And Stannis gave me his seal he gave me leave to rule The Hand speaks with the king’s voice

Not in this Davos was no courtier and he did not even try to blunt his words It is not in Stannis to yield so long as he knows his claim is just No more than he can unsay his words against Joffrey when he believes them true As for the marriage Tommen was born of the same incest as Joffrey and His Grace would sooner see Shireen dead than wed to such

A vein throbbed in Florent’s forehead He has no choice

You are wrong my lord He can choose to die a king

And us with him Is that what you desire Onion Knight

No But I am the king’s man and I will make no peace without his leave

Lord Alester stared at him helplessly for a long moment and then began to weep





JON

The last night fell black and moonless but for once the sky was clear I am going up the hill to look for Ghost he told the Thenns at the cave mouth and they grunted and let him pass

So many stars he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in Winterfell he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each he could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith he was old friends with the Ice Dragon the Shadowcat the Moonmaid and the Sword of the Morning All those he shared with Ygritte but not some of the others We look up at the same stars and see such different things The King’s Crown was the Cradle to hear her tell it the Stallion was the Horned Lord the red wanderer that septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the Thief And when the Thief was in the Moonmaid that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman Ygritte insisted Like the night you stole me The Thief was bright that night

I never meant to steal you he said I never knew you were a girl until my knife was at your throat

If you kill a man and never mean t’ he’s just as dead Ygritte said stubbornly Jon had never met anyone so stubborn except maybe for his little sister Arya Is she still my sister he wondered Was she ever He had never truly been a Stark only Lord Eddard’s motherless bastard with no more place at Winterfell than Theon Greyjoy And even that he’d lost When a man of the Night’s Watch said his words he put aside his old family and joined a new one but Jon Snow had lost those brothers too

He found Ghost atop the hill as he thought he might The white wolf never howled yet something drew him to the heights all the same and he would squat there on his hindquarters hot breath rising in a white mist as his red eyes drank the stars

Do you have names for them as well Jon asked as he went to one knee beside the direwolf and scratched the thick white fur on his neck The Hare The Doe The She-Wolf Ghost licked his face his rough wet tongue rasping against the scabs where the eagle’s talons had ripped Jon’s cheek The bird marked both of us he thought Ghost he said quietly on the morrow we go over There’s no steps here no cage-and-crane no way for me to get you to the other side We have to part Do you understand
