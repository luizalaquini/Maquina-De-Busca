A few words Three of them can say snow

One bird croaking my name was bad enough said Jon and snow’s nothing a black brother wants to hear about Snow often meant death in the north

Was there anything in Whitetree

Bones ashes and empty houses Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment The Old Bear wants word sent back to Aemon

Sam took a bird from one of the cages stroked its feathers attached the message and said Fly home now brave one Home The raven quorked something unintelligible back at him and Sam tossed it into the air Flapping it beat its way skyward through the trees I wish he could carry me with him

Still

Well said Sam yes but… I’m not as frightened as I was truly The first night every time I heard someone getting up to make water I thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat I was afraid that if I closed my eyes I might never open them again only… well… dawn came after all He managed a wan smile I may be craven but I’m not stupid I’m sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground but I’m hardly scared at all Look He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was I’ve been working on my maps

The world is strange Jon thought Two hundred brave men had left the Wall and the only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam the self-confessed coward We’ll make a ranger of you yet he joked Next thing you’ll want to be an outrider like Grenn Shall I speak to the Old Bear

Don’t you dare Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse It was a plow horse big and slow and clumsy but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode I had hoped we might stay the night in the village he said wistfully It would be nice to sleep under a roof again

Too few roofs for all of us Jon mounted again gave Sam a parting smile and rode off The column was well under way so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion He had seen enough of Whitetree

Ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game The woods were as empty as the villages Dywen had told him one night around the fire We’re a large party Jon had said The game’s probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march

Frightened away by something no doubt Dywen said

Once the horse had settled Ghost loped along easily beside him Jon caught up to Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket Is the bird away the Old Bear asked

Yes my lord Sam is teaching them to talk

The Old Bear snorted He’ll regret that Damned things make a lot of noise but they never say a thing worth hearing

They rode in silence until Jon said If my uncle found all these villages empty as well—

—he would have made it his purpose to learn why Lord Mormont finished for him and it may well be someone or something did not want that known Well we’ll be three hundred when Qhorin joins us Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with We will find them Jon I promise you

Or they will find us thought Jon





ARYA

The river was a blue-green ribbon shining in the morning sun Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface ripples spreading out behind it as it went Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles

It seemed a peaceful place… until Koss spotted the dead man There in the reeds He pointed and Arya saw it The body of a soldier shapeless and swollen His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face I told you there was bodies Lommy announced I could taste them in that water

When Yoren saw the corpse he spat Dobber see if he’s got anything worth the taking Mail knife a bit o’ coin what have you He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened Yoren rode back angry his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees We won’t be crossing here Koss you’ll come with me upriver look for a ford Woth Gerren you go downstream The rest o’ you wait here Put a guard out

Dobber found a leather purse in the dead man’s belt Inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie shouting Mud Pie Mud Pie In the back of their wagon Rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while Yoren was gone but no one paid him any mind Kurz caught a fish with his bare hands Arya saw how he did it standing over a shallow pool calm as still water his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near It didn’t look as hard as catching cats Fish didn’t have claws

It was midday when the others returned Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream but someone had burned it up Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale Might be we could swim the horses over maybe the donkeys but there’s no way we’ll get those wagons across And there’s smoke to the north and west more fires could be this side o’ the river’s the place we want to be He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud a line trailing down from it That’s Gods Eye with the river flowing south We’re here He poked a hole beside the line of the river under the circle We can’t go round west of the lake like I thought East takes us back to the kingsroad He moved the stick up to where the line and circle met Near as I recall there’s a town here The holdfast’s stone and there’s a lordling got his seat there too just a towerhouse but he’ll have a guard might be a knight or two We follow the river north should be there before dark They’ll have boats so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one He drew the stick up through the circle of the lake from bottom to top Gods be good we’ll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown He thrust the point down at the top of the circle We can buy new mounts there or else take shelter at Harrenhal That’s Lady Whent’s seat and she’s always been a friend o’ the Watch

Hot Pie’s eyes got wide There’s ghosts in Harrenhal…
