Troy at the carriers But as he approached some

one opened the door and came out He heard this
person say  Good-night  to the inmates and the voice
was Troys This was strange coming so immediately
after his arrival Boldwood however hastened up
to him Troy had what appeared to be a carpet-bag
in his hand -- the same that he had brought with him
It seemed as if he were going to leave again this very
night
Troy turned up the hill and quickened his pace
Boldwood stepped forward
 Sergeant Troy  
 Yes-im Sergeant Troy
 Just arrived from up the country I think 
 Just arrived from Bath
 I am William Boldwood
 Indeed
The tone in which this word was uttered was all
that had been wanted to bring Boldwood to the
point
 I wish to speak a word with you he said
 What about  
 About her who lives just ahead there -- and about
a woman you have wronged
 I wonder at your impertinence said Troy moving
on
 Now look here said Boldwood standing in front
of him  wonder or not you are going to hold a conver+
sation with me
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwoods
voice looked at his stalwart frame then at the thick
cudgel he carried in his hand He remembered it was
past ten oclock It seemed worth while to be civil to
Boldwood
 Very well Ill listen with pleasure said Troy
placing his bag on the ground only speak low for
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
there
 Well then -- I know a good deal concerning your
Fanny Robins attachment to you I may say too that
I believe I am the only person in the village excepting
Gabriel Oak who does know it You ought to marry
her
 I suppose I ought Indeed l wish to but I
cannot

himself and said I am too poor His voice
was changed Previously it had had a deviimay-care
tone It was the voice of a trickster now
Boldwoods present mood was not critical enough to
notice tones He continued I may as well speak
plainly and understand I dont wish to enter into the
questions of right or wrong womans honour and shame
or to express any opinion on your conduct I intend a
business transaction with you
 I see said Troy  Suppose we sit down here
An old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately
opposite and they sat down
The tone in which this word was uttered was all
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwoods
voice looked at his stalwart frame then at the thick

 I was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene
said Boldwood but you came and --  -- 
 Not engaged said Troy
 As good as engaged
 If I had not turned up she might have become en+
gaged to you
 Hang might  
 Would then
 If you had not come I should certainly -- yes
certainly -- have been accepted by this time If you had
not seen her you might have been married to Fanny
Well theres too much difference between Miss Ever+
denes station and your own for this flirtation with her
ever to benefit you by ending in marriage So all I ask
is dont molest her any more Marry Fanny
make it worth your while
 How will you 
 Ill pay you well now Ill settle a sum of money
upon her and Ill see that you dont suffer from poverty
in the future Ill put it clearly Bathsheba is only
playing with you you are too poor for her as I said
so give up wasting your time about a great match youll
never make for a moderate and rightful match you may
make to-morrow take up your carpet-bag turn about
leave Weatherbury now this night and you shall take
fifty pounds with you Fanny shall have fifty to enable
her to prepare for the wedding when you have told me
where she is living and she shall have five hundred
paid down on her wedding-day
