If you like Sam thought for a moment There’s a song our septon used to sing to me and my sisters when we were little and it was time for us to go to sleep ‘The Song of the Seven’ it’s called He cleared his throat and softly sang





The Father’s face is stern and strong

he sits and judges right from wrong

He weighs our lives the short and long

and loves the little children





The Mother gives the gift of life

and watches over every wife

Her gentle smile ends all strife

and she loves her little children





The Warrior stands before the foe

protecting us where e’er we go

With sword and shield and spear and bow

he guards the little children





The Crone is very wise and old

and sees our fates as they unfold

She lifts her lamp of shining gold

to lead the little children
