438 And he arose out of the synagogue and entered into Simons
house

And Simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they
besought him for her

439 And he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them

440 Now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with
divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every
one of them and healed them

441 And devils also came out of many crying out and saying Thou
art Christ the Son of God And he rebuking them suffered them not to
speak for they knew that he was Christ

442 And when it was day he departed and went into a desert place
and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he
should not depart from them

443 And he said unto them I must preach the kingdom of God to other
cities also for therefore am I sent

444 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee

51 And it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear
the word of God he stood by the lake of Gennesaret 52 And saw two
ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them
and were washing their nets

53 And he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and
prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land And he sat
down and taught the people out of the ship

54 Now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon Launch out into
the deep and let down your nets for a draught

55 And Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all the
night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word I will let
down the net

56 And when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of
fishes and their net brake

57 And they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other
ship that they should come and help them And they came and filled
both the ships so that they began to sink

58 When Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying
Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord

59 For he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken 510 And so was also James and
John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon And Jesus
said unto Simon Fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men

511 And when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all
and followed him

512 And it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man
full of leprosy who seeing Jesus fell on his face and besought him
saying Lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

513 And he put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be
thou clean And immediately the leprosy departed from him

514 And he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to
the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded
for a testimony unto them

515 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great
multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their
infirmities

516 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed

517 And it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that
there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were
come out of every town of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem and the
power of the Lord was present to heal them

518 And behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before
him

519 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him
down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus

520 And when he saw their faith he said unto him Man thy sins are
forgiven thee

521 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying Who is
this which speaketh blasphemies Who can forgive sins but God alone
522 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto
them What reason ye in your hearts  523 Whether is easier to say
Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say Rise up and walk  524 But that
ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
he said unto the sick of the palsy I say unto thee Arise and take
