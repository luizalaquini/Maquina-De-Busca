Miss Everdene is out of my reach why I have all to
gain by accepting your money and marrying Fan But
shes only a servant
 Never mind -- do you agree to my arrangement 
 I do
 Ah   said Boldwood in a more elastic voice O
Troy if you like her best why then did you step in here
and injure my happiness  
 I love Fanny best now said Troy But
Bathsh --  -- Miss Everdene inflamed me and displaced
Fanny for a time It is over now
 Why should it be over so soon And why then
did you come here again  
 There are weighty reasons Fifty pounds at once
you said 
 I did said Boldwood  and here they are -- fifty
sovereigns He handed Troy a small packet
 You have everything ready -- it seems that you
calculated on my accepting them said the sergeant
taking the packet
 I thought you might accept them said Boldwood
 Youve only my word that the programme shall be
adhered to whilst I at any rate have fifty pounds
 l had thought of that and l have considered that
if I cant appeal to your honour I can trust to your --
well shrewdness well call it -- not to lose five hundred
pounds in prospect and
P 287
also make a bitter enemy of a
man who is willing to be an extremely useful friend
 Stop listen   said Troy in a whisper
A light pit-pat was audible upon the road just above
them
By George -- tis she he continued I must go
on and meet her
She -- who  
Bathsheba
Bathsheba -- out alone at this time o night   said
Boldwood in amazement and starting up  Why must
you meet her 
She was expecting me to-night -- and I must now
speak to her and wish her good-bye according to your
wish 
I dont see the necessity of speaking
It can do no harm -- and shell be wandering about
looking for me if I dont You shall hear all I say to her
It will help you in your love-making when I am gone
Your tone is mocking
O no And renaember this if she does not know
what has become of me she will think more about me
than if I tell her flatly I have come to give her up
Will you confine your words to that one point  -- +
Shall I hear every word you say  
Every word Now sit still there and hold my
carpet bag for me and mark what you hear
The light footstep came closer halting occasionally
as if the walker listened for a sound Troy whistled a
double note in a soft fluty tone
Come to that is it   murmured Boldwood uneasily
You promised silence said Troy
I promise again
Troy stepped forward
Frank dearest is that you   The tones were
Bathshebas
O God   said Boldwood
Yes said Troy to her
How late you are she continued tenderly Did
you come by the carrier  I listened and heard his
wheels entering the village but it was some time ago
and I had almost given you up Frank
P 288
I was sure to come said Frank You knew I
should did you not  
Well I thought you would she said playfully 
and Frank it is so lucky  Theres not a soul in my
house but me to-night Ive packed them all off so
nobody on earth will know of your visit to your ladys
bower Liddy wanted to go to her grandfathers to
tell him about her holiday and I said she might stay
with them till to-morrow -- when youll be gone again
Capital said Troy  But dear me I had better
go back for my bag because my slippers and brush and
comb are in it you run home whilst I fetch it and Ill
promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes
Yes She turned and tripped up the hill again
During the progress of this dialogue there was a
nervous twitching of Boldwoods tightly closed lips and
his face became bathed in a clammy dew He now
started forward towards Troy Troy turned to him and
took up the bag
Shall I tell her I have come to give her up and
cannot marry her   said the soldier mockingly
No no wait a minute I want to say more to
you -- more to you   said Boldwood in a hoarse whisper
Now said Troy  you see my dilemma Perhaps
I am a bad man -- the victim of my impulses -- led away
to do what I ought to leave undone I cant however
marry them both And I have two reasons for- choosing
Fanny First I like her best upon the whole and
second you make it worth my while
