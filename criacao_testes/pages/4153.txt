of the speakers eyes these are usually fixed upon it
Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying
upon the ground in a way which suggested less ovine
criticism than womanly embarrassment She became
more or less red in the cheek the blood wavering in
uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space between
ebb and flood Gabriel sheared on constrained and
sad
She left Boldwoods side and he walked up and
down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour Then she
reappeared in her

new riding-habit of myrtle-green which
fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit and young
Bob Coggan led -on -her mare Boldwood fetching his
own horse from the tree under which it had been tied
  Oaks eyes could not forsake them and in en+
deavouring to continue his shearing at the same time
that he watched Boldwoods manner he snipped the
sheep in the groin The animal plunged Bathsheba
instantly gazed towards it and saw the blood
O Gabriel she exclaimed with severe remon+
strance you who are so strict with the other men -- see
what you are doing yourself
To an outsider there was not much to complain of
in this remark  but to Oak who knew Bathsheba to be
well aware that she herself was the cause of the poor
ewes wound because she had wounded the ewes shearer
in a -- still more vital part it had a sting which the abiding
sense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was
not calculated to heal But a manly resolve to recognize
boldly that he had no longer a lovers interest in her
helped him oceasionally to conceal a feeling
 Bottle   he shouted in an unmoved voice of routine
Cainy Ball ran up the wound was anointed and the
shearing continued
Boldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle
and before they turned away she again spoke out to Oak
with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness
I am going now to see Mr Boldwoods Leicesters
Take my place in the barn Gabriel and keep the men
carefully to their work
The horses heads were put about and they trotted
away
Boldwoods deep attachment was a matter of great
interest among all around him  but after having been
pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar
of thriving bachelorship his lapse was an anticlimax
somewhat resembling that of St John Longs death by
consumption in the midst of his proofs that it was not
a fatal disease

 That means matrimony said Temperance Miller
following them out of sight with her eyes
I reckon thats the size ot said Coggan working
along without looking up
 Well better wed over the mixen than over the moor
said Laban Tall turning his sheep
Henery Fray spoke exhibiting miserable eyes at the
same time I dont see why a maid should take a
husband when shes bold enough to fight her own
battles and dont want a home  for tis keeping another
woman out But let it be for tis a pity he and she
should trouble two houses
As usual with decided characters Bathsheba invari+
ably provoked the criticism of individuals like Henery
Fray Her emblazoned fault was to be too pronounced
in her objections and not sufficiently overt in her
likings We learn that it is not the rays which bodies
absorb but those which they reject that give them the
colours they are known by  and win the same way people
are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms whilst
their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all
Henery continued in a more complaisant mood  I
once hinted my mind to her on a few things as nearly
as a battered frame dared to do so to such a froward
piece You all know neighbours what a man I be
and how I come down with my powerful words when
my pride is boiling wi scarn 
 We do we do Henery
 So I said  Mistress Everdene theres places empty
and theres gifted men willing  but the spite  -- no not
the spite -- I didnt say spite -- but the villainy of the
contrarikind I said meaning womankind  keeps em
out That wasnt too strong for her say  
 Passably well put
Yes and I would have said it had death and
salvation overtook me for it Such is my spirit when I
have a mind
A true man and proud as a lucifer
You see the artfulness  Why twas about being
baily really but I didnt put it so plain that she could
understand my meaning so I could lay it on all the

stronger That was my depth   However let her
marry an she will Perhaps tis high time I believe
Farmer Boldwood kissed her behind the spear-bed at the
sheep-washing tother day -- that I do
 What a lie  said Gabriel
 Ah neighbour Oak -- howst know   said Henery
