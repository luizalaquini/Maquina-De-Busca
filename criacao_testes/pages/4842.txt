my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave

4430 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father and the lad
be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life
4431 It shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with
us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs
of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave

4432 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father
saying If I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to
my father for ever

4433 Now therefore I pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren

4434 For how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me
lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father

451 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
by him and he cried Cause every man to go out from me And there
stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his
brethren

452 And he wept aloud and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
heard

453 And Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph doth my father
yet live And his brethren could not answer him for they were
troubled at his presence

454 And Joseph said unto his brethren Come near to me I pray you
And they came near And he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye
sold into Egypt

455 Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye
sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life

456 For these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet
there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor
harvest

457 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance

458 So now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he hath
made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler
throughout all the land of Egypt

459 Haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him Thus saith
thy son Joseph God hath made me lord of all Egypt come down unto me
tarry not 4510 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen and thou
shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens
children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 4511
And there will I nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine
lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty

4512 And behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you

4513 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all
that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither

4514 And he fell upon his brother Benjamins neck and wept and
Benjamin wept upon his neck

4515 Moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and
after that his brethren talked with him

4516 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaohs house saying
Josephs brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well and his
servants

4517 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph Say unto thy brethren This do ye
lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of Canaan 4518 And
take your father and your households and come unto me and I will
give you the good of the land of Egypt and ye shall eat the fat of
the land

4519 Now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your
father and come

4520 Also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of
Egypt is yours

4521 And the children of Israel did so and Joseph gave them wagons
according to the commandment of Pharaoh and gave them provision for
the way

4522 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to
Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of
raiment

4523 And to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden
with the good things of Egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and
bread and meat for his father by the way

4524 So he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said
unto them See that ye fall not out by the way
