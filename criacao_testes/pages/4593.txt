A Lannister victory was ill tidings but Catelyn could not share her brother’s obvious dismay She still had nightmares about the shadow she had seen slide across Renly’s tent and the way the blood had come flowing out through the steel of his gorget Stannis was no more a friend than Lord Tywin

You do not understand Highgarden has declared for Joffrey Dorne as well All the south His mouth tightened And you see fit to loose the Kingslayer You had no right

I had a mother’s right Her voice was calm though the news about Highgarden was a savage blow to Robb’s hopes She could not think about that now though

No right Edmure repeated He was Robb’s captive your king’s captive and Robb charged me to keep him safe

Brienne will keep him safe She swore it on her sword

That woman

She will deliver Jaime to King’s Landing and bring Arya and Sansa back to us safely

Cersei will never give them up

Not Cersei Tyrion He swore it in open court And the Kingslayer swore it as well

Jaime’s word is worthless As for the Imp it’s said he took an axe in the head during the battle He’ll be dead before your Brienne reaches King’s Landing if she ever does

Dead Could the gods truly be so merciless She had made Jaime swear a hundred oaths but it was his brother’s promise she had pinned her hopes on

Edmure was blind to her distress Jaime was my charge and I mean to have him back I’ve sent ravens—

Ravens to whom How many

Three he said so the message will be certain to reach Lord Bolton By river or road the way from Riverrun to King’s Landing must needs take them close by Harrenhal

Harrenhal The very word seemed to darken the room Horror thickened her voice as she said Edmure do you know what you have done

Have no fear I left your part out I wrote that Jaime had escaped and offered a thousand dragons for his recapture

Worse and worse Catelyn thought in despair My brother is a fool Unbidden unwanted tears filled her eyes If this was an escape she said softly and not an exchange of hostages why should the Lannisters give my daughters to Brienne

It will never come to that The Kingslayer will be returned to us I have made certain of it

All you have made certain is that I shall never see my daughters again Brienne might have gotten him to King’s Landing safely    so long as no one was hunting for them But now    Catelyn could not go on Leave me Edmure She had no right to command him here in the castle that would soon be his yet her tone would brook no argument Leave me to Father and my grief I have no more to say to you Go Go All she wanted was to lie down to close her eyes and sleep and pray no dreams would come





ARYA

The sky was as black as the walls of Harrenhal behind them and the rain fell soft and steady muffling the sound of their horses’ hooves and running down their faces

They rode north away from the lake following a rutted farm road across the torn fields and into the woods and streams Arya took the lead kicking her stolen horse to a brisk heedless trot until the trees closed in around her Hot Pie and Gendry followed as best they could Wolves howled off in the distance and she could hear Hot Pie’s heavy breathing No one spoke From time to time Arya glanced over her shoulder to make sure the two boys had not fallen too far behind and to see if they were being pursued

They would be she knew She had stolen three horses from the stables and a map and a dagger from Roose Bolton’s own solar and killed a guard on the postern gate slitting his throat when he knelt to pick up the worn iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her Someone would find him lying dead in his own blood and then the hue and cry would go up They would wake Lord Bolton and search Harrenhal from crenel to cellar and when they did they would find the map and the dagger missing along with some swords from the armory bread and cheese from the kitchens a baker boy a ’prentice smith and a cupbearer called Nan    or Weasel or Arry depending on who you asked

The Lord of the Dreadfort would not come after them himself Roose Bolton would stay abed his pasty flesh dotted with leeches giving commands in his whispery soft voice His man Walton might lead the hunt the one they called Steelshanks for the greaves he always wore on his long legs Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and his sellswords who named themselves the Brave Companions Others called them Bloody Mummers though never to their faces and sometimes the Footmen for Lord Vargo’s habit of cutting off the hands and feet of men who displeased him

If they catch us he’ll cut off our hands and feet Arya thought and then Roose Bolton will peel the skin off us She was still dressed in her page’s garb and on the breast over her heart was sewn Lord Bolton’s sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort

Every time she looked back she half expected to see a blaze of torches pouring out the distant gates of Harrenhal or rushing along the tops of its huge high walls but there was nothing Harrenhal slept on until it was lost in darkness and hidden behind the trees

When they crossed the first stream Arya turned her horse aside and led them off the road following the twisting course of the water for a quarter-mile before finally scrambling out and up a stony bank If the hunters brought dogs that might throw them off the scent she hoped They could not stay on the road There is death on the road she told herself death on all the roads

Gendry and Hot Pie did not question her choice She had the map after all and Hot Pie seemed almost as terrified of her as of the men who might be coming after them He had seen the guard she’d killed It’s better if he’s scared of me she told herself That way he’ll do like I say instead of something stupid

She should be more frightened herself she knew She was only ten a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal The rain had washed the guard’s blood off her fingers she wore a sword across her back wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows and Arya Stark was unafraid Fear cuts deeper than swords she whispered under her breath the words that Syrio Forel had taught her and Jaqen’s words too valar morghulis

The rain stopped and started again and stopped once more and started but they had good cloaks to keep the water off Arya kept them moving at a slow steady pace It was too black beneath the trees to ride any faster the boys were no horsemen neither one and the soft broken ground was treacherous with half-buried roots and hidden stones They crossed another road its deep ruts filled with runoff but Arya shunned it Up and down the rolling hills she took them through brambles and briars and tangles of underbrush along the bottoms of narrow gullies where branches heavy with wet leaves slapped at their faces as they passed

Gendry’s mare lost her footing in the mud once going down hard on her hindquarters and spilling him from the saddle but neither horse nor rider was hurt and Gendry got that stubborn look on his face and mounted right up again Not long after they came upon three wolves devouring the corpse of a fawn When Hot Pie’s horse caught the scent he shied and bolted Two of the wolves fled as well but the third raised his head and bared his teeth prepared to defend his kill Back off Arya told Gendry Slow so you don’t spook him They edged their mounts away until the wolf and his feast were no longer in sight Only then did she swing about to ride after Hot Pie who was clinging desperately to the saddle as he crashed through the trees

Later they passed through a burned village threading their way carefully between the shells of blackened hovels and past the bones of a dozen dead men hanging from a row of apple trees When Hot Pie saw them he began to pray a thin whispered plea for the Mother’s mercy repeated over and over Arya looked up at the fleshless dead in their wet rotting clothes and said her own prayer Ser Gregor it went Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei She ended it with valar morghulis touched Jaqen’s coin where it nestled under her belt and then reached up and plucked an apple from among the dead men as she rode beneath them It was mushy and overripe but she ate it worms and all

That was the day without a dawn Slowly the sky lightened around them but they never saw the sun Black turned to grey and colors crept timidly back into the world The soldier pines were dressed in somber greens the broadleafs in russets and faded golds already beginning to brown They stopped long enough to water the horses and eat a cold quick breakfast ripping apart a loaf of the bread that Hot Pie had stolen from the kitchens and passing chunks of hard yellow cheese from hand to hand

Do you know where we’re going Gendry asked her

North said Arya

Hot Pie peered around uncertainly Which way is north

She used her cheese to point That way

But there’s no sun How do you know

From the moss See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees That’s south

What do we want with the north Gendry wanted to know

The Trident Arya unrolled the stolen map to show them See Once we reach the Trident all we need to do is follow it upstream till we come to Riverrun here Her finger traced the path It’s a long way but we can’t get lost so long as we keep to the river

Hot Pie blinked at the map Which one is Riverrun

Riverrun was painted as a castle tower in the fork between the flowing blue lines of two rivers the Tumblestone and the Red Fork There She touched it Riverrun it reads

You can read writing he said to her wonderingly as if she’d said she could walk on water

She nodded We’ll be safe once we reach Riverrun

We will Why

Because Riverrun is my grandfather’s castle and my brother Robb will be there she wanted to say She bit her lip and rolled up the map We just will But only if we get there She was the first one back in the saddle It made her feel bad to hide the truth from Hot Pie but she did not trust him with her secret Gendry knew but that was different Gendry had his own secret though even he didn’t seem to know what it was

That day Arya quickened their pace keeping the horses to a trot as long as she dared and sometimes spurring to a gallop when she spied a flat stretch of field before them That was seldom enough though the ground was growing hillier as they went The hills were not high nor especially steep but there seemed to be no end of them and they soon grew tired of climbing up one and down the other and found themselves following the lay of the land along streambeds and through a maze of shallow wooded valleys where the trees made a solid canopy overhead
