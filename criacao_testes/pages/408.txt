Meera said All of Winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating Bran The women talk of it at the well and the guards in their hall

Tell us what frightens you so much said Jojen

I don’t want to Anyway it’s only dreams Maester Luwin says dreams might mean anything or nothing

My brother dreams as other boys do and those dreams might mean anything Meera said but the green dreams are different

Jojen’s eyes were the color of moss and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else Like now I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains he said It was a green dream so I knew it was true A crow was trying to peck through the chains but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them

Did the crow have three eyes

Jojen nodded

Summer raised his head from Bran’s lap and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden eyes

When I was little I almost died of greywater fever That was when the crow came to me

He came to me after I fell Bran blurted I was asleep for a long time He said I had to fly or die and I woke up only I was broken and I couldn’t fly after all

You can if you want to Picking up her net Meera shook out the last tangles and began arranging it in loose folds

You are the winged wolf Bran said Jojen I wasn’t sure when we first came but now I am The crow sent us here to break your chains

Is the crow at Greywater

No The crow is in the north

At the Wall Bran had always wanted to see the Wall His bastard brother Jon was there now a man of the Night’s Watch

Beyond the Wall Meera Reed hung the net from her belt When Jojen told our lord father what he’d dreamed he sent us to Winterfell

How would I break the chains Jojen Bran asked

Open your eye

They are open Can’t you see

Two are open Jojen pointed One two

I only have two

You have three The crow gave you the third but you will not open it He had a slow soft way of speaking With two eyes you see my face With three you could see my heart With two you can see that oak tree there With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become With two you see no farther than your walls With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall

Summer got to his feet I don’t need to see so far Bran made a nervous smile I’m tired of talking about crows Let’s talk about wolves Or lizard-lions Have you ever hunted one Meera We don’t have them here

Meera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes They live in the water In slow streams and deep swamps—

Her brother interrupted Did you dream of a lizard-lion

No said Bran I told you I don’t want—

Did you dream of a wolf
