He will if you agree to leave the Kingsguard

I’m not leaving the Kingsguard

His sister fought back tears Jaime you’re my shining knight You cannot abandon me when I need you most He is stealing my son sending me away… and unless you stop him Father is going to force me to wed again

Jaime should not have been surprised but he was The words were a blow to his gut harder than any that Ser Addam Marbrand had dealt him Who

Does it matter Some lord or other Someone Father thinks he needs I don’t care I will not have another husband You are the only man I want in my bed ever again

Then tell him that

She pulled her hands away You are talking madness again Would you have us ripped apart as Mother did that time she caught us playing Tommen would lose the throne Myrcella her marriage… I want to be your wife we belong to each other but it can never be Jaime We are brother and sister

The Targaryens…

We are not Targaryens

Quiet he said scornfully So loud you’ll wake my Sworn Brothers We can’t have that now can we People might learn that you had come to see me

Jaime she sobbed don’t you think I want it as much as you do It makes no matter who they wed me to I want you at my side I want you in my bed I want you inside me Nothing has changed between us Let me prove it to you She pushed up his tunic and began to fumble with the laces of his breeches

Jaime felt himself responding No he said not here They had never done it in White Sword Tower much less in the Lord Commander’s chambers Cersei this is not the place

You took me in the sept This is no different She drew out his cock and bent her head over it

Jaime pushed her away with the stump of his right hand No Not here I said He forced himself to stand

For an instant he could see confusion in her bright green eyes and fear as well Then rage replaced it Cersei gathered herself together got to her feet straightened her skirts Was it your hand they hacked off in Harrenhal or your manhood As she shook her head her hair tumbled around her bare white shoulders I was a fool to come You lacked the courage to avenge Joffrey why would I think that you’d protect Tommen Tell me if the Imp had killed all three of your children would that have made you wroth

Tyrion is not going to harm Tommen or Myrcella I am still not certain he killed Joffrey

Her mouth twisted in anger How can you say that After all his threats—

Threats mean nothing He swears he did not do it

Oh he swears is that it And dwarfs don’t lie is that what you think

Not to me No more than you would

You great golden fool He’s lied to you a thousand times and so have I She bound up her hair again and scooped up the hairnet from the bedpost where she’d hung it Think what you will The little monster is in a black cell and soon Ser Ilyn will have his head off Perhaps you’d like it for a keepsake She glanced at the pillow He can watch over you as you sleep alone in that cold white bed Until his eyes rot out that is

You had best go Cersei You’re making me angry

Oh an angry cripple How terrifying She laughed A pity Lord Tywin Lannister never had a son I could have been the heir he wanted but I lacked the cock And speaking of such best tuck yours away brother It looks rather sad and small hanging from your breeches like that

When she was gone Jaime took her advice fumbling one-handed at his laces He felt a bone-deep ache in his phantom fingers I’ve lost a hand a father a son a sister and a lover and soon enough I will lose a brother And yet they keep telling me House Lannister won this war

Jaime donned his cloak and went downstairs where he found Ser Boros Blount having a cup of wine in the common room When you’re done with your drink tell Ser Loras I’m ready to see her

Ser Boros was too much of a coward to do much more than glower You are ready to see who

Just tell Loras

Aye Ser Boros drained his cup Aye Lord Commander

He took his own good time about it though or else the Knight of Flowers proved hard to find Several hours had passed by the time they arrived the slim handsome youth and the big ugly maid Jaime was sitting alone in the round room leafing idly through the White Book Lord Commander Ser Loras said you wished to see the Maid of Tarth

I did Jaime waved them closer with his left hand You have talked with her I take it

As you commanded my lord

And

The lad tensed I… it may be it happened as she says ser That it was Stannis I cannot be certain

Varys tells me that the castellan of Storm’s End perished strangely as well said Jaime

Ser Cortnay Penrose said Brienne sadly A good man

A stubborn man One day he stood square in the way of the King of Dragonstone The next he leapt from a tower Jaime stood Ser Loras we will talk more of this later You may leave Brienne with me

The wench looked as ugly and awkward as ever he decided when Tyrell left them Someone had dressed her in woman’s clothes again but this dress fit much better than that hideous pink rag the goat had made her wear Blue is a good color on you my lady Jaime observed It goes well with your eyes She does have astonishing eyes

Brienne glanced down at herself flustered Septa Donyse padded out the bodice to give it that shape She said you sent her to me She lingered by the door as if she meant to flee at any second You look…

Different He managed a half-smile More meat on the ribs and fewer lice in my hair that’s all The stump’s the same Close the door and come here

She did as he bid her The white cloak…

…is new but I’m sure I’ll soil it soon enough

That wasn’t… I was about to say that it becomes you

She came closer hesitant Jaime did you mean what you told Ser Loras About… about King Renly and the shadow

Jaime shrugged I would have killed Renly myself if we’d met in battle what do I care who cut his throat

You said I had honor…

I’m the bloody Kingslayer remember When I say you have honor that’s like a whore vouchsafing your maidenhood He leaned back and looked up at her Steelshanks is on his way back north to deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton

You gave her to him she cried dismayed You swore an oath to Lady Catelyn…

With a sword at my throat but never mind Lady Catelyn’s dead I could not give her back her daughters even if I had them And the girl my father sent with Steelshanks was not Arya Stark

Not Arya Stark

You heard me My lord father found some skinny northern girl more or less the same age with more or less the same coloring He dressed her up in white and grey gave her a silver wolf to pin her cloak and sent her off to wed Bolton’s bastard He lifted his stump to point at her I wanted to tell you that before you went galloping off to rescue her and got yourself killed for no good purpose You’re not half bad with a sword but you’re not good enough to take on two hundred men by yourself
