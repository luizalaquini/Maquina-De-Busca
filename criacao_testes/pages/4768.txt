Arya bit her lip Does that mean you won’t buy her

The woman chuckled It means you’ll take what I give you sweetling Else we go down to the castle and maybe you get nothing Or even hanged for stealing some good knight’s horse

A half-dozen other Saltpans folks were around going about their business so Arya knew she couldn’t kill the woman Instead she had to bite her lip and let herself be cheated The purse she got was pitifully flat and when she asked for more for the saddle and bridle and blanket the woman just laughed at her

She would never have cheated the Hound she thought during the long walk back to the docks The distance seemed to have grown by miles since she’d ridden it

The purple galley was still there If the ship had sailed while she was being robbed that would have been too much to bear A cask of mead was being rolled up the plank when she arrived When she tried to follow a sailor up on deck shouted down at her in a tongue she did not know I want to see the captain Arya told him He only shouted louder But the commotion drew the attention of a stout grey-haired man in a coat of purple wool and he spoke the Common Tongue I am captain here he said What is your wish Be quick child we have a tide to catch

I want to go north to the Wall Here I can pay She gave him the purse The Night’s Watch has a castle on the sea

Eastwatch The captain spilled out the silver onto his palm and frowned Is this all you have

It is not enough Arya knew without being told She could see it on his face I wouldn’t need a cabin or anything she said I could sleep down in the hold or   

Take her on as cabin girl said a passing oarsman a bolt of wool over one shoulder She can sleep with me

Mind your tongue the captain snapped

I could work said Arya I could scrub the decks I scrubbed a castle steps once Or I could row   

No he said you couldn’t He gave her back her coins It would make no difference if you could child The north has nothing for us Ice and war and pirates We saw a dozen pirate ships making north as we rounded Crackclaw Point and I have no wish to meet them again From here we bend our oars for home and I suggest you do the same

I have no home Arya thought I have no pack And now I don’t even have a horse

The captain was turning away when she said What ship is this my lord

He paused long enough to give her a weary smile This is the galleas Titan’s Daughter of the Free City of Braavos

Wait Arya said suddenly I have something else She had stuffed it down inside her smallclothes to keep it safe so she had to dig deep to find it while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered with obvious impatience One more silver will make no difference child he finally said

It’s not silver Her fingers closed on it It’s iron Here She pressed it into his hand the small black iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her so worn the man whose head it bore had no features It’s probably worthless but   

The captain turned it over and blinked at it then looked at her again This    how    

Jaqen said to say the words too Arya crossed her arms against her chest Valar morghulis she said as loud as if she’d known what it meant

Valar dohaeris he replied touching his brow with two fingers Of course you shall have a cabin





SAMWELL

He sucks harder than mine Gilly stroked the babe’s head as she held him to her nipple

He’s hungry said the blonde woman Val the one the black brothers called the wildling princess He’s lived on goats’ milk up to now and potions from that blind maester

The boy did not have a name yet no more than Gilly’s did That was the wildling way Not even Mance Rayder’s son would get a name till his third year it would seem though Sam had heard the brothers calling him the little prince and born-in-battle

He watched the child nurse at Gilly’s breast and then he watched Jon watch Jon is smiling A sad smile still but definitely a smile of sorts Sam was glad to see it It is the first time I’ve seen him smile since I got back

They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake and from Deep Lake to Queensgate following a narrow track from one castle to the next never out of sight of the Wall A day and a half from Castle Black as they trudged along on callused feet Gilly heard horses behind them and turned to see a column of black riders coming from the west My brothers Sam assured her No one uses this road but the Night’s Watch It had turned out to be Ser Denys Mallister from the Shadow Tower along with the wounded Bowen Marsh and the survivors from the fight at the Bridge of Skulls When Sam saw Dywen Giant and Dolorous Edd Tollett he broke down and wept

It was from them that he learned about the battle beneath the Wall Stannis landed his knights at Eastwatch and Cotter Pyke led him along the ranger’s roads to take the wildlings unawares Giant told him He smashed them Mance Rayder was taken captive a thousand of his best slain including Harma Dogshead The rest scattered like leaves before a storm we heard The gods are good Sam thought If he had not gotten lost as he made his way south from Craster’s Keep he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle    or into Mance Rayder’s camp at the very least That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy but not for him Sam had heard all the stories about what wildlings did with captured crows He shuddered

Nothing that his brothers told him prepared him for what he found at Castle Black however The common hall had burned to the ground and the great wooden stair was a mound of broken ice and scorched timbers Donal Noye was dead along with Rast Deaf Dick Red Alyn and so many more yet the castle was more crowded than Sam had ever seen not with black brothers but with the king’s soldiers more than a thousand of them There was a king in the King’s Tower for the first time in living memory and banners flew from the Lance Hardin’s Tower the Grey Keep the Shieldhall and other buildings that had stood empty and abandoned for long years The big one the gold with the black stag that’s the royal standard of House Baratheon he told Gilly who had never seen banners before The fox-and-flowers is House Florent The turtle is Estermont the swordfish is Bar Emmon and the crossed trumpets are for Wensington

They’re all bright as flowers Gilly pointed I like those yellow ones with the fire Look and some of the fighters have the same thing on their blouses

A fiery heart I don’t know whose sigil that is

He found out soon enough Queen’s men Pyp told him—after he let out a whoop and shouted Run and bar the doors lads it’s Sam the Slayer come back from the grave while Grenn was hugging Sam so hard he thought his ribs might break—but best you don’t go asking where the queen is Stannis left her at Eastwatch with their daughter and his fleet He brought no woman but the red one

The red one said Sam uncertainly

Melisandre of Asshai said Grenn The king’s sorceress They say she burned a man alive at Dragonstone so Stannis would have favorable winds for his voyage north She rode beside him in the battle too and gave him his magic sword Lightbringer they call it Wait till you see it It glows like it had a piece of sun inside it He looked at Sam again and grinned a big helpless stupid grin I still can’t believe you’re here

Jon Snow had smiled to see him too but it was a tired smile like the one he wore now You made it back after all he said And brought Gilly out as well You’ve done well Sam

Jon had done more than well himself to hear Grenn tell it Yet even capturing the Horn of Winter and a wildling prince had not been enough for Ser Alliser Thorne and his friends who still named him turncloak Though Maester Aemon said his wound was healing well Jon bore other scars deeper than the ones around his eye He grieves for his wildling girl and for his brothers

It’s strange he said to Sam Craster had no love for Mance nor Mance for Craster but now Craster’s daughter is feeding Mance’s son

I have the milk Gilly said her voice soft and shy Mine takes only a little He’s not so greedy as this one

The wildling woman Val turned to face them I’ve heard the queen’s men saying that the red woman means to give Mance to the fire as soon as he is strong enough

Jon gave her a weary look Mance is a deserter from the Night’s Watch The penalty for that is death If the Watch had taken him he would have been hanged by now but he’s the king’s captive and no one knows the king’s mind but the red woman

I want to see him Val said I want to show him his son He deserves that much before you kill him

Sam tried to explain No one is permitted to see him but Maester Aemon my lady

If it were in my power Mance could hold his son Jon’s smile was gone I’m sorry Val He turned away Sam and I have duties to return to Well Sam does anyway We’ll ask about your seeing Mance That’s all I can promise

Sam lingered long enough to give Gilly’s hand a squeeze and promise to return again after supper Then he hurried after There were guards outside the door queen’s men with spears Jon was halfway down the steps but he waited when he heard Sam puffing after him You’re more than fond of Gilly aren’t you

Sam reddened Gilly’s good She’s good and kind He was glad that his long nightmare was done glad to be back with his brothers at Castle Black    but some nights alone in his cell he thought of how warm Gilly had been when they’d curled up beneath the furs with the babe between them She    she made me braver Jon Not brave but    braver

You know you cannot keep her Jon said gently no more than I could stay with Ygritte You said the words Sam the same as I did The same as all of us

I know Gilly said she’d be a wife to me but    I told her about the words and what they meant I don’t know if that made her sad or glad but I told her He swallowed nervously and said Jon could there be honor in a lie if it were told for a    a good purpose

It would depend on the lie and the purpose I suppose Jon looked at Sam I wouldn’t advise it You’re not made to lie Sam You blush and squeak and stammer

I do said Sam but I could lie in a letter I’m better with a quill in hand I had a    a thought When things are more settled here I thought maybe the best thing for Gilly    I thought I might send her to Horn Hill To my mother and sisters and my    my f-f-father If Gilly were to say the babe was m-mine    He was blushing again My mother would want him I know She would find some place for Gilly some kind of service it wouldn’t be as hard as serving Craster And Lord R-Randyll he    he would never say so but he might be pleased to believe I got a bastard on some wildling girl At least it would prove I was man enough to lie with a woman and father a child He told me once that I was sure to die a maiden that no woman would ever    you know    Jon if I did this wrote this lie    would that be a good thing The life the boy would have
