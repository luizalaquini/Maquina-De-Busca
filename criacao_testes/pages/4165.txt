tion pompous travels and lordly sleeps Now it is
yours
 But Sergeant Troy I cannot take this -- I cannot  
she exclaimed with round-eyed wonder  A gold watch 
What are you doing Dont be such a dissembler
The sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his
gift which she held out persistently towards him
Bathsheba followed as he retired
Keep it -- do Miss Everdene -- keep it  said the
erratic child of impulse  The fact of your possessing
it makes it worth ten times as much to me A more
plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well and
the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats
against -- well I wont speak of that It is in far
worthier hands than ever it has been in before
But indeed I cant have it she said in a perfect
simmer of distress  O how can you do such a thing 
that is if you really mean it Give me your dead
fathers watch and such a valuable one You should
not be so reckless indeed Sergeant Troy
I loved my father good but better I love you
more Thats how I can do it said the sergeant with
an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it
was evidently not all acted now Her beauty which
whilst it had been quiescent he had praised in jest
had in its animated phases moved him to

earnest and
though his seriousness was less than she imagined it
was probably more than he imagined himself
Bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment
and she said in half-suspicious accents of feeling Can
it be 0 how can it be that you care for me and
so suddenly You have seen so little of me I may
not be really so -- so nice-looking as I seem to you
Please do take it  O do I cannot and will not have
it Believe me your generosity is too great I have
never done you a single kindness and why should you
be so kind to me
A factitious reply had been again upon his lips but
it was again suspended and he looked at her with an
arrested eye The truth was that as she now stood --
excited wild and honest as the day --  her alluring
beauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed
upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in
advancing them as false He said mechanically Ah
why  and continued to look at her
And my workfolk see me following you about the
field and are wondering O this is dreadful she
went on unconscious of the transmutation she was
effecting
I did not quite mean you to accept it at first for it
as my one poor patent of nobility he broke out
bluntly but upon my soul I wish you would now
Without any shamming come Dont deny me the
happiness of wearing it for my sake  But you are too
lovely even to care to be kind as others are
 No no  dont say so  I have reasons for reserve
which I cannot explain
 bet it be then let it be he said receiving back
the watch at last I must be leaving you now And
will you speak to me for these few weeks of my stay  
Indeed I will Yet I dont know if I will O
why did you come and disturb me so 
Perhaps in setting a gin I have caught myself
Such things have happened Well will you let me
work in your fields   he coaxed
 Yes I suppose so  if it is any pleasure to you
 Miss Everdene I thank you
 No no

Good-bye
The sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the
slope of his head saluted and returned to the distant
group of haymakers
Bathsheba could not face the haymakers now Her
heart erratically flitting hither and thither from per+
plexed excitement hot and almost tearful she retreated
homeward murmuring O what have I done  What
does it mean  I wish I knew how much of it was
true

HIVING THE BEES
THE Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this
year It was in the latter part of June and the day after
the interview with Troy in the hayfield that Bathsheba
was standing in her garden watching a swarm in the
air and guessing their probable settling place Not only
were they late this year but unruly Sometimes through+
out a whole season all the swarms would alight on the
lowest attainable bough -- such as part of a currant-bush
or espalier apple-tree  next year they would with just
the same unanimity make straight off to the uppermost
member of some tall gaunt costard or quarrenden
and there defy all invaders who did not come armed
with ladders and staves to take them
This was the case at present Bathshebas eyes
shaded by one hand were following the ascending
multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue till
