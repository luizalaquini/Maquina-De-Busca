unto every good work

222 Flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith
charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart

223 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do
gender strifes

224 And the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto
all men apt to teach patient 225 In meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves if God peradventure will give them repentance
to the acknowledging of the truth 226 And that they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him
at his will

31 This know also that in the last days perilous times shall come

32 For men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters
proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy 33
Without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
fierce despisers of those that are good 34 Traitors heady
highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God 35 Having a
form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away

36 For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead
captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 37
Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth

38 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist
the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith

39 But they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men as theirs also was

310 But thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose
faith longsuffering charity patience 311 Persecutions
afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra
what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered
me

312 Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution

313 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving
and being deceived

314 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them 315 And that
from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus

316 All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable
for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in
righteousness 317 That the man of God may be perfect throughly
furnished unto all good works

41 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom
42 Preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove
rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine

43 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers
having itching ears 44 And they shall turn away their ears from the
truth and shall be turned unto fables

45 But watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of
an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry

46 For I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is
at hand

47 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept
the faith 48 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at
that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his
appearing

49 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me 410 For Demas hath
forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto
Thessalonica Crescens to Galatia Titus unto Dalmatia

411 Only Luke is with me Take Mark and bring him with thee for he
is profitable to me for the ministry

412 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus

413 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus when thou comest
bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments

414 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the Lord reward him
according to his works 415 Of whom be thou ware also for he hath
greatly withstood our words

416 At my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge

417 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me that
by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles
might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion
