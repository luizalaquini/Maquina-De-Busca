thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen

359 Conaniah also and Shemaiah and Nethaneel his brethren and
Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad chief of the Levites gave unto the
Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five
hundred oxen

3510 So the service was prepared and the priests stood in their
place and the Levites in their courses according to the kings
commandment

3511 And they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the
blood from their hands and the Levites flayed them

3512 And they removed the burnt offerings that they might give
according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer
unto the LORD as it is written in the book of Moses And so did they
with the oxen

3513 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in
caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people

3514 And afterward they made ready for themselves and for the
priests because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering
of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the Levites
prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron

3515 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place according
to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the
kings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not
depart from their service for their brethren the Levites prepared for
them

3516 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day to
keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the
LORD according to the commandment of king Josiah

3517 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days

3518 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
days of Samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of Israel keep
such a passover as Josiah kept and the priests and the Levites and
all Judah and Israel that were present and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem

3519 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
kept

3520 After all this when Josiah had prepared the temple Necho king
of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates and Josiah
went out against him

3521 But he sent ambassadors to him saying What have I to do with
thee thou king of Judah I come not against thee this day but
against the house wherewith I have war for God commanded me to make
haste forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me that he
destroy thee not

3522 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him but
disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not
unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God and came to fight in
the valley of Megiddo

3523 And the archers shot at king Josiah and the king said to his
servants Have me away for I am sore wounded

3524 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him
in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to Jerusalem
and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers
And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah

3525 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah and all the singing men and
the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day
and made them an ordinance in Israel and behold they are written in
the lamentations

3526 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness according
to that which was written in the law of the LORD 3527 And his deeds
first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of
Israel and Judah

361 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and
made him king in his fathers stead in Jerusalem

362 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign
and he reigned three months in Jerusalem

363 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem and condemned
the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold

364 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
and Jerusalem and turned his name to Jehoiakim And Necho took
Jehoahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt

365 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem and he did that which was
evil in the sight of the LORD his God
