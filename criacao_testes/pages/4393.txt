It maps very simply on to a phonetic representation just like Esperanto
However it can provide little help with the crucial problem of stress
assignment except perhaps by explicitly indicating reduced vowels
sh 93  Discussion
pp
This chapter has really only touched the tip of a linguistic iceberg
I have given some examples of representations rules algorithms
and exceptions to make the concepts more tangible but a whole mass of
detail has been swept under the carpet
pp
There are two important messages that are worth reiterating once more
The first is that the representation of the input em that is
whether it be a concept
in some semantic domain a syntactic description of an utterance a
decomposition into morphs plain text or some contrived re-spelling of it em
is crucial to the quality of the output
Almost any extra information about the utterance can be taken into account
and used to improve the speech
It is difficult to derive such information if it is not provided explicitly
for the process of climbing the tree from text to semantic representation is
at least as hard as descending it to a phonetic transcription
pp
Secondly simple algorithms perform remarkably well em witness the
punctuation-driven intonation assignment scheme and word fragment rules
for pronunciation
However the combined degradation contributed by several imperfect
processes is likely to impair speech quality very seriously
And great complexity is introduced when these simple algorithms are
discarded in favour of more sophisticated ones
There is for example a world of difference between a pronunciation
program that copes with 97 of common words and one that deals correctly
with 99 of a random sample from a dictionary
pp
Some of the options that face the system designer are recapitulated in
Figure 94
FC Figure 94
Starting from text one can take the simple approach of lexically-based
suffix-splitting letter-to-sound rules and prosodics derived
from punctuation to generate a phonetic transcription
This will provide a cheap system which is relatively easy to implement
but whose speech quality will probably not be acceptable to any but the
most dedicated listener
such as a blind person with no other access to reading material
pp
The biggest improvement in speech quality from such a system would
almost certainly come from more intelligent prosodic
control em particularly of intonation
This unfortunately is also by far the most difficult to make unless
intonation contours tonic stresses and tone-group boundaries are hand-coded
into the input
To generate the appropriate information from text one has to climb to the
upper levels in Figure 94 em and even when these are reached the problems
are by no means over
Still let us climb the tree
pp
For syntax analysis part-of-speech information is needed and for this
the grammatical roles of individual words in the text must be ascertained
A morph dictionary is the most reliable way to do this
A linguist may prefer to go from morphs to syntax by way of morphemes
but this is not necessary for the present purpose
Just the information that
the morph went is a verb can be stored in the dictionary instead
of its decomposition  went = go + ed
pp
Now that we have the morphological structure of the text stress assignment rules
can be applied to produce more accurate speech rhythms
The morph decomposition will also allow improvements to be made to the
pronunciation particularly in the case of silent es in compound words
But the ability to assign intonation has hardly been improved at all
pp
Let us proceed upwards
Now the problems become really difficult
A semantic representation of the text is needed but what exactly does this
mean
We certainly must have
ul
morphemic
knowledge for now the fact that went is a derivative of go
rather than any other verb becomes crucial
Very well let us augment the morph dictionary with morphemic information
But this does not attack the problem of semantic representation
We may wish to resolve pronoun references to help assign stress
Parts of the problem are solved in principle
and reported in the artificial intelligence
literature but if such an ability is incorporated into the speech
synthesis system it will become enormously complicated
In addition we have seen that knowledge of antitheses in the text will greatly
assist intonation assignment but procedures for extracting this
information constitute a research topic in their own right
pp
Now step back and take a top-down approach
What could we do with this semantic understanding and knowledge of the structure
of the discourse if we had it
