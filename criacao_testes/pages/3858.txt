I mislike that word Lord Tywin said stiffly

And I mislike being left in the dark

There was no reason to tell you You had no part in this

Was Cersei told Tyrion demanded to know

No one was told save those who had a part to play And they were only told as much as they needed to know You ought to know that there is no other way to keep a secret—here especially My object was to rid us of a dangerous enemy as cheaply as I could not to indulge your curiosity or make your sister feel important He closed the shutters frowning You have a certain cunning Tyrion but the plain truth is you talk too much That loose tongue of yours will be your undoing

You should have let Joff tear it out suggested Tyrion

You would do well not to tempt me Lord Tywin said I’ll hear no more of this I have been considering how best to appease Oberyn Martell and his entourage

Oh Is this something I’m allowed to know or should I leave so you can discuss it with yourself

His father ignored the sally Prince Oberyn’s presence here is unfortunate His brother is a cautious man a reasoned man subtle deliberate even indolent to a degree He is a man who weighs the consequences of every word and every action But Oberyn has always been half-mad

Is it true he tried to raise Dorne for Viserys

No one speaks of it but yes Ravens flew and riders rode with what secret messages I never knew Jon Arryn sailed to Sunspear to return Prince Lewyn’s bones sat down with Prince Doran and ended all the talk of war But Robert never went to Dorne thereafter and Prince Oberyn seldom left it

Well he’s here now with half the nobility of Dorne in his tail and he grows more impatient every day said Tyrion Perhaps I should show him the brothels of King’s Landing that might distract him A tool for every task isn’t that how it works My tool is yours Father Never let it be said that House Lannister blew its trumpets and I did not respond

Lord Tywin’s mouth tightened Very droll Shall I have them sew you a suit of motley and a little hat with bells on it

If I wear it do I have leave to say anything I want about His Grace King Joffrey

Lord Tywin seated himself again and said I was made to suffer my father’s follies I will not suffer yours Enough

Very well as you ask so pleasantly The Red Viper is not going to be pleasant I fear… nor will he content himself with Ser Gregor’s head alone

All the more reason not to give it to him

Not to… Tyrion was shocked I thought we were agreed that the woods were full of beasts

Lesser beasts Lord Tywin’s fingers laced together under his chin Ser Gregor has served us well No other knight in the realm inspires such terror in our enemies

Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who…

He knows nothing He has heard tales Stable gossip and kitchen calumnies He has no crumb of proof Ser Gregor is certainly not about to confess to him I mean to keep him well away for so long as the Dornishmen are in King’s Landing

And when Oberyn demands the justice he’s come for

I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children Lord Tywin said calmly So will you if he asks

Ser Amory Lorch is dead Tyrion said flatly

Precisely Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the fall of Harrenhal That ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease even Oberyn Martell

You may call that justice…

It is justice It was Ser Amory who brought me the girl’s body if you must know He found her hiding under her father’s bed as if she believed Rhaegar could still protect her Princess Elia and the babe were in the nursery a floor below

Well it’s a tale and Ser Amory’s not like to deny it What will you tell Oberyn when he asks who gave Lorch his orders

Ser Amory acted on his own in the hope of winning favor from the new king Robert’s hatred for Rhaegar was scarcely a secret

It might serve Tyrion had to concede but the snake will not be happy Far be it from me to question your cunning Father but in your place I do believe I’d have let Robert Baratheon bloody his own hands

Lord Tywin stared at him as if he had lost his wits You deserve that motley then We had come late to Robert’s cause It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty When I laid those bodies before the throne no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever And Robert’s relief was palpable As stupid as he was even he knew that Rhaegar’s children had to die if his throne was ever to be secure Yet he saw himself as a hero and heroes do not kill children His father shrugged I grant you it was done too brutally Elia need not have been harmed at all that was sheer folly By herself she was nothing

Then why did the Mountain kill her

Because I did not tell him to spare her I doubt I mentioned her at all I had more pressing concerns Ned Stark’s van was rushing south from the Trident and I feared it might come to swords between us And it was in Aerys to murder Jaime with no more cause than spite That was the thing I feared most That and what Jaime himself might do He closed a fist Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane only that he was huge and terrible in battle The rape… even you will not accuse me of giving that command I would hope Ser Amory was almost as bestial with Rhaenys I asked him afterward why it had required half a hundred thrusts to kill a girl of… two Three He said she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming If Lorch had half the wits the gods gave a turnip he would have calmed her with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow His mouth twisted in distaste The blood was in him

But not in you Father There is no blood in Tywin Lannister Was it a soft silk pillow that slew Robb Stark

It was to be an arrow at Edmure Tully’s wedding feast The boy was too wary in the field He kept his men in good order and surrounded himself with outriders and bodyguards

So Lord Walder slew him under his own roof at his own table Tyrion made a fist What of Lady Catelyn

Slain as well I’d say A pair of wolfskins Frey had intended to keep her captive but perhaps something went awry

So much for guest right

The blood is on Walder Frey’s hands not mine

Walder Frey is a peevish old man who lives to fondle his young wife and brood over all the slights he’s suffered I have no doubt he hatched this ugly chicken but he would never have dared such a thing without a promise of protection

I suppose you would have spared the boy and told Lord Frey you had no need of his allegiance That would have driven the old fool right back into Stark’s arms and won you another year of war Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner When Tyrion had no reply to that his father continued The price was cheap by any measure The crown shall grant Riverrun to Ser Emmon Frey once the Blackfish yields Lancel and Daven must marry Frey girls Joy is to wed one of Lord Walder’s natural sons when she’s old enough and Roose Bolton becomes Warden of the North and takes home Arya Stark

Arya Stark Tyrion cocked his head And Bolton I might have known Frey would not have the stomach to act alone But Arya… Varys and Ser Jacelyn searched for her for more than half a year Arya Stark is surely dead

So was Renly until the Blackwater

What does that mean

Perhaps Littlefinger succeeded where you and Varys failed Lord Bolton will wed the girl to his bastard son We shall allow the Dreadfort to fight the ironborn for a few years and see if he can bring Stark’s other bannermen to heel Come spring all of them should be at the end of their strength and ready to bend the knee The north will go to your son by Sansa Stark… if you ever find enough manhood in you to breed one Lest you forget it is not only Joffrey who must needs take a maidenhead

I had not forgotten though I’d hoped you had And when do you imagine Sansa will be at her most fertile Tyrion asked his father in tones that dripped acid Before or after I tell her how we murdered her mother and her brother
