He is a rare bird the maester said Most ravens will eat grain but they prefer flesh It makes them strong and I fear they relish the taste of blood In that they are like men… and like men not all ravens are alike

Jon had nothing to say to that He threw meat wondering why he’d been summoned No doubt the old man would tell him in his own good time Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried

Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages the maester went on though the raven is a stronger flyer larger bolder far more clever better able to defend itself against hawks… yet ravens are black and they eat the dead so some godly men abhor them Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves did you know The maester turned his white eyes on Jon smiling The Night’s Watch prefers ravens

Jon’s fingers were in the bucket blood up to the wrist Dywen says the wildlings call us crows he said uncertainty

The crow is the raven’s poor cousin They are both beggars in black hated and misunderstood

Jon wished he understood what they were talking about and why What did he care about ravens and doves If the old man had something to say to him why couldn’t he just say it

Jon did you ever wonder why the men of the Night’s Watch take no wives and father no children Maester Aemon asked

Jon shrugged No He scattered more meat The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket

So they will not love the old man answered for love is the bane of honor the death of duty

That did not sound right to Jon yet he said nothing The maester was a hundred years old and a high officer of the Night’s Watch it was not his place to contradict him

The old man seemed to sense his doubts Tell me Jon if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do

Jon hesitated He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself not even for love yet inside a small sly voice whispered He fathered a bastard where was the honor in that And your mother what of his duty to her he will not even say her name He would do whatever was right he said… ringingly to make up for his hesitation No matter what

Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a woman’s love What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms… or the memory of a brother’s smile Wind and words Wind and words We are only human and the gods have fashioned us for love That is our great glory and our great tragedy

The men who formed the Night’s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve So they vowed they would have no wives nor children

Yet brothers they had and sisters Mothers who gave them birth fathers who gave them names They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms and they knew times may change but men do not So they pledged as well that the Night’s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded

They kept their pledge When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom Harren’s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall with ten thousand swords to hand He did not march In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war The Watch took no part When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts So it has always been for years beyond counting Such is the price of honor

A craven can be as brave as any man when there is nothing to fear And we all do our duty when there is no cost to it How easy it seems then to walk the path of honor Yet soon or late in every man’s life comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose

Some of the ravens were still eating long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks The rest seemed to be watching him Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes And this is my day… is that what you’re saying

Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes It was as if he were seeing right into his heart Jon felt naked and exposed He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere scattering the ravens They took to the air shrieking wildly The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor

The old man laid a withered spotted hand on his shoulder It hurts boy he said softly Oh yes Choosing… it has always hurt And always will I know

You don’t know Jon said bitterly No one knows Even if I am his bastard he’s still my father…

Maester Aemon sighed Have you heard nothing I’ve told you Jon Do you think you are the first He shook his ancient head a gesture weary beyond words Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows Once when I was a boy once in the fullness of my manhood and once when I had grown old By then my strength was fled my eyes grown dim yet that last choice was as cruel as the first My ravens would bring the news from the south words darker than their wings the ruin of my House the death of my kin disgrace and desolation What could I have done old blind frail I was helpless as a suckling babe yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother’s poor grandson and his son and even the little children…

Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man’s eyes Who are you he asked quietly almost in dread

A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips Only a maester of the Citadel bound in service to Castle Black and the Night’s Watch In my order we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar The old man touched the maester’s chain that hung loosely around his thin fleshless neck My father was Maekar the First of his Name and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight who was his uncle or his father depending on which tale you believe Aemon he called me…

Aemon… Targaryen Jon could scarcely believe it

Once the old man said Once So you see Jon I do know… and knowing I will not tell you stay or go You must make that choice yourself and live with it all the rest of your days As I have His voice fell to a whisper As I have…





DAENERYS

When the battle was done Dany rode her silver through the fields of the dead Her handmaids and the men of her khas came after smiling and jesting among themselves

Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground while arakhs and arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood Dying horses lifted their heads and screamed at her as she rode past Wounded men moaned and prayed Jaqqa rhan moved among them the mercy men with their heavy axes taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike After them would scurry a flock of small girls pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets Last of all the dogs would come sniffing lean and hungry the feral pack that was never far behind the khalasar

The sheep had been dead longest There seemed to be thousands of them black with flies arrow shafts bristling from each carcass Khal Ogo’s riders had done that Dany knew no man of Drogo’s khalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill

The town was afire black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky Beneath broken walls of dried mud riders galloped back and forth swinging their long whips as they herded the survivors from the smoking rubble The women and children of Ogo’s khalasar walked with a sullen pride even in defeat and bondage they were slaves now but they seemed not to fear it It was different with the townsfolk Dany pitied them she remembered what terror felt like Mothers stumbled along with blank dead faces pulling sobbing children by the hand There were only a few men among them cripples and cowards and grandfathers

Ser Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen but the Dothraki called them haesh rakhi the Lamb Men Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki for they had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes Now they looked alien to her squat and flat-faced their black hair cropped unnaturally short They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables and Khal Drogo said they belonged south of the river bend The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep

Dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river A rider cut him off and turned him and the others boxed him in cracking their whips in his face running him this way and that One galloped behind him lashing him across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood Another snared his ankle with a lash and sent him sprawling Finally when the boy could only crawl they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through his back

Ser Jorah met her outside the shattered gate He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail His gauntlets greaves and greathelm were dark grey steel The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he donned his armor but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth tempers had flared longsword had clashed with arakh and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death

Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up Your lord husband awaits you within the town

Drogo took no harm

A few cuts Ser Jorah answered nothing of consequence He slew two khals this day Khal Ogo first and then the son Fogo who became khal when Ogo fell His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair and now Khal Drogo’s every step rings louder than before

Ogo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast where Viserys had been crowned but that was in Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains where every rider was a brother and all quarrels were put aside It was different out in the grass Ogo’s khalasar had been attacking the town when Khal Drogo caught him She wondered what the Lamb Men had thought when they first saw the dust of their horses from atop those cracked-mud walls Perhaps a few the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the prayers of desperate men took it for deliverance

Across the road a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a pile of corpses facedown and thrust himself inside her Other riders dismounted to take their turns That was the sort of deliverance the Dothraki brought the Lamb Men

I am the blood of the dragon Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself as she turned her face away She pressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate

Most of Ogo’s riders fled Ser Jorah was saying Still there may be as many as ten thousand captives

Slaves Dany thought Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver’s Bay She wanted to cry but she told herself that she must be strong This is war this is what it looks like this is the price of the Iron Throne

I’ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen Ser Jorah said They’ll pay a better price than he’d get from a slaving caravan Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls and triple for boys under ten If enough children survive the journey the gold will buy us all the ships we need and hire men to sail them

Behind them the girl being raped made a heartrending sound a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins and she turned the silver’s head Make them stop she commanded Ser Jorah

Khaleesi The knight sounded perplexed

You heard my words she said Stop them She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki Jhogo Quaro you will aid Ser Jorah I want no rape

The warriors exchanged a baffled look

Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer Princess he said you have a gentle heart but you do not understand This is how it has always been Those men have shed blood for the khal Now they claim their reward
