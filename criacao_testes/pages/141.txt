The maester’s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself No begging your forgiveness my lady but it was Lord Jon who—

A bell tolled loudly below them High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade Below two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden a weeping woman carved in veined white marble no doubt meant to be Alyssa

The bad little man Lord Robert said giggling Mother can I make him fly I want to see him fly

Later my sweet baby Lysa promised him

Trial first drawled Ser Lyn Corbray then execution

A moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden The knight was attended by two young squires the sellsword by the Eyrie’s master-at-arms

Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat Large circular rondels enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh while a solid gorget encircled his throat Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision

Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight He wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard and a mail coif High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe with a longer reach… and Bronn was fifteen years younger if she was any judge

They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman facing each other with Lannister between them The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his waist He lifted it high above his head and the light shattered Rainbows danced across the Imp’s face In a high solemn singsong voice the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness to find the truth in this man’s soul to grant him life and freedom if he was innocent death if he was guilty His voice echoed off the surrounding towers

When the last echo had died away the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty departure Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn’s ear before the guardsmen led him away The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from his knee

Robert Arryn Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair When are they going to fight he asked plaintively

Ser Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires The other brought him a triangular shield almost four feet tall heavy oak dotted with iron studs They strapped it to his left forearm When Lysa’s master-at-arms offered Bronn a similar shield the sellsword spat and waved it away Three days growth of coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours until it was too sharp to touch

Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky its pommel was a falcon’s head its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert’s place Isn’t it a lovely thing I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade

The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword Yet she said nothing she was weary of futile arguments with her sister

Make them fight Lord Robert called out

Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute For the Eyrie and the Vale

Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden flanked by his guards It was to him that Bronn turned with a cursory salute

They await your command Lady Lysa said to her lord son

Fight the boy screamed his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair

Ser Vardis swiveled bringing up his heavy shield Bronn turned to face him Their swords rang together once twice a testing The sellsword backed off a step The knight came after holding his shield before him He tried a slash but Bronn jerked back just out of reach and the silver blade cut only air Bronn circled to his right Ser Vardis turned to follow keeping his shield between them The knight pressed forward placing each foot carefully on the uneven ground The sellsword gave way a faint smile playing over his lips Ser Vardis attacked slashing but Bronn leapt away from him hopping lightly over a low moss-covered stone Now the sellsword circled left away from the shield toward the knight’s unprotected side Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs but he did not have the reach Bronn danced farther to his left Ser Vardis turned in place

The man is craven Lord Hunter declared Stand and fight coward Other voices echoed the sentiment

Catelyn looked to Ser Rodrik Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man

She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life had viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time but this was something different and deadlier a dance where the smallest misstep meant death And as she watched the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark as vivid as if it had been yesterday

They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail he took off most of his armor Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear but she had turned him away Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark and so it was to him that she gave her token a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun As she pressed it into his hand she pleaded with him He is only a foolish boy but I have loved him like a brother It would grieve me to see him die And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her

That fight was over almost as soon as it began Brandon was a man grown and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair raining steel on him with every step until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds Yield he called more than once but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on grimly When the river was lapping at their ankles Brandon finally ended it with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal He looked at her as he fell and murmured Cat as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers She thought she had forgotten that

That was the last time she had seen his face… until the day she was brought before him in King’s Landing

A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun but her lord father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay abed Lysa helped their maester nurse him she had been softer and shyer in those days Edmure had called on him as well but Petyr had sent him away Her brother had acted as Brandon’s squire at the duel and Littlefinger would not forgive that As soon as he was strong enough to be moved Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter to finish his healing on the Fingers upon the windswept jut of rock where he’d been born
