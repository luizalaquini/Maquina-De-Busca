482 There shall be no more praise of Moab in Heshbon they have
devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a
nation Also thou shalt be cut down O Madmen the sword shall pursue
thee

483 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim spoiling and great
destruction

484 Moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard

485 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up for
in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of
destruction

486 Flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness

487 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures
thou shalt also be taken and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity
with his priests and his princes together

488 And the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall
escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be
destroyed as the LORD hath spoken

489 Give wings unto Moab that it may flee and get away for the
cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein

4810 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully and
cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood

4811 Moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on
his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither
hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and
his scent is not changed

4812 Therefore behold the days come saith the LORD that I will
send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall
empty his vessels and break their bottles

4813 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was
ashamed of Bethel their confidence

4814 How say ye We are mighty and strong men for the war  4815
Moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young
men are gone down to the slaughter saith the King whose name is the
LORD of hosts

4816 The calamity of Moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth
fast

4817 All ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his
name say How is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rod
4818 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon come down from thy glory
and sit in thirst for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee and
he shall destroy thy strong holds

4819 O inhabitant of Aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that
fleeth and her that escapeth and say What is done  4820 Moab is
confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in Arnon
that Moab is spoiled 4821 And judgment is come upon the plain
country upon Holon and upon Jahazah and upon Mephaath 4822 And
upon Dibon and upon Nebo and upon Bethdiblathaim 4823 And upon
Kiriathaim and upon Bethgamul and upon Bethmeon 4824 And upon
Kerioth and upon Bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of Moab
far or near

4825 The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the
LORD

4826 Make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the LORD
Moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision

4827 For was not Israel a derision unto thee was he found among
thieves  for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy

4828 O ye that dwell in Moab leave the cities and dwell in the
rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the
holes mouth

4829 We have heard the pride of Moab he is exceeding proud his
loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of
his heart

4830 I know his wrath saith the LORD but it shall not be so his
lies shall not so effect it

4831 Therefore will I howl for Moab and I will cry out for all Moab
mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres

4832 O vine of Sibmah I will weep for thee with the weeping of
Jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of
Jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage

4833 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from
the land of Moab and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses
none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shouting

4834 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh and even unto Jahaz
