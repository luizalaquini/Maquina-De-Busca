Bro… our own men Aemon’s words hurt a hundred times worse than his fingers Jon remembered the Old Bear as last he’d seen him standing before his tent with his raven on his arm croaking for corn Mormont gone He had feared it ever since he’d seen the aftermath of battle on the Fist yet it was no less a blow Who was it Who turned on him

Garth of Oldtown Ollo Lophand Dirk… thieves cowards and killers the lot of them We should have seen it coming The Watch is not what it was Too few honest men to keep the rogues in line Donal Noye turned the maester’s blades in the fire A dozen true men made it back Dolorous Edd Giant your friend the Aurochs We had the tale from them

Only a dozen Two hundred men had left Castle Black with Lord Commander Mormont two hundred of the Watch’s best Does this mean Marsh is Lord Commander then The Old Pomegranate was amiable and a diligent First Steward but he was woefully ill-suited to face a wildling host

For the nonce until we can hold a choosing said Maester Aemon Clydas bring me the flask

A choosing With Qhorin Halfhand and Ser Jaremy Rykker both dead and Ben Stark still missing who was there Not Bowen Marsh or Ser Wynton Stout that was certain Had Thoren Smallwood survived the Fist or Ser Ottyn Wythers No it will be Cotter Pyke or Ser Denys Mallister Which though The commanders at the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch were good men but very different Ser Denys courtly and cautious as chivalrous as he was elderly Pyke younger bastard-born rough-tongued and bold to a fault Worse the two men despised each other The Old Bear had always kept them far apart at opposite ends of the Wall The Mallisters had a bone-deep mistrust of the ironborn Jon knew

A stab of pain reminded him of his own woes The maester squeezed his hand Clydas is bringing milk of the poppy

Jon tried to rise I don’t need—

You do Aemon said firmly This will hurt

Donal Noye crossed the room and shoved Jon back onto his back Be still or I’ll tie you down Even with only one arm the smith handled him as if he were a child Clydas returned with a green flask and a rounded stone cup Maester Aemon poured it full Drink this

Jon had bitten his lip in his struggles He could taste blood mingled with the thick chalky potion It was all he could do not to retch it back up

Clydas brought a basin of warm water and Maester Aemon washed the pus and blood from his wound Gentle as he was even the lightest touch made Jon want to scream The Magnar’s men are disciplined and they have bronze armor he told them Talking helped keep his mind off his leg

The Magnar’s a lord on Skagos Noye said There were Skagossons at Eastwatch when I first came to the Wall I remember hearing them talk of him

Jon was using the word in its older sense I think Maester Aemon said not as a family name but as a title It derives from the Old Tongue

It means lord Jon agreed Styr is the Magnar of some place called Thenn in the far north of the Frostfangs He has a hundred of his own men and a score of raiders who know the Gift almost as well as we do Mance never found the horn though that’s something The Horn of Winter that’s what he was digging for up along the Milkwater

Maester Aemon paused washcloth in hand The Horn of Winter is an ancient legend Does the King-beyond-the-Wall truly believe that such a thing exists

They all do said Jon Ygritte said they opened a hundred graves… graves of kings and heroes all over the valley of the Milkwater but they never…

Who is Ygritte Donal Noye asked pointedly

A woman of the free folk How could he explain Ygritte to them She’s warm and smart and funny and she can kiss a man or slit his throat She’s with Styr but she’s not… she’s young only a girl in truth wild but she… She killed an old man for building a fire His tongue felt thick and clumsy The milk of the poppy was clouding his wits I broke my vows with her I never meant to but… It was wrong Wrong to love her wrong to leave her… I wasn’t strong enough The Halfhand commanded me ride with them watch I must not balk I… His head felt as if it were packed with wet wool

Maester Aemon sniffed Jon’s wound again Then he put the bloody cloth back in the basin and said Donal the hot knife if you please I shall need you to hold him still

I will not scream Jon told himself when he saw the blade glowing red hot But he broke that vow as well Donal Noye held him down while Clydas helped guide the maester’s hand Jon did not move except to pound his fist against the table again and again and again The pain was so huge he felt small and weak and helpless inside it a child whimpering in the dark Ygritte he thought when the stench of burning flesh was in his nose and his own shriek echoing in her ears Ygritte I had to For half a heartbeat the agony started to ebb But then the iron touched him once again and he fainted

When his eyelids fluttered open he was wrapped in thick wool and floating He could not seem to move but that did not matter For a time he dreamed that Ygritte was with him tending him with gentle hands Finally he closed his eyes and slept

The next waking was not so gentle The room was dark but under the blankets the pain was back a throbbing in his leg that turned into a hot knife at the least motion Jon learned that the hard way when he tried to see if he still had a leg Gasping he swallowed a scream and made another fist

Jon A candle appeared and a well-remembered face was looking down on him big ears and all You shouldn’t move

Pyp Jon reached up and the other boy clasped his hand and gave it a squeeze I thought you’d gone…

…with the Old Pomegranate No he thinks I’m too small and green Grenn’s here too

I’m here too Grenn stepped to the other side of the bed I fell asleep

Jon’s throat was dry Water he gasped Grenn brought it and held it to his lips I saw the Fist he said after a long swallow The blood and the dead horses… Noye said a dozen made it back… who

Dywen did Giant Dolorous Edd Sweet Donnel Hill Ulmer Left Hand Lew Garth Greyfeather Four or five more Me

Sam

Grenn looked away He killed one of the Others Jon I saw it He stabbed him with that dragonglass knife you made him and we started calling him Sam the Slayer He hated that

Sam the Slayer Jon could hardly imagine a less likely warrior than Sam Tarly What happened to him

We left him Grenn sounded miserable I shook him and screamed at him even slapped his face Giant tried to drag him to his feet but he was too heavy Remember in training how he’d curl up on the ground and lie there whimpering At Craster’s he wouldn’t even whimper Dirk and Ollo were tearing up the walls looking for food Garth and Garth were fighting some of the others were raping Craster’s wives Dolorous Edd figured Dirk’s bunch would kill all the loyal men to keep us from telling what they’d done and they had us two to one We left Sam with the Old Bear He wouldn’t move Jon

You were his brother he almost said How could you leave him amongst wildlings and murderers

He might still be alive said Pyp He might surprise us all and come riding up tomorrow

With Mance Rayder’s head aye Grenn was trying to sound cheerful Jon could tell Sam the Slayer

Jon tried to sit again It was as much a mistake as the first time He cried out cursing

Grenn go wake Maester Aemon said Pyp Tell him Jon needs more milk of the poppy

Yes Jon thought No he said The Magnar…

We know said Pyp The sentries on the Wall have been told to keep one eye on the south and Donal Noye dispatched some men to Weatherback Ridge to watch the kingsroad Maester Aemon’s sent birds to Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower too

Maester Aemon shuffled to the bedside one hand on Grenn’s shoulder Jon be gentle with yourself It is good that you have woken but you must give yourself time to heal We drowned the wound with boiling wine and closed you up with a poultice of nettle mustard seed and moldy bread but unless you rest…

I can’t Jon fought through the pain to sit Mance will be here soon… thousands of men giants mammoths… has word been sent to Winterfell To the king Sweat dripped off his brow He closed his eyes a moment

Grenn gave Pyp a strange look He doesn’t know

Jon said Maester Aemon much and more happened while you were away and little of it good Balon Greyjoy has crowned himself again and sent his longships against the north Kings sprout like weeds at every hand and we have sent appeals to all of them yet none will come They have more pressing uses for their swords and we are far off and forgotten And Winterfell… Jon be strong… Winterfell is no more…

No more Jon stared at Aemon’s white eyes and wrinkled face My brothers are at Winterfell Bran and Rickon…

The maester touched his brow I am so very sorry Jon Your brothers died at the command of Theon Greyjoy after he took Winterfell in his father’s name When your father’s bannermen threatened to retake it he put the castle to the torch

Your brothers were avenged Grenn said Bolton’s son killed all the ironmen and it’s said he’s flaying Theon Greyjoy inch by inch for what he did

I’m sorry Jon Pyp squeezed his shoulder We are all

Jon had never liked Theon Greyjoy but he had been their father’s ward Another spasm of pain twisted up his leg and the next he knew he was flat on his back again There’s some mistake he insisted At Queenscrown I saw a direwolf a grey direwolf… grey… it knew me If Bran was dead could some part of him live on in his wolf as Orell lived within his eagle

Drink this Grenn held a cup to his lips Jon drank His head was full of wolves and eagles the sound of his brothers’ laughter The faces above him began to blur and fade They can’t be dead Theon would never do that And Winterfell… grey granite oak and iron crows wheeling around the towers steam rising off the hot pools in the godswood the stone kings sitting on their thrones… how could Winterfell be gone

When the dreams took him he found himself back home once more splashing in the hot pools beneath a huge white weirwood that had his father’s face Ygritte was with him laughing at him shedding her skins till she was naked as her name day trying to kiss him but he couldn’t not with his father watching He was the blood of Winterfell a man of the Night’s Watch I will not father a bastard he told her I will not I will not You know nothing Jon Snow she whispered her skin dissolving in the hot water the flesh beneath sloughing off her bones until only skull and skeleton remained and the pool bubbled thick and red
