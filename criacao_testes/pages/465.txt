Davos wanted to protest He was a knight now no longer a smuggler and he had never been an assassin Yet when he opened his mouth the words would not come This was Stannis his just lord to whom he owed all he was And he had his sons to consider as well Gods be good what has she done to him

You are quiet Stannis observed

And should remain so Davos told himself yet instead he said My liege you must have the castle I see that now but surely there are other ways Cleaner ways Let Ser Cortnay keep the bastard boy and he may well yield

I must have the boy Davos Must Melisandre has seen that in the flames as well

Davos groped for some other answer Storm’s End holds no knight who can match Ser Guyard or Lord Caron or any of a hundred others sworn to your service This single combat… could it be that Ser Cortnay seeks for a way to yield with honor Even if it means his own life

A troubled look crossed the king’s face like a passing cloud More like he plans some treachery There will be no combat of champions Ser Cortnay was dead before he ever threw that glove The flames do not lie Davos

Yet they require me to make them true he thought It had been a long time since Davos Seaworth felt so sad

And so it was that he found himself once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of night steering a tiny boat with a black sail The sky was the same and the sea The same salt smell was in the air and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered it A thousand flickering campfires burned around the castle as the fires of the Tyrells and Redwynes had sixteen years before But all the rest was different

The last time it was life I brought to Storm’s End shaped to look like onions This time it is death in the shape of Melisandre of Asshai Sixteen years ago the sails had cracked and snapped with every shift of wind until he’d pulled them down and gone on with muffled oars Even so his heart had been in his gullet The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax after so long however and they had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin This time the only ships in sight belonged to Stannis and the only danger would come from watchers on the castle walls Even so Davos was taut as a bowstring

Melisandre huddled upon a thwart lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered her from head to heels her face a paleness beneath the cowl Davos loved the water He slept best when he had a deck rocking beneath him and the sighing of the wind in his rigging was a sweeter sound to him than any a singer could make with his harp strings Even the sea brought him no comfort tonight though I can smell the fear on you ser knight the red woman said softly

Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors And tonight I am no knight Tonight I am Davos the smuggler again Would that you were an onion

She laughed Is it me you fear Or what we do

What you do I’ll have no part of it

Your hand raised the sail Your hand holds the tiller

Silent Davos tended to his course The shore was a snarl of rocks so he was taking them well out across the bay He would wait for the tide to turn before coming about Storm’s End dwindled behind them but the red woman seemed unconcerned Are you a good man Davos Seaworth she asked

Would a good man be doing this I am a man he said I am kind to my wife but I have known other women I have tried to be a father to my sons to help make them a place in this world Aye I’ve broken laws but I never felt evil until tonight I would say my parts are mixed m’lady Good and bad

A grey man she said Neither white nor black but partaking of both Is that what you are Ser Davos

What if I am It seems to me that most men are grey

If half of an onion is black with rot it is a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil

The fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky and the land was almost out of sight It was time to come about Watch your head my lady He pushed on the tiller and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned Melisandre leaned under the swinging yard one hand on the gunwale calm as ever Wood creaked canvas cracked and water splashed so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear Davos knew better The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm’s End and that but faintly

A rippling wake spread out behind as they swung back toward the shore You speak of men and onions Davos said to Melisandre What of women Is it not the same for them Are you good or evil my lady

That made her chuckle Oh good I am a knight of sorts myself sweet ser A champion of light and life

Yet you mean to kill a man tonight he said As you killed Maester Cressen

Your maester poisoned himself He meant to poison me but I was protected by a greater power and he was not

And Renly Baratheon Who was it who killed him

Her head turned Beneath the shadow of the cowl her eyes burned like pale red candle flames Not I

Liar Davos was certain now
