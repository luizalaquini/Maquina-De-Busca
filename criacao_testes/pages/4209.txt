their roots in the neighbouring sea and by the time
that horse man and corpse entered Yalbury Great
Wood these silent workings of an invisible hand had
reached them and they were completely enveloped
this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs and the
first fog of the series
The air was as an eye suddenly struck blind The
waggon and its load rolled no longer on the horizontal
division between clearness and opacity but were
imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor
throughout There was no perceptible motion in the
air not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the
beeches birches and firs composing the wood on either
side The trees stood in an attitude of intentness as if
they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock
them A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things
 -- so completely that the crunching of the waggon+
wheels was as a great noise and small rustles which
had never ohtained a hearing except by night were dis+
tinctly individualized
Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden
as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus
then at the
P 342
unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on
each hand indistinct shadowless and spectreiike in
their monochrome of grey He felt anything but cheer+
ful and wished he had the company even of a child or
dog Stopping the home he listened Not a footstep
or wheel was audible anywhere around and the dead
silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from
a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart
rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny The fog had by
this time saturated the trees and this was the first
dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves The
hollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully
of the grim Leveller Then hard by came down another
drop then two or three Presently there was a continual
tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves the
road and the travellers The nearer boughs were beadcd
with the mist to the greyness of aged men and the rusty+
red leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops
like diamonds on auburn hair
At the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town just beyond
this wood was the old inn Bucks Head It was about
a mile and a half from Weatherbury and in the meridian
times of stage-coach travelling had been the place
where many coaches changed and kept their relays
of horses All the old stabling was now pulled down
and little remained besides the habitable inn itself
which standing a little way back from the road sig+
nified its existence to people far up and down the
highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough
of an elm on the opposite side of the way
Travellers  -- for the variety 1tourist1 had hardly
developed into a distinct species at this date -- some+
times said in passing when they cast their eyes up to
the sign-bearing tree that artists were fond of repre+
senting the signboard hanging thus but that they
themselves had never before noticed so perfect an
instance in actual working order It was near this tree
that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak
crept on his first journey to Weatherbury but owing
to the darkness the sign and the inn had been un+
observed
The manners of the inn were of the old-established

type Indeed in the minds of its frequenters they
existed as unalterable formule  1eg1 --
Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor
For tobacco shout
In calling for the girl in waiting say Maid
Ditto for the landlady Old Soul etc etc
It was a relief to Josephs heart when the friendly
signboard came in view and stopping his horse
immediately beneath it he proceeded to fulfil an
intention made a long time before His spirits were
oozing out of him quite He turned the horses head
to the green bank and entered the hostel for a mug
of ale
Going down into the kitchen of the inn the floor
of which was a step below the passage which in its
BUCKS HEAD
turn was a step below the road outside what should
Joseph see to gladden his eyes but two copper-coloured
discs in the form of the countenances of Mr Jan
Coggan and Mr Mark Clark These owners of the
two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood
within the pale of respectability were now sitting face
to face over a threeiegged circular table having an
iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally
elbowed off they might have been said to resemble
the setting sun and the full moon shining 1vis-a-vis1
across the globe
 Why tis neighbour Poorgrass said Mark Clark
Im sure your face dont praise your mistresss table

Ive had a very pale companion for the last four
miles said Joseph indulging in a shudder toned
down by resignation And to speak the truth twas
