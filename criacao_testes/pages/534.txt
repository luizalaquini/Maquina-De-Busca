You can do better than that Cersei said Drain the cup Sansa Your queen commands you It almost gagged her but Sansa emptied the cup gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming

More Cersei asked

No Please

The queen looked displeased When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier I lied to you Would you like to hear the truth Sansa Would you like to know why he’s really here

She did not dare answer but it did not matter The queen raised a hand and beckoned never waiting for a reply Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall but suddenly there he was striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat He carried Ice unsheathed Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s head Sansa recalled but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious There was blood drying on the rippling steel the red already fading to brown Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us said Cersei

Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle His pox-scarred face had no expression

He’s here for us he says the queen said Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne but I will not suffer him to judge me I do not mean for him to have us alive

Us

You heard me So perhaps you had best pray again Sansa and for a different outcome The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister I promise you She reached out and touched Sansa’s hair brushing it lightly away from her neck





TYRION

The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds and a fourth larger than the others standing well out into the river firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult

Wedge Tyrion commanded as his men streamed out of the sally port They formed up in spearhead with him at the point Ser Mandon Moore took the place to his right flames shimmering against the white enamel of his armor his dead eyes shining passionlessly through his helm He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white with the pure white shield of the Kingsguard strapped to his arm On the left Tyrion was surprised to see Podrick Payne a sword in his hand You’re too young he said at once Go back

I’m your squire my lord

Tyrion could spare no time for argument With me then Stay close He kicked his horse into motion

They rode knee to knee following the line of the looming walls Joffrey’s standard streamed crimson and gold from Ser Mandon’s staff stag and lion dancing hoof to paw They went from a walk to a trot wheeling wide around the base of the tower Arrows darted from the city walls while stones spun and tumbled overhead crashing down blindly onto earth and water steel and flesh Ahead loomed the King’s Gate and a surging mob of soldiers wrestling with a huge ram a shaft of black oak with an iron head Archers off the ships surrounded them loosing their shafts at whatever defenders showed themselves on the gatehouse walls Lances Tyrion commanded He sped to a canter

The ground was sodden and slippery equal parts mud and blood His stallion stumbled over a corpse his hooves sliding and churning the earth and for an instant Tyrion feared his charge would end with him tumbling from the saddle before he even reached the foe but somehow he and his horse both managed to keep their balance Beneath the gate men were turning hurriedly trying to brace for the shock Tyrion lifted his axe and shouted King’s Landing Other voices took up the cry and now the arrowhead flew a long scream of steel and silk pounding hooves and sharp blades kissed by fire

Ser Mandon dropped the point of his lance at the last possible instant and drove Joffrey’s banner through the chest of a man in a studded jerkin lifting him full off his feet before the shaft snapped Ahead of Tyrion was a knight whose surcoat showed a fox peering through a ring of flowers Florent was his first thought but helmless ran a close second He smashed the man in the face with all the weight of axe and arm and charging horse taking off half his head The shock of impact numbed his shoulder Shagga would laugh at me he thought riding on

A spear thudded against his shield Pod galloped beside him slashing down at every foe they passed Dimly he heard cheers from the men on the walls The battering ram crashed down into the mud forgotten in an instant as its handlers fled or turned to fight Tyrion rode down an archer opened a spearman from shoulder to armpit glanced a blow off a swordfish-crested helm At the ram his big red reared but the black stallion leapt the obstacle smoothly and Ser Mandon flashed past him death in snow-white silk His sword sheared off limbs cracked heads broke shields asunder—though few enough of the enemy had made it across the river with shields intact

Tyrion urged his mount over the ram Their foes were fleeing He moved his head right to left and back again but saw no sign of Podrick Payne An arrow clattered against his cheek missing his eye slit by an inch His jolt of fear almost unhorsed him If I’m to sit here like a stump I had as well paint a target on my breastplate

He spurred his horse back into motion trotting over and around a scatter of corpses Downriver the Blackwater was jammed with the hulks of burning galleys Patches of wildfire still floated atop the water sending fiery green plumes swirling twenty feet into the air They had dispersed the men on the battering ram but he could see fighting all along the riverfront Ser Balon Swann’s men most like or Lancel’s trying to throw the enemy back into the water as they swarmed ashore off the burning ships We’ll ride for the Mud Gate he commanded

Ser Mandon shouted The Mud Gate And they were off again King’s Landing his men cried raggedly and Halfman Halfman He wondered who had taught them that Through the steel and padding of his helm he heard anguished screams the hungry crackle of flame the shuddering of warhorns and the brazen blast of trumpets Fire was everywhere Gods be good no wonder the Hound was frightened It’s the flames he fears…

A splintering crash rang across the Blackwater as a stone the size of a horse landed square amidships on one of the galleys Ours or theirs Through the roiling smoke he could not tell His wedge was gone every man was his own battle now I should have turned back he thought riding on

The axe was heavy in his fist A handful still followed him the rest dead or fled He had to wrestle his stallion to keep his head to the east The big destrier liked fire no more than Sandor Clegane had but the horse was easier to cow

Men were crawling from the river men burned and bleeding coughing up water staggering most dying He led his troop among them delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand The war shrank to the size of his eye slit Knights twice his size fled from him or stood and died They seemed little things and fearful Lannister he shouted slaying His arm was red to the elbow glistening in the light off the river When his horse reared again he shook his axe at the stars and heard them call out Halfman Halfman Tyrion felt drunk

The battle fever He had never thought to experience it himself though Jaime had told him of it often enough How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop how the past and the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant how fear fled and thought fled and even your body You don’t feel your wounds then or the ache in your back from the weight of the armor or the sweat running down into your eyes You stop feeling you stop thinking you stop being you there is only the fight the foe this man and then the next and the next and the next and you know they are afraid and tired but you’re not you’re alive and death is all around you but their swords move so slowly you can dance through them laughing Battle fever I am half a man and drunk with slaughter let them kill me if they can
