She’s not alone Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall and behind him Hot Pie leading her horse In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand Gendry looked almost a man grown and dangerous Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie Do like she says and leave us be warned Gendry

Two and three the singer counted and is that all of you And horses too lovely horses Where did you steal them

They’re ours Arya watched them carefully The singer kept distracting her with his talk but it was the archer who was the danger If he should pull an arrow from the ground…

Will you give us your names like honest men the singer asked the boys

I’m Hot Pie Hot Pie said at once

Aye and good for you The man smiled It’s not every day I meet a lad with such a tasty name And what would your friends be called Mutton Chop and Squab

Gendry scowled down from his saddle Why should I tell you my name I haven’t heard yours

Well as to that I’m Tom of Sevenstreams but Tom Sevenstrings is what they call me or Tom o’ Sevens This great lout with the brown teeth is Lem short for Lemoncloak It’s yellow you see and Lem’s a sour sort And young fellow me lad over there is Anguy or Archer as we like to call him

Now who are you demanded Lem in the deep voice that Arya had heard through the branches of the willow

She was not about to give up her true name as easy as that Squab if you want she said I don’t care

The big man laughed A squab with a sword he said Now there’s something you don’t often see

I’m the Bull said Gendry taking his lead from Arya She could not blame him for preferring Bull to Mutton Chop

Tom Sevenstrings strummed his harp Hot Pie Squab and the Bull Escaped from Lord Bolton’s kitchen did you

How did you know Arya demanded uneasy

You bear his sigil on your chest little one

She had forgotten that for an instant Beneath her cloak she still wore her fine page’s doublet with the flayed man of the Dreadfort sewn on her breast Don’t call me little one

Why not said Lem You’re little enough

I’m bigger than I was I’m not a child Children didn’t kill people and she had

I can see that Squab You’re none of you children not if you were Bolton’s

We never were Hot Pie never knew when to keep quiet We were at Harrenhal before he came that’s all

So you’re lion cubs is that the way of it said Tom

Not that either We’re nobody’s men Whose men are you

Anguy the Archer said We’re king’s men

Arya frowned Which king

King Robert said Lem in his yellow cloak

That old drunk said Gendry scornfully He’s dead some boar killed him everyone knows that

Aye lad said Tom Sevenstrings and more’s the pity He plucked a sad chord from his harp
