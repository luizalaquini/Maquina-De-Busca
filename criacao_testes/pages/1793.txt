opinion He knew now that he was right and that
Troy was wrong Every voice in nature was unanimous
in bespeaking change But two distinct translations
attached to these dumb expressions Apparently there
was to be a thunder-storm and afterwards a cold con+
tinuous rain The creeping things seemed to know all
about the later rain hut little of the interpolated
thunder-storm  whilst the sheep knew all about the
thunder-storm and nothing of the later rain
This complication of weathers being uncommon
was all the more to be feared Oak returned to the
stack-yard All was silent here and the conical tips of
the ricks jutted darkly into the sky There were five
wheat-ricks in this yard and three stacks of barley
The wheat when threshed would average about thirty
quarters to each stack  the barley at least forty Their
value to Bathsheba and indeed to anybody Oak
mentally estimated by the following simple calcula+
tion  --
5 x 30 = 150 quarters= 500fl
3 x 40=120 quarters= 250l
Total   750l
Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form
that money can wear -- that of necessary food for man
and beast  should the risk be run cf deteriorating this
bulk of corn to less than half its value because of the
instability of a woman  Never if I can prevent it 
said Gabriel

Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before
him But man even to himself is a palimpsest having
an ostensible writing and another beneath the lines
It is possible that there was this golden legend under
the utilitarian one I will help to my last effort the
woman I have loved so dearly
He went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain
assistance for covering the ricks that very

was silent within and he would have passed on in the
belief that the party had broken up had not a dim
light yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish
whiteness outside streamed through a knot-hole in the
folding doors
Gabriel looked in An unusual picture met his
eye
The candles suspended among the evergreens had
burnt down to their sockets and in some cases the
leaves tied about them were scorched Many of the
lights had quite gone out others smoked and stank
grease dropping from them upon the floor Here
under the table and leaning against forms and chairs
in every conceivable attitude except the perpendicular 
were the wretched persons of all the work-folk the hair
of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of
mops and brooms In the midst of these shone red
and distinct the figure of Sergeant Troy leaning back
in a chair Coggan was on his back with his mouth
open huzzing forth snores as were several others  the
united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming
a subdued roar like London from a distance Joseph
Poorgrass was curled round in the fashion of a hedge+
hog apparently in attempts to present the least possible
portion of his surface to the air and behind him was
dimly visible an unimportant remnant of William Smali
bury The glasses and cups still stood upon the table
a water-jug being overturned from which a small rill
after tracing its course with marvellous precision down
the centre of the long table fell into the neck of the
unconscious Mark Clark in a steady monotonous drip
like the dripping of a stalactite in a cave
Gabriel glanced hopelessly at the group which with
one or two exceptions composed all the able-bodied
men upon the farm He saw at once that if the ricks
were to be saved that night or even the next morning
he must save them with his own hands
A faint  ting-ting  resounded from under Coggans
waistcoat It was Coggans watch striking the hour of
two
Oak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon
who usually undertook the rough thatching of the home+
stead and shook him The shaking was without effect
Gabriel shouted in his ear  wheres your thatching+
beetle and rick-stick and spars  
 Under the staddles said Moon mechanically with
the unconscious promptness of a medium
Gabriel let go his head and it dropped upon the
floor like a bowl He then went to Susan Talls
husband
 wheres the key of the granary  
No answer The question was repeated with the
same result To be shouted to at night was evidently
less of a novelty to Susan Talls husband than to
Matthew Moon Oak flung down Talls head into the
corner again and turned away
To be just the men were not greatly to blame for
this painful and demoralizing termination to the
evenings entertainment Sergeant Troy had so strenu+
ously insisted glass in hand that drinking should be
the bond of their union that those who wished to refuse
