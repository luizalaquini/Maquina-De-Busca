1326 Men and brethren children of the stock of Abraham and
whosoever among you feareth God to you is the word of this salvation
sent

1327 For they that dwell at Jerusalem and their rulers because they
knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him

1328 And though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain

1329 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they
took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre

1330 But God raised him from the dead 1331 And he was seen many
days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem who are
his witnesses unto the people

1332 And we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which
was made unto the fathers 1333 God hath fulfilled the same unto us
their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also
written in the second psalm Thou art my Son this day have I begotten
thee

1334 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no
more to return to corruption he said on this wise I will give you
the sure mercies of David

1335 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm Thou shalt not suffer
thine Holy One to see corruption

1336 For David after he had served his own generation by the will of
God fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
1337 But he whom God raised again saw no corruption

1338 Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins 1339 And by
him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye
could not be justified by the law of Moses

1340 Beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in
the prophets 1341 Behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for
I work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe
though a man declare it unto you

1342 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath

1343 Now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to
them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God

1344 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
hear the word of God

1345 But when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with
envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul
contradicting and blaspheming

1346 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said It was necessary
that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing
ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
lo we turn to the Gentiles

1347 For so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be
a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
ends of the earth

1348 And when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified
the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed

1349 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
region

1350 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the
chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and
Barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts

1351 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came
unto Iconium

1352 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost

141 And it came to pass in Iconium that they went both together into
the synagogue of the Jews and so spake that a great multitude both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed

142 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and made their
minds evil affected against the brethren

143 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord which
gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and
wonders to be done by their hands

144 But the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the
Jews and part with the apostles

145 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also
