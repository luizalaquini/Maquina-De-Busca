when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels
were lifted up

120 Whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their
spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels

121 When those went these went and when those stood these stood
and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted
up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels

122 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth
over their heads above

123 And under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward
the other every one had two which covered on this side and every
one had two which covered on that side their bodies

124 And when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the
noise of great waters as the voice of the Almighty the voice of
speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their
wings

125 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
heads when they stood and had let down their wings

126 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man
above upon it

127 And I saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round
about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and
from the appearance of his loins even downward I saw as it were the
appearance of fire and it had brightness round about

128 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about This was
the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD And when I
saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of one that spake

21 And he said unto me Son of man stand upon thy feet and I will
speak unto thee

22 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me
upon my feet that I heard him that spake unto me

23 And he said unto me Son of man I send thee to the children of
Israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and
their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day

24 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted I do send thee
unto them and thou shalt say unto them Thus saith the Lord GOD

25 And they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear
for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been
a prophet among them

26 And thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of
their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost
dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed
at their looks though they be a rebellious house

27 And thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear
or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious

28 But thou son of man hear what I say unto thee Be not thou
rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that I
give thee

29 And when I looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a
roll of a book was therein 210 And he spread it before me and it
was written within and without and there was written therein
lamentations and mourning and woe

31 Moreover he said unto me Son of man eat that thou findest eat
this roll and go speak unto the house of Israel

32 So I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll

33 And he said unto me Son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill
thy bowels with this roll that I give thee Then did I eat it and it
was in my mouth as honey for sweetness

34 And he said unto me Son of man go get thee unto the house of
Israel and speak with my words unto them

35 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an
hard language but to the house of Israel 36 Not to many people of a
strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not
understand Surely had I sent thee to them they would have hearkened
unto thee

37 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee for they will
not hearken unto me for all the house of Israel are impudent and
hardhearted

38 Behold I have made thy face strong against their faces and thy
