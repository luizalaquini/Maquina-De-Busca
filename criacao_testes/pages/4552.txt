Lady Tanda flushed with shame No my lady but we thank you kindly You must forgive my daughter she has not been well

I don’t want to Lollys clutched at her maid a slender pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat onto those iron spikes Please please I don’t want to

Sansa spoke to her gently We’ll all be thrice protected inside and there’s to be food and drink and song as well

Lollys gaped at her mouth open She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears I don’t want to

You have to her sister Falyse said sharply and that is the end of it Shae help me They each took an elbow and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge Sansa followed with their mother She’s been sick Lady Tanda said If a babe can be termed a sickness Sansa thought It was common gossip that Lollys was with child

The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords Another sat at the foot of the stair—a real guard would have been standing not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside

The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand but it could still seat a hundred and it made up in grace what it lacked in space Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce so the torches burned twice as bright the walls were paneled in richly carved wood and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle A line of arched windows ran along the south wall but they had been closed off with heavy draperies Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike It makes no matter Sansa thought The war is with us

Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables along with a handful of old men and young boys The women were wives daughters mothers and sisters Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis Many would not return The air was heavy with the knowledge As Joffrey’s betrothed Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail and held his sword before him her father’s greatsword Ice near as tall as he was Its point rested on the floor and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip Sansa’s breath caught in her throat Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare He turned his gaunt pox-ravaged face toward her

What is he doing here she asked Osfryd Kettleblack He captained the queen’s new red cloak guard

Osfryd grinned Her Grace expects she’ll have need of him before the night’s done

Ser Ilyn was the King’s Justice There was only one service he might be needed for Whose head does she want

All rise for Her Grace Cersei of House Lannister Queen Regent and Protector of the Realm the royal steward cried

Cersei’s gown was snowy linen white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard Her long dagged sleeves showed a lining of gold satin Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare shoulders in thick curls Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds The white made her look strangely innocent almost maidenly but there were points of color on her cheeks

Be seated the queen said when she had taken her place on the dais and be welcome Osfryd Kettleblack held her chair a page performed the same service for Sansa You look pale Sansa Cersei observed Is your red flower still blooming

Yes

How apt The men will bleed out there and you in here The queen signaled for the first course to be served

Why is Ser Ilyn here Sansa blurted out

The queen glanced at the mute headsman To deal with treason and to defend us if need be He was a knight before he was a headsman She pointed her spoon toward the end of the hall where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred When the axes smash down those doors you may be glad of him

I would be gladder if it were the Hound Sansa thought Harsh as he was she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her Won’t your guards protect us

And who will protect us from my guards The queen gave Osfryd a sideways look Loyal sellswords are rare as virgin whores If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in their haste to rip them off They’ll steal what they can and flee along with the serving men washerwomen and stableboys all out to save their own worthless hides Do you have any notion what happens when a city is sacked Sansa No you wouldn’t would you All you know of life you learned from singers and there’s such a dearth of good sacking songs

True knights would never harm women and children The words rang hollow in her ears even as she said them

True knights The queen seemed to find that wonderfully amusing No doubt you’re right So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you sweetling I’m sure it won’t be very long now





DAVOS

Blackwater Bay was rough and choppy whitecaps everywhere Black Betha rode the flood tide her sail cracking and snapping at each shift of wind Wraith and Lady Marya sailed beside her no more than twenty yards between their hulls His sons could keep a line Davos took pride in that

Across the sea warhorns boomed deep throaty moans like the calls of monstrous serpents repeated ship to ship Bring down the sail Davos commanded Lower mast Oarsmen to your oars His son Matthos relayed the commands The deck of Black Betha churned as crewmen ran to their tasks pushing through the soldiers who always seemed to be in the way no matter where they stood Ser Imry had decreed that they would enter the river on oars alone so as not to expose their sails to the scorpions and spitfires on the walls of King’s Landing

Davos could make out Fury well to the southeast her sails shimmering golden as they came down the crowned stag of Baratheon blazoned on the canvas From her decks Stannis Baratheon had commanded the assault on Dragonstone sixteen years before but this time he had chosen to ride with his army trusting Fury and the command of his fleet to his wife’s brother Ser Imry who’d come over to his cause at Storm’s End with Lord Alester and all the other Florents

Davos knew Fury as well as he knew his own ships Above her three hundred oars was a deck given over wholly to scorpions and topside she mounted catapults fore and aft large enough to fling barrels of burning pitch A most formidable ship and very swift as well although Ser Imry had packed her bow to stern with armored knights and men-at-arms at some cost to her speed

The warhorns sounded again commands drifting back from the Fury Davos felt a tingle in his missing fingertips Out oars he shouted Form line A hundred blades dipped down into the water as the oarmaster’s drum began to boom The sound was like the beating of a great slow heart and the oars moved at every stroke a hundred men pulling as one

Wooden wings had sprouted from the Wraith and Lady Marya as well The three galleys kept pace their blades churning the water Slow cruise Davos called Lord Velaryon’s silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark had moved into her position to port of Wraith and Bold Laughter was coming up fast but Harridan was only now getting her oars into the water and Seahorse was still struggling to bring down her mast Davos looked astern Yes there far to the south that could only be Swordfish lagging as ever She dipped two hundred oars and mounted the largest ram in the fleet though Davos had grave doubts about her captain

He could hear soldiers shouting encouragement to each other across the water They’d been little more than ballast since Storm’s End and were eager to get at the foe confident of victory In that they were of one mind with their admiral Lord High Captain Ser Imry Florent

Three days past he had summoned all his captains to a war council aboard the Fury while the fleet lay anchored at the mouth of the Wendwater in order to acquaint them with his dispositions Davos and his sons had been assigned a place in the second line of battle well out on the dangerous starboard wing A place of honor Allard had declared well satisfied with the chance to prove his valor A place of peril his father had pointed out His sons had given him pitying looks even young Maric The Onion Knight has become an old woman he could hear them thinking still a smuggler at heart

Well the last was true enough he would make no apologies for it Seaworth had a lordly ring to it but down deep he was still Davos of Flea Bottom coming home to his city on its three high hills He knew as much of ships and sails and shores as any man in the Seven Kingdoms and had fought his share of desperate fights sword to sword on a wet deck But to this sort of battle he came a maiden nervous and afraid Smugglers do not sound warhorns and raise banners When they smell danger they raise sail and run before the wind

Had he been admiral he might have done it all differently For a start he would have sent a few of his swiftest ships to probe upriver and see what awaited them instead of smashing in headlong When he had suggested as much to Ser Imry the Lord High Captain had thanked him courteously but his eyes were not as polite Who is this lowborn craven those eyes asked Is he the one who bought his knighthood with an onion

With four times as many ships as the boy king Ser Imry saw no need for caution or deceptive tactics He had organized the fleet into ten lines of battle each of twenty ships The first two lines would sweep up the river to engage and destroy Joffrey’s little fleet or the boy’s toys as Ser Imry dubbed them to the mirth of his lordly captains Those that followed would land companies of archers and spearmen beneath the city walls and only then join the fight on the river The smaller slower ships to the rear would ferry over the main part of Stannis’s host from the south bank protected by Salladhor Saan and his Lyseni who would stand out in the bay in case the Lannisters had other ships hidden up along the coast poised to sweep down on their rear

To be fair there was reason for Ser Imry’s haste The winds had not used them kindly on the voyage up from Storm’s End They had lost two cogs to the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay on the very day they set sail a poor way to begin One of the Myrish galleys had foundered in the Straits of Tarth and a storm had overtaken them as they were entering the Gullet scattering the fleet across half the narrow sea All but twelve ships had finally regrouped behind the sheltering spine of Massey’s Hook in the calmer waters of Blackwater Bay but not before they had lost considerable time

Stannis would have reached the Rush days ago The kingsroad ran from Storm’s End straight to King’s Landing a much shorter route than by sea and his host was largely mounted near twenty thousand knights light horse and freeriders Renly’s unwilling legacy to his brother They would have made good time but armored destriers and twelve-foot lances would avail them little against the deep waters of the Blackwater Rush and the high stone walls of the city Stannis would be camped with his lords on the south bank of the river doubtless seething with impatience and wondering what Ser Imry had done with his fleet

Off Merling Rock two days before they had sighted a half-dozen fishing skiffs The fisherfolk had fled before them but one by one they had been overtaken and boarded A small spoon of victory is just the thing to settle the stomach before battle Ser Imry had declared happily It makes the men hungry for a larger helping But Davos had been more interested in what the captives had to say about the defenses at King’s Landing The dwarf had been busy building some sort of boom to close off the mouth of the river though the fishermen differed as to whether the work had been completed or not He found himself wishing it had If the river was closed to them Ser Imry would have no choice but to pause and take stock

The sea was full of sound shouts and calls warhorns and drums and the trill of pipes the slap of wood on water as thousands of oars rose and fell Keep line Davos shouted A gust of wind tugged at his old green cloak A jerkin of boiled leather and a pothelm at his feet were his only armor At sea heavy steel was as like to cost a man his life as to save it he believed Ser Imry and the other highborn captains did not share his view they glittered as they paced their decks

Harridan and Seahorse had slipped into their places now and Lord Celtigar’s Red Claw beyond them To starboard of Allard’s Lady Marya were the three galleys that Stannis had seized from the unfortunate Lord Sunglass Piety Prayer and Devotion their decks crawling with archers Even Swordfish was closing lumbering and rolling through a thickening sea under both oars and sail A ship of that many oars ought to be much faster Davos reflected with disapproval It’s that ram she carries it’s too big she has no balance

The wind was gusting from the south but under oars it made no matter They would be sweeping in on the flood tide but the Lannisters would have the river current to their favor and the Blackwater Rush flowed strong and swift where it met the sea The first shock would inevitably favor the foe We are fools to meet them on the Blackwater Davos thought In any encounter on the open sea their battle lines would envelop the enemy fleet on both flanks driving them inward to destruction On the river though the numbers and weight of Ser Imry’s ships would count for less They could not dress more than twenty ships abreast lest they risk tangling their oars and colliding with each other

Beyond the line of warships Davos could see the Red Keep up on Aegon’s High Hill dark against a lemon sky with the mouth of the Rush opening out below Across the river the south shore was black with men and horses stirring like angry ants as they caught sight of the approaching ships Stannis would have kept them busy building rafts and fletching arrows yet even so the waiting would have been a hard thing to bear Trumpets sounded from among them tiny and brazen soon swallowed by the roar of a thousand shouts Davos closed his stubby hand around the pouch that held his fingerbones and mouthed a silent prayer for luck

Fury herself would center the first line of battle flanked by the Lord Steffon and the Stag of the Sea each of two hundred oars On the port and starboard wings were the hundreds Lady Harra Brightfish Laughing Lord Sea Demon Horned Honor Ragged Jenna Trident Three Swift Sword Princess Rhaenys Dog’s Nose Sceptre Faithful Red Raven Queen Alysanne Cat Courageous and Dragonsbane From every stern streamed the fiery heart of the Lord of Light red and yellow and orange Behind Davos and his sons came another line of hundreds commanded by knights and lordly captains and then the smaller slower Myrish contingent none dipping more than eighty oars Farther back would come the sailed ships carracks and lumbering great cogs and last of all Salladhor Saan in his proud Valyrian a towering three-hundred paced by the rest of his galleys with their distinctive striped hulls The flamboyant Lyseni princeling had not been pleased to be assigned the rear guard but it was clear that Ser Imry trusted him no more than Stannis did Too many complaints and too much talk of the gold he was owed Davos was sorry nonetheless Salladhor Saan was a resourceful old pirate and his crews were born seamen fearless in a fight They were wasted in the rear

Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooo The call rolled across whitecaps and churning oars from the forecastle of the Fury Ser Imry was sounding the attack Ahoooooooooooooooooooo ahooooooooooooooooooooo

Swordfish had joined the line at last though she still had her sail raised Fast cruise Davos barked The drum began to beat more quickly and the stroke picked up the blades of the oars cutting water splash-swoosh splash-swoosh splash-swoosh On deck soldiers banged sword against shield while archers quietly strung their bows and pulled the first arrow from the quivers at their belts The galleys of the first line of battle obscured his vision so Davos paced the deck searching for a better view He saw no sign of any boom the mouth of the river was open as if to swallow them all Except   

In his smuggling days Davos had often jested that he knew the waterfront at King’s Landing a deal better than the back of his hand since he had not spent a good part of his life sneaking in and out of the back of his hand The squat towers of raw new stone that stood opposite one another at the mouth of the Blackwater might mean nothing to Ser Imry Florent but to him it was as if two extra fingers had sprouted from his knuckles

Shading his eyes against the westering sun he peered at those towers more closely They were too small to hold much of a garrison The one on the north bank was built against the bluff with the Red Keep frowning above its counterpart on the south shore had its footing in the water They dug a cut through the bank he knew at once That would make the tower very difficult to assault attackers would need to wade through the water or bridge the little channel Stannis had posted bowmen below to fire up at the defenders whenever one was rash enough to lift his head above the ramparts but otherwise had not troubled

Something flashed down low where the dark water swirled around the base of the tower It was sunlight on steel and it told Davos Seaworth all he needed to know A chain boom    and yet they have not closed the river against us Why

He could make a guess at that as well but there was no time to consider the question A shout went up from the ships ahead and the warhorns blew again the enemy was before them
