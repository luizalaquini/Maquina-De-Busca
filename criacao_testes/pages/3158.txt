neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree

41 And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a
man that is wakened out of his sleep

42 And said unto me What seest thou And I said I have looked and
behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
upon the top thereof 43 And two olive trees by it one upon the
right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof

44 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying
What are these my lord  45 Then the angel that talked with me
answered and said unto me Knowest thou not what these be And I said
No my lord

46 Then he answered and spake unto me saying This is the word of
the LORD unto Zerubbabel saying Not by might nor by power but by
my spirit saith the LORD of hosts

47 Who art thou O great mountain before Zerubbabel thou shalt
become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with
shoutings crying Grace grace unto it

48 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me saying 49 The hands
of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall
also finish it and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent
me unto you

410 For who hath despised the day of small things for they shall
rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with
those seven they are the eyes of the LORD which run to and fro
through the whole earth

411 Then answered I and said unto him What are these two olive
trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side
thereof  412 And I answered again and said unto him What be these
two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden
oil out of themselves  413 And he answered me and said Knowest thou
not what these be And I said No my lord

414 Then said he These are the two anointed ones that stand by the
LORD of the whole earth

51 Then I turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a
flying roll

52 And he said unto me What seest thou And I answered I see a
flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth
thereof ten cubits

53 Then said he unto me This is the curse that goeth forth over the
face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off
as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be
cut off as on that side according to it

54 I will bring it forth saith the LORD of hosts and it shall enter
into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth
falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and
shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof

55 Then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me
Lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth

56 And I said What is it And he said This is an ephah that goeth
forth He said moreover This is their resemblance through all the
earth

57 And behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a
woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah

58 And he said This is wickedness And he cast it into the midst of
the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof

59 Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked and behold there came
out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings
like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the
earth and the heaven

510 Then said I to the angel that talked with me Whither do these
bear the ephah  511 And he said unto me To build it an house in the
land of Shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her
own base

61 And I turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold
there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the
mountains were mountains of brass

62 In the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot
black horses 63 And in the third chariot white horses and in the
fourth chariot grisled and bay horses

64 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me What
are these my lord  65 And the angel answered and said unto me
These are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from
standing before the LORD of all the earth

66 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth
toward the south country
