Computalker provides independent oral and nasal amplitude parameters
pp
Unvoiced excitation can be passed through the main vocal tract
through the aspiration amplitude control AH
In practice the voicing amplitudes AV and AN will probably always be zero when AH
is non-zero for physiological constraints prohibit simultaneous voicing
and aspiration
A second unvoiced excitation path passes through a fricative formant filter
whose resonant frequency can be varied and has its amplitude independently
controlled by AF

FG Table 111  Computalker control parameters
Four of them control amplitudes while the others control frequencies
In the latter case the parameter value is logarithmically related to
the actual frequency of the excitation FV or resonance F1 F2 F3 FF
The ranges over which each frequency can be controlled is shown in the Table
An independent calibration of one particular Computalker has shown that
the logarithmic specifications are met remarkably well
pp
Each parameter is specified to Computalker as an 8-bit number
Parameters are addressed by a 4-bit code and so a total of 12 bits
is transferred in parallel to Computalker from the computer
for each parameter update
Parameters 9 to 14 are unassigned reserved for future expansion is
the official phrase and the last parameter SW governs the position of
an audio on-off switch
pp
Computalker does not contain a clock that is accessible to the user
and so the timing of parameter updates is entirely up to the host computer
Typically a 10 msec interval between frames is used
with interrupts generated by a separate timer
In fact the frame interval can be anywhere between 2 msec and 50 msec
and can be changed to alter the rate of speaking
However it is rather naive to view fast speech as slow
speech speeded up by a linear time compression for in human
speech production the rhythm changes and elisions occur in a rather
more subtle way
Thus it is not particularly useful to be able to alter the frame rate
pp
At each interrupt the host computer transfers values for all of the nine
parameters to Computalker a total of 108 data bits
In theory perhaps it is only necessary to transmit those parameters
whose values have changed but in practice all of them should be updated
regardless
This is because the parameters are stored for the duration of the frame
in analogue sample-and-hold devices  Essentially the parameter value
is represented as the charge on a capacitor
In time em and it takes only a short time em the values drift
Although the drift over 10 msec is insignificant it becomes very
noticeable over longer time periods
If parameters are not updated at all the result is a
whooosh sound up to maximum amplitude in a period of a second or two
Hence it is essential that Computalker be serviced by the computer regularly
to update all its parameters
The audio on-off switch is provided so that the computer can turn off
the sound directly if another program which does not use the device
is to be run
rh Filter implementation
It is hard to get definite information on the implementation
of Computalker
Because it is a commercial device circuit diagrams are not published
It is certainly an analogue rather than a digital implementation
The designer suggests that a configuration like that of Figure 112 is used
for the formant filters Rice 1976

Control is obtained over the resonant frequency by varying the resistance
at the bottom in sympathy with the parameter value
The middle two operational amplifiers can be modelled by a resistance
-Rk in the forward path where k is the digital control value
