He dreamed of a better place a snug little cottage by the sunset sea The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth but he had always been warm there even when they let the fire go out She used to tease me about that he remembered I never thought to feed the fire that had always been a servant’s task We have no servants she would remind me and I would say You have me I’m your servant and she would say A lazy servant What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock my lord and he would tell her They kiss them That would always make her giggle They do not neither They beat them I bet she would say but he would insist No they kiss them just like this He would show her how They kiss their fingers first every one and they kiss their wrists yes and inside their elbows Then they kiss their funny ears all our servants have funny ears Stop laughing And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little bump in them there so like that and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips their    mmmm    mouths    so   

They would kiss for hours and spend whole days doing no more than lolling in bed listening to the waves and touching each other Her body was a wonder to him and she seemed to find delight in his Sometimes she would sing to him I loved a maid as fair as summer with sunlight in her hair I love you Tyrion she would whisper before they went to sleep at night I love your lips I love your voice and the words you say to me and how you treat me gentle I love your face

My face

Yes Yes I love your hands and how you touch me Your cock I love your cock I love how it feels when it’s in me

It loves you too my lady

I love to say your name Tyrion Lannister It goes with mine Not the Lannister t’other part Tyrion and Tysha Tysha and Tyrion Tyrion My lord Tyrion   

Lies he thought all feigned all for gold she was a whore Jaime’s whore Jaime’s gift my lady of the lie Her face seemed to fade away dissolving behind a veil of tears but even after she was gone he could still hear the faint far-off sound of her voice calling his name    my lord can you hear me My lord Tyrion My lord My lord

Through a haze of poppied sleep he saw a soft pink face leaning over him He was back in the dank room with the torn bed hangings and the face was wrong not hers too round with a brown fringe of beard Do you thirst my lord I have your milk your good milk You must not fight no don’t try to move you need your rest He had the copper funnel in one damp pink hand and a flask in the other

As the man leaned close Tyrion’s fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals grabbed pulled The maester dropped the flask spilling milk of the poppy all over the blanket Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man’s fat neck No More he croaked so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken But he must have for the maester choked out a reply Unhand please my lord    need your milk the pain    the chain don’t unhand no   

The pink face was beginning to purple when Tyrion let go The maester reeled back sucking in air His reddened throat showed deep white gouges where the links had pressed His eyes were white too Tyrion raised a hand to his face and made a ripping motion over the hardened mask And again And again

You    you want the bandages off is that it the maester said at last But I’m not to    that would be    be most unwise my lord You are not yet healed the queen would   

The mention of his sister made Tyrion growl Are you one of hers then He pointed a finger at the maester then coiled his hand into a fist Crushing choking a promise unless the fool did as he was bid

Thankfully he understood I    I will do as my lord commands to be sure but    this is unwise your wounds   

Do It Louder that time

Bowing the man left the room only to return a few moments later bearing a long knife with a slender sawtooth blade a basin of water a pile of soft cloths and several flasks By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches so he was half sitting against his pillow The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin beneath the mask A slip of the hand here and Cersei will be free of me he thought He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen only inches above his throat

Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister’s braver creatures After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks There was pain as well but he did his best to ignore that The maester discarded the bandages still crusty with potion Be still now I must wash out the wound His touch was gentle the water warm and soothing The wound Tyrion thought remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes This is like to sting some the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs It did more than sting It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion’s face and twisted a burning poker up his nose His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath but somehow he managed not to scream The maester was clucking like an old hen It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit my lord Still it looks clean good good When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying your wounds were filthy One of your ribs was broken doubtless you can feel it the blow of some mace perhaps or a fall it’s hard to say And you took an arrow in the arm there where it joins the shoulder It showed signs of mortification and for a time I feared you might lose the limb but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots and now it seems to be healing clean   

Name Tyrion breathed up at him Name

The maester blinked Why you are Tyrion Lannister my lord Brother to the queen Do you remember the battle Sometimes with head wounds—

Your name His throat was raw and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words

I am Maester Ballabar

Ballabar Tyrion repeated Bring me Looking glass

My lord the maester said I would not counsel    that might be ah unwise as it were    your wound   

Bring it he had to say His mouth was stiff and sore as if a punch had split his lip And drink Wine No poppy

The maester rose flush-faced and hurried off He came back with a flagon of pale amber wine and a small silvered looking glass in an ornate golden frame Sitting on the edge of the bed he poured half a cup of wine and held it to Tyrion’s swollen lips The trickle went down cool though he could hardly taste it More he said when the cup was empty Maester Ballabar poured again By the end of the second cup Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to face his face

He turned over the glass and did not know whether he ought to laugh or cry The gash was long and crooked starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw Three-quarters of his nose was gone and a chunk of his lip Someone had sewn the torn flesh together with catgut and their clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw red half-healed flesh Pretty he croaked flinging the glass aside

He remembered now The bridge of boats Ser Mandon Moore a hand a sword coming at his face If I had not pulled back that cut would have taken off the top of my head Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard because his dead empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions I should never have trusted any of them He’d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s and Ser Osmund later but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle Why else I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of Tyrion touched his face plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers Another gift from my sweet sister

The maester stood beside the bed like a goose about to take flight My lord there there will most like be a scar   

Most like His snort of laughter turned into a wince of pain There would be a scar to be sure Nor was it likely that his nose would be growing back anytime soon It was not as if his face had ever been fit to look at Teach me not to play with axes His grin felt tight Where are we What what place It hurt to talk but Tyrion had been too long in silence

Ah you are in Maegor’s Holdfast my lord A chamber over the Queen’s Ballroom Her Grace wanted you kept close so she might watch over you herself

I’ll wager she did Return me Tyrion commanded Own bed Own chambers Where I will have my own men about me and my own maester too if I find one I can trust

Your own    my lord that would not be possible The King’s Hand has taken up residence in your former chambers

I Am King’s Hand He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking and confused by what he was hearing

Maester Ballabar looked distressed No my lord I    you were wounded near death Your lord father has taken up those duties now Lord Tywin he   

Here

Since the night of the battle Lord Tywin saved us all The smallfolk say it was King Renly’s ghost but wiser men know better It was your father and Lord Tyrell with the Knight of Flowers and Lord Littlefinger They rode through the ashes and took the usurper Stannis in the rear It was a great victory and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help His Grace set the realm to rights gods be praised

Gods be praised Tyrion repeated hollowly His bloody father and bloody Littlefinger and Renly’s ghost I want    Who do I want He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch him Shae Who could he send for who could he trust Varys Bronn Ser Jacelyn    my squire he finished Pod Payne It was Pod on the bridge of boats the lad saved my life

The boy The odd boy

Odd boy Podrick Payne You go Send him

As you will my lord Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited He wondered how long he had been here asleep Cersei would have me sleep forever but I won’t be so obliging

Podrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse My lord He crept close to the bed How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom Tyrion wondered I meant to stay by you but the maester sent me away

Send him away Hear me Talk’s hard Need dreamwine Dreamwine not milk of the poppy Go to Frenken Frenken not Ballabar Watch him make it Bring it here Pod stole a glance at Tyrion’s face and just as quickly averted his eyes Well I cannot blame him for that I want Tyrion went on mine own Guard Bronn Where’s Bronn

They made him a knight

Even frowning hurt Find him Bring him

As you say My lord Bronn

Tyrion seized the lad’s wrist Ser Mandon

The boy flinched I n-never meant to k-k-k-k-

Dead You’re certain Dead

He shuffled his feet sheepish Drowned

Good Say nothing Of him Of me Any of it Nothing

By the time his squire left the last of Tyrion’s strength was gone as well He lay back and closed his eyes Perhaps he would dream of Tysha again I wonder how she’d like my face now he thought bitterly
