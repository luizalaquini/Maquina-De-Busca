4122 Let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let
them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them
and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come

4123 Shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know
that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed
and behold it together

4124 Behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an
abomination is he that chooseth you

4125 I have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the
rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon
princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay

4126 Who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and
beforetime that we may say He is righteous yea there is none that
sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that
heareth your words

4127 The first shall say to Zion Behold behold them and I will
give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings

4128 For I beheld and there was no man even among them and there
was no counsellor that when I asked of them could answer a word

4129 Behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their
molten images are wind and confusion

421 Behold my servant whom I uphold mine elect in whom my soul
delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth
judgment to the Gentiles

422 He shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in
the street

423 A bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he
not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth

424 He shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment
in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law

425 Thus saith God the LORD he that created the heavens and
stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which
cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and
spirit to them that walk therein 426 I the LORD have called thee in
righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give
thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles 427
To open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house

428 I am the LORD that is my name and my glory will I not give to
another neither my praise to graven images

429 Behold the former things are come to pass and new things do I
declare before they spring forth I tell you of them

4210 Sing unto the LORD a new song and his praise from the end of
the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the
isles and the inhabitants thereof

4211 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice
the villages that Kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock
sing let them shout from the top of the mountains

4212 Let them give glory unto the LORD and declare his praise in the
islands

4213 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up
jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail
against his enemies

4214 I have long time holden my peace I have been still and
refrained myself now will I cry like a travailing woman I will
destroy and devour at once

4215 I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their
herbs and I will make the rivers islands and I will dry up the
pools

4216 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not I will
lead them in paths that they have not known I will make darkness
light before them and crooked things straight These things will I do
unto them and not forsake them

4217 They shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that
trust in graven images that say to the molten images Ye are our
gods

4218 Hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see

4219 Who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that I
sent  who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the LORDs
servant  4220 Seeing many things but thou observest not opening
the ears but he heareth not

4221 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will
magnify the law and make it honourable
