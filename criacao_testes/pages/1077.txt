Why would you want me as your Hand if you refuse to listen to my counsel

Why Robert laughed Why not Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom Put on the badge Ned It suits you And if you ever throw it in my face again I swear to you I’ll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister





CATELYN

The eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn Catelyn Stark watched the light spread her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window Below her the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests Pale white mists rose off Alyssa’s Tears where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long tumble down the face of the Giant’s Lance Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face

Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband her brothers and all her children slain and yet in life she had never shed a tear So in death the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale where the men she had loved were buried Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died Tell me the rest of it she said

The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind her Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent but he has had no answer Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood

Catelyn turned away from the sunrise Its beauty did little to lighten her mood it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to Edmure has sent riders and made vows she said but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun What of my lord father

The message made no mention of Lord Hoster my lady Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds he looked almost himself again

My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick she said worried I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived

Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep Maester Colemon told me

I should have been woken she insisted

The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat Ser Rodrik said

Then she still plans to go through with this mummer’s farce Catelyn grimaced The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes and she is too deaf to hear the tune Whatever happens this morning Ser Rodrik it is past time we took our leave My place is at Winterfell with my sons If you are strong enough to travel I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown We can take ship from there

Another ship Ser Rodrik looked a shade green yet he managed not to shudder As you say my lady

The old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had given her If she spoke to her sister before the duel perhaps she could change her mind she thought as they dressed her Lysa’s policies varied with her moods and her moods changed hourly The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud fearful cruel dreamy reckless timid stubborn vain and above all inconstant

When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately but no nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the Vale And now this…

Lannister is my prisoner she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the Eyrie’s cold white halls Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt My sister must be reminded of that

At the doors to Lysa’s apartments they met her uncle storming out Going to join the fool’s festival Ser Brynden snapped I’d tell you to slap some sense into your sister if I thought it would do any good but you’d only bruise your hand

There was a bird from Riverrun Catelyn began a letter from Edmure…

I know child The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden’s only concession to ornament I had to hear it from Maester Colemon I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste Do you know what she told me The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords nor even one Uncle she said You are the Knight of the Gate Your place is here A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder Well I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate Black fish or no I am still a Tully I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall

Catelyn could not pretend to surprise Alone You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell Come with us Uncle I will give you your thousand men Riverrun will not fight alone

Brynden thought a moment then nodded a brusque agreement As you say It’s the long way home but I’m more like to get there I’ll wait for you below He went striding off his cloak swirling behind him

Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik They went through the doors to the high nervous sound of a child’s giggles

Lysa’s apartments opened over a small garden a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers The builders had intended it as a godswood but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale they could not get a weirwood to take root here So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary amidst low flowering shrubs It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives and that of Tyrion Lannister into the hands of the gods

Lysa freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her milk-white neck was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat surrounded by her knights retainers and lords high and low Most of them still hoped to wed her bed her and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side From what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie it was a vain hope

A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert’s chair there the Lord of the Eyrie sat giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out and the guests were sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups A fool’s festival Brynden had called it and small wonder

Across the terrace Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter’s and nibbled a blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray’s dagger They were the suitors who stood highest in Lysa’s favor… today at least Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable Eon Hunter was even older than Jon Arryn had been half-crippled by gout and cursed with three quarrelsome sons each more grasping than the last Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly lean and handsome heir to an ancient but impoverished house but vain reckless hot-tempered… and it was whispered notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women

When Lysa espied Catelyn she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek Isn’t it a lovely morning The gods are smiling on us Do try a cup of the wine sweet sister Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it from his own cellars

Thank you no Lysa we must talk

After her sister promised already beginning to turn away from her

Now Catelyn spoke more loudly than she’d intended Men were turning to look Lysa you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly Alive the Imp has value Dead he is only food for crows And if his champion should prevail here—

Small chance of that my lady Lord Hunter assured her patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter He will make short work of the sellsword

Will he my lord Catelyn said coolly I wonder She had seen Bronn fight on the high road it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died He moved like a panther and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm

Lysa’s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom Women understand little of these things Ser Morton Waynwood said Ser Vardis is a knight sweet lady This other fellow well his sort are all cowards at heart Useful enough in a battle with thousands of their fellows around them but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them

Say you have the truth of it then Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache What will we gain by the dwarf’s death Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain

Behead the man Ser Lyn Corbray suggested When the Kingslayer receives the Imp’s head it will be a warning to him

Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair Lord Robert wants to see him fly she said as if that settled the matter And the Imp has only himself to blame It was he who demanded a trial by combat

Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him even if she’d wished to Lord Hunter intoned ponderously

Ignoring them all Catelyn turned all her force on her sister I remind you Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner

And I remind you the dwarf murdered my lord husband Her voice rose He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless and now I mean to see him pay Whirling her skirts swinging around her Lysa stalked across the terrace Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her

Do you think he did Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again Murder Lord Jon that is The Imp still denies it and most fiercely…

I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn Catelyn replied but whether it was Tyrion or Ser Jaime or the queen or all of them together I could not begin to say Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer… perhaps because the dwarf was here while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep hundreds of leagues to the south Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter before reading it

Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers Poison well… that could be the dwarf’s work true enough Or Cersei’s It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon begging your pardons my lady The Kingslayer now… I have no great liking for the man but he’s not the sort Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his Was it poison my lady

Catelyn frowned vaguely uneasy How else could they make it look a natural death Behind her Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace She glanced at her nephew and sighed The boy is utterly without discipline He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time

His lord father agreed with you said a voice at her elbow She turned to behold Maester Colemon a cup of wine in his hand He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering you know… oh but I’m speaking out of turn The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain I fear I’ve had too much of Lord Hunter’s excellent wine The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray…

You are mistaken Maester Catelyn said It was Casterly Rock not Dragonstone and those arrangements were made after the Hand’s death without my sister’s consent

The maester’s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself No begging your forgiveness my lady but it was Lord Jon who—

A bell tolled loudly below them High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade Below two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden a weeping woman carved in veined white marble no doubt meant to be Alyssa
