 Dear me -- Casterbridge Union -- and is Fanny come
to this said Bathsheba musing I wish I had known
of it sooner I thought she was far away How long
has she lived there
Ony been there a day or two
Oh -- then she has not been staying there as a
regular inmate
 No She first went to live in a garrison-town tother
side o Wessex and since then shes been picking up a
living at seampstering in Melchester for several months
at the house of a very respectable widow-woman who
takes in work of that sort She only got handy the
Union-house on Sunday morning a blieve and tis sup+
posed here and there that she had traipsed every step
of the way from Melchester Why she left her place
I cant say for I dont know and as to a lie why I
wouldnt tell it Thats the short of the story maam
Ah-h  
P 337
No gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one
more rapidly than changed the young wifes counten+
ance whilst this word came from her in a long-drawn
breath Did she walk along our turnpike-road she
said in a suddenly restless and eager voice
I believe she did Maam shall I call Liddy
You baint well maam surely  You look like a lily --
so pale and fainty
No dont call her it is nothing When did she
pass Weatherbury
Last Saturday night
That will do Joseph now you may go
 Certainly maam
 Joseph come hither a moment What was the
colour of Fanny Robins hair
Really mistress now that tis put to me so judge+
and-jury like I cant call to mind if yell believe me
Never mind go on and do what I told you Stop
 -- well no go on
She turned herself away from him that he might no
longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly
upon her and went indoors with a distressng sense of
faintness and a beating brow About an hour after she
heard the noise of the waggon and went out still with a
painful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled
look Joseph dressed in his best suit of clothes was
putting in the horse to start The shrubs and flowers
were all piled in the waggon as she had directed
Bathsheba hardly saw them now
 Whose sweetheart did you say Joseph
I dont know maam
Are you quite sure
 Yes maam quite sure
Sure of what
Im sure that all I know is that she arrived in the
morning and died in the evening without further parley
What Oak and Mr Boldwood told me was only these
few words Little Fanny Robin is dead Joseph
Gabriel said looking in my face in his steady old way
I was very sorry and I said Ah -- and how did she
P 338
come to die Well shes dead in Casterhridge
Union he said and perhaps tisnt much matter
about how she came to die She reached the Union
early Sunday morning and died in the afternoon -- thats
clear enough Then I asked what shed been doing
lately and Mr Boldwood turned round to me then and
left off spitting a thistle with the end of his stick He
told me about her having lived by seampstering in
Melchester as I mentioned to you and that she walked
therefrom at the end of last week passing near here
Saturday night in the dusk They then said I had
better just name a hent of her death to you and away
they went Her death might have been brought on by
biding in the night wind you know maam for people
used to say shed go off in a decline she used to cough
a good deal in winter time However tisnt much
odds to us about that now for tis all over
Have you heard a different story at all She
looked at him so intently that Josephs eyes quailed
Not a word mistress I assure ee he said
Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet
I wonder why Gabriel didnt bring the message to
me himself He mostly makes a point of seeing me
upon the most trifling errand These words were
merely murmured and she was looking upon the ground
Perhaps he was busy maam Joseph suggested
And sometimes he seems to suffer from things upon
his mind connected with the time when he was better
off than a is now As rather a curious item but a
very understanding shepherd and learned in books
Did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was
speaking to you about this
I cannot but say that there did maam He was
terrible down and so was Farmer Boldwood
Thank you Joseph That will do Go on now
or youll be late
Bathsheba still unhappy went indoors again In
the course of the afternoon she said to Liddy Who had
been informed of the occurrence  What was the colour
