Home It’s their fault you won’t let me have Summer

The Frey boy did not ask to be attacked the maester said no more than I did

That was Shaggydog Rickon’s big black wolf was so wild he even frightened Bran at times Summer never bit anyone

Summer ripped out a man’s throat in this very chamber or have you forgotten The truth is those sweet pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous beasts The Frey boys are wise to be wary of them

We should put the Walders in the godswood They could play lord of the crossing all they want and Summer could sleep with me again If I’m the prince why won’t you heed me I wanted to ride Dancer but Alebelly wouldn’t let me past the gate

And rightly so The wolfswood is full of danger your last ride should have taught you that Would you want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters

Summer would save me Bran insisted stubbornly Princes should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances

Bran child why do you torment yourself so One day you may do some of these things but now you are only a boy of eight

I’d sooner be a wolf Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted and I could find Arya and Sansa I’d smell where they were and go save them and when Robb went to battle I’d fight beside him like Grey Wind I’d tear out the Kingslayer’s throat with my teeth rip and then the war would be over and everyone would come back to Winterfell If I was a wolf    He howled Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo

Luwin raised his voice A true prince would welcome—

AAHOOOOOOO Bran howled louder OOOO-OOOO-OOOO

The maester surrendered As you will child With a look that was part grief and part disgust he left the bedchamber

Howling lost its savor once Bran was alone After a time he quieted I did welcome them he told himself resentful I was the lord in Winterfell a true lord he can’t say I wasn’t When the Walders had arrived from the Twins it had been Rickon who wanted them gone A baby of four he had screamed that he wanted Mother and Father and Robb not these strangers It had been up to Bran to soothe him and bid the Freys welcome He had offered them meat and mead and a seat by the fire and even Maester Luwin had said afterward that he’d done well

Only that was before the game

The game was played with a log a staff a body of water and a great deal of shouting The water was the most important Walder and Walder assured Bran You could use a plank or even a series of stones and a branch could be your staff You didn’t have to shout But without water there was no game As Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream they made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood Walder and Walder had never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before but they both allowed how it would make the game even better

Both of them were called Walder Frey Big Walder said there were bunches of Walders at the Twins all named after the boys’ grandfather Lord Walder Frey We have our own names at Winterfell Rickon told them haughtily when he heard that

The way their game was played you laid the log across the water and one player stood in the middle with the stick He was the lord of the crossing and when one of the other players came up he had to say I am the lord of the crossing who goes there And the other player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross The lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions They didn’t have to tell the truth but the oaths were binding unless they said Mayhaps so the trick was to say Mayhaps so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice Then you could try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing but only if you’d said Mayhaps Otherwise you were out of the game The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he pleased and he was the only one who got to use a stick

In practice the game seemed to come down to mostly shoving hitting and falling into the water along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone had said Mayhaps Little Walder was lord of the crossing more often than not

He was Little Walder even though he was tall and stout with a red face and a big round belly Big Walder was sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter He’s fifty-two days older than me Little Walder explained so he was bigger at first but I grew faster

We’re cousins not brothers added Big Walder the little one I’m Walder son of Jammos My father was Lord Walder’s son by his fourth wife He’s Walder son of Merrett His grandmother was Lord Walder’s third wife the Crakehall He’s ahead of me in the line of succession even though I’m older

Only by fifty-two days Little Walder objected And neither of us will ever hold the Twins stupid

I will Big Walder declared We’re not the only Walders either Ser Stevron has a grandson Black Walder he’s fourth in line of succession and there’s Red Walder Ser Emmon’s son and Bastard Walder who isn’t in the line at all He’s called Walder Rivers not Walder Frey Plus there’s girls named Walda

And Tyr You always forget Tyr

He’s Waltyr not Walder Big Walder said airily And he’s after us so he doesn’t matter Anyhow I never liked him

Ser Rodrik decreed that they would share Jon Snow’s old bedchamber since Jon was in the Night’s Watch and never coming back Bran hated that it made him feel as if the Freys were trying to steal Jon’s place

He had watched wistfully while the Walders contested with Turnip the cook’s boy and Joseth’s girls Bandy and Shyra The Walders had decreed that Bran should be the judge and decide whether or not people had said Mayhaps but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him

The shouts and splashes soon drew others Palla the kennel girl Cayn’s boy Calon TomToo whose father Fat Tom had died with Bran’s father at King’s Landing Before very long every one of them was soaked and muddy Palla was brown from head to heel with moss in her hair breathless from laughter Bran had not heard so much laughing since the night the bloody raven came If I had my legs I’d knock all of them into the water he thought bitterly No one would ever be lord of the crossing but me

Finally Rickon came running into the godswood Shaggydog at his heels He watched Turnip and Little Walder struggle for the stick until Turnip lost his footing and went in with a huge splash arms waving Rickon yelled Me Me now I want to play Little Walder beckoned him on and Shaggydog started to follow No Shaggy his brother commanded Wolves can’t play You stay with Bran And he did   

   until Little Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick square across his belly Before Bran could blink the black wolf was flying over the plank there was blood in the water the Walders were shrieking red murder Rickon sat in the mud laughing and Hodor came lumbering in shouting Hodor Hodor Hodor

After that oddly Rickon decided he liked the Walders They never played lord of the crossing again but they played other games—monsters and maidens rats and cats come-into-my-castle all sorts of things With Rickon by their side the Walders plundered the kitchens for pies and honeycombs raced round the walls tossed bones to the pups in the kennels and trained with wooden swords under Ser Rodrik’s sharp eye Rickon even showed them the deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason was carving father’s tomb You had no right Bran screamed at his brother when he heard That was our place a Stark place But Rickon never cared

The door to his bedchamber opened Maester Luwin was carrying a green jar and this time Osha and Hayhead came with him I’ve made you a sleeping draught Bran

Osha scooped him up in her bony arms She was very tall for a woman and wiry strong She bore him effortlessly to his bed

This will give you dreamless sleep Maester Luwin said as he pulled the stopper from the jar Sweet dreamless sleep

It will Bran said wanting to believe

Yes Drink

Bran drank The potion was thick and chalky but there was honey in it so it went down easy

Come the morn you’ll feel better Luwin gave Bran a smile and a pat as he took his leave

Osha lingered behind Is it the wolf dreams again

Bran nodded

You should not fight so hard boy I see you talking to the heart tree Might be the gods are trying to talk back

The gods he murmured drowsy already Osha’s face grew blurry and grey Sweet dreamless sleep Bran thought

Yet when the darkness closed over him he found himself in the godswood moving silently beneath green-grey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time I am walking he thought exulting Part of him knew that it was only a dream but even the dream of walking was better than the truth of his bedchamber walls and ceiling and door

It was dark amongst the trees but the comet lit his way and his feet were sure He was moving on four good legs strong and swift and he could feel the ground underfoot the soft crackling of fallen leaves thick roots and hard stones the deep layers of humus It was a good feeling

The smells filled his head alive and intoxicating the green muddy stink of the hot pools the perfume of rich rotting earth beneath his paws the squirrels in the oaks The scent of squirrel made him remember the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack between his teeth Slaver filled his mouth He had eaten no more than half a day past but there was no joy in dead meat even deer He could hear the squirrels chittering and rustling above him safe among their leaves but they knew better than to come down to where his brother and he were prowling

He could smell his brother too a familiar scent strong and earthy his scent as black as his coat His brother was loping around the walls full of fury Round and round he went night after day after night tireless searching    for prey for a way out for his mother his littermates his pack    searching searching and never finding

Behind the trees the walls rose piles of dead man-rock that loomed all about this speck of living wood Speckled grey they rose and moss-spotted yet thick and strong and higher than any wolf could hope to leap Cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes through the piled stones that hemmed them in His brother would stop at every hole and bare his fangs in rage but the ways stayed closed

He had done the same the first night and learned that it was no good Snarls would open no paths here Circling the walls would not push them back Lifting a leg and marking the trees would keep no men away The world had tightened around them but beyond the walled wood still stood the great grey caves of man-rock Winterfell he remembered the sound coming to him suddenly Beyond its sky-tall man-cliffs the true world was calling and he knew he must answer or die
