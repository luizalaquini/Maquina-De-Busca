What have you found Jon lowered the torch revealing a rounded mound of soft earth A grave he thought But whose

He knelt jammed the torch into the ground beside him The soil was loose sandy Jon pulled it out by the fistful There were no stones no roots Whatever was here had been put here recently Two feet down his fingers touched cloth He had been expecting a corpse fearing a corpse but this was something else He pushed against the fabric and felt small hard shapes beneath unyielding There was no smell no sign of graveworms Ghost backed off and sat on his haunches watching

Jon brushed the loose soil away to reveal a rounded bundle perhaps two feet across He jammed his fingers down around the edges and worked it loose When he pulled it free whatever was inside shifted and clinked Treasure he thought but the shapes were wrong to be coins and the sound was wrong for metal

A length of frayed rope bound the bundle together Jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it groped for the edges of the cloth and pulled The bundle turned and its contents spilled out onto the ground glittering dark and bright He saw a dozen knives leaf-shaped spearheads numerous arrowheads Jon picked up a dagger blade featherlight and shiny black hiltless Torchlight ran along its edge a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness Dragonglass What the maesters call obsidian Had Ghost uncovered some ancient cache of the children of the forest buried here for thousands of years The Fist of the First Men was an old place only   

Beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn made from an auroch’s horn and banded in bronze Jon shook the dirt from inside it and a stream of arrowheads fell out He let them fall and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in rubbing it between his fingers Good wool thick a double weave damp but not rotted It could not have been long in the ground And it was dark He seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch Not dark Black

Even before Jon stood and shook it out he knew what he had the black cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch





BRAN

Alebelly found him in the forge working the bellows for Mikken Maester wants you in the turret m’lord prince There’s been a bird from the king

From Robb Excited Bran did not wait for Hodor but let Alebelly carry him up the steps He was a big man though not so big as Hodor and nowhere near as strong By the time they reached the maester’s turret he was red-faced and puffing Rickon was there before them and both Walder Freys as well

Maester Luwin sent Alebelly away and closed his door My lords he said gravely we have had a message from His Grace with both good news and ill He has won a great victory in the west shattering a Lannister army at a place named Oxcross and has taken several castles as well He writes us from Ashemark formerly the stronghold of House Marbrand

Rickon tugged at the maester’s robe Is Robb coming home

Not just yet I fear There are battles yet to fight

Was it Lord Tywin he defeated asked Bran

No said the maester Ser Stafford Lannister commanded the enemy host He was slain in the battle

Bran had never even heard of Ser Stafford Lannister He found himself agreeing with Big Walder when he said Lord Tywin is the only one who matters

Tell Robb I want him to come home said Rickon He can bring his wolf home too and Mother and Father Though he knew Lord Eddard was dead sometimes Rickon forgot    willfully Bran suspected His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be

Bran was glad for Robb’s victory but disquieted as well He remembered what Osha had said the day that his brother had led his army out of Winterfell He’s marching the wrong way the wildling woman had insisted

Sadly no victory is without cost Maester Luwin turned to the Walders My lords your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross He took a wound in the battle Robb writes It was not thought to be serious but three days later he died in his tent asleep

Big Walder shrugged He was very old Five-and-sixty I think Too old for battles He was always saying he was tired

Little Walder hooted Tired of waiting for our grandfather to die you mean Does this mean Ser Emmon’s the heir now

Don’t be stupid his cousin said The sons of the first son come before the second son Ser Ryman is next in line and then Edwyn and Black Walder and Petyr Pimple And then Aegon and all his sons

Ryman is old too said Little Walder Past forty I bet And he has a bad belly Do you think he’ll be lord

I’ll be lord I don’t care if he is

Maester Luwin cut in sharply You ought to be ashamed of such talk my lords Where is your grief Your uncle is dead

Yes said Little Walder We’re very sad

They weren’t though Bran got a sick feeling in his belly They like the taste of this dish better than I do He asked Maester Luwin to be excused

Very well The maester rang for help Hodor must have been busy in the stables It was Osha who came She was stronger than Alebelly though and had no trouble lifting Bran in her arms and carrying him down the steps

Osha Bran asked as they crossed the yard Do you know the way north To the Wall and    and even past

The way’s easy Look for the Ice Dragon and chase the blue star in the rider’s eye She backed through a door and started up the winding steps

And there are still giants there and    the rest    the Others and the children of the forest too

The giants I’ve seen the children I’ve heard tell of and the white walkers    why do you want to know

Did you ever see a three-eyed crow

No She laughed And I can’t say I’d want to Osha kicked open the door to his bedchamber and set him in his window seat where he could watch the yard below

It seemed only a few heartbeats after she took her leave that the door opened again and Jojen Reed entered unbidden with his sister Meera behind him You heard about the bird Bran asked The other boy nodded It wasn’t a supper like you said It was a letter from Robb and we didn’t eat it but—

The green dreams take strange shapes sometimes Jojen admitted The truth of them is not always easy to understand

Tell me the bad thing you dreamed Bran said The bad thing that is coming to Winterfell

Does my lord prince believe me now Will he trust my words no matter how queer they sound in his ears

Bran nodded

It is the sea that comes

The sea

I dreamed that the sea was lapping all around Winterfell I saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle Drowned men were floating in the yard When I first dreamed the dream back at Greywater I didn’t know their faces but now I do That Alebelly is one the guard who called our names at the feast Your septon’s another Your smith as well

Mikken Bran was as confused as he was dismayed But the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues away and Winterfell’s walls are so high the water couldn’t get in even if it did come

In the dark of night the salt sea will flow over these walls said Jojen I saw the dead bloated and drowned

We have to tell them Bran said Alebelly and Mikken and Septon Chayle Tell them not to drown

It will not save them replied the boy in green

Meera came to the window seat and put a hand on his shoulder They will not believe Bran No more than you did

Jojen sat on Bran’s bed Tell me what you dream

He was scared even then but he had sworn to trust them and a Stark of Winterfell keeps his sworn word There’s different kinds he said slowly There’s the wolf dreams those aren’t so bad as the others I run and hunt and kill squirrels And there’s dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too calling my name That frightens me But the worst dreams are when I fall He looked down into the yard feeling miserable I never used to fall before When I climbed I went everyplace up on the roofs and along the walls I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower Mother was afraid that I would fall but I knew I never would Only I did and now when I sleep I fall all the time
