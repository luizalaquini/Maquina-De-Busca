1839 And they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his
peace but he cried so much the more Thou son of David have mercy on
me

1840 And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and
when he was come near he asked him 1841 Saying What wilt thou that
I shall do unto thee And he said Lord that I may receive my sight

1842 And Jesus said unto him Receive thy sight thy faith hath saved
thee

1843 And immediately he received his sight and followed him
glorifying God and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto
God

191 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho

192 And behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was the chief
among the publicans and he was rich

193 And he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the
press because he was little of stature

194 And he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
him for he was to pass that way

195 And when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and
said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day I must
abide at thy house

196 And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully

197 And when they saw it they all murmured saying That he was gone
to be guest with a man that is a sinner

198 And Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord Behold Lord the
half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken any thing
from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold

199 And Jesus said unto him This day is salvation come to this
house forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham

1910 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost

1911 And as they heard these things he added and spake a parable
because he was nigh to Jerusalem and because they thought that the
kingdom of God should immediately appear

1912 He said therefore A certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom and to return

1913 And he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds
and said unto them Occupy till I come

1914 But his citizens hated him and sent a message after him
saying We will not have this man to reign over us

1915 And it came to pass that when he was returned having received
the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him
to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man
had gained by trading

1916 Then came the first saying Lord thy pound hath gained ten
pounds

1917 And he said unto him Well thou good servant because thou hast
been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities

1918 And the second came saying Lord thy pound hath gained five
pounds

1919 And he said likewise to him Be thou also over five cities

1920 And another came saying Lord behold here is thy pound which
I have kept laid up in a napkin 1921 For I feared thee because thou
art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and
reapest that thou didst not sow

1922 And he saith unto him Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee
thou wicked servant Thou knewest that I was an austere man taking up
that I laid not down and reaping that I did not sow 1923 Wherefore
then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming I might
have required mine own with usury  1924 And he said unto them that
stood by Take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten
pounds

1925 And they said unto him Lord he hath ten pounds  1926 For I
say unto you That unto every one which hath shall be given and from
him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him

1927 But those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over
them bring hither and slay them before me

1928 And when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to
Jerusalem

1929 And it came to pass when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
Bethany at the mount called the mount of Olives he sent two of his
