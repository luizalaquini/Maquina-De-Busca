As you say Khaleesi

I want Ser Jorah she said standing Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders And a warm bath and Mirri Maz Duur and… Memory came back to her all at once and she faltered Khal Drogo she forced herself to say watching their faces with dread Is he—

The khal lives Irri answered quietly… yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water

She turned to Doreah Tell me

I… I shall bring Ser Jorah the Lysene girl said bowing her head and fleeing the tent

Jhiqui would have run as well but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive What is it I must know Drogo… and my child Why had she not remembered the child until now My son… Rhaego… where is he I want him

Her handmaid lowered her eyes The boy… he did not live Khaleesi Her voice was a frightened whisper

Dany released her wrist My son is dead she thought as Jhiqui left the tent She had known somehow She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui’s tears No she had known before she woke Her dream came back to her sudden and vivid and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid bursting into flame

She should weep she knew yet her eyes were dry as ash She had wept in her dream and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks All the grief has been burned out of me she told herself She felt sad and yet… she could feel Rhaego receding from her as if he had never been

Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later and found Dany standing over the other dragon’s eggs the two still in their chest It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with which was passing strange Ser Jorah come here she said She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls What do you feel

Shell hard as rock The knight was wary Scales

Heat

No Cold stone He took his hand away Princess are you well Should you be up weak as you are

Weak I am strong Jorah To please him she reclined on a pile of cushions Tell me how my child died

He never lived my princess The women say… He faltered and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him and the way he limped when he moved

Tell me Tell me what the women say

He turned his face away His eyes were haunted They say the child was…

She waited but Ser Jorah could not say it His face grew dark with shame He looked half a corpse himself

Monstrous Mirri Maz Duur finished for him The knight was a powerful man yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger and crueler and infinitely more dangerous Twisted I drew him forth myself He was scaled like a lizard blind with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat When I touched him the flesh sloughed off the bone and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption He had been dead for years

Darkness Dany thought The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her If she looked back she was lost My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent she said I could feel him kicking fighting to be born

That may be as it may be answered Mirri Maz Duur yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said Death was in that tent Khaleesi

Only shadows Ser Jorah husked but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice I saw maegi I saw you alone dancing with the shadows 

The grave casts long shadows Iron Lord Mirri said Long and dark and in the end no light can hold them back

Ser Jorah had killed her son Dany knew He had done what he did for love and loyalty yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness He knew it too the grey face the hollow eyes the limp The shadows have touched you too Ser Jorah she told him The knight made no reply Dany turned to the godswife You warned me that only death could pay for life I thought you meant the horse

No Mirri Maz Duur said That was a lie you told yourself You knew the price

Had she Had she If I look back I am lost The price was paid Dany said The horse my child Quaro and Qotho Haggo and Cohollo The price was paid and paid and paid She rose from her cushions Where is Khal Drogo Show him to me godswife maegi bloodmage whatever you are Show me Khal Drogo Show me what I bought with my son’s life

As you command Khaleesi the old woman said Come I will take you to him

Dany was weaker than she knew Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her stand Time enough for this later my princess he said quietly

I would see him now Ser Jorah

After the dimness of the tent the world outside was blinding bright The sun burned like molten gold and the land was seared and empty Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support her Aggo and Rakharo stood behind The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes She saw the ashes of a fire a few score horses milling listlessly and searching for a bite of grass a scattering of tents and bedrolls A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes swatting feebly at bloodflies A count might show a hundred people no more Where the other forty thousand had made their camp only the wind and dust lived now

Drogo’s khalasar is gone she said

A khal who cannot ride is no khal said Jhogo

The Dothraki follow only the strong Ser Jorah said I am sorry my princess There was no way to hold them Ko Pono left first naming himself Khal Pono and many followed him Jhaqo was not long to do the same The rest slipped away night by night in large bands and small There are a dozen new khalasars on the Dothraki sea where once there was only Drogo’s

The old remain said Aggo The frightened the weak and the sick And we who swore We remain

They took Khal Drogo’s herds Khaleesi Rakharo said We were too few to stop them It is the right of the strong to take from the weak They took many slaves as well the khal’s and yours yet they left some few

Eroeh asked Dany remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the Lamb Men

Mago seized her who is Khal Jhaqo’s bloodrider now said Jhogo He mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders They were six When they were done with her they cut her throat

It was her fate Khaleesi said Aggo

If I look back I am lost It was a cruel fate Dany said yet not so cruel as Mago’s will be I promise you that by the old gods and the new by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives I swear it by the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World Before I am done with them Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh

The Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances Khaleesi the handmaid Irri explained as if to a child Jhaqo is a khal now with twenty thousand riders at his back

She lifted her head And I am Daenerys Stormhorn Daenerys of House Targaryen of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them I am the dragon’s daughter and I swear to you these men will die screaming Now bring me to Khal Drogo

He was lying on the bare red earth staring up at the sun

A dozen bloodflies had settled on his body though he did not seem to feel them Dany brushed them away and knelt beside him His eyes were wide open but did not see and she knew at once that he was blind When she whispered his name he did not seem to hear The wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous

Why is he out here alone in the sun she asked them

He seems to like the warmth Princess Ser Jorah said His eyes follow the sun though he does not see it He can walk after a fashion He will go where you lead him but no farther He will eat if you put food in his mouth drink if you dribble water on his lips

Dany kissed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow and stood to face Mirri Maz Duur Your spells are costly maegi

He lives said Mirri Maz Duur You asked for life You paid for life

This is not life for one who was as Drogo was His life was laughter and meat roasting over a firepit and a horse between his legs His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy His life was his bloodriders and me and the son I was to give him

Mirri Maz Duur made no reply

When will he be as he was Dany demanded
