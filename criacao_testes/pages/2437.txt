411 And it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh
dreamed and behold he stood by the river

412 And behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow

413 And behold seven other kine came up after them out of the
river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon
the brink of the river

414 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine So Pharaoh awoke

415 And he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears
of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good

416 And behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
sprung up after them

417 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears
And Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream

418 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled
and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the
wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none
that could interpret them unto Pharaoh

419 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh saying I do remember
my faults this day 4110 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put
me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief
baker 4111 And we dreamed a dream in one night I and he we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation of his dream

4112 And there was there with us a young man an Hebrew servant to
the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us
our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret

4113 And it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he
restored unto mine office and him he hanged

4114 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him
hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his
raiment and came in unto Pharaoh

4115 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there
is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee that thou
canst understand a dream to interpret it

4116 And Joseph answered Pharaoh saying It is not in me God shall
give Pharaoh an answer of peace

4117 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph In my dream behold I stood upon
the bank of the river 4118 And behold there came up out of the
river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a
meadow 4119 And behold seven other kine came up after them poor
and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as I never saw in all the
land of Egypt for badness 4120 And the lean and the ill favoured
kine did eat up the first seven fat kine 4121 And when they had
eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but
they were still ill favoured as at the beginning So I awoke

4122 And I saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one
stalk full and good 4123 And behold seven ears withered thin
and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 4124 And the
thin ears devoured the seven good ears and I told this unto the
magicians but there was none that could declare it to me

4125 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh The dream of Pharaoh is one God
hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do

4126 The seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are
seven years the dream is one

4127 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind
shall be seven years of famine

4128 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh What God is
about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh

4129 Behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
the land of Egypt 4130 And there shall arise after them seven years
of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt
and the famine shall consume the land 4131 And the plenty shall not
be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall
be very grievous

4132 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is
because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it
to pass

4133 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and
set him over the land of Egypt

4134 Let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land
and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
years

4135 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come
