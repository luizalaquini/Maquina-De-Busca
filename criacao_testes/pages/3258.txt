78 Go ye up unto this feast I go not up yet unto this feast for my
time is not yet full come

79 When he had said these words unto them he abode still in Galilee

710 But when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the
feast not openly but as it were in secret

711 Then the Jews sought him at the feast and said Where is he
712 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for
some said He is a good man others said Nay but he deceiveth the
people

713 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews

714 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple
and taught

715 And the Jews marvelled saying How knoweth this man letters
having never learned  716 Jesus answered them and said My doctrine
is not mine but his that sent me

717 If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine
whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself

718 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no
unrighteousness is in him

719 Did not Moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the
law  Why go ye about to kill me  720 The people answered and said
Thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee  721 Jesus answered
and said unto them I have done one work and ye all marvel

722 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of
Moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a
man

723 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of
Moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath day  724 Judge not according to
the appearance but judge righteous judgment

725 Then said some of them of Jerusalem Is not this he whom they
seek to kill  726 But lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing
unto him Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ
727 Howbeit we know this man whence he is but when Christ cometh no
man knoweth whence he is

728 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught saying Ye both know
me and ye know whence I am and I am not come of myself but he that
sent me is true whom ye know not

729 But I know him for I am from him and he hath sent me

730 Then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him
because his hour was not yet come

731 And many of the people believed on him and said When Christ
cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done
732 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers
to take him

733 Then said Jesus unto them Yet a little while am I with you and
then I go unto him that sent me

734 Ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither
ye cannot come

735 Then said the Jews among themselves Whither will he go that we
shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles
and teach the Gentiles  736 What manner of saying is this that he
said Ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am thither
ye cannot come  737 In the last day that great day of the feast
Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirst let him come unto
me and drink

738 He that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water

739 But this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him
should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that
Jesus was not yet glorified  740 Many of the people therefore when
they heard this saying said Of a truth this is the Prophet

741 Others said This is the Christ But some said Shall Christ come
out of Galilee  742 Hath not the scripture said That Christ cometh
of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David
was  743 So there was a division among the people because of him

744 And some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on
him

745 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees and
they said unto them Why have ye not brought him  746 The officers
answered Never man spake like this man

747 Then answered them the Pharisees Are ye also deceived  748
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him  749 But
