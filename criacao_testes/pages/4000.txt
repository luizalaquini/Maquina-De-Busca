some obviously bleached curls he looks about as much
like Peeta as I do
People have gone wild Cressida murmurs
We watch a brief rebel update in which we learn that
several more blocks have been taken today I make note of
the intersections on my map and study it Line C is only
four blocks from here I announce Somehow that fills me
with more anxiety than the idea of Peacekeepers looking
for housing I become very helpful Let me wash the
dishes
Ill give you a hand Gale collects the plates
I feel Peetas eyes follow us out of the room In the
cramped kitchen at the back of Tigriss shop I fill the sink
with hot water and suds Do you think its true I ask That
Snow will let refugees into the mansion
I think he has to now at least for the cameras says
Gale
Im leaving in the morning I say
Im going with you Gale says What should we do
with the others
Pollux and Cressida could be useful Theyre good
guides I say Pollux and Cressida arent actually the
problem But Peetas too
Unpredictable finishes Gale Do you think hed still
let us leave him behind
We can make the argument that hell endanger us I
say He might stay here if were convincing
Peetas fairly rational about our suggestion He readily
agrees that his company could put the other four of us at
risk Im thinking this may all work out that he can just sit out
the war in Tigriss cellar when he announces hes going out
on his own
To do what asks Cressida
Im not sure exactly The one thing that I might still be
useful at is causing a diversion You saw what happened to
that man who looked like me he says
What if youlose control I say
You meango mutt Well if I feel that coming on Ill
try to get back here he assures me
And if Snow gets you again asks Gale You dont
even have a gun
Ill just have to take my chances says Peeta Like
the rest of you The two exchange a long look and then
Gale reaches into his breast pocket He places his
nightlock tablet in Peetas hand Peeta lets it lie on his open
palm neither rejecting nor accepting it What about you
Dont worry Beetee showed me how to detonate my
explosive arrows by hand If that fails Ive got my knife And
Ill have Katniss says Gale with a smile She wont give
them the satisfaction of taking me alive
The thought of Peacekeepers dragging Gale away
starts the tune playing in my head again
Are you are you
Coming to the tree
Take it Peeta I say in a strained voice I reach out
and close his fingers over the pill No one will be there to
help you
We spend a fitful night woken by one anothers
nightmares minds buzzing with the next days plans Im
relieved when five oclock rolls around and we can begin
whatever this day holds for us We eat a mishmash of our
remaining food--canned peaches crackers and snails--
leaving one can of salmon for Tigris as meager thanks for
all shes done The gesture seems to touch her in some
way Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies
into action She spends the next hour remaking the five of
us She redresses us so regular clothes hide our uniforms
before we even don our coats and cloaks Covers our
military boots with some sort of furry slippers Secures our
wigs with pins Cleans off the garish remains of the paint
we so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up again
Drapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons Then gives
us handbags and bundles of knickknacks to carry In the
end we look exactly like the refugees fleeing the rebels
Never underestimate the power of a brilliant stylist
says Peeta Its hard to tell but I think Tigris might actually
blush under her stripes
There are no helpful updates on the television but the
alley seems as thick with refugees as the previous morning
Our plan is to slip into the crowd in three groups First
Cressida and Pollux who will act as guides while keeping
a safe lead on us Then Gale and myself who intend to
position ourselves among the refugees assigned to the
mansion today Then Peeta who will trail behind us ready
to create a disturbance as needed
Tigris watches through the shutters for the right
moment unbolts the door and nods to Cressida and
Pollux Take care Cressida says and they are gone
Well be following in a minute I get out the key unlock
Peetas cuffs and stuff them in my pocket He rubs his
wrists Flexes them I feel a kind of desperation rising up in
me Its like Im back in the Quarter Quell with Beetee giving
Johanna and me that coil of wire
Listen I say Dont do anything foolish
No Its last-resort stuff Completely he says
I wrap my arms around his neck feel his arms hesitate
before they embrace me Not as steady as they once were
but still warm and strong A thousand moments surge
through me All the times these arms were my only refuge
from the world Perhaps not fully appreciated then but so
