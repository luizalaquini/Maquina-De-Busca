They know thought Chett You bloody old pus bag they know certain as sunrise Qhorin Halfhand hasn’t come back has he Nor Jarman Buckwell If any of them got caught you know damned well the wildlings will have wrung a song or two out of them by now

Smallwood stepped forward Mance Rayder means to break the Wall and bring red war to the Seven Kingdoms Well that’s a game two can play On the morrow we’ll bring the war to him

We ride at dawn with all our strength the Old Bear said as a murmur went through the assembly We will ride north and loop around to the west Harma’s van will be well past the Fist by the time we turn The foothills of the Frostfangs are full of narrow winding valleys made for ambush Their line of march will stretch for many miles We shall fall on them in several places at once and make them swear we were three thousand not three hundred

We’ll hit hard and be away before their horsemen can form up to face us Thoren Smallwood said If they pursue we’ll lead them a merry chase then wheel and hit again farther down the column We’ll burn their wagons scatter their herds and slay as many as we can Mance Rayder himself if we find him If they break and return to their hovels we’ve won If not we’ll harry them all the way to the Wall and see to it that they leave a trail of corpses to mark their progress

There are thousands someone called from behind Chett

We’ll die That was Maslyn’s voice green with fear

Die screamed Mormont’s raven flapping its black wings Die die die

Many of us the Old Bear said Mayhaps even all of us But as another Lord Commander said a thousand years ago that is why they dress us in black Remember your words brothers For we are the swords in the darkness the watchers on the walls…

The fire that burns against the cold Ser Mallador Locke drew his longsword

The light that brings the dawn others answered and more swords were pulled from scabbards

Then all of them were drawing and it was near three hundred upraised swords and as many voices crying The horn that wakes the sleepers The shield that guards the realms of men Chett had no choice but to join his voice to the others The air was misty with their breath and firelight glinted off the steel He was pleased to see Lark and Softfoot and Sweet Donnel Hill joining in as if they were as big fools as the rest That was good No sense to draw attention when their hour was so close

When the shouting died away once more he heard the sound of the wind picking at the ringwall The flames swirled and shivered as if they too were cold and in the sudden quiet the Old Bear’s raven cawed loudly and once again said Die

Clever bird thought Chett as the officers dismissed them warning everyone to get a good meal and a long rest tonight Chett crawled under his furs near the dogs his head full of things that could go wrong What if that bloody oath gave one of his a change of heart Or Small Paul forgot and tried to kill Mormont during the second watch in place of the third Or Maslyn lost his courage or someone turned informer or…

He found himself listening to the night The wind did sound like a wailing child and from time to time he could hear men’s voices a horse’s whinny a log spitting in the fire But nothing else So quiet

He could see Bessa’s face floating before him It wasn’t the knife I wanted to put in you he wanted to tell her I picked you flowers wild roses and tansy and goldencups it took me all morning His heart was thumping like a drum so loud he feared it might wake the camp Ice caked his beard all around his mouth Where did that come from with Bessa Whenever he’d thought of her before it had only been to remember the way she’d looked dying What was wrong with him He could hardly breathe Had he gone to sleep He got to his knees and something wet and cold touched his nose Chett looked up

Snow was falling

He could feel tears freezing to his cheeks It isn’t fair he wanted to scream Snow would ruin everything he’d worked for all his careful plans It was a heavy fall thick white flakes coming down all about him How would they find their food caches in the snow or the game trail they meant to follow east They won’t need Dywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither not if we’re tracking through fresh snow And snow hid the shape of the ground especially by night A horse could stumble over a root break a leg on a stone We’re done he realized Done before we began We’re lost There’d be no lord’s life for the leechman’s son no keep to call his own no wives nor crowns Only a wildling’s sword in his belly and then an unmarked grave The snow’s taken it all from me… the bloody snow…

Snow had ruined him once before Snow and his pet pig

Chett got to his feet His legs were stiff and the falling snowflakes turned the distant torches to vague orange glows He felt as though he were being attacked by a cloud of pale cold bugs They settled on his shoulders on his head they flew at his nose and his eyes Cursing he brushed them off Samwell Tarly he remembered I can still deal with Ser Piggy He wrapped his scarf around his face pulled up his hood and went striding through the camp to where the coward slept

The snow was falling so heavily that he got lost among the tents but finally he spotted the snug little windbreak the fat boy had made for himself between a rock and the raven cages Tarly was buried beneath a mound of black wool blankets and shaggy furs The snow was drifting in to cover him He looked like some kind of soft round mountain Steel whispered on leather faint as hope as Chett eased his dagger from its sheath One of the ravens quorked Snow another muttered peering through the bars with black eyes The first added a Snow of its own He edged past them placing each foot carefully He would clap his left hand down over the fat boy’s mouth to muffle his cries and then…

Uuuuuuuhoooooooooo

He stopped midstep swallowing his curse as the sound of the horn shuddered through the camp faint and far yet unmistakable Not now Gods be damned not NOW The Old Bear had hidden far-eyes in a ring of trees around the Fist to give warning of any approach Jarman Buckwell’s back from the Giant’s Stair Chett figured or Qhorin Halfhand from the Skirling Pass A single blast of the horn meant brothers returning If it was the Halfhand Jon Snow might be with him alive

Sam Tarly sat up puffy-eyed and stared at the snow in confusion The ravens were cawing noisily and Chett could hear his dogs baying Half the bloody camp’s awake His gloved fingers clenched around the dagger’s hilt as he waited for the sound to die away But no sooner had it gone than it came again louder and longer

Uuuuuuuuuuuuhooooooooooooooo

Gods he heard Sam Tarly whimper The fat boy lurched to his knees his feet tangled in his cloak and blankets He kicked them away and reached for a chainmail hauberk he’d hung on the rock nearby As he slipped the huge tent of a garment down over his head and wriggled into it he spied Chett standing there Was it two he asked I dreamed I heard two blasts…

No dream said Chett Two blasts to call the Watch to arms Two blasts for foes approaching There’s an axe out there with Piggy writ on it fat boy Two blasts means wildlings The fear on that big moon face made him want to laugh Bugger them all to seven hells Bloody Harma Bloody Mance Rayder Bloody Smallwood he said they wouldn’t be on us for another—

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhooooooooooooooooooooooooo
