do say Please God afore I do anything from my
getting up to my going down of the same and I be
willing to take as much disgrace as there is in that
holy act Hah yes  But not a man of spirit 
Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted
against my hinder parts without groaning manfully that
I question the right to do so I inquire that query
boldly
 We cant say that you have Hero Poorgrass
admitted Jan
Never have I allowed such treatment to pass un+
questioned Yet the shepherd says in the face of that
rich testimony that I be not a man of spirit Well
let it pass by and death is a kind friend 
Gabriel seeing that neither of the three was in a fit
state to Cake charge of the waggon for the remainder of
the journey made no reply but closing the door again
upon them went across to where the vehicle stood now
getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy
time He pulled the horses head from the large patch
of turf it had eaten bare readjusted the boughs over
the coffin and drove along through the unwholesome
night
It had gradually become rumoured in the village
that the body to be brought and buried that day was
all that was left of the unfortunate Fanny Robin who
had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through
Melchester and onwards But
P 349
thanks to Boldwoods
reticence and Oaks generosity the lover she had followed
had never been individualized as Troy Gabriel hoped
that the whole truth of the matter might not be published
till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few
days when the interposing barriers of earth and time
and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut
into oblivion would deaden the sting that revelation and
invidious remark would have for Bathsheba just now
By the time that Gabriel reached the old manor+
house her residence which lay in his way to the church
it was quite dark A man came from the gate and said
through the fog which hung between them like blown
flour --
Is that Poorgrass with the corpse
Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson
 The corpse is here sir said Gabriel
I have just been to inquire of Mrs Troy if she could
tell me the reason of the delay I am afraid it is too
late now for the funeral to be performed with proper
decency Have you the registrars certificate  
 No said Gabriel I expect Poorgrass has that 
and hes at the Bucks Head I forgot to ask him
for it
Then that settles the matter Well put off the
funeral till to-morrow morning The body may be
brought on to the church or it may be left here at
the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning
They waited more than an hour and have now gone
home
Gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a
most objectionable plan notwithstanding that Fanny
had been an inmate of the farm-house for several years
in the lifetime of Bathshebas uncle Visions of several
unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay
flitted before him But his will was not law and he
went indoors to inquire of his mistress what were her
wishes on the subject He found her in an unusual
mood  her eyes as she looked up to him were suspicious
and perplexed as with some antecedent thought Troy
had not yet returned At first Bathsheba assented with
a mien of indifference to his proposition that they should
go on to the church at once with their burden but
immediately
P 350
afterwards following Gabriel to the gate
she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fannys
account and desired that the girl might be brought into
the house Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving
her in the waggon just as she lay now with her flowers
and green leaves about her merely wheeling the vehicle
into the coach-house till the morning but to no purpose
It is unkind and unchristian she said to leave the
poor thing in a coach-house all night
Very well then said the parson And I will
arrange that the funeral shall take place early to+
morrow Perhaps Mrs Troy is right in feeling that we
cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too thoughtfully
We must remember that though she may have erred
grievously in leaving her home she is still our sister 
and it is to be believed that Gods uncovenanted
mercies are extended towards her and that she is a
member of the flock of Christ
The parsons words spread into the heavy air with a
sad yet unperturbed cadence and Gabriel shed an
honest tear Bathsheba seemed unmoved Mr
Thirdly then left them and Gabriel lighted a lantern
Fetching three other men to assist him they bore the
unconscious truant indoors placing the coffin on two
benches in the middle of a little sitting-room next the
hall as Bathsheba directed
