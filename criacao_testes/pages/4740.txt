A ragged cheer went up Zei grabbed Owen by the hands spun him around in a circle and gave him a long wet kiss right there for all to see She tried to kiss Jon too but he held her by the shoulder and pushed her gently but firmly away No he said I am done with kissing Suddenly he was too weary to stand and his leg was agony from knee to groin He fumbled for his crutch Pyp help me to the cage Grenn you have the Wall

Me said Grenn Him said Pyp It was hard to tell which of them was more horrified But Grenn stammered b-but what do I do if the wildlings attack again

Stop them Jon told him

As they rode down in the cage Pyp took off his helm and wiped his brow Frozen sweat Is there anything as disgusting as frozen sweat He laughed Gods I don’t think I have ever been so hungry I could eat an aurochs whole I swear it Do you think Hobb will cook up Grenn for us When he saw Jon’s face his smile died What’s wrong Is it your leg

My leg Jon agreed Even the words were an effort

Not the battle though We won the battle

Ask me when I’ve seen the gate Jon said grimly I want a fire a hot meal a warm bed and something to make my leg stop hurting he told himself But first he had to check the tunnel and find what had become of Donal Noye

After the battle with the Thenns it had taken them almost a day to clear the ice and broken beams away from the inner gate Spotted Pate and Kegs and some of the other builders had argued heatedly that they ought just leave the debris there another obstacle for Mance That would have meant abandoning the defense of the tunnel though and Noye was having none of it With men in the murder holes and archers and spears behind each inner grate a few determined brothers could hold off a hundred times as many wildlings and clog the way with corpses He did not mean to give Mance Rayder free passage through the ice So with pick and spade and ropes they had moved the broken steps aside and dug back down to the gate

Jon waited by the cold iron bars while Pyp went to Maester Aemon for the spare key Surprisingly the maester himself returned with him and Clydas with a lantern Come see me when we are done the old man told Jon while Pyp was fumbling with the chains I need to change your dressing and apply a fresh poultice and you will want some more dreamwine for the pain

Jon nodded weakly The door swung open Pyp led them in followed by Clydas and the lantern It was all Jon could do to keep up with Maester Aemon The ice pressed close around them and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones the weight of the Wall above his head It felt like walking down the gullet of an ice dragon The tunnel took a twist and then another Pyp unlocked a second iron gate They walked farther turned again and saw light ahead faint and pale through the ice That’s bad Jon knew at once That’s very bad

Then Pyp said There’s blood on the floor

The last twenty feet of the tunnel was where they’d fought and died The outer door of studded oak had been hacked and broken and finally torn off its hinges and one of the giants had crawled in through the splinters The lantern bathed the grisly scene in a sullen reddish light Pyp turned aside to retch and Jon found himself envying Maester Aemon his blindness

Noye and his men had been waiting within behind a gate of heavy iron bars like the two Pyp had just unlocked The two crossbows had gotten off a dozen quarrels as the giant struggled toward them Then the spearmen must have come to the fore stabbing through the bars Still the giant found the strength to reach through twist the head off Spotted Pate seize the iron gate and wrench the bars apart Links of broken chain lay strewn across the floor One giant All this was the work of one giant

Are they all dead Maester Aemon asked softly

Yes Donal was the last Noye’s sword was sunk deep in the giant’s throat halfway to the hilt The armorer had always seemed such a big man to Jon but locked in the giant’s massive arms he looked almost like a child The giant crushed his spine I don’t know who died first He took the lantern and moved forward for a better look Mag I am the last of the giants He could feel the sadness there but he had no time for sadness It was Mag the Mighty The king of the giants

He needed sun then It was too cold and dark inside the tunnel and the stench of blood and death was suffocating Jon gave the lantern back to Clydas squeezed around the bodies and through the twisted bars and walked toward the daylight to see what lay beyond the splintered door

The huge carcass of a dead mammoth partially blocked the way One of the beast’s tusks snagged his cloak and tore it as he edged past Three more giants lay outside half buried beneath stone and slush and hardened pitch He could see where the fire had melted the Wall where great sheets of ice had come sloughing off in the heat to shatter on the blackened ground He looked up at where they’d come from When you stand here it seems immense as if it were about to crush you

Jon went back inside to where the others waited We need to repair the outer gate as best we can and then block up this section of the tunnel Rubble chunks of ice anything All the way to the second gate if we can Ser Wynton will need to take command he’s the last knight left but he needs to move now the giants will be back before we know it We have to tell him—

Tell him what you will said Maester Aemon gently He will smile nod and forget Thirty years ago Ser Wynton Stout came within a dozen votes of being Lord Commander He would have made a fine one Ten years ago he would still have been capable No longer You know that as well as Donal did Jon

It was true You give the order then Jon told the maester You have been on the Wall your whole life the men will follow you We have to close the gate

I am a maester chained and sworn My order serves Jon We give counsel not commands

Someone must—

You You must lead

No

Yes Jon It need not be for long Only until such time as the garrison returns Donal chose you and Qhorin Halfhand before him Lord Commander Mormont made you his steward You are a son of Winterfell a nephew of Benjen Stark It must be you or no one The Wall is yours Jon Snow





ARYA

She could feel the hole inside her every morning when she woke It wasn’t hunger though sometimes there was that too It was a hollow place an emptiness where her heart had been where her brothers had lived and her parents Her head hurt too Not as bad as it had at first but still pretty bad Arya was used to that though and at least the lump was going down But the hole inside her stayed the same The hole will never feel any better she told herself when she went to sleep

Some mornings Arya did not want to wake at all She would huddle beneath her cloak with her eyes squeezed shut and try to will herself back to sleep If the Hound would only have left her alone she would have slept all day and all night

And dreamed That was the best part the dreaming She dreamed of wolves most every night A great pack of wolves with her at the head She was bigger than any of them stronger swifter faster She could outrun horses and outfight lions When she bared her teeth even men would run from her her belly was never empty long and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold And her brothers and sisters were with her many and more of them fierce and terrible and hers They would never leave her

But if her nights were full of wolves her days belonged to the dog Sandor Clegane made her get up every morning whether she wanted to or not He would curse at her in his raspy voice or yank her to her feet and shake her Once he dumped a helm full of cold water all over her head She bounced up sputtering and shivering and tried to kick him but he only laughed Dry off and feed the bloody horses he told her and she did

They had two now Stranger and a sorrel palfrey mare Arya had named Craven because Sandor said she’d likely run off from the Twins the same as them They’d found her wandering riderless through a field the morning after the slaughter She was a good enough horse but Arya could not love a coward Stranger would have fought Still she tended the mare as best she knew It was better than riding double with the Hound And Craven might have been a coward but she was young and strong as well Arya thought that she might be able to outrun Stranger if it came to it

The Hound no longer watched her as closely as he had Sometimes he did not seem to care whether she stayed or went and he no longer bound her up in a cloak at night One night I’ll kill him in his sleep she told herself but she never did One day I’ll ride away on Craven and he won’t be able to catch me she thought but she never did that either Where would she go Winterfell was gone Her grandfather’s brother was at Riverrun but he didn’t know her no more than she knew him Maybe Lady Smallwood would take her in at Acorn Hall but maybe she wouldn’t Besides Arya wasn’t even sure she could find Acorn Hall again Sometimes she thought she might go back to Sharna’s inn if the floods hadn’t washed it away She could stay with Hot Pie or maybe Lord Beric would find her there Anguy would teach her to use a bow and she could ride with Gendry and be an outlaw like Wenda the White Fawn in the songs

But that was just stupid like something Sansa might dream Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her just like the Hound None of them wanted her around They were never my pack not even Hot Pie and Gendry I was stupid to think so just a stupid little girl and no wolf at all

So she stayed with the Hound They rode every day never sleeping twice in the same place avoiding towns and villages and castles as best they could Once she asked Sandor Clegane where they were going Away he said That’s all you need to know You’re not worth spit to me now and I don’t want to hear your whining I should have let you run into that bloody castle

You should have she agreed thinking of her mother

You’d be dead if I had You ought to thank me You ought to sing me a pretty little song the way your sister did

Did you hit her with an axe too

I hit you with the flat of the axe you stupid little bitch If I’d hit you with the blade there’d still be chunks of your head floating down the Green Fork Now shut your bloody mouth If I had any sense I’d give you to the silent sisters They cut the tongues out of girls who talk too much

That wasn’t fair of him to say Aside from that one time Arya hardly talked at all Whole days passed when neither of them said anything She was too empty to talk and the Hound was too angry She could feel the fury in him she could see it on his face the way his mouth would tighten and twist the looks he gave her Whenever he took his axe to chop some wood for a fire he would slide into a cold rage hacking savagely at the tree or the deadfall or the broken limb until they had twenty times as much kindling and firewood as they’d needed Sometimes he would be so sore and tired afterward that he would lie down and go right to sleep without even lighting a fire Arya hated it when that happened and hated him too Those were the nights when she stared the longest at the axe It looks awfully heavy but I bet I could swing it She wouldn’t hit him with the flat either

Sometimes in their wanderings they glimpsed other people farmers in their fields swineherds with their pigs a milkmaid leading a cow a squire carrying a message down a rutted road She never wanted to speak to them either It was as if they lived in some distant land and spoke a queer alien tongue they had nothing to do with her or her with them

Besides it wasn’t safe to be seen From time to time columns of horsemen passed down the winding farm roads the twin towers of Frey flying before them Hunting for stray northmen the Hound said when they had passed Any time you hear hooves get your head down fast it’s not like to be a friend

One day in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen oak they came face to face with another survivor of the Twins The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk and he told them he was Ser Marq Piper’s man a bowman though he’d lost his bow His left shoulder was all twisted and swollen where it met his arm a blow from a mace he said it had broken his shoulder and smashed his chainmail deep into his flesh A northman it was he wept His badge was a bloody man and he saw mine and made a jape red man and pink maiden maybe they should get together I drank to his Lord Bolton he drank to Ser Marq and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the King in the North And then he killed me His eyes were fever bright when he said that and Arya could tell that it was true His shoulder was swollen grotesquely and pus and blood had stained his whole left side There was a stink to him too He smells like a corpse The man begged them for a drink of wine

If I’d had any wine I’d have drunk it myself the Hound told him I can give you water and the gift of mercy

The archer looked at him a long while before he said You’re Joffrey’s dog

My own dog now Do you want the water

Aye The man swallowed And the mercy Please

They had passed a small pond a short ways back Sandor gave Arya his helm and told her to fill it so she trudged back to the water’s edge Mud squished over the toe of her boots She used the dog’s head as a pail Water ran out through the eyeholes but the bottom of the helm still held a lot

When she came back the archer turned his face up and she poured the water into his mouth He gulped it down as fast as she could pour and what he couldn’t gulp ran down his cheeks into the brown blood that crusted his whiskers until pale pink tears dangled from his beard When the water was gone he clutched the helm and licked the steel Good he said I wish it was wine though I wanted wine
