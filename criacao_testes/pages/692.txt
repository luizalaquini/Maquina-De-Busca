Tyrion had claimed Pycelle’s old place at the foot propped up by cushions so he could gaze down the length of the table Dispossessed Pycelle had moved up next to Cersei about as far from the dwarf as he could get without claiming the king’s seat The Grand Maester was a shambling skeleton leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as he walked a few white hairs sprouting from his long chicken’s neck in place of his once-luxuriant white beard Tyrion gazed at him without remorse

The others had to scramble for seats Lord Mace Tyrell a heavy robust man with curling brown hair and a spade-shaped beard well salted with white Paxter Redwyne of the Arbor stoop-shouldered and thin his bald head fringed by tufts of orange hair Mathis Rowan Lord of Goldengrove clean-shaven stout and sweating the High Septon a frail man with wispy white chin hair Too many strange faces Tyrion thought too many new players The game changed while I lay rotting in my bed and no one will tell me the rules

Oh the lords had been courteous enough though he could tell how uncomfortable it made them to look at him That chain of yours that was cunning Mace Tyrell had said in a jolly tone and Lord Redwyne nodded and said Quite so quite so my lord of Highgarden speaks for all of us and very cheerfully too

Tell it to the people of this city Tyrion thought bitterly Tell it to the bloody singers with their songs of Renly’s ghost

His uncle Kevan had been the warmest going so far as to kiss his cheek and say Lancel has told me how brave you were Tyrion He speaks very highly of you

He’d better or I’ll have a few things to say of him He made himself smile and say My good cousin is too kind His wound is healing I trust

Ser Kevan frowned One day he seems stronger the next… it is worrisome Your sister often visits his sickbed to lift his spirits and pray for him

But is she praying that he lives or dies Cersei had made shameless use of their cousin both in and out of bed a little secret she no doubt hoped Lancel would carry to his grave now that Father was here and she no longer had need of him Would she go so far as to murder him though To look at her today you would never suspect Cersei was capable of such ruthlessness She was all charm flirting with Lord Tyrell as they spoke of Joffrey’s wedding feast complimenting Lord Redwyne on the valor of his twins softening gruff Lord Rowan with jests and smiles making pious noises at the High Septon Shall we begin with the wedding arrangements she asked as Lord Tywin took his seat

No their father said With the war Varys

The eunuch smiled a silken smile I have such delicious tidings for you all my lords Yesterday at dawn our brave Lord Randyll caught Robett Glover outside Duskendale and trapped him against the sea Losses were heavy on both sides but in the end our loyal men prevailed Ser Helman Tallhart is reported dead with a thousand others Robett Glover leads the survivors back toward Harrenhal in bloody disarray little dreaming he will find valiant Ser Gregor and his stalwarts athwart his path

Gods be praised said Paxter Redwyne A great victory for King Joffrey 

What did Joffrey have to do with it thought Tyrion

And a terrible defeat for the north certainly observed Littlefinger yet one in which Robb Stark played no part The Young Wolf remains unbeaten in the field

What do we know of Stark’s plans and movements asked Mathis Rowan ever blunt and to the point

He has run back to Riverrun with his plunder abandoning the castles he took in the west announced Lord Tywin Our cousin Ser Daven is reforming the remnants of his late father’s army at Lannisport When they are ready he shall join Ser Forley Prester at the Golden Tooth As soon as the Stark boy starts north Ser Forley and Ser Daven will descend on Riverrun

You are certain Lord Stark means to go north Lord Rowan asked Even with the ironmen at Moat Cailin

Mace Tyrell spoke up Is there anything as pointless as a king without a kingdom No it’s plain the boy must abandon the riverlands join his forces to Roose Bolton’s once more and throw all his strength against Moat Cailin That is what I would do

Tyrion had to bite his tongue at that Robb Stark had won more battles in a year than the Lord of Highgarden had in twenty Tyrell’s reputation rested on one indecisive victory over Robert Baratheon at Ashford in a battle largely won by Lord Tarly’s van before the main host had even arrived The siege of Storm’s End where Mace Tyrell actually did hold the command had dragged on a year to no result and after the Trident was fought the Lord of Highgarden had meekly dipped his banners to Eddard Stark

I ought to write Robb Stark a stern letter Littlefinger was saying I understand his man Bolton is stabling goats in my high hall it’s really quite unconscionable

Ser Kevan Lannister cleared his throat As regards the Starks… Balon Greyjoy who now styles himself King of the Isles and the North has written to us offering terms of alliance

He ought to be offering fealty snapped Cersei By what right does he call himself king

By right of conquest Lord Tywin said King Balon has strangler’s fingers round the Neck Robb Stark’s heirs are dead Winterfell is fallen and the ironmen hold Moat Cailin Deepwood Motte and most of the Stony Shore King Balon’s longships command the sunset sea and are well placed to menace Lannisport Fair Isle and even Highgarden should we provoke him

And if we accept this alliance inquired Lord Mathis Rowan What terms does he propose

That we recognize his kingship and grant him everything north of the Neck

Lord Redwyne laughed What is there north of the Neck that any sane man would want If Greyjoy will trade swords and sails for stone and snow I say do it and count ourselves lucky

Truly agreed Mace Tyrell That’s what I would do Let King Balon finish the northmen whilst we finish Stannis

Lord Tywin’s face gave no hint as to his feelings There is Lysa Arryn to deal with as well Jon Arryn’s widow Hoster Tully’s daughter Catelyn Stark’s sister… whose husband was conspiring with Stannis Baratheon at the time of his death
