No She folded her arms across the swell of her belly protectively

At the last Viserys looked at her Sister please… Dany tell them… make them… sweet sister…

When the gold was half-melted and starting to run Drogo reached into the flames snatched out the pot Crown he roared Here A crown for Cart King And upended the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother

The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was like nothing human His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor slowed stopped Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest setting the scarlet silk to smoldering… yet no drop of blood was spilled

He was no dragon Dany thought curiously calm Fire cannot kill a dragon





EDDARD

He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell as he he had walked a thousand times before The Kings of Winter watched him pass with eyes of ice and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone heads and snarled Last of all he came to the tomb where his father slept with Brandon and Lyanna beside him Promise me Ned Lyanna’s statue whispered She wore a garland of pale blue roses and her eyes wept blood

Eddard Stark jerked upright his heart racing the blankets tangled around him The room was black as pitch and someone was hammering on the door Lord Eddard a voice called loudly

A moment Groggy and naked he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber When he opened the door he found Tomard with an upraised fist and Cayn with a taper in hand Between them stood the king’s own steward

The man’s face might have been carved of stone so little did it show My lord Hand he intoned His Grace the King commands your presence At once

So Robert had returned from his hunt It was long past time I shall need a few moments to dress Ned left the man waiting without Cayn helped him with his clothes white linen tunic and grey cloak trousers cut open down his plaster-sheathed leg his badge of office and last of all a belt of heavy silver links He sheathed the Valyrian dagger at his waist

The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner bailey The moon hung low over the walls ripening toward full On the ramparts a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds

The royal apartments were in Maegor’s Holdfast a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes a castle-within-a-castle Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight Within Ned passed two other knights of the Kingsguard Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps and Ser Barristan Selmy waited at the door of the king’s bedchamber Three men in white cloaks he thought remembering and a strange chill went through him Ser Barristan’s face was as pale as his armor Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong The royal steward opened the door Lord Eddard Stark the Hand of the King he announced

Bring him here Robert’s voice called strangely thick

Fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber filling the room with a sullen red glare The heat within was suffocating Robert lay across the canopied bed At the bedside hovered Grand Maester Pycelle while Lord Renly paced restlessly before the shuttered windows Servants moved back and forth feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her husband Her hair was tousled as if from sleep but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes They followed Ned as Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the room He seemed to move very slowly as if he were still dreaming

The king still wore his boots Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where Robert’s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him A green doublet lay on the floor slashed open and discarded the cloth crusted with red-brown stains The room smelled of smoke and blood and death

Ned the king whispered when he saw him His face was pale as milk Come… closer

His men brought him close Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost He had only to look down at Robert to know how bad it was What… he began his throat clenched

A boar Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens his cloak spattered with blood

A devil the king husked My own fault Too much wine damn me to hell Missed my thrust

And where were the rest of you Ned demanded of Lord Renly Where was Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard

Renly’s mouth twitched My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone

Eddard Stark lifted the blanket

They had done what they could to close him up but it was nowhere near enough The boar must have been a fearsome thing It had ripped the king from groin to nipple with its tusks The wine-soaked bandages that Grand Maester Pycelle had applied were already black with blood and the smell off the wound was hideous Ned’s stomach turned He let the blanket fall

Stinks Robert said The stink of death don’t think I can’t smell it Bastard did me good eh But I… I paid him back in kind Ned The king’s smile was as terrible as his wound his teeth red Drove a knife right through his eye Ask them if I didn’t Ask them
