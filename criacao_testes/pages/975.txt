220 For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye
shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it
ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God

221 For even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered
for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps 222
Who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth 223 Who when
he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened
not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously 224 Who
his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being
dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were
healed

225 For ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls

31 Likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that
if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives 32 While they behold your chaste
conversation coupled with fear

33 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel 34 But let
it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of
God of great price

35 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also who
trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own
husbands 36 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him lord whose
daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any
amazement

37 Likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge
giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being
heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not
hindered

38 Finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another
love as brethren be pitiful be courteous 39 Not rendering evil for
evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that
ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing

310 For he that will love life and see good days let him refrain
his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile 311 Let
him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it

312 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are
open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that
do evil

313 And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that
which is good  314 But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake
happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled
315 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear 316 Having a good conscience that
whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ

317 For it is better if the will of God be so that ye suffer for
well doing than for evil doing

318 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the
unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the
flesh but quickened by the Spirit 319 By which also he went and
preached unto the spirits in prison 320 Which sometime were
disobedient when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls
were saved by water

321 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good
conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ 322 Who
is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him

41 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in
the flesh hath ceased from sin 42 That he no longer should live the
rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of
God

43 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess
of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries 44
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot speaking evil of you 45 Who shall give account to
him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead

46 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but
live according to God in the spirit

47 But the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and
watch unto prayer

48 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins
