The tunnel was dug for another King’s Hand whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence

And yet you knew of it

Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel Careful the steps are steep

They emerged through a trap at the back of a stable having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under Rhaenys’s Hill A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about A mule and three horses occupied the stalls He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth Old he said and I have my doubts about his wind

He is not a mount to carry you into battle true Varys replied but he will serve and attract no notice As will the others And the stableboys see and hear only the animals The eunuch took a cloak from a peg It was roughspun sun-faded and threadbare but very ample in its cut If you will permit me When he swept it over Tyrion’s shoulders it enveloped him head to heel with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows Men see what they expect to see Varys said as he fussed and pulled Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children so a child is what they will see A boy in an old cloak on his father’s horse going about his father’s business Though it would be best if you came most often by night

I plan to… after today At the moment though Shae awaits me He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King’s Landing not far from the sea but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed

Which horse will you have

Tyrion shrugged This one will do well enough

I shall saddle him for you Varys took tack and saddle down from a peg

Tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly You missed a lively council Stannis has crowned himself it seems

I know

He accuses my brother and sister of incest I wonder how he came by that suspicion

Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard’s hair as Ned Stark did and Jon Arryn before him Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear The eunuch’s laugh was not his usual giggle but deeper and more throaty

Someone like you perchance

Am I suspected It was not me

If it had been would you admit it

No But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long It is one thing to deceive a king and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney Besides the bastards were there for all to see

Robert’s bastards What of them

He fathered eight to the best of my knowing Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle Their mothers were copper and honey chestnut and butter yet the babes were all black as ravens… and as ill-omened it would seem So when Joffrey Myrcella and Tommen slid out between your sister’s thighs each as golden as the sun the truth was not hard to glimpse

Tyrion shook his head If she had borne only one child for her husband it would have been enough to disarm suspicion… but then she would not have been Cersei If you were not this whisperer who was

Some traitor doubtless Varys tightened the cinch

Littlefinger

I named no name

Tyrion let the eunuch help him mount Lord Varys he said from the saddle sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King’s Landing and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy

How odd I think quite the same of you
