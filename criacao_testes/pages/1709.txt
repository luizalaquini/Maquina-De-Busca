He drew out his flute and began to play  Jockey to
the Fair in the style of a man who had never known
moments sorrow Oak could pipe with Arcadian
sweetness and the sound of the well-known notes
cheered his own heart as well as those of the loungers
He played on with spirit and in half an hour had
earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute
man
By making inquiries he learnt that there was another
fair at Shottsford the next day
How far is Shottsford
Ten miles tother side of Weatherbury
Weatherbury It was where Bathsheba had gone
two months before This information was like coming
from night into noon
How far is it to Weatherbury 
Five or six miles
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
this time but the place had enough interest attaching
to it to lead Oak to choose Shottsford fair as his next
field of inquiry because it lay in the Weatherbury
quarter Moreover the Weatherbury folk were by no
means uninteresting intrinsically If report spoke truly
they were as hardy merry thriving wicked a set as
any in the whole county Oak resolved to sleep at
Weatherbury -- -that -- night on his way to Shottsford
and struck out at once -- into the -- high road which had
been recommended as the direct route to the village in
question
The road stretched through water-meadows traversed
by little brooks whose quivering surfaces were braided
along their centres and folded into creases at the sides
or where the flow was more rapid the stream was pied
with spots of white froth

which rode on in undisturbed
serenity On the higher levels the dead and dry carcases
of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter+
skelter upon the shoulders of the wind and little birds
in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking
themselves in comfortably for the night retaining their
places if Oak kept moving but flying away if he
stopped to look at them He passed by Yalbury-Wood
where the game-birds were rising to their roosts and
heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants cu-uck cuck
and the wheezy whistle of the hens
By the time he had walked three or four miles every
shape in the-landscape had assumed a uniform hue of
blackness He descended Yalbury Hill and could just
discern ahead of him a waggon drawn up under a great
over-hanging tree by the roadside
On coming close he found there were no horses
attached to it the spot being apparently quite deserted
The waggon from its position seemed to have been left
there for the night for beyond about half a truss  of hay
which was heaped in the bottom it was quite empty
Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and con+
sidered his position He calculated that he had walked
a very fair proportion of the journey and having been
on foot since daybreak he felt tempted to lie down upon
the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the
village of Weatherbury and having to pay for a lodging
Eating his las slices of bread and ham and drinking
from the bottle of cider he had taken the precaution to
bring with him he got into the lonely waggon Here
he spread half of the hay as a bed and as well as he
could in the darkness pulled the other half over him
by way of bed-clothes covering himself entirely and
feeling physically as comfortable as ever he had been
in his life Inward melancholy it was impossible for
a man like Oak introspective far beyond his neighbours
to banish quite whilst conning the present untoward
page of his history So thinking of his misfortunes
amorous and pastoral he fell asleep shepherds enjoying
in common with sailors the privilege of being able to
summon the god instead of having to wait for him

On somewhat suddenly awaking after a sleep of
whose length he had no idea Oak found that the waggon
was in motion He was being carried along the road
at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without
springs and under circumstances of physical uneadiness
his head being dandled up and down on the bed of
the waggon like a kettledrum-stick He then dis+
tinguished voices in conversation comig from the
forpart of the waggon His concern at this dilemma
which would have been alarm had he been a thriving
man but -- misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror
led him to peer cautiously from the hay and the first
sight he beheld was the stars above him Charless
Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole
star and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine
oclock -- in other words that he had slept two hours
This small astronomical calculation was made without
any positive effort and whilst he was stealthily turning
to discover if possible into whose hands he had fallen
Two figures were dimly visible in front sitting with
their legs outside the waggon one of whom was driving
Gabriel soon found that this was the waggoner and it
appeared they had come from Casterbridge fair like
