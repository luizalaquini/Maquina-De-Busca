Best go the rest of the way on foot m’lord It’s just over that ridge

Royce paused a moment staring off into the distance his face reflective A cold wind whispered through the trees His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive

There’s something wrong here Gared muttered

The young knight gave him a disdainful smile Is there

Can’t you feel it Gared asked Listen to the darkness

Will could feel it Four years in the Night’s Watch and he had never been so afraid What was it

Wind Trees rustling A wolf Which sound is it that unmans you so Gared When Gared did not answer Royce slid gracefully from his saddle He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb well away from the other horses and drew his longsword from its sheath Jewels glittered in its hilt and the moonlight ran down the shining steel It was a splendid weapon castle-forged and new-made from the look of it Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger

The trees press close here Will warned That sword will tangle you up m’lord Better a knife

If I need instruction I will ask for it the young lord said Gared stay here Guard the horses

Gared dismounted We need a fire I’ll see to it

How big a fool are you old man If there are enemies in this wood a fire is the last thing we want

There’s some enemies a fire will keep away Gared said Bears and direwolves and… and other things…

Ser Waymar’s mouth became a hard line No fire

Gared’s hood shadowed his face but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword It was a short ugly thing its grip discolored by sweat its edge nicked from hard use but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling’s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard

Finally Gared looked down No fire he muttered low under his breath

Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away Lead on he said to Will

Will threaded their way through a thicket then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree Under the thin crust of snow the ground was damp and muddy slick footing with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up Will made no sound as he climbed Behind him he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling’s ringmail the rustle of leaves and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak

The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge where Will had known it would be its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground Will slid in underneath flat on his belly in the snow and the mud and looked down on the empty clearing below

His heart stopped in his chest For a moment he dared not breathe Moonlight shone down on the clearing the ashes of the firepit the snow-covered lean-to the great rock the little half-frozen stream Everything was just as it had been a few hours ago

They were gone All the bodies were gone

Gods he heard behind him A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge He stood there beside the sentinel longsword in hand his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up outlined nobly against the stars for all to see

Get down Will whispered urgently Something’s wrong

Royce did not move He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed Your dead men seem to have moved camp Will

Will’s voice abandoned him He groped for words that did not come It was not possible His eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite stopped on the axe A huge double-bladed battle-axe still lying where he had seen it last untouched A valuable weapon…

On your feet Will Ser Waymar commanded There’s no one here I won’t have you hiding under a bush

Reluctantly Will obeyed

Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging We will find these men He glanced around Up the tree Be quick about it Look for a fire

Will turned away wordless There was no use to argue The wind was moving It cut right through him He went to the tree a vaulting grey-green sentinel and began to climb Soon his hands were sticky with sap and he was lost among the needles Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood and slipped his dirk free of its sheath He put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort

Down below the lordling called out suddenly Who goes there Will heard uncertainty in the challenge He stopped climbing he listened he watched

The woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snow owl

The Others made no sound

Will saw movement from the corner of his eye Pale shapes gliding through the wood He turned his head glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness Then it was gone Branches stirred gently in the wind scratching at one another with wooden fingers Will opened his mouth to call down a warning and the words seemed to freeze in his throat Perhaps he was wrong Perhaps it had only been a bird a reflection on the snow some trick of the moonlight What had he seen after all

Will where are you Ser Waymar called up Can you see anything He was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in hand He must have felt them as Will felt them There was nothing to see Answer me Why is it so cold

It was cold Shivering Will clung more tightly to his perch His face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel He could feel the sweet sticky sap on his cheek

A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood It stood in front of Royce Tall it was and gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh pale as milk Its armor seemed to change color as it moved here it was white as new-fallen snow there black as shadow everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took

Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss Come no farther the lordling warned His voice cracked like a boy’s He threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands The wind had stopped It was very cold

The Other slid forward on silent feet In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade It was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghost-light that played around its edges and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor

Ser Waymar met him bravely Dance with me then He lifted his sword high over his head defiant His hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold Yet in that moment Will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the Night’s Watch

The Other halted Will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes a blue that burned like ice They fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal For a heartbeat he dared to hope

They emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first Three of them… four… five… Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them Will had to call out It was his duty And his death if he did He shivered and hugged the tree and kept the silence

The pale sword came shivering through the air

Ser Waymar met it with steel When the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain Royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step Another flurry of blows and he fell back again

Behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood Yet they made no move to interfere

Again and again the swords met until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight His blade was white with frost the Other’s danced with pale blue light

Then Royce’s parry came a beat too late The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm The young lord cried out in pain Blood welled between the rings It steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow Ser Waymar’s fingers brushed his side His moleskin glove came away soaked with red

The Other said something in a language that Will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking

Ser Waymar Royce found his fury For Robert he shouted and he came up snarling lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it The Other’s parry was almost lazy

When the blades touched the steel shattered

A scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles Royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes Blood welled between his fingers

The watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given Swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence It was cold butchery The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk Will closed his eyes Far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles
