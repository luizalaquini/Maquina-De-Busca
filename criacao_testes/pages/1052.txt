The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned’s badge and the sigil on his doublet and the master came hurrying out all smiles and bows Wine for the King’s Hand he told the girl gesturing Ned to a couch I am Tobho Mott my lord please please put yourself at ease He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon’s egg If you are in need of new arms for the Hand’s tourney you have come to the right shop Ned did not bother to correct him My work is costly and I make no apologies for that my lord he said as he filled two matching silver goblets You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms I promise you Visit every forge in King’s Landing if you like and compare for yourself Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail my work is art

Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here Tobho boasted and many high lords the ones who knew fine steel and even Lord Renly the king’s own brother Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly’s new armor the green plate with the golden antlers No other armorer in the city could get that deep a green he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as a boy Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark is it not I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street he vowed

Ned smiled Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn

Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine The Hand did call upon me with Lord Stannis the king’s brother I regret to say they did not honor me with their patronage

Ned looked at the man evenly saying nothing waiting He had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions And so it was this time

They asked to see the boy the armorer said so I took them back to the forge

The boy Ned echoed He had no notion who the boy might be I should like to see the boy as well

Tobho Mott gave him a cool careful look As you wish my lord he said with no trace of his former friendliness He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done When the armorer opened the door the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon’s mouth Inside a forge blazed in each corner and the air stank of smoke and sulfur Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows

The master called over a tall lad about Robb’s age his arms and chest corded with muscle This is Lord Stark the new Hand of the King he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers Thick hair shaggy and unkempt and black as ink The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw This is Gendry Strong for his age and he works hard Show the Hand that helmet you made lad Almost shyly the boy led them to his bench and a steel helm shaped like a bull’s head with two great curving horns

Ned turned the helm over in his hands It was raw steel unpolished but expertly shaped This is fine work I would be pleased if you would let me buy it

The boy snatched it out of his hands It’s not for sale

Tobho Mott looked horror-struck Boy this is the King’s Hand If his lordship wants this helm make him a gift of it He honors you by asking

I made it for me the boy said stubbornly

A hundred pardons my lord his master said hurriedly to Ned The boy is crude as new steel and like new steel would profit from some beating That helm is journeyman’s work at best Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen

He’s done nothing that requires my forgiveness Gendry when Lord Arryn came to see you what did you talk about

He asked me questions is all m’lord

What sort of questions

The boy shrugged How was I and was I well treated and if I liked the work and stuff about my mother Who she was and what she looked like and all

What did you tell him Ned asked

The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead She died when I was little She had yellow hair and sometimes she used to sing to me I remember She worked in an alehouse

Did Lord Stannis question you as well

The bald one No not him He never said no word just glared at me like I was some raper who done for his daughter

Mind your filthy tongue the master said This is the King’s own Hand The boy lowered his eyes A smart boy but stubborn That helm… the others call him bullheaded so he threw it in their teeth

Ned touched the boy’s head fingering the thick black hair Look at me Gendry The apprentice lifted his face Ned studied the shape of his jaw the eyes like blue ice Yes he thought I see it Go back to your work lad I’m sorry to have bothered you He walked back to the house with the master Who paid the boy’s apprentice fee he asked lightly

Mott looked fretful You saw the boy Such a strong boy Those hands of his those hands were made for hammers He had such promise I took him on without a fee

The truth now Ned urged The streets are full of strong boys The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down Who paid for him

A lord the master said reluctantly He gave no name and wore no sigil on his coat He paid in gold twice the customary sum and said he was paying once for the boy and once for my silence

Describe him

He was stout round of shoulder not so tall as you Brown beard but there was a bit of red in it I’ll swear He wore a rich cloak that I do remember heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear He hesitated a moment My lord I want no trouble

None of us wants trouble but I fear these are troubled times Master Mott Ned said You know who the boy is

I am only an armorer my lord I know what I’m told

You know who the boy is Ned repeated patiently That is not a question

The boy is my apprentice the master said He looked Ned in the eye stubborn as old iron Who he was before he came to me that’s none of my concern

Ned nodded He decided that he liked Tobho Mott master armorer If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one send him to me He has the look of a warrior Until then you have my thanks Master Mott and my promise Should I ever want a helm to frighten children this will be the first place I visit

His guard was waiting outside with the horses Did you find anything my lord Jacks asked as Ned mounted up

I did Ned told him wondering What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard and why was it worth his life





CATELYN

My lady you ought cover your head Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north You will take a chill

It is only water Ser Rodrik Catelyn replied Her hair hung wet and heavy a loose strand stuck to her forehead and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look but for once she did not care The southern rain was soft and warm Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face gentle as a mother’s kisses It took her back to her childhood to long grey days at Riverrun She remembered the godswood drooping branches heavy with moisture and the sound of her brother’s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves She remembered making mud pies with Lysa the weight of them the mud slick and brown between her fingers They had served them to Littlefinger giggling and he’d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week How young they all had been

Catelyn had almost forgotten In the north the rain fell cold and hard and sometimes at night it turned to ice It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter That was no rain for little girls to play in

I am soaked through Ser Rodrik complained Even my bones are wet The woods pressed close around them and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud We will want a fire tonight my lady and a hot meal would serve us both

There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead Catelyn told him She had slept many a night there in her youth traveling with her father Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime always riding somewhere She still remembered the innkeep a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey rich and heavy on the tongue but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles The sourleaf had stained Masha’s teeth a dark red and made her smile a bloody horror

An inn Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully If only… but we dare not risk it If we wish to remain unknown I think it best we seek out some small holdfast… He broke off as they heard sounds up the road splashing water the clink of mail a horse’s whinny Riders he warned his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword Even on the kingsroad it never hurt to be wary

They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream Catelyn reined up to let them pass The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard Mallisters Ser Rodrik whispered to her as if she had not known My lady best pull up your hood

Catelyn made no move Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them surrounded by his knights his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind They were riding for King’s Landing and the Hand’s tourney she knew For the past week the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad knights and freeriders singers with their harps and drums heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey traders and craftsmen and whores and all of them moving south

She studied Lord Jason boldly The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys and his gifts had been lavish His brown hair was salted with white now his face chiseled gaunt by time yet the years had not touched his pride He rode like a man who feared nothing Catelyn envied him that she had come to fear so much As the riders passed Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting but it was only a high lord’s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road There was no recognition in those fierce eyes and his son did not even waste a look

He did not know you Ser Rodrik said after wondering

He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road wet and tired It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord I think we shall be safe enough at the inn Ser Rodrik
