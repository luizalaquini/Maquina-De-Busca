You have done House Frey a grievous insult Robb

I never meant to Ser Stevron died for me and Olyvar was as loyal a squire as any king could want He asked to stay with me but Ser Ryman took him with the rest All their strength The Greatjon urged me to attack them…

Fighting your own in the midst of your enemies she said It would have been the end of you

Yes I thought perhaps we could arrange other matches for Lord Walder’s daughters Ser Wendel Manderly has offered to take one and the Greatjon tells me his uncles wish to wed again If Lord Walder will be reasonable—

He is not reasonable said Catelyn He is proud and prickly to a fault You know that He wanted to be grandfather to a king You will not appease him with the offer of two hoary old brigands and the second son of the fattest man in the Seven Kingdoms Not only have you broken your oath but you’ve slighted the honor of the Twins by choosing a bride from a lesser house

Robb bristled at that The Westerlings are better blood than the Freys They’re an ancient line descended from the First Men The Kings of the Rock sometimes wed Westerlings before the Conquest and there was another Jeyne Westerling who was queen to King Maegor three hundred years ago

All of which will only salt Lord Walder’s wounds It has always rankled him that older houses look down on the Freys as upstarts This insult is not the first he’s borne to hear him tell it Jon Arryn was disinclined to foster his grandsons and my father refused the offer of one of his daughters for Edmure She inclined her head toward her brother as he rejoined them

Your Grace Brynden Blackflsh said perhaps we had best continue this in private

Yes Robb sounded tired I would kill for a cup of wine The audience chamber I think

As they started up the steps Catelyn asked the question that had been troubling her since she entered the hall Robb where is Grey Wind

In the yard with a haunch of mutton I told the kennelmaster to see that he was fed

You always kept him with you before

A hall is no place for a wolf He gets restless you’ve seen Growling and snapping I should never have taken him into battle with me He’s killed too many men to fear them now Jeyne’s anxious around him and he terrifies her mother

And there’s the heart of it Catelyn thought He is part of you Robb To fear him is to fear you

I am not a wolf no matter what they call me Robb sounded cross Grey Wind killed a man at the Crag another at Ashemark and six or seven at Oxcross If you had seen—

I saw Bran’s wolf tear out a man’s throat at Winterfell she said sharply and loved him for it

That’s different The man at the Crag was a knight Jeyne had known all her life You can’t blame her for being afraid Grey Wind doesn’t like her uncle either He bares his teeth every time Ser Rolph comes near him

A chill went through her Send Ser Rolph away At once

Where Back to the Crag so the Lannisters can mount his head on a spike Jeyne loves him He’s her uncle and a fair knight besides I need more men like Rolph Spicer not fewer I am not going to banish him just because my wolf doesn’t seem to like the way he smells

Robb She stopped and held his arm I told you once to keep Theon Greyjoy close and you did not listen Listen now Send this man away I am not saying you must banish him Find some task that requires a man of courage some honorable duty what it is matters not… but do not keep him near you

He frowned Should I have Grey Wind sniff all my knights There might be others whose smell he mislikes

Any man Grey Wind mislikes is a man I do not want close to you These wolves are more than wolves Robb You must know that I think perhaps the gods sent them to us Your father’s gods the old gods of the north Five wolf pups Robb five for five Stark children

Six said Robb There was a wolf for Jon as well I found them remember I know how many there were and where they came from I used to think the same as you that the wolves were our guardians our protectors until…

Until she prompted

Robb’s mouth tightened …Until they told me that Theon had murdered Bran and Rickon Small good their wolves did them I am no longer a boy Mother I’m a king and I can protect myself He sighed I will find some duty for Ser Rolph some pretext to send him away Not because of his smell but to ease your mind You have suffered enough

Relieved Catelyn kissed him lightly on the cheek before the others could come around the turn of the stair and for a moment he was her boy again and not her king

Lord Hoster’s private audience chamber was a small room above the Great Hall better suited to intimate discussions Robb took the high seat removed his crown and set it on the floor beside him as Catelyn rang for wine Edmure was filling his uncle’s ear with the whole story of the fight at the Stone Mill It was only after the servants had come and gone that the Blackfish cleared his throat and said I think we’ve all heard sufficient of your boasting Nephew
