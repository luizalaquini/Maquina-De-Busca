3520 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from
the presence of Moses

3521 And they came every one whose heart stirred him up and every
one whom his spirit made willing and they brought the LORDs offering
to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation and for all his
service and for the holy garments

3522 And they came both men and women as many as were willing
hearted and brought bracelets and earrings and rings and tablets
all jewels of gold and every man that offered offered an offering of
gold unto the LORD

3523 And every man with whom was found blue and purple and
scarlet and fine linen and goats hair and red skins of rams and
badgers skins brought them

3524 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought
the LORDs offering and every man with whom was found shittim wood
for any work of the service brought it

3525 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
hands and brought that which they had spun both of blue and of
purple and of scarlet and of fine linen

3526 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
goats hair

3527 And the rulers brought onyx stones and stones to be set for
the ephod and for the breastplate 3528 And spice and oil for the
light and for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense

3529 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD
every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all
manner of work which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of
Moses

3530 And Moses said unto the children of Israel See the LORD hath
called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe
of Judah 3531 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God in
wisdom in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of
workmanship 3532 And to devise curious works to work in gold and
in silver and in brass 3533 And in the cutting of stones to set
them and in carving of wood to make any manner of cunning work

3534 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach both he and
Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan

3535 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart to work all manner of
work of the engraver and of the cunning workman and of the
embroiderer in blue and in purple in scarlet and in fine linen
and of the weaver even of them that do any work and of those that
devise cunning work

361 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab and every wise hearted man in
whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the sanctuary according to all that
the LORD had commanded

362 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab and every wise hearted
man in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom even every one whose
heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it 363 And they
received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had
brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary to make it
withal And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning

364 And all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary
came every man from his work which they made 365 And they spake unto
Moses saying The people bring much more than enough for the service
of the work which the LORD commanded to make

366 And Moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp saying Let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary So the people were restrained
from bringing

367 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it and too much

368 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and
