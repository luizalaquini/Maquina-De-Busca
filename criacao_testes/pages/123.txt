Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward Show me your steel Lord Eddard I’ll butcher you like Aerys if I must but I’d sooner you died with a blade in your hand He gave Littlefinger a cool contemptuous glance Lord Baelish I’d leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing

Littlefinger did not need to be urged I will bring the City Watch he promised Ned The Lannister line parted to let him through and closed behind him Littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished around a corner

Ned’s men had drawn their swords but they were three against twenty Eyes watched from nearby windows and doors but no one was about to intervene His party was mounted the Lannisters on foot save for Jaime himself A charge might win them free but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a surer safer tactic Kill me he warned the Kingslayer and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion

Jaime Lannister poked at Ned’s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings Would she The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage I think… not He sighed But I am not willing to chance my brother’s life on a woman’s honor Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath So I suppose I’ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you I wonder if he’ll care Jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around When he was beyond the line of swordsmen he glanced back at his captain Tregar see that no harm comes to Lord Stark

As you say m’lord

Still… we wouldn’t want him to leave here entirely unchastened so—through the night and the rain he glimpsed the white of Jaime’s smile—kill his men

No Ned Stark screamed clawing for his sword Jaime was already cantering off down the street as he heard Wyl shout Men closed from both sides Ned rode one down cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him Jory Cassel put his heels into his mount and charged A steel-shod hoof caught a Lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening crunch A second man reeled away and for an instant Jory was free Wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse swords slashing in the rain Ned galloped to him bringing his longsword down on Tregar’s helm The jolt of impact made him grit his teeth Tregar stumbled to his knees his lion crest sheared in half blood running down his face Heward was hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the belly Suddenly Jory was back among them a red rain flying from his sword No Ned shouted Jory away Ned’s horse slipped under him and came crashing down in the mud There was a moment of blinding pain and the taste of blood in his mouth

He saw them cut the legs from Jory’s mount and drag him to the earth swords rising and failing as they closed in around him When Ned’s horse lurched back to its feet he tried to rise only to fall again choking on his scream He could see the splintered bone poking through his calf It was the last thing he saw for a time The rain came down and down and down

When he opened his eyes again Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead His horse moved closer caught the rank scent of blood and galloped away Ned began to drag himself through the mud gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg It seemed to take years Faces watched from candlelit windows and people began to emerge from alleys and doors but no one moved to help

Littlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street cradling Jory Cassel’s body in his arms

Somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter but the trip back to the castle was a blur of agony and Ned lost consciousness more than once He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn The rain had darkened the pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of blood

Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him holding a cup whispering Drink my lord Here The milk of the poppy for your pain He remembered swallowing and Pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk and that was the last he knew





DAENERYS

The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions rearing their hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch

Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls… and no buildings that she could see Yet there it stood immense and beautiful the great horses framing the distant purple mountain beyond The bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down the godsway his bloodriders beside him

Dany followed on her silver escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys mounted once more After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar the Sorefoot King Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day and Viserys had accepted In his stubborn ignorance he had not even known he was being mocked the carts were for eunuchs cripples women giving birth the very young and the very old That won him yet another name Khal Rhaggat the Cart King Her brother had thought it was the khal’s way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell him the truth lest he be shamed The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame… yet he had done as she bid It had taken much pleading and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column

Where is the city she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch There were no buildings to be seen no people only the grass and the road lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the centuries

Ahead Ser Jorah answered Under the mountain

Beyond the horse gate plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past their feet Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones their faces chipped and stained even their names lost in the mists of time Lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths draped only in flowers or poured air from shattered jars Monsters stood in the grass beside the road black iron dragons with jewels for eyes roaring griffins manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike and other beasts she could not name Some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them Those Ser Jorah said had likely come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai

So many she said as her silver stepped slowly onward and from so many lands

Viserys was less impressed The trash of dead cities he sneered He was careful to speak in the Common Tongue which few Dothraki could understand yet even so Dany found herself glancing back at the men of her khas to make certain he had not been overheard He went on blithely All these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built… and kill He laughed They do know how to kill Otherwise I’d have no use for them at all

They are my people now Dany said You should not call them savages brother

The dragon speaks as he likes Viserys said… in the Common Tongue He glanced over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo riding behind them and favored them with a mocking smile See the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men A moss-eaten stone monolith loomed over the road fifty feet tall Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives me my army I grow tired of waiting

The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen…

The crones yes her brother interrupted and there’s to be some mummer’s show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly you told me What is that to me I’m tired of eating horsemeat and I’m sick of the stink of these savages He sniffed at the wide floppy sleeve of his tunic where it was his custom to keep a sachet It could not have helped much The tunic was filthy All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn out of Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat
