I know my courtesies m’lady Gendry said stubborn as ever Whenever highborn girls came into the shop with their fathers my master told me I was to bend the knee and speak only when they spoke to me and call them m’lady

If you start calling me m’lady even Hot Pie is going to notice And you better keep on pissing the same way too

As m’lady commands

Arya slammed his chest with both hands He tripped over a stone and sat down with a thump What kind of lord’s daughter are you he said laughing

This kind She kicked him in the side but it only made him laugh harder You laugh all you like I’m going to see who’s in the village The sun had already fallen below the trees dusk would be on them in no time at all For once it was Gendry who had to hurry after You smell that she asked

He sniffed the air Rotten fish

You know it’s not

We better be careful I’ll go around west see if there’s some road There must be if you saw a wagon You take the shore If you need help bark like a dog

That’s stupid If I need help I’ll shout help She darted away bare feet silent in the grass When she glanced back over her shoulder he was watching her with that pained look on his face that meant he was thinking He’s probably thinking that he shouldn’t be letting m’lady go stealing food Arya just knew he was going to be stupid now

The smell grew stronger as she got closer to the village It did not smell like rotten fish to her This stench was ranker fouler She wrinkled her nose

Where the trees began to thin she used the undergrowth slipping from bush to bush quiet as a shadow Every few yards she stopped to listen The third time she heard horses and a man’s voice as well And the smell got worse Dead man’s stink that’s what it is She had smelled it before with Yoren and the others

A dense thicket of brambles grew south of the village By the time she reached it the long shadows of sunset had begun to fade and the lantern bugs were coming out She could see thatched roofs just beyond the hedge She crept along until she found a gap and squirmed through on her belly keeping well hidden until she saw what made the smell

Beside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up and things that had once been men dangled there their feet in chains while crows pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse For every crow there were a hundred flies When the wind blew off the lake the nearest corpse twisted on its chain ever so slightly The crows had eaten most of its face and something else had been at it as well something much larger Throat and chest had been torn apart and glistening green entrails and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened one arm had been ripped right off the shoulder Arya saw the bones a few feet away gnawed and cracked picked clean of meat

She made herself look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond him telling herself she was hard as a stone Corpses all so savaged and decayed that it took her a moment to realize they had been stripped before they were hanged They did not look like naked people they hardly looked like people at all The crows had eaten their eyes and sometimes their faces Of the sixth in the long row nothing remained but a single leg still tangled in its chains swaying with each breeze

Fear cuts deeper than swords Dead men could not hurt her but whoever had killed them could Well beyond the gibbet two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in front of the long low building by the water the one with the slate roof A pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of it banners drooping from each staff One looked red and one paler white or yellow maybe but both were limp and with the dusk settling she could not even be certain that red one was Lannister crimson I don’t need to see the lion I can see all the dead people who else would it be but Lannisters

Then there was a shout

The two spearmen turned at the cry and a third man came into view shoving a captive before him It was growing too dark to make out faces but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm and when Arya saw the horns she knew it was Gendry You stupid stupid stupid STUPID she thought If he’d been here she would have kicked him again

The guards were talking loudly but she was too far away to make out the words especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand One of the spearmen snatched the helm off Gendry’s head and asked him a question but he must not have liked the answer because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down The one who’d captured him gave him a kick while the second spearman was trying on the bull’s-head helm Finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the storehouse When they opened the heavy wooden doors a small boy darted out but one of the guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside Arya heard sobbing from inside the building and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip

The guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them Just then a breath of wind came sighing off the lake and the banners stirred and lifted The one on the tall staff bore the golden lion as she’d feared On the other three sleek black shapes ran across a field as yellow as butter Dogs she thought Arya had seen those dogs before but where

It didn’t matter The only thing that mattered was that they had Gendry Even if he was stubborn and stupid she had to get him out She wondered if they knew that the queen wanted him

One of the guards took off his helm and donned Gendry’s instead It made her angry to see him wearing it but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him She thought she heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse muffled by the masonry but it was hard to be certain

She stayed long enough to see the guard changed and much more besides Men came and went They led their horses down to the stream to drink A hunting party returned from the wood carrying a deer’s carcass slung from a pole She watched them clean and gut it and build a cookfire on the far side of the stream and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly with the stench of corruption Her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch The prospect of food brought other men out of the houses near all of them wearing bits of mail or boiled leather When the deer was cooked the choicest portions were carried to one of the houses

She thought that the dark might let her crawl close and free Gendry but the guards kindled torches off the cookfire A squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the storehouse and later two more men joined them and they all passed a skin of wine from hand to hand When it was empty the others left but the two guards remained leaning on their spears

Arya’s arms and legs were stiff when she finally wriggled out from under the briar into the dark of the wood It was a black night with a thin sliver of moon appearing and disappearing as the clouds blew past Silent as a shadow she told herself as she moved through the trees In this darkness she dared not run for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing her way On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against its shores on her right a wind sighed through the branches and leaves rustled and stirred Far off she heard the howling of wolves

Lommy and Hot Pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind them Quiet she told them putting an arm around Weasel when the little girl came running up

Hot Pie stared at her with big eyes We thought you left us He had his shortsword in hand the one Yoren had taken off the gold cloak I was scared you was a wolf

Where’s the Bull asked Lommy

They caught him Arya whispered We have to get him out Hot Pie you got to help We’ll sneak up and kill the guards and then I’ll open the door

Hot Pie and Lommy exchanged a look How many

I couldn’t count Arya admitted Twenty at least but only two on the door

Hot Pie looked as if he were going to cry We can’t fight twenty

You only need to fight one I’ll do the other and we’ll get Gendry out and run

We should yield Lommy said Just go in and yield

Arya shook her head stubbornly

Then just leave him Arry Lommy pleaded They don’t know about the rest of us If we hide they’ll go away you know they will It’s not our fault Gendry’s captured

You’re stupid Lommy Arya said angrily You’ll die if we don’t get Gendry out Who’s going to carry you

You and Hot Pie

All the time with no one else to help We’ll never do it Gendry was the strong one Anyhow I don’t care what you say I’m going back for him She looked at Hot Pie Are you coming

Hot Pie glanced at Lommy at Arya at Lommy again I’ll come he said reluctantly

Lommy you keep Weasel here

He grabbed the little girl by the hand and pulled her close What if the wolves come

Yield Arya suggested

Finding their way back to the village seemed to take hours Hot Pie kept stumbling in the dark and losing his way and Arya had to wait for him and double back Finally she took him by the hand and led him along through the trees Just be quiet and follow When they could make out the first faint glow of the village fires against the sky she said There’s dead men hanging on the other side of the hedge but they’re nothing to be scared of just remember fear cuts deeper than swords We have to go real quiet and slow Hot Pie nodded

She wriggled under the briar first and waited for him on the far side crouched low Hot Pie emerged pale and panting face and arms bloody with long scratches He started to say something but Arya put a finger to his lips On hands and knees they crawled along the gibbet beneath the swaying dead Hot Pie never once looked up nor made a sound

Until the crow landed on his back and he gave a muffled gasp Who’s there a voice boomed suddenly from the dark

Hot Pie leapt to his feet I yield He threw away his sword as dozens of crows rose shrieking and complaining to flap about the corpses Arya grabbed his leg and tried to drag him back down but he wrenched loose and ran forward waving his arms I yield I yield

She bounced up and drew Needle but by then men were all around her Arya slashed at the nearest but he blocked her with a steel-clad arm and someone else slammed into her and dragged her to the ground and a third man wrenched the sword from her grasp When she tried to bite her teeth snapped shut on cold dirty chainmail Oho a fierce one the man said laughing The blow from his iron-clad fist near knocked her head off

They talked over her as she lay hurting but Arya could not seem to understand the words Her ears rang When she tried to crawl off the earth moved beneath her They took Needle The shame of that hurt worse than the pain and the pain hurt a lot Jon had given her that sword Syrio had taught her to use it

Finally someone grabbed the front of her jerkin yanked her to her knees Hot Pie was kneeling too before the tallest man Arya had ever seen a monster from one of Old Nan’s stories She never saw where the giant had come from Three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone Suddenly Arya knew where she had seen those dogs before The night of the tourney at King’s Landing all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions That one belongs to the Hound’s brother Sansa had confided when they passed the black dogs on the yellow field He’s even bigger than Hodor you’ll see They call him the Mountain That Rides

Arya let her head droop only half aware of what was going on around her Hot Pie was yielding some more The Mountain said You’ll lead us to these others and walked off Next she was stumbling past the dead men on their gibbet while Hot Pie told their captors he’d bake them pies and tarts if they didn’t hurt him Four men went with them One carried a torch one a longsword two had spears
