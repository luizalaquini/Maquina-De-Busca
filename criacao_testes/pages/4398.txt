one to repeat the last utterance in case of misrecognition
and the other to summarize the current state of the interaction
in case of distraction
For the former it is essential to avoid simply regenerating an utterance
identical with the last
Some variation of intonation and rhythm is needed to prevent an annoying
stereotyped response
A second consecutive repeat request should trigger a paraphrased reply
An error recovery sequence could be used which presented the misunderstood
information in a different way with more interaction but experience
indicates that this is of minor importance especially if information units
are kept small anyway
To summarize the current state of the interaction in response to the second
type of repeat command necessitates the system maintaining a model of
the user
Even a poor model like a record of his last few transactions and their
results is well worth having
rh Varied speech
Synthetic speech is usually rather dreary to listen to
Successive utterances with identical intonations should be carefully avoided
Small changes in speaking rate pitch range and mean pitch level
all serve to add variety
Unfortunately little is known at present about the role of intonation in
interactive dialogue although this is an active research area and
new developments can be expected for a detailed report of a recent
research project relevant to this topic see Brown

However even random variations in certain parameters of the pitch contour
are useful to relieve the tedium of repetitive intonation patterns
sh 102  The applications programming environment
pp
The comments in the last section are aimed at the applications programmer
who is designing the dialogue and constructing the interactive system
But what kind of environment should
ul
he
be given to assist with this work
pp
The best help the applications programmer can have is a speech generation
method which makes it easy for him to enter new utterances and modify
them on-line in cut-and-try attempts to render the man-machine dialogue
as natural as possible
This is perhaps the most important advantage of synthesizing speech by rule
from a textual representation
If encoded versions of natural utterances are stored it becomes quite
difficult to make minor modifications to the dialogue in the light of
experience with it for a recording session must be set up
to acquire new utterances
This is especially true if more than one voice is used or if the
voice belongs to a person who cannot be recalled quickly by the programmer
to augment the utterance library
Even if it is his own voice there will still be delays for recording
speech is a real-time job which usually needs a stand-alone processor
and if data compression is used a substantial amount of computation will
be needed before the utterance is in a useable form
pp
The broad phonetic input required by segmental speech synthesis-by-rule
systems is quite suitable for utterance representation
Utterances can be entered quickly from a standard computer terminal
and edited as text files
Programmers must acquire skill in phonetic transcription
but this is a small inconvenience
The art is easily learned in an interactive situation where the effect
of modifications to the transcription can be heard immediately
If allophones must be represented explicitly in the input then the
programmers task becomes considerably more complicated because of the
combinatorial explosion in trial-and-error modifications
pp
Plain text input is also quite suitable
A significant rate of error is tolerable if immediate audio feedback
of the result is available so that the operator can adjust his text
to suit the pronunciation idiosyncrasies of the program
But it is acceptable and indeed preferable if prosodic features are
represented explicitly in the input rather than being assigned automatically
by a computer program
pp
The application of voice response to interactive computer dialogue is
quite different to the problem of reading aloud from text
We have seen that a major concern with reading machines is how to glean
information about intonation rhythm emphasis tone of voice and so on
from an input of ordinary English text
The significant problems of semantic processing utilization of pragmatic
knowledge and syntactic analysis do not fortunately arise in interactive
information retrieval systems
In these the end user is communicating with a program which has been
created by a person who knows what he wants it to say
Thus the major difficulty is in
ul
describing
the prosodic features rather than
ul
deriving
them from text

Speech synthesis by rule is a subsidiary process to the main interactive
