That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar riding to the Trident But she was mounted on a dragon not a horse When she saw the Usurper’s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming but another part exulted This is how it was meant to be The other was a nightmare and I have only now awakened

She woke suddenly in the darkness of her cabin still flush with triumph Balerion seemed to wake with her and she heard the faint creak of wood water lapping against the hull a footfall on the deck above her head And something else

Someone was in the cabin with her

Irri Jhiqui Where are you Her handmaids did not respond It was too black to see but she could hear them breathing Jorah is that you

They sleep a woman said They all sleep The voice was very close Even dragons must sleep

She is standing over me Who’s there Dany peered into the darkness She thought she could see a shadow the faintest outline of a shape What do you want of me

Remember To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Quaithe Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily Khaleesi murmured Jhiqui rubbing her eyes Viserion woke and opened his jaws and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask Khaleesi are you unwell asked Jhiqui

A dream Dany shook her head I dreamed a dream no more Go back to sleep All of us go back to sleep Yet try as she might sleep would not come again

If I look back I am lost Dany told herself the next morning as she entered Astapor through the harbor gates She dared not remind herself how small and insignificant her following truly was or she would lose all courage Today she rode her silver clad in horsehair pants and painted leather vest a bronze medallion belt about her waist and two more crossed between her breasts Irri and Jhiqui had braided her hair and hung it with a tiny silver bell whose chime sang of the Undying of Qarth burned in their Palace of Dust

The red brick streets of Astapor were almost crowded this morning Slaves and servants lined the ways while the slavers and their women donned their tokars to look down from their stepped pyramids They are not so different from Qartheen after all she thought They want a glimpse of dragons to tell their children of and their children’s children It made her wonder how many of them would ever have children

Aggo went before her with his great Dothraki bow Strong Belwas walked to the right of her mare the girl Missandei to her left Ser Jorah Mormont was behind in mail and surcoat glowering at anyone who came too near Rakharo and Jhogo protected the litter Dany had commanded that the top be removed so her three dragons might be chained to the platform Irri and Jhiqui rode with them to try and keep them calm Yet Viserion’s tail lashed back and forth and smoke rose angry from his nostrils Rhaegal could sense something wrong as well Thrice he tried to take wing only to be pulled down by the heavy chain in Jhiqui’s hand Drogon coiled into a ball wings and tail tucked tight Only his eyes remained to tell that he was not asleep

The rest of her people followed Groleo and the other captains and their crews and the eighty-three Dothraki who remained to her of the hundred thousand who had once ridden in Drogo’s khalasar She put the oldest and weakest on the inside of the column with the nursing women and those with child and the little girls and the boys too young to braid their hair The rest—her warriors such as they were—rode outside and moved their dismal herd along the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived both red waste and black salt sea

I ought to have a banner sewn she thought as she led her tattered band up along Astapor’s meandering river She closed her eyes to imagine how it would look all flowing black silk and on it the red three-headed dragon of Targaryen breathing golden flames A banner such as Rhaegar might have borne The river’s banks were strangely tranquil The Worm the Astapori called the stream It was wide and slow and crooked dotted with tiny wooded islands She glimpsed children playing on one of them darting amongst elegant marble statues On another island two lovers kissed in the shade of tall green trees with no more shame than Dothraki at a wedding Without clothing she could not tell if they were slave or free

The Plaza of Pride with its great bronze harpy was too small to hold all the Unsullied she had bought Instead they had been assembled in the Plaza of Punishment fronting on Astapor’s main gate so they might be marched directly from the city once Daenerys had taken them in hand There were no bronze statues here only a wooden platform where rebellious slaves were racked and flayed and hanged The Good Masters place them so they will be the first thing a new slave sees upon entering the city Missandei told her as they came to the plaza

At first glimpse Dany thought their skin was striped like the zorses of the Jogos Nhai Then she rode her silver nearer and saw the raw red flesh beneath the crawling black stripes Flies Flies and maggots The rebellious slaves had been peeled like a man might peel an apple in a long curling strip One man had an arm black with flies from fingers to elbow and red and white beneath Dany reined in beneath him What did this one do

He raised a hand against his owner

Her stomach roiling Dany wheeled her silver about and trotted toward the center of the plaza and the army she had bought so dear Rank on rank on rank they stood her stone halfmen with their hearts of brick eight thousand and six hundred in the spiked bronze caps of fully trained Unsullied and five thousand odd behind them bareheaded yet armed with spears and shortswords The ones farthest to the back were only boys she saw but they stood as straight and still as all the rest

Kraznys mo Nakloz and his fellows were all there to greet her Other well-born Astapori stood in knots behind them sipping wine from silver flutes as slaves circulated among them with trays of olives and cherries and figs The elder Grazdan sat in a sedan chair supported by four huge copper-skinned slaves Half a dozen mounted lancers rode along the edges of the plaza keeping back the crowds who had come to watch The sun flashed blinding bright off the polished copper disks sewn to their cloaks but she could not help but notice how nervous their horses seemed They fear the dragons And well they might

Kraznys had a slave help her from her saddle His own hands were full one clutched his tokar while the other held an omate whip Here they are He looked at Missandei Tell her they are hers… if she can pay

She can the girl said

Ser Jorah barked a command and the trade goods were brought forward Six bales of tiger skins three hundred bolts of fine silk Jars of saffron jars of myrrh jars of pepper and curry and cardamom an onyx mask twelve jade monkeys casks of ink in red and black and green a box of rare black amethysts a box of pearls a cask of pitted olives stuffed with maggots a dozen casks of pickled cave fish a great brass gong and a hammer to beat it with seventeen ivory eyes and a huge chest full of books written in tongues that Dany could not read And more and more and more Her people stacked it all before the slavers

While the payment was being made Kraznys mo Nakloz favored her with a few final words on the handling of her troops They are green as yet he said through Missandei Tell the whore of Westeros she would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking Whatever plunder she takes will be hers alone Unsullied have no lust for gold or gems And should she take captives a few guards will suffice to march them back to Astapor We’ll buy the healthy ones and for a good price And who knows In ten years some of the boys she sends us may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper

Finally there were no more trade goods to add to the pile Her Dothraki mounted their horses once more and Dany said This was all we could carry The rest awaits you on the ships a great quantity of amber and wine and black rice And you have the ships themselves So all that remains is…

…the dragon finished the Grazdan with the spiked beard who spoke the Common Tongue so thickly

And here he waits Ser Jorah and Belwas walked beside her to the litter where Drogon and his brothers lay basking in the sun Jhiqui unfastened one end of the chain and handed it down to her When she gave a yank the black dragon raised his head hissing and unfolded wings of night and scarlet Kraznys mo Nakloz smiled broadly as their shadow fell across him

Dany handed the slaver the end of Drogon’s chain In return he presented her with the whip The handle was black dragonbone elaborately carved and inlaid with gold Nine long thin leather lashes trailed from it each one tipped by a gilded claw The gold pommel was a woman’s head with pointed ivory teeth The harpy’s fingers Kraznys named the scourge

Dany turned the whip in her hand Such a light thing to bear such weight Is it done then Do they belong to me

It is done he agreed giving the chain a sharp pull to bring Drogon down from the litter

Dany mounted her silver She could feel her heart thumping in her chest She felt desperately afraid Was this what my brother would have done She wondered if Prince Rhaegar had been this anxious when he saw the Usurper’s host formed up across the Trident with all their banners floating on the wind

She stood in her stirrups and raised the harpy’s fingers above her head for all the Unsullied to see IT IS DONE she cried at the top of her lungs YOU ARE MINE She gave the mare her heels and galloped along the first rank holding the fingers high YOU ARE THE DRAGON’S NOW YOU’RE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR IT IS DONE IT IS DONE

She glimpsed old Grazdan turn his grey head sharply He hears me speak Valyrian The other slavers were not listening They crowded around Kraznys and the dragon shouting advice Though the Astapori yanked and tugged Drogon would not budge off the litter Smoke rose grey from his open jaws and his long neck curled and straightened as he snapped at the slaver’s face

It is time to cross the Trident Dany thought as she wheeled and rode her silver back Her bloodriders moved in close around her You are in difficulty she observed

He will not come Kraznys said

There is a reason A dragon is no slave And Dany swept the lash down as hard as she could across the slaver’s face Kraznys screamed and staggered back the blood running red down his cheeks into his perfumed beard The harpy’s fingers had torn his features half to pieces with one slash but she did not pause to contemplate the ruin Drogon she sang out loudly sweetly all her fear forgotten Dracarys

The black dragon spread his wings and roared

A lance of swirling dark flame took Kraznys full in the face His eyes melted and ran down his cheeks and the oil in his hair and beard burst so fiercely into fire that for an instant the slaver wore a burning crown twice as tall as his head The sudden stench of charred meat overwhelmed even his perfume and his wail seemed to drown all other sound

Then the Plaza of Punishment blew apart into blood and chaos The Good Masters were shrieking stumbling shoving one another aside and tripping over the fringes of their tokars in their haste Drogon flew almost lazily at Kraznys black wings beating As he gave the slaver another taste of fire Irri and Jhiqui unchained Viserion and Rhaegal and suddenly there were three dragons in the air When Dany turned to look a third of Astapor’s proud demon-horned warriors were fighting to stay atop their terrified mounts and another third were fleeing in a bright blaze of shiny copper One man kept his saddle long enough to draw a sword but Jhogo’s whip coiled about his neck and cut off his shout Another lost a hand to Rakharo’s arakh and rode off reeling and spurting blood Aggo sat calmly notching arrows to his bowstring and sending them at tokars Silver gold or plain he cared nothing for the fringe Strong Belwas had his arakh out as well and he spun it as he charged

Spears Dany heard one Astapori shout It was Grazdan old Grazdan in his tokar heavy with pearls Unsullied Defend us stop them defend your masters Spears Swords

When Rakharo put an arrow through his mouth the slaves holding his sedan chair broke and ran dumping him unceremoniously on the ground The old man crawled to the first rank of eunuchs his blood pooling on the bricks The Unsullied did not so much as look down to watch him die Rank on rank on rank they stood

And did not move The gods have heard my prayer

Unsullied Dany galloped before them her silver-gold braid flying behind her her bell chiming with every stride Slay the Good Masters slay the soldiers slay every man who wears a tokar or holds a whip but harm no child under twelve and strike the chains off every slave you see She raised the harpy’s fingers in the air… and then she flung the scourge aside Freedom she sang out Dracarys Dracarys

Dracarys they shouted back the sweetest word she’d ever heard Dracarys Dracarys And all around them slavers ran and sobbed and begged and died and the dusty air was filled with spears and fire





Sansa


On the morning her new gown was to be ready the serving girls filled Sansa’s tub with steaming hot water and scrubbed her head to toe until she glowed pink Cersei’s own bedmaid trimmed her nails and brushed and curled her auburn hair so it fell down her back in soft ringlets She brought a dozen of the queen’s favorite scents as well Sansa chose a sharp sweet fragrance with a hint of lemon in it under the smell of flowers The maid dabbed some on her finger and touched Sansa behind each ear and under her chin and then lightly on her nipples

Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress and watched as they dressed Sansa in her new clothes The smallclothes were all silk but the gown itself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver and lined with silvery satin The points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she lowered her arms And it was a woman’s gown not a little girl’s there was no doubt of that The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly the deep vee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey The skirts were long and full the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as they laced her into it They brought her new shoes as well slippers of soft grey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers You are very beautiful my lady the seamstress said when she was dressed

I am aren’t I Sansa giggled and spun her skirts swirling around her Oh I am She could not wait for Willas to see her like this He will love me he will he must… he will forget Winterfell when he sees me I’ll see that he does
