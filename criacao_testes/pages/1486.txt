Back in the riverlands they found that the rains had ebbed away and the flood waters had begun to recede The Hound turned south back toward the Trident We’ll make for Riverrun he told Arya as they roasted a hare he’d killed Maybe the Blackfish wants to buy himself a she-wolf

He doesn’t know me He won’t even know I’m really me Arya was tired of making for Riverrun She had been making for Riverrun for years it seemed without ever getting there Every time she made for Riverrun she ended up someplace worse He won’t give you any ransom He’ll probably just hang you

He’s free to try He turned the spit

He doesn’t talk like he’s lost his belly for fighting I know where we could go Arya said She still had one brother left Jon will want me even if no one else does He’ll call me little sister and muss my hair It was a long way though and she didn’t think she could get there by herself She hadn’t even been able to reach Riverrun We could go to the Wall

Sandor’s laugh was half a growl The little wolf bitch wants to join the Night’s Watch does she

My brother’s on the Wall she said stubbornly

His mouth gave a twitch The Wall’s a thousand leagues from here We’d need to fight through the bloody Freys just to reach the Neck There’s lizard lions in those swamps that eat wolves every day for breakfast And if we did reach the north with our skins intact there’s ironborn in half the castles and thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well

Are you scared of them she asked Have you lost your belly for fighting

For a moment she thought he was going to hit her By then the hare was brown though skin crackling and grease popping as it dripped down into the cookfire Sandor took it off the stick ripped it apart with his big hands and tossed half of it into Arya’s lap There’s nothing wrong with my belly he said as he pulled off a leg but I don’t give a rat’s arse for you or your brother I have a brother too





Tyrion


Tyrion Ser Kevan Lannister said wearily if you are indeed innocent of Joffrey’s death you should have no difficulty proving it at trial

Tyrion turned from the window Who is to judge me

Justice belongs to the throne The king is dead but your father remains Hand Since it is his own son who stands accused and his grandson who was the victim he has asked Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn to sit in judgment with him

Tyrion was scarcely reassured Mace Tyrell had been Joffrey’s goodfather however briefly and the Red Viper was… well a snake Will I be allowed to demand trial by battle

I would not advise that

Why not It had saved him in the Vale why not here Answer me Uncle Will I be allowed a trial by battle and a champion to prove my innocence

Certainly if such is your wish However you had best know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor Clegane as her champion in the event of such a trial

The bitch checks my moves before I make them A pity she didn’t choose a Kettleblack Bronn would make short work of any of the three brothers but the Mountain That Rides was a kettle of a different color I shall need to sleep on this I need to speak with Bronn and soon He didn’t want to think about what this was like to cost him Bronn had a lofty notion of what his skin was worth Does Cersei have witnesses against me

More every day

Then I must have witnesses of my own

Tell me who you would have and Ser Addam will send the Watch to bring them to the trial

I would sooner find them myself

You stand accused of regicide and kinslaying Do you truly imagine you will be allowed to come and go as you please Ser Kevan waved at the table You have quill ink and parchment Write the names of such witnesses as you require and I shall do all in my power to produce them you have my word as a Lannister But you shall not leave this tower except to go to trial

Tyrion would not demean himself by begging Will you permit my squire to come and go The boy Podrick Payne

Certainly if that is your wish I shall send him to you

Do so Sooner would be better than later and now would be better than sooner He waddled to the writing table But when he heard the door open he turned back and said Uncle

Ser Kevan paused Yes

I did not do this

I wish I could believe that Tyrion

When the door closed Tyrion Lannister pulled himself up into the chair sharpened a quill and pulled a blank parchment Who will speak for me He dipped his quill in the inkpot

The sheet was still maiden when Podrick Payne appeared sometime later My lord the boy said

Tyrion put down the quill Find Bronn and bring him at once Tell him there’s gold in it more gold than he’s ever dreamt of and see that you don’t return without him

Yes my lord I mean no I won’t Return He went

He had not returned by sunset nor by moonrise Tyrion fell asleep in the window seat to wake stiff and sore at dawn A serving man brought porridge and apples to break his fast with a horn of ale He ate at the table the blank parchment before him An hour later the serving man returned for the bowl Have you seen my squire Tyrion asked him The man shook his head

Sighing he turned back to the table and dipped the quill again Sansa he wrote upon the parchment He sat staring at the name his teeth clenched so hard they hurt

Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of food which even Tyrion found hard to swallow Sansa must have poisoned him Joff practically put his cup down in her lap and he’d given her ample reason Any doubts Tyrion might have had vanished when his wife did One flesh one heart one soul His mouth twisted She wasted no time proving how much those vows meant to her did she Well what did you expect dwarf

And yet… where would Sansa have gotten poison He could not believe the girl had acted alone in this Do I really want to find her Would the judges believe that Tyrion’s child bride had poisoned a king without her husband’s knowledge I wouldn’t Cersei would insist that they had done the deed together

Even so he gave the parchment to his uncle the next day Ser Kevan frowned at it Lady Sansa is your only witness

I will think of others in time

Best think of them now The judges mean to begin the trial three days hence

That’s too soon You have me shut up here under guard how am I to find witnesses to my innocence

Your sister’s had no difficulty finding witnesses to your guilt Ser Kevan rolled up the parchment Ser Addam has men hunting for your wife Varys has offered a hundred stags for word of her whereabouts and a hundred dragons for the girl herself If the girl can be found she will be found and I shall bring her to you I see no harm in husband and wife sharing the same cell and giving comfort to one another

You are too kind Have you seen my squire

I sent him to you yesterday Did he not come

He came Tyrion admitted and then he went

I shall send him to you again

But it was the next morning before Podrick Payne returned He stepped inside the room hesitantly with fear written all over his face Bronn came in behind him The sellsword knight wore a jerkin studded with silver and a heavy riding cloak with a pair of fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through his swordbelt

One look at Bronn’s face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach It took you long enough
