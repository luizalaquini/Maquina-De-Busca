Oak
Whos tother man then said Mrs Tall
Only a friend said Coggan
Say hes wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch
to-morrow morning at ten said Oak in a whisper
That he must come without fail and wear his best
clothes
P 462
The clothes will floor us as safe as houses said
Coggan
It cant be helped said Oak Tell her
So Coggan delivered the message Mind het or
wet blow or snow he must come added Jan Tis
very particular indeed The fact is tis to witness her
sign some law-work about taking shares wi another
farmer for a long span o years There thats what tis
and now Ive told ee Mother Tall in a way I shouldnt
ha done if I hadnt loved ee so hopeless well
Coggan retired before she could ask any further
and next they called at the vicars in a manner which
excited no curiosity at all Then Gabriel went home
and prepared for the morrow
Liddy said Bathsheba on going to bed that night
I want you to call me at seven oclock to-morrow In
case I shouldnt wake
But you always do wake afore then maam
Yes but I have something important to do which
Ill tell you of when the time comes and its best to
make sure
CONCLUSION
Bathsheba however awoke voluntarily at four nor
could she by any contrivance get to sleep again About
six being quite positive that her watch had stopped
during the night she could wait no longer She went
and tapped at Liddys door and after some labour awoke
her
But I thought it was I who had to call you said
the bewildered Liddy And it isnt six yet
Indeed it is how can you tell such a story Liddy
I know it must be ever so much past seven Come to
my room as soon as you can I want you to give my
hair a good brushing
When Liddy came to Bathshebas room her mistress
was already waiting Liddy could not understand
this extraordinary promptness  Whatever 1is1 going on
maam she said
Well Ill tell you said Bathsheba with a mischiev+
ous smile in her bright eyes Farmer Oak is coming
here to dine with me to-day
Farmer Oak -- and nobody else  -- you two alone
Yes
P 463
But is it safe maam after whats been said asked
her companion dubiously A womans good name is
such a perishable article that --  -- 
Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek and
whispered in Liddys ear although there was nobody
present Then Liddy stared and exclaimcd  Souls
alive what news It makes my heart go quite
bumpity-bump
It makes mine rather furious too said Bathsheba
However theres no getting out of it now
It was a damp disagreeable morning Nevertheless
at twenty minutes to ten oclock Oak came out of his
house and
Went up the hill side
With that sort of stride
A man puts out when walking in search of a bride
and knocked Bathshebas door Ten minutes later
a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen
moving from the same door and through the mist along
the road to the church The distance was not more
than a quarter of a mile and these two sensible persons
deemed it unnecessary to drive An observer must have
been very close indeed to discover that the forms under
the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba arm-in+
arm for the first time in their lives Oak in a greatcoat
extending to his knees and Bathsheba in a cloak that
reached her clogs Yet though so plainly dressed
there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her  --
  As though a rose should shut and be a bud again
Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks and having
at Gabriels request arranged her hair this morning as
she had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill she seemed
in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating
dream which considering that she was now only three
or four-and-twenty was perhaps not very wonderful In
the church were Tall Liddy and the parson and in a
remarkably short space of time the deed was done
The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathshebas
parlour in the evening of the same day for it had been
arranged that 
P 464
Farmer Oak should go there to live since
he had as yet neither money house nor furniture worthy
of the name though he was on a sure way towards them
whilst Bathsheba was comparatively in a plethora of all
three
Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea
their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon
