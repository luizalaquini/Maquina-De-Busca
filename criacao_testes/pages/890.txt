You are he who must stand against the Other The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago The red comet was your herald You are the prince that was promised and if you fail the world fails with you Melisandre went to him her red lips parted her ruby throbbing Give me this boy she whispered and I will give you your kingdom

He can’t said Davos Edric Storm is gone

Gone Stannis turned What do you mean gone

He is aboard a Lyseni galley safely out to sea Davos watched Melisandre’s pale heart-shaped face He saw the flicker of dismay there the sudden uncertainty She did not see it

The king’s eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of his face The bastard was taken from Dragonstone without my leave A galley you say If that Lysene pirate thinks to use the boy to squeeze gold from me—

This is your Hand’s work sire Melisandre gave Davos a knowing look You will bring him back my lord You will

The boy is out of my reach said Davos And out of your reach as well my lady

Her red eyes made him squirm I should have left you to the dark ser Do you know what you have done

My duty

Some might call it treason Stannis went to the window to stare out into the night Is he looking for the ship I raised you up from dirt Davos He sounded more tired than angry Was loyalty too much to hope for

Four of my sons died for you on the Blackwater I might have died myself You have my loyalty always Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words he said next he knew his life depended on them Your Grace you made me swear to give you honest counsel and swift obedience to defend your realm against your foes to protect your people Is not Edric Storm one of your people One of those I swore to protect I kept my oath How could that be treason

Stannis ground his teeth again I never asked for this crown Gold is cold and heavy on the head but so long as I am the king I have a duty… If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark… Sacrifice… is never easy Davos Or it is no true sacrifice Tell him my lady

Melisandre said Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart’s blood of his own beloved wife If a man with a thousand cows gives one to god that is nothing But a man who offers the only cow he owns…

She talks of cows Davos told the king I am speaking of a boy your daughter’s friend your brother’s son

A king’s son with the power of kingsblood in his veins Melisandre’s ruby glowed like a red star at her throat Do you think you’ve saved this boy Onion Knight When the long night falls Edric Storm shall die with the rest wherever he is hidden Your own sons as well Darkness and cold will cover the earth You meddle in matters you do not understand

There’s much I don’t understand Davos admitted I have never pretended elsewise I know the seas and rivers the shapes of the coasts where the rocks and shoals lie I know hidden coves where a boat can land unseen And I know that a king protects his people or he is no king at all

Stannis’s face darkened Do you mock me to my face Must I learn a king’s duty from an onion smuggler

Davos knelt If I have offended take my head I’ll die as I lived your loyal man But hear me first Hear me for the sake of the onions I brought you and the fingers you took

Stannis slid Lightbringer from its scabbard Its glow filled the chamber Say what you will but say it quickly The muscles in the king’s neck stood out like cords

Davos fumbled inside his cloak and drew out the crinkled sheet of parchment It seemed a thin and flimsy thing yet it was all the shield he had A King’s Hand should be able to read and write Maester Pylos has been teaching me He smoothed the letter flat upon his knee and began to read by the light of the magic sword





Jon


He dreamt he was back in Winterfell limping past the stone kings on their thrones Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as he passed and their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon their laps You are no Stark he could hear them mutter in heavy granite voices There is no place for you here Go away He walked deeper into the darkness Father he called Bran Rickon No one answered A chill wind was blowing on his neck Uncle he called Uncle Benjen Father Please Father help me Up above he heard drums They are feasting in the Great Hall but I am not welcome there I am no Stark and this is not my place His crutch slipped and he fell to his knees The crypts were growing darker A light has gone out somewhere Ygritte he whispered Forgive me Please But it was only a direwolf grey and ghastly spotted with blood his golden eyes shining sadly through the dark…

The cell was dark the bed hard beneath him His own bed he remembered his own bed in his steward’s cell beneath the Old Bear’s chambers By rights it should have brought him sweeter dreams Even beneath the furs he was cold Ghost had shared his cell before the ranging warming it against the chill of night And in the wild Ygritte had slept beside him Both gone now He had burned Ygritte himself as he knew she would have wanted and Ghost… where are you Was he dead as well was that what his dream had meant the bloody wolf in the crypts But the wolf in the dream had been grey not white Grey like Bran’s wolf Had the Thenns hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown If so Bran was lost to him for good and all

Jon was trying to make sense of that when the horn blew

The Horn of Winter he thought still confused from sleep But Mance never found Joramun’s horn so that couldn’t be A second blast followed as long and deep as the first Jon had to get up and go to the Wall he knew but it was so hard…
