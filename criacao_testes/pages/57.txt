Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see manses and arbors and granaries brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant’s stalls taverns and graveyards and brothels all piled one on another She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees wandering crookback streets and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast Visenya’s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit its huge dome collapsing into ruin its bronze doors closed now for a century The Street of the Sisters ran between them straight as an arrow The city walls rose in the distance high and strong

A hundred quays lined the waterfront and the harbor was crowded with ships Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys Catelyn spied the queen’s ornate barge tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben its hull black with tar while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water

And above it all frowning down from Aegon’s high hill was the Red Keep seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts an immense grim barbican vaulted halls and covered bridges barracks and dungeons and granaries massive curtain walls studded with archers’ nests all fashioned of pale red stone Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason woodworker and builder who had labored on it Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built he vowed

Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden not black and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon

A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port its white sails huge with wind The Storm Dancer moved past it pulling steadily for shore

My lady Ser Rodrik said I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed You must not enter the castle I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place

She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities You would be as much at risk as I would

Ser Rodrik smiled I think not I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers and she is forty years dead I believe I am safe enough my lady

Moreo bellowed a command As one sixty oars lifted from the river then reversed and backed water The galley slowed Another shout The oars slid back inside the hull As they thumped against the dock Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up Moreo came bustling up all smiles King’s Landing my lady as you did command and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle

We shall not be going to the castle Perhaps you can suggest an inn someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river

The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard Just so I know of several establishments that might suit your needs Yet first if I may be so bold there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise Sixty stags I believe it was

For the oarmen Catelyn reminded him

Oh of a certainty said Moreo Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh For the sake of their wives and children If you give them the silver here my lady they will dice it away or spend it all for a night’s pleasure

There are worse things to spend money on Ser Rodrik put in Winter is coming

A man must make his own choices Catelyn said They earned the silver How they spend it is no concern of mine

As you say my lady Moreo replied bowing and smiling

Just to be sure Catelyn paid the oarmen herself a stag to each man and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya’s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real Her rooms were large and airy though and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms Best of all she had no interest in their names

I think it best if you stay away from the common room Ser Rodrik said after they had settled in Even in a place like this one never knows who may be watching He wore ringmail dagger and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head I will be back before nightfall with Ser Aron he promised Rest now my lady

Catelyn was tired The voyage had been long and fatiguing and she was no longer as young as she had been Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops with a view of the Blackwater beyond She watched Ser Rodrik set off striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds then decided to take his advice The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers but she had no trouble falling asleep

She woke to a pounding on her door

Catelyn sat up sharply Outside the window the rooftops of King’s Landing were red in the light of the setting sun She had slept longer than she intended A fist hammered at her door again and a voice called out Open in the name of the king

A moment she called out She wrapped herself in her cloak The dagger was on the bedside table She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door

The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said No need for that m’lady We’re to escort you to the castle

By whose authority she said

He showed her a ribbon Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat The seal was a mockingbird in grey wax Petyr she said So soon Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik She looked at the head guardsman Do you know who I am

No m’lady he said M’lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him and see that you were not mistreated

Catelyn nodded You may wait outside while I dress
