King Joffrey and his queen met the pie below the dais As Joff drew his sword Margaery laid a hand on his arm to restrain him Widow’s Wail was not meant for slicing pies

True Joffrey lifted his voice Ser Ilyn your sword

From the shadows at the back of the hall Ser Ilyn Payne appeared The specter at the feast thought Tyrion as he watched the King’s Justice stride forward gaunt and grim He had been too young to have known Ser Ilyn before he’d lost his tongue He would have been a different man in those days but now the silence is as much a part of him as those hollow eyes that rusty chainmail shirt and the greatsword on his back

Ser Ilyn bowed before the king and queen reached back over his shoulder and drew forth six feet of ornate silver bright with runes He knelt to offer the huge blade to Joffrey hilt first points of red fire winked from ruby eyes on the pommel a chunk of dragonglass carved in the shape of a grinning skull

Sansa stirred in her seat What sword is that

Tyrion’s eyes still stung from the wine He blinked and looked again Ser Ilyn’s greatsword was as long and wide as Ice but it was too silvery-bright Valyrian steel had a darkness to it a smokiness in its soul Sansa clutched his arm What has Ser Ilyn done with my father’s sword

I should have sent Ice back to Robb Stark Tyrion thought He glanced at his father but Lord Tywin was watching the king

Joffrey and Margaery joined hands to lift the greatsword and swung it down together in a silvery arc When the piecrust broke the doves burst forth in a swirl of white feathers scattering in every direction flapping for the windows and the rafters A roar of delight went up from the benches and the fiddlers and pipers in the gallery began to play a sprightly tune Joff took his bride in his arms and whirled her around merrily

A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream The pigeons were well and truly cooked in this pie but he found them no more appetizing than the white ones fluttering about the hall Sansa was not eating either You’re deathly pale my lady Tyrion said You need a breath of cool air and I need a fresh doublet He stood and offered her his hand Come

But before they could make their retreat Joffrey was back Uncle where are you going You’re my cupbearer remember

I need to change into fresh garb Your Grace May I have your leave

No I like the look of you this way Serve me my wine

The king’s chalice was on the table where he’d left it Tyrion had to climb back onto his chair to reach it Joff yanked it from his hands and drank long and deep his throat working as the wine ran purple down his chin My lord Margaery said we should return to our places Lord Buckler wants to toast us

My uncle hasn’t eaten his pigeon pie Holding the chalice one-handed Joff jammed his other into Tyrion’s pie It’s ill luck not to eat the pie he scolded as he filled his mouth with hot spiced pigeon See it’s good Spitting out flakes of crust he coughed and helped himself to another fistful Dry though Needs washing down Joff took a swallow of wine and coughed again more violently I want to see kof see you ride that kof kof pig Uncle I want    His words broke up in a fit of coughing

Margaery looked at him with concern Your Grace

It’s kof the pie noth—kof pie Joff took another drink or tried to but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled him over His face was turning red I kof I can’t kof kof kof kof    The chalice slipped from his hand and dark red wine went running across the dais

He’s choking Queen Margaery gasped

Her grandmother moved to her side Help the poor boy the Queen of Thorns screeched in a voice ten times her size Dolts Will you all stand about gaping Help your king

Ser Garlan shoved Tyrion aside and began to pound Joffrey on the back Ser Osmund Kettleblack ripped open the king’s collar A fearful high thin sound emerged from the boy’s throat the sound of a man trying to suck a river through a reed then it stopped and that was more terrible still Turn him over Mace Tyrell bellowed at everyone and no one Turn him over shake him by his heels A different voice was calling Water give him some water The High Septon began to pray loudly Grand Maester Pycelle shouted for someone to help him back to his chambers to fetch his potions Joffrey began to claw at his throat his nails tearing bloody gouges in the flesh Beneath the skin the muscles stood out hard as stone Prince Tommen was screaming and crying

He is going to die Tyrion realized He felt curiously calm though pandemonium raged all about him They were pounding Joff on the back again but his face was only growing darker Dogs were barking children were wailing men were shouting useless advice at each other Half the wedding guests were on their feet some shoving at each other for a better view others rushing for the doors in their haste to get away

Ser Meryn pried the king’s mouth open to jam a spoon down his throat As he did the boy’s eyes met Tyrion’s He has Jaime’s eyes Only he had never seen Jaime look so scared The boy’s only thirteen Joffrey was making a dry clacking noise trying to speak His eyes bulged white with terror and he lifted a hand    reaching for his uncle or pointing    Is he begging my forgiveness or does he think I can save him Noooo Cersei wailed Father help him someone help him my son my son   

Tyrion found himself thinking of Robb Stark My own wedding is looking much better in hindsight He looked to see how Sansa was taking this but there was so much confusion in the hall that he could not find her But his eyes fell on the wedding chalice forgotten on the floor He went and scooped it up There was still a half-inch of deep purple wine in the bottom of it Tyrion considered it a moment then poured it on the floor

Margaery Tyrell was weeping in her grandmother’s arms as the old lady said Be brave be brave Most of the musicians had fled but one last flutist in the gallery was blowing a dirge In the rear of the throne room scuffling had broken out around the doors and the guests were trampling on each other Ser Addam’s gold cloaks moved in to restore order Guests were rushing headlong out into the night some weeping some stumbling and retching others white with fear It occurred to Tyrion belatedly that it might be wise to leave himself

When he heard Cersei’s scream he knew that it was over

I should leave Now Instead he waddled toward her

His sister sat in a puddle of wine cradling her son’s body Her gown was torn and stained her face white as chalk A thin black dog crept up beside her sniffing at Joffrey’s corpse The boy is gone Cersei Lord Tywin said He put his gloved hand on his daughter’s shoulder as one of his guardsmen shooed away the dog Unhand him now Let him go She did not hear It took two Kingsguard to pry loose her fingers so the body of King Joffrey Baratheon could slide limp and lifeless to the floor

The High Septon knelt beside him Father Above judge our good King Joffrey justly he intoned beginning the prayer for the dead Margaery Tyrell began to sob and Tyrion heard her mother Lady Alerie saying He choked sweetling He choked on the pie It was naught to do with you He choked We all saw

He did not choke Cersei’s voice was sharp as Ser Ilyn’s sword My son was poisoned She looked to the white knights standing helplessly around her Kingsguard do your duty

My lady said Ser Loras Tyrell uncertain

Arrest my brother she commanded him He did this the dwarf Him and his little wife They killed my son Your king Take them Take them both





SANSA

Far across the city a bell began to toll

Sansa felt as though she were in a dream Joffrey is dead she told the trees to see if that would wake her

He had not been dead when she left the throne room He had been on his knees though clawing at his throat tearing at his own skin as he fought to breathe The sight of it had been too terrible to watch and she had turned and fled sobbing Lady Tanda had been fleeing as well You have a good heart my lady she said to Sansa Not every maid would weep so for a man who set her aside and wed her to a dwarf

A good heart I have a good heart Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet but Sansa choked it back down The bells were ringing slow and mournful Ringing ringing ringing They had rung for King Robert the same way Joffrey was dead he was dead he was dead dead dead Why was she crying when she wanted to dance Were they tears of joy

She found her clothes where she had hidden them the night before last With no maids to help her it took her longer than it should have to undo the laces of her gown Her hands were strangely clumsy though she was not as frightened as she ought to have been The gods are cruel to take him so young and handsome at his own wedding feast Lady Tanda had said to her

The gods are just thought Sansa Robb had died at a wedding feast as well It was Robb she wept for Him and Margaery Poor Margaery twice wed and twice widowed Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve pushed down the gown and wriggled out of it She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak shook out the clothing she had hidden there Dress warmly Ser Dontos had told her and dress dark She had no blacks so she chose a dress of thick brown wool The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls though The cloak will cover them The cloak was a deep green with a large hood She slipped the dress over her head and donned the cloak though she left the hood down for the moment There were shoes as well simple and sturdy with flat heels and square toes The gods heard my prayer she thought She felt so numb and dreamy My skin has turned to porcelain to ivory to steel Her hands moved stiffly awkwardly as if they had never let down her hair before For a moment she wished Shae was there to help her with the net

When she pulled it free her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders The web of spun silver hung from her fingers the fine metal glimmering softly the stones black in the moonlight Black amethysts from Asshai One of them was missing Sansa lifted the net for a closer look There was a dark smudge in the silver socket where the stone had fallen out

A sudden terror filled her Her heart hammered against her ribs and for an instant she held her breath Why am I so scared it’s only an amethyst a black amethyst from Asshai no more than that It must have been loose in the setting that’s all It was loose and it fell out and now it’s lying somewhere in the throne room or in the yard unless   

Ser Dontos had said the hair net was magic that it would take her home He told her she must wear it tonight at Joffrey’s wedding feast The silver wire stretched tight across her knuckles Her thumb rubbed back and forth against the hole where the stone had been She tried to stop but her fingers were not her own Her thumb was drawn to the hole as the tongue is drawn to a missing tooth What kind of magic The king was dead the cruel king who had been her gallant prince a thousand years ago If Dontos had lied about the hair net had he lied about the rest as well What if he never comes What if there is no ship no boat on the river no escape What would happen to her then

She heard a faint rustle of leaves and stuffed the silver hair net down deep in the pocket of her cloak Who’s there she cried Who is it The godswood was dim and dark and the bells were ringing Joff into his grave

Me He staggered out from under the trees reeling drunk He caught her arm to steady himself Sweet Jonquil I’ve come Your Florian has come don’t be afraid

Sansa pulled away from his touch You said I must wear the hair net The silver net with    what sort of stones are those

Amethysts Black amethysts from Asshai my lady

They’re no amethysts Are they Are they You lied

Black amethysts he swore There was magic in them

There was murder in them

Softly my lady softly No murder He choked on his pigeon pie Dontos chortled Oh tasty tasty pie Silver and stones that’s all it was silver and stone and magic
