One project which uses such a method for generating speech has been
described Young and Fallside 1980

Young Fallside 1980

Although some attention is paid to rhythm the intonation contours
which are generated are disappointingly repetitive and lacking in
richness
In fact very little semantic information is used to assign contours really
just that inferred by the crude punctuation-driven method described
earlier
pp
The higher-level semantic problems associated with speech output were
studied some years go under the
title synthetic elocution Vanderslice 1968

Vanderslice 1968

A set of rules was generated and tested by hand on a sample passage
the first part of which is shown in Table 94
However no attempt was made to formalize the rules in a computer program
and indeed it was recognized that a number of important questions
such as the form of the semantic information assumed at the input
had been left unanswered

The comments in the table which are selected and slightly edited versions
of those appearing in the original work Vanderslice 1968 are intended
as examples of the nature and subtlety of the prosodic influences which
were examined

Vanderslice 1968

The concepts of accent and emphasis are used these relate to stress
but are not easy to define precisely in our tone-group terminology
Fortunately we do not need an exact characterization of them for the present
purpose
Roughly speaking accent encompasses both foot-initial stress and
tonic stress whereas emphasis is something more than this
typically being realized by the fall-rise or rise-fall contours of
Hallidays tone groups 4 and 5 Figure 85
pp
Particular attention is paid to anaphora and antithesis amongst other things
The first term means the repetition of a word or phrase in the text
and is often applied to pronoun references
In the example the word human is repeated in the first few words
them in the second sentence refers to human experience and human
behaviour he in the third sentence is the previously-mentioned
psychologist and task is anaphoric with tries to bring them under
systematic study
Other things being equal anaphoric references are unaccented
In our terms this means that they certainly do not receive tonic stress
and may not even receive foot stress

Antithesis is defined as the contrast of ideas expressed by parallelism of
