the priests so is the trespass offering it is most holy 1414 And
the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and
the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
to be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the
great toe of his right foot 1415 And the priest shall take some of
the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand 1416
And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times
before the LORD 1417 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand
shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great
toe of his right foot upon the blood of the trespass offering 1418
And the remnant of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall pour
upon the head of him that is to be cleansed and the priest shall make
an atonement for him before the LORD

1419 And the priest shall offer the sin offering and make an
atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness and
afterward he shall kill the burnt offering 1420 And the priest shall
offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar and the
priest shall make an atonement for him and he shall be clean

1421 And if he be poor and cannot get so much then he shall take
one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved to make an atonement for
him and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering and a log of oil 1422 And two turtledoves or two young
pigeons such as he is able to get and the one shall be a sin
offering and the other a burnt offering

1423 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto
the priest unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
before the LORD

1424 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and
the log of oil and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering
before the LORD 1425 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass
offering and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great
toe of his right foot 1426 And the priest shall pour of the oil into
the palm of his own left hand 1427 And the priest shall sprinkle
with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven
times before the LORD 1428 And the priest shall put of the oil that
is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe
of his right foot upon the place of the blood of the trespass
offering 1429 And the rest of the oil that is in the priests hand
he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed to make an
atonement for him before the LORD

1430 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves or of the young
pigeons such as he can get 1431 Even such as he is able to get the
one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering with the
meat offering and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is
to be cleansed before the LORD

1432 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy whose
hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing

1433 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying 1434 When
ye be come into the land of Canaan which I give to you for a
possession and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of
your possession 1435 And he that owneth the house shall come and
tell the priest saying It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague
in the house 1436 Then the priest shall command that they empty the
house before the priest go into it to see the plague that all that
is in the house be not made unclean and afterward the priest shall go
in to see the house 1437 And he shall look on the plague and
behold if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes greenish or reddish which in sight are lower than the wall
1438 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
house and shut up the house seven days 1439 And the priest shall
come again the seventh day and shall look and behold if the plague
be spread in the walls of the house 1440 Then the priest shall
command that they take away the stones in which the plague is and
they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city 1441 And
he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place 1442 And they shall take other stones and put them in
the place of those stones and he shall take other morter and shall
plaister the house

1443 And if the plague come again and break out in the house after
that he hath taken away the stones and after he hath scraped the
house and after it is plaistered 1444 Then the priest shall come
and look and behold if the plague be spread in the house it is a

1446 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
