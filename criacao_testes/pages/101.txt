For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak He strode across the tent whirled strode back his face dark and angry He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury Selmy dodged Get out the king said then coldly Get out before I kill you

Ser Barristan left quickly Ned was about to follow when the king called out again Not you Ned

Ned turned back Robert took up his horn again filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner and thrust it at Ned Drink he said brusquely

I’ve no thirst—

Drink Your king commands it

Ned took the horn and drank The beer was black and thick so strong it stung the eyes

Robert sat down again Damn you Ned Stark You and Jon Arryn I loved you both What have you done to me You were the one should have been king you or Jon

You had the better claim Your Grace

I told you to drink not to argue You made me king you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk damn you Look at me Ned Look at what kinging has done to me Gods too fat for my armor how did it ever come to this

Robert…

Drink and stay quiet the king is talking I swear to you I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne or so dead as now that I’ve won it And Cersei… I have Jon Arryn to thank for her I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me but Jon said the realm needed an heir Cersei Lannister would be a good match he told me she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s throne The king shook his head I loved that old man I swear it but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy Oh Cersei is lovely to look at truly but cold… the way she guards her cunt you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs Here give me that beer if you won’t drink it He took the horn upended it belched wiped his mouth I am sorry for your girl Ned Truly About the wolf I mean My son was lying I’d stake my soul on it My son… you love your children don’t you

With all my heart Ned said

Let me tell you a secret Ned More than once I have dreamed of giving up the crown Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer spend my time warring and whoring that’s what I was made for The sellsword king how the singers would love me You know what stops me The thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear My son How could I have made a son like that Ned

He’s only a boy Ned said awkwardly He had small liking for Prince Joffrey but he could hear the pain in Robert’s voice Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age

It would not trouble me if the boy was wild Ned You don’t know him as I do He sighed and shook his head Ah perhaps you are right Jon despaired of me often enough yet I grew into a good king Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence You might speak up and agree now you know

Your Grace… Ned began carefully

Robert slapped Ned on the back Ah say that I’m a better king than Aerys and be done with it You never could lie for love nor honor Ned Stark I’m still young and now that you’re here with me things will be different We’ll make this a reign to sing of and damn the Lannisters to seven hells I smell bacon Who do you think our champion will be today Have you seen Mace Tyrell’s boy The Knight of Flowers they call him Now there’s a son any man would be proud to own to Last tourney he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump you ought to have seen the look on Cersei’s face I laughed till my sides hurt Renly says he has this sister a maid of fourteen lovely as a dawn…

They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon at a trestle table by the river’s edge The king’s melancholy melted away with the morning mist and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys …had given Jon a barrel of oranges remember Only the things had gone rotten so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose You remember Redfort’s pock-faced squire He tossed one back at me and before Jon could so much as fart there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction He laughed uproariously and even Ned smiled remembering

This was the boy he had grown up with he thought this was the Robert Baratheon he’d known and loved If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn this man would listen Then Cersei would fall and the Kingslayer with her and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident He could see it all so clearly

That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time and afterward his smiles came easier and more often until it was time for the tournament to resume

Ned walked with the king to the jousting field He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa Septa Mordane was ill today and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting As he saw Robert to his place he noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear the place beside the king was empty That too gave Ned cause to hope

He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the day’s first joust Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his arrival

Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear He wore an olive-green cloak over his soot-grey armor That and his hound’s-head helm were his only concession to ornament

A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered the lists riding an elegant blood bay destrier The horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail and Jaime glittered from head to heel Even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles

Done Lord Renly shouted back The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning

Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them Littlefinger called dryly

Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons gently lowered his visor and rode to the end of the lists Both men couched their lances
