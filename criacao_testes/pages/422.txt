I was at the Whispering Wood my lord I have seen enough butchery I came here an envoy—

And an envoy you shall leave Renly said but wiser than you came You shall see what befalls rebels with your own eyes so your son can hear it from your own lips We’ll keep you safe never fear He turned away to make his dispositions Lord Mathis you shall lead the center of my main battle Bryce you’ll have the left The right is mine Lord Estermont you shall command the reserve

I shall not fail you Your Grace Lord Estermont replied

Lord Mathis Rowan spoke up Who shall have the van

Your Grace said Ser Jon Fossoway I beg the honor

Beg all you like said Ser Guyard the Green by rights it should be one of the seven who strikes the first blow

It takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall Randyll Tarly announced I was leading Mace Tyrell’s van when you were still sucking on your mother’s teat Guyard

A clamor filled the pavilion as other men loudly set forth their claims The knights of summer Catelyn thought Renly raised a hand Enough my lords If I had a dozen vans all of you should have one but the greatest glory by rights belongs to the greatest knight Ser Loras shall strike the first blow

With a glad heart Your Grace The Knight of Flowers knelt before the king Grant me your blessing and a knight to ride beside me with your banner Let the stag and rose go to battle side by side

Renly glanced about him Brienne

Your Grace She was still armored in her blue steel though she had taken off her helm The crowded tent was hot and sweat plastered limp yellow hair to her broad homely face My place is at your side I am your sworn shield…

One of seven the king reminded her Never fear four of your fellows will be with me in the fight

Brienne dropped to her knees If I must part from Your Grace grant me the honor of arming you for battle

Catelyn heard someone snigger behind her She loves him poor thing she thought sadly She’d play his squire just to touch him and never care how great a fool they think her

Granted Renly said Now leave me all of you Even kings must rest before a battle

My lord Catelyn said there was a small sept in the last village we passed If you will not permit me to depart for Riverrun grant me leave to go there and pray

As you will Ser Robar give Lady Stark safe escort to this sept… but see that she returns to us by dawn

You might do well to pray yourself Catelyn added

For victory

For wisdom

Renly laughed Loras stay and help me pray It’s been so long I’ve quite forgotten how As to the rest of you I want every man in place by first light armed armored and horsed We shall give Stannis a dawn he will not soon forget

Dusk was falling when Catelyn left the pavilion Ser Robar Royce fell in beside her She knew him slightly—one of Bronze Yohn’s sons comely in a rough-hewn way a tourney warrior of some renown Renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood red armor and named him one of his seven You are a long way from the Vale ser she told him

And you far from Winterfell my lady

I know what brought me here but why have you come This is not your battle no more than it is mine

I made it my battle when I made Renly my king

The Royces are bannermen to House Arryn

My lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty as does his heir A second son must find glory where he can Ser Robar shrugged A man grows weary of tourneys
