925 And they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses
full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit
trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness

926 Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee
and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which
testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great
provocations

927 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies
who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold
mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of
their enemies

928 But after they had rest they did evil again before thee
therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they
had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou
deliver them according to thy mercies 929 And testifiedst against
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt
proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against
thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and
withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear

930 Yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against
them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear
therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands

931 Nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly
consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful
God

932 Now therefore our God the great the mighty and the terrible
God who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem
little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our
princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers
and on all thy people since the time of the kings of Assyria unto
this day

933 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou
hast done right but we have done wickedly 934 Neither have our
kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor
hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou
didst testify against them

935 For they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great
goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which
thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works

936 Behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou
gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof
behold we are servants in it 937 And it yieldeth much increase unto
the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they
have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure
and we are in great distress

938 And because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it
and our princes Levites and priests seal unto it

101 Now those that sealed were Nehemiah the Tirshatha the son of
Hachaliah and Zidkijah 102 Seraiah Azariah Jeremiah 103 Pashur
Amariah Malchijah 104 Hattush Shebaniah Malluch 105 Harim

priests

109 And the Levites both Jeshua the son of Azaniah Binnui of the
sons of Henadad Kadmiel 1010 And their brethren Shebaniah
Hodijah Kelita Pelaiah Hanan 1011 Micha Rehob Hashabiah 1012
Zaccur Sherebiah Shebaniah 1013 Hodijah Bani Beninu

1014 The chief of the people Parosh Pahathmoab Elam Zatthu Bani
1015 Bunni Azgad Bebai 1016 Adonijah Bigvai Adin 1017 Ater
Hizkijah Azzur 1018 Hodijah Hashum Bezai 1019 Hariph Anathoth

1024 Hallohesh Pileha Shobek 1025 Rehum Hashabnah Maaseiah
1026 And Ahijah Hanan Anan 1027 Malluch Harim Baanah

1028 And the rest of the people the priests the Levites the
porters the singers the Nethinims and all they that had separated
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God their
wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge
and having understanding 1029 They clave to their brethren their
nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in Gods
law which was given by Moses the servant of God and to observe and
do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord and his judgments and
his statutes 1030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the
people of the land not take their daughters for our sons 1031 And
if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath
day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on
the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the
exaction of every debt

1032 Also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with
the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God
1033 For the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for
the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for
