the side of the great river which is Hiddekel 105 Then I lifted up
mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen
whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz 106 His body also
was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and
his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to
polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a
multitude

107 And I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me
saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they
fled to hide themselves

108 Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there
remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption and I retained no strength

109 Yet heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of
his words then was I in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward
the ground

1010 And behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and
upon the palms of my hands

1011 And he said unto me O Daniel a man greatly beloved understand
the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am
I now sent

And when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling

1012 Then said he unto me Fear not Daniel for from the first day
that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself
before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words

1013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days but lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help
me and I remained there with the kings of Persia

1014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days

1015 And when he had spoken such words unto me I set my face toward
the ground and I became dumb

1016 And behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
my lips then I opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that
stood before me O my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
me and I have retained no strength

1017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord
for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither
is there breath left in me

1018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
a man and he strengthened me 1019 And said O man greatly beloved
fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong And when he
had spoken unto me I was strengthened and said Let my lord speak
for thou hast strengthened me

1020 Then said he Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee and now
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia and when I am gone
forth lo the prince of Grecia shall come

1021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but
Michael your prince

111 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede even I stood to
confirm and to strengthen him

112 And now will I shew thee the truth Behold there shall stand up
yet three kings in Persia and the fourth shall be far richer than
they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all
against the realm of Grecia

113 And a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great
dominion and do according to his will

114 And when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and
shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his
posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his
kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those

115 And the king of the south shall be strong and one of his
princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his
dominion shall be a great dominion

116 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together for
the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north
to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm
neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and
they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened
her in these times

117 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the
fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and
shall prevail 118 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their
gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver
and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the
north
