257 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations

258 He will swallow up death in victory and the Lord GOD will wipe
away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he
take away from off all the earth for the LORD hath spoken it

259 And it shall be said in that day Lo this is our God we have
waited for him and he will save us this is the LORD we have waited
for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation

2510 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest and Moab
shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the
dunghill

2511 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he
that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring
down their pride together with the spoils of their hands

2512 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust

261 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah We have
a strong city salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks

262 Open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the
truth may enter in

263 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
thee because he trusteth in thee

264 Trust ye in the LORD for ever for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
everlasting strength 265 For he bringeth down them that dwell on
high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the
ground he bringeth it even to the dust

266 The foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the
steps of the needy

267 The way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost
weigh the path of the just

268 Yea in the way of thy judgments O LORD have we waited for
thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of
thee

269 With my soul have I desired thee in the night yea with my
spirit within me will I seek thee early for when thy judgments are in
the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness

2610 Let favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn
righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and
will not behold the majesty of the LORD

2611 LORD when thy hand is lifted up they will not see but they
shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people yea the fire
of thine enemies shall devour them

2612 LORD thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought
all our works in us

2613 O LORD our God other lords beside thee have had dominion over
us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name

2614 They are dead they shall not live they are deceased they
shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and
made all their memory to perish

2615 Thou hast increased the nation O LORD thou hast increased the
nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the
ends of the earth

2616 LORD in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a
prayer when thy chastening was upon them

2617 Like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her
delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in
thy sight O LORD

2618 We have been with child we have been in pain we have as it
were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the
earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen

2619 Thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they
arise Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the
dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead

2620 Come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy
doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until
the indignation be overpast

2621 For behold the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall
disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain

271 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that
crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea
