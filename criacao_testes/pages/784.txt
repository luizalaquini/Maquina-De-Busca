of divorcement and to put her away  198 He saith unto them Moses
because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your
wives but from the beginning it was not so

199 And I say unto you Whosoever shall put away his wife except it
be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery

1910 His disciples say unto him If the case of the man be so with
his wife it is not good to marry

1911 But he said unto them All men cannot receive this saying save
they to whom it is given

1912 For there are some eunuchs which were so born from their
mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of
men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heavens sake He that is able to receive it let him
receive it

1913 Then were there brought unto him little children that he should
put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them

1914 But Jesus said Suffer little children and forbid them not to
come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven

1915 And he laid his hands on them and departed thence

1916 And behold one came and said unto him Good Master what good
thing shall I do that I may have eternal life  1917 And he said
unto him Why callest thou me good there is none good but one that
is God but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments

1918 He saith unto him Which Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder
Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not
bear false witness 1919 Honour thy father and thy mother and Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself

1920 The young man saith unto him All these things have I kept from
my youth up what lack I yet  1921 Jesus said unto him If thou wilt
be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me

1922 But when the young man heard that saying he went away
sorrowful for he had great possessions

1923 Then said Jesus unto his disciples Verily I say unto you That
a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven

1924 And again I say unto you It is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
God

1925 When his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed
saying Who then can be saved  1926 But Jesus beheld them and said
unto them With men this is impossible but with God all things are
possible

1927 Then answered Peter and said unto him Behold we have forsaken
all and followed thee what shall we have therefore  1928 And Jesus
said unto them Verily I say unto you That ye which have followed me
in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his
glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve
tribes of Israel

1929 And every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or
sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my
names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit
everlasting life

1930 But many that are first shall be last and the last shall be
first

201 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers
into his vineyard

202 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he
sent them into his vineyard

203 And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing
idle in the marketplace 204 And said unto them Go ye also into the
vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you And they went their
way

205 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did
likewise

206 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others
standing idle and saith unto them Why stand ye here all the day
idle  207 They say unto him Because no man hath hired us He saith
unto them Go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that
shall ye receive

208 So when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward Call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from
the last unto the first

209 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they
received every man a penny
