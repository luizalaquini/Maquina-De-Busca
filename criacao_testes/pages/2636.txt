son born to Naomi and they called his name Obed he is the father of
Jesse the father of David

The First Book of Samuel

Otherwise Called

The First Book of the Kings


11 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim of mount Ephraim
and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham the son of Elihu the
son of Tohu the son of Zuph an Ephrathite 12 And he had two wives
the name of the one was Hannah and the name of the other Peninnah
and Peninnah had children but Hannah had no children

13 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh And the two sons of Eli
Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the LORD were there

14 And when the time was that Elkanah offered he gave to Peninnah
his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions 15 But
unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the
LORD had shut up her womb

16 And her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret
because the LORD had shut up her womb

17 And as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of
the LORD so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat

18 Then said Elkanah her husband to her Hannah why weepest thou
and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not I better
to thee than ten sons  19 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in
Shiloh and after they had drunk Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat
by a post of the temple of the LORD

110 And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the LORD and
wept sore

111 And she vowed a vow and said O LORD of hosts if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and
not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life
and there shall no razor come upon his head

112 And it came to pass as she continued praying before the LORD
that Eli marked her mouth

113 Now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her
voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken

114 And Eli said unto her How long wilt thou be drunken put away
thy wine from thee

115 And Hannah answered and said No my lord I am a woman of a
sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have
poured out my soul before the LORD

116 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto

117 Then Eli answered and said Go in peace and the God of Israel
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him

118 And she said Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight So the
woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad

119 And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the
LORD and returned and came to their house to Ramah and Elkanah knew
Hannah his wife and the LORD remembered her

120 Wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after
Hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name Samuel
saying Because I have asked him of the LORD

121 And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the
LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow

122 But Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband I will not
go up until the child be weaned and then I will bring him that he
may appear before the LORD and there abide for ever

123 And Elkanah her husband said unto her Do what seemeth thee good
tarry until thou have weaned him only the LORD establish his word So
