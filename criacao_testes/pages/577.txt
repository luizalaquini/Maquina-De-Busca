1017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire and his Holy One
for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in
one day 1018 And shall consume the glory of his forest and of his
fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a
standard-bearer fainteth

1019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a
child may write them

1020 And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of
Israel and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the LORD the
Holy One of Israel in truth

1021 The remnant shall return even the remnant of Jacob unto the
mighty God

1022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea yet a
remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness

1023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption even
determined in the midst of all the land

1024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts O my people that
dwellest in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee
with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner
of Egypt

1025 For yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease
and mine anger in their destruction

1026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb and as his rod was
upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt

1027 And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be
taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and
the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing

1028 He is come to Aiath he is passed to Migron at Michmash he hath
laid up his carriages 1029 They are gone over the passage they have
taken up their lodging at Geba Ramah is afraid Gibeah of Saul is
fled

1030 Lift up thy voice O daughter of Gallim cause it to be heard
unto Laish O poor Anathoth

1031 Madmenah is removed the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
to flee

1032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day he shall shake his hand
against the mount of the daughter of Zion the hill of Jerusalem

1033 Behold the Lord the LORD of hosts shall lop the bough with
terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the
haughty shall be humbled

1034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and
Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one

111 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a
Branch shall grow out of his roots 112 And the spirit of the LORD
shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the
spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear
of the LORD 113 And shall make him of quick understanding in the
fear of the LORD and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes
neither reprove after the hearing of his ears 114 But with
righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the
meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his
mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked

115 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and
faithfulness the girdle of his reins

116 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together and a little child shall lead them

117 And the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie
down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox

118 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the
weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den

119 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover
the sea

1110 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall
stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and
his rest shall be glorious

1111 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set
his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people
which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros
and from Cush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and
from the islands of the sea
