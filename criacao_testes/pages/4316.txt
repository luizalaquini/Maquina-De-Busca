If the first five formants are synthesized explicitly instead of just the
first three the correction is

giving a rather more reasonable value of 43 dB when f=5 kHz  In actual
implementations fixed filters are sometimes included explicitly for
formants 4 and 5  Although this lowers the gain of the higher-formant
correction filter the total amplification at 5 kHz of the combined correction
is still 72 dB  If one is less demanding and aims for a synthesizer that
produces a correct spectrum only up to 35 kHz it is 35 dB
This places quite stringent requirements on the preceding formant filters if
the stray noise that they generate internally is not to be amplified to
perceptible magnitudes by the correction filter at high frequencies
pp
Explicit inclusion of fixed filters for formants 4 and 5 undoubtedly improves
the accuracy of the higher-formant correction  Recall that the above derivation
of the correction filter characteristic used the first-order approximation

which is only valid if w  w sub n
Thus it only holds at frequencies less than
the highest explicitly synthesized formant
and so with formants 4 35 kHz and
5 45 kHz included a reasonable correction should be obtained for
telephone-quality speech  However detailed analysis with a second-order
approximation shows that the coefficient of the neglected term is in fact

A second perhaps more compelling reason for explicitly
including a couple of fixed formants is that the otherwise enormous amplification
provided by the correction can be distributed throughout the formant chain
We saw earlier why there is reason to prefer the
order F3emF1emF2 over F1emF2emF3
With explicit formants 4 and 5 a suitable order which helps
to keep the amplification at intermediate points in the chain within reasonable
bounds is F3emF5emF2emF4emF1
rh Parallel synthesizers
A series synthesizer models the vocal tract resonances by a chain of formant
filters in series  A parallel synthesizer utilizes a parallel connection of
filters as illustrated in Figure 59

Consider a parallel combination of two formants with individually-controllable
amplitudes  The combined transfer function is

If the formant bandwidths b sub 1 and b sub 2
are equal and the amplitudes are
chosen as
LB
EQ
A sub 1 = w sub 2 sup 2 over w sub 2 sup 2 -w sub 1 sup 2

A sub 2 =- w sub 1 sup 2 over w sub 2 sup 2 -w sub 1 sup 2

then the transfer function becomes the same as that of a two-formant series synthesizer
namely
LB
EQ
Hs  =  w sub 1 sup 2 over s sup 2 + b sub 1 s + w sub 1 sup 2
  w sub 2 sup 2 over s sup 2 + b sub 2 s + w sub 2 sup 2  
EN
LE
The argument can be extended to any number of formants under the assumption
that the formant bandwidths are equal  Note that the signs of A sub 1
and A sub 2
differ  in general the formant amplitudes for a parallel synthesizer alternate
in sign
