For wildling raiders he thought Like us Like me

Beyond that Wall lay the Seven Kingdoms and everything he had sworn to protect He had said the words had pledged his life and honor and by rights he should be up there standing sentry He should be raising a horn to his lips to rouse the Night’s Watch to arms He had no horn though It would not be hard to steal one from the wildlings he suspected but what would that accomplish Even if he blew it there was no one to hear The Wall was a hundred leagues long and the Watch sadly dwindled All but three of the strongholds had been abandoned there might not be a brother within forty miles of here but for Jon If he was a brother still…

I should have tried to kill Mance Rayder on the Fist even if it meant my life That was what Qhorin Halfhand would have done But Jon had hesitated and the chance passed The next day he had ridden off with Styr the Magnar Jarl and more than a hundred picked Thenns and raiders He told himself that he was only biding his time that when the moment came he would slip away and ride for Castle Black The moment never came They rested most nights in empty wildling villages and Styr always set a dozen of his Thenns to guard the horses Jarl watched him suspiciously And Ygritte was never far day or night

Two hearts that beat as one Mance Rayder’s mocking words rang bitter in his head Jon had seldom felt so confused I have no choice he’d told himself the first time when she slipped beneath his sleeping skins If I refuse her she will know me for a turncloak I am playing the part the Halfhand told me to play

His body had played the part eagerly enough His lips on hers his hand sliding under her doeskin shirt to find a breast his manhood stiffening when she rubbed her mound against it through their clothes My vows he’d thought remembering the weirwood grove where he had said them the nine great white trees in a circle the carved red faces watching listening But her fingers were undoing his laces and her tongue was in his mouth and her hand slipped inside his smallclothes and brought him out and he could not see the weirwoods anymore only her She bit his neck and he nuzzled hers burying his nose in her thick red hair Lucky he thought she is lucky fire-kissed Isn’t that good she whispered as she guided him inside her She was sopping wet down there and no maiden that was plain but Jon did not care His vows her maidenhood none of it mattered only the heat of her the mouth on his the finger that pinched at his nipple Isn’t that sweet she said again Not so fast oh slow yes like that There now there now yes sweet sweet You know nothing Jon Snow but I can show you Harder now Yessss

A part he tried to remind himself afterward I am playing a part I had to do it once to prove I’d abandoned my vows I had to make her trust me It need never happen again He was still a man of the Night’s Watch and a son of Eddard Stark He had done what needed to be done proved what needed to be proven

The proving had been so sweet though and Ygritte had gone to sleep beside him with her head against his chest and that was sweet as well dangerously sweet He thought of the weirwoods again and the words he’d said before them It was only once and it had to be Even my father stumbled once when he forgot his marriage vows and sired a bastard Jon vowed to himself that it would be the same with him It will never happen again

It happened twice more that night and again in the morning when she woke to find him hard The wildlings were stirring by then and several could not help but notice what was going on beneath the pile of furs Jarl told them to be quick about it before he had to throw a pail of water over them Like a pair of rutting dogs Jon thought afterward Was that what he’d become I am a man of the Night’s Watch a small voice inside insisted but every night it seemed a little fainter and when Ygritte kissed his ears or bit his neck he could not hear it at all Was this how it was for my father he wondered Was he as weak as I am when he dishonored himself in my mother’s bed

Something was coming up the hill behind him he realized suddenly For half a heartbeat he thought it might be Ghost come back but the direwolf never made so much noise Jon drew Longclaw in a single smooth motion but it was only one of the Thenns a broad man in a bronze helm Snow the intruder said Come Magnar wants The men of Thenn spoke the Old Tongue and most had only a few words of the Common

Jon did not much care what the Magnar wanted but there was no use arguing with someone who could scarcely understand him so he followed the man back down the hill

The mouth of the cave was a cleft in the rock barely wide enough for a horse half concealed behind a soldier pine It opened to the north so the glows of the fires within would not be visible from the Wall Even if by some mischance a patrol should happen to pass atop the Wall tonight they would see nothing but hills and pines and the icy sheen of starlight on a half-frozen lake Mance Rayder had planned his thrust well

Within the rock the passage descended twenty feet before it opened out onto a space as large as Winterfell’s Great Hall Cookfires burned amongst the columns their smoke rising to blacken the stony ceiling The horses had been hobbled along one wall beside a shallow pool A sinkhole in the center of the floor opened on what might have been an even greater cavern below though the darkness made it hard to tell Jon could hear the soft rushing sound of an underground stream somewhere below as well

Jarl was with the Magnar Mance had given them the joint command Styr was none too pleased by that Jon had noted early on Mance Rayder had called the dark youth a pet of Val who was sister to Dalla his own queen which made Jarl a sort of good brother once removed to the King-beyond-the-Wall The Magnar plainly resented sharing his authority He had brought a hundred Thenns five times as many men as Jarl and often acted as if he had the sole command But it would be the younger man who got them over the ice Jon knew Though he could not have been older than twenty Jarl had been raiding for eight years and had gone over the Wall a dozen times with the likes of Alfyn Crowkiller and the Weeper and more recently with his own band

The Magnar was direct Jarl has warned me of crows patrolling on high Tell me all you know of these patrols

Tell me Jon noted not tell us though Jarl stood right beside him He would have liked nothing better than to refuse the brusque demand but he knew Styr would put him to death at the slightest disloyalty and Ygritte as well for the crime of being his There are four men in each patrol two rangers and two builders he said The builders are supposed to make note of cracks melting and other structural problems while the rangers look for signs of foes They ride mules

Mules The earless man frowned Mules are slow

Slow but more surefooted on the ice The patrols often ride atop the Wall and aside from Castle Black the paths up there have not been graveled for long years The mules are bred at Eastwatch and specially trained to their duty

They often ride atop the Wall Not always

No One patrol in four follows the base instead to search for cracks in the foundation ice or signs of tunneling

The Magnar nodded Even in far Thenn we know the tale of Arson Iceaxe and his tunnel

Jon knew the tale as well Arson Iceaxe had been halfway through the Wall when his tunnel was found by rangers from the Nightfort They did not trouble to disturb him at his digging only sealed the way behind with ice and stone and snow Dolorous Edd used to say that if you pressed your ear flat to the Wall you could still hear Arson chipping away with his axe

When do these patrols go out How often

Jon shrugged It changes I’ve heard that Lord Commander Qorgyle used to send them out every third day from Castle Black to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and every second day from Castle Black to the Shadow Tower The Watch had more men in his day though Lord Commander Mormont prefers to vary the number of patrols and the days of their departure to make it more difficult for anyone to know their comings and goings And sometimes the Old Bear will even send a larger force to one of the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moon’s turn His uncle had originated that tactic Jon knew Anything to make the enemy unsure

Is Stonedoor manned at present asked Jarl Greyguard

So we’re between those two are we Jon kept his face carefully blank Only Eastwatch Castle Black and the Shadow Tower were manned when I left the Wall I can’t speak to what Bowen Marsh or Ser Denys might have done since

How many crows remain within the castles asked Styr

Five hundred at Castle Black Two hundred at Shadow Tower perhaps three hundred at Eastwatch Jon added three hundred men to the count If only it were that easy…
