  Joseph Poorgrass in the background twitched and
his lips became dry with fear of some terrible conse+
quences as he saw Bathsheba summarily speaking and
Henery slinking off to a corner
  Now the next Laban Tall youll stay on working
for me
  For you or anybody that pays me well maam
replied the young married man
  True -- the man must live said a woman in the
back quarter who had just entered with clicking pattens
  What woman is that Bathsheba asked
  I be his lawful wife continued the voice with
greater prominence of manner and tone This lady
called herself five-and-twenty looked thirty passed as
thirty-five and was forty She was a woman who never
like some newly married showed
P 130
conjugal tenderness in
public perhaps because she had none to show
  Oh you are said Bathsheba Well Laban will
you stay on 
  Yes hell stay maam said again the shrill tongue
of Labans lawful wife
  Well he can speak for himself I suppose
  O Lord not he maam A simple tool Well
enough but a poor gawkhammer mortal the wife replied
  Heh-heh-heh laughed the married man with a
hideous effort of appreciation for he was as irrepressibly
good-humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary
candidate on the hustings
  The names remaining were called in the same
manner
  Now I think I have done with you said Bathsheba
closing the book and shaking back a stray twine of hair
Has William Smallbury returned
  No maam
  The new shepherd will want a man under him
suggested Henery Fray trying to make himself official
again by a sideway approach towards her chair
  Oh -- he will Who can he have
  Young Cain Ball is a very good lad Henery said
and Shepherd Oak dont mind his youth he added
turning with an apologetic smile to the shepherd who
had just appeared on the scene and was now leaning
against the doorpost with his arms folded
  No I dont mind that said Gabriel
  How did Cain come by such a name asked
Bathsheba
  Oh you see mem his pore mother not being a
Scripture-read woman made a mistake at his christening
thinking twas Abel killed Cain and called en Cain
but twas too late for the name could never be got rid
of in the parish Tis very unfortunate for the boy
  It is rather unfortunate
  Yes However we soften it down as much as we
can and call him Cainey Ah pore widow-woman
she cried her heart
P 131
out about it almost She was
brought up by a very heathen father and mother who
never sent her to church or school and it shows how
the sins of the parents are visited upon the children
mem
  Mr Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree
of melancholy required when the persons involved in
the given misfortune do not belong to your own family
  Very well then Cainey Ball to be under-shepherd
And you quite understand your duties -- you I mean
Gabriel Oak
  Quite well I thank you Miss Everdene said
Shepard Oak from the doorpost If I dont Ill
inquire Gabriel was rather staggered by the remark+
able coolness of her manner Certainly nobody without
previous information would have dreamt that Oak and
the handsome woman before whom he stood had ever
been other than strangers But perhaps her air was
the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
her from a cottage to a large house and fields The
case is not unexampled in high places When in the
writings of the later poets Jove and his family are found
to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak
of Olympus into the wide sky above it their words show
a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve
Footsteps were heard in the passage combining in
their character the qualities both of weight and measure
rather at the expense of velocity
All Heres Billy Smallbury come from Caster+
bridge
 And whats the news   said Bathsheba as William
after marching to the middle of the hall took a hand+
kerchief from his hat and wiped his forehead from its
centre to its remoter boundaries
I should have been sooner miss he said if it
hadnt been for the weather He then stamped with
each foot severely and on looking down his boots were
perceived to be clogged with snow
Come at last is it  said Henery
 Well what about Fanny   said Bathsheba
Well maam in round numbers shes run away with
the soldiers said William
