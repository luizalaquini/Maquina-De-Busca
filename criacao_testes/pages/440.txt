THEON

Theon wiped the spittle off his cheek with the back of his hand Robb will gut you Greyjoy Benfred Tallheart screamed He’ll feed your turncloak’s heart to his wolf you piece of sheep dung

Aeron Damphair’s voice cut through the insults like a sword through cheese Now you must kill him

I have questions for him first said Theon

Fuck your questions Benfred hung bleeding and helpless between Stygg and Werlag You’ll choke on them before you get any answers from me craven Turncloak

Uncle Aeron was relentless When he spits on you he spits on all of us He spits on the Drowned God He must die

My father gave me the command here Uncle

And sent me to counsel you

And to watch me Theon dare not push matters too far with his uncle The command was his yes but his men had a faith in the Drowned God that they did not have in him and they were terrified of Aeron Damphair I cannot fault them for that

You’ll lose your head for this Greyjoy The crows will eat the jelly of your eyes Benfred tried to spit again but only managed a little blood The Others bugger your wet god

Tallhart you’ve spit away your life Theon thought Stygg silence him he said

They forced Benfred to his knees Werlag tore the rabbitskin off his belt and jammed it between his teeth to stop his shouting Stygg unlimbered his axe

No Aeron Damphair declared He must be given to the god The old way

What does it matter Dead is dead Take him then

You will come as well You command here The offering should come from you

That was more than Theon could stomach You are the priest Uncle I leave the god to you Do me the same kindness and leave the battles to me He waved his hand and Werlag and Stygg began to drag their captive off toward the shore Aeron Damphair gave his nephew a reproachful look then followed Down to the pebbled beach they would go to drown Benfred Tallhart in salt water The old way

Perhaps it’s a kindness Theon told himself as he stalked off in the other direction Stygg was hardly the most expert of headsmen and Benfred had a neck thick as a boar’s heavy with muscle and fat I used to mock him for it just to see how angry I could make him he remembered That had been what three years past When Ned Stark had ridden to Torrhen’s Square to see Ser Helman Theon had accompanied him and spent a fortnight in Benfred’s company

He could hear the rough noises of victory from the crook in the road where the battle had been fought… if you’d go so far as to call it a battle More like slaughtering sheep if truth be told Sheep fleeced in steel but sheep nonetheless

Climbing a jumble of stone Theon looked down on the dead men and dying horses The horses had deserved better Tymor and his brothers had gathered up what mounts had come through the fight unhurt while Urzen and Black Lorren silenced the animals too badly wounded to be saved The rest of his men were looting the corpses Gevin Harlaw knelt on a dead man’s chest sawing off his finger to get at a ring Paying the iron price My lord father would approve Theon thought of seeking out the bodies of the two men he’d slain himself to see if they had any jewelry worth the taking but the notion left a bitter taste in his mouth He could imagine what Eddard Stark would have said Yet that thought made him angry too Stark is dead and rotting and naught to me he reminded himself

Old Botley who was called Fishwhiskers sat scowling by his pile of plunder while his three sons added to it One of them was in a shoving match with a fat man named Todric who was reeling among the slain with a horn of ale in one hand and an axe in the other clad in a cloak of white foxfur only slightly stained by the blood of its previous owner Drunk Theon decided watching him bellow It was said that the ironmen of old had oft been blood-drunk in battle so berserk that they felt no pain and feared no foe but this was a common ale-drunk

Wex my bow and quiver The boy ran and fetched them Theon bent the bow and slipped the string into its notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into his eyes Fishwhiskers leapt up cursing but Theon was quicker He drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn figuring to give them a shot to talk about but Todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as he loosed The arrow took him through the belly

The looters stopped to gape Theon lowered his bow No drunkards I said and no squabbles over plunder On his knees Todric was dying noisily Botley silence him Fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey They slit Todric’s throat as he kicked feebly and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead

Now they know I mean what I say Lord Balon might have given him the command but Theon knew that some of his men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when they looked at him Anyone else have a thirst No one replied Good He kicked at Benfred’s fallen banner clutched in the dead hand of the squire who’d borne it A rabbitskin had been tied below the flag Why rabbitskins he had meant to ask but being spat on had made him forget his questions He tossed his bow back to Wex and strode off remembering how elated he’d felt after the Whispering Wood and wondering why this did not taste as sweet Tallhart you bloody overproud fool you never even sent out a scout

They’d been joking and even singing as they’d come on the three trees of Tallhart streaming above them while rabbitskins flapped stupidly from the points of their lances The archers concealed behind the gorse had spoiled the song with a rain of arrows and Theon himself had led his men-at-arms out to finish the butcher’s work with dagger axe and warhammer He had ordered their leader spared for questioning
