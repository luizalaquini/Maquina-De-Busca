which I have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and
worship them 720 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my
land which I have given them and this house which I have sanctified
for my name will I cast out of my sight and will make it to be a
proverb and a byword among all nations

721 And this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every
one that passeth by it so that he shall say Why hath the LORD done
thus unto this land and unto this house  722 And it shall be
answered Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers which
brought them forth out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other
gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought
all this evil upon them

81 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein Solomon
had built the house of the LORD and his own house 82 That the
cities which Huram had restored to Solomon Solomon built them and
caused the children of Israel to dwell there

83 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah and prevailed against it

84 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities
which he built in Hamath

85 Also he built Bethhoron the upper and Bethhoron the nether
fenced cities with walls gates and bars 86 And Baalath and all
the store cities that Solomon had and all the chariot cities and the
cities of the horsemen and all that Solomon desired to build in
Jerusalem and in Lebanon and throughout all the land of his
dominion

87 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites and the
Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites
which were not of Israel 88 But of their children who were left
after them in the land whom the children of Israel consumed not them
did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day

89 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and
captains of his chariots and horsemen

810 And these were the chief of king Solomons officers even two
hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people

811 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
David unto the house that he had built for her for he said My wife
shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel because the
places are holy whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come

812 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar
of the LORD which he had built before the porch 813 Even after a
certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of
Moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn
feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened
bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles

814 And he appointed according to the order of David his father the
courses of the priests to their service and the Levites to their
charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of
every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate
for so had David the man of God commanded

815 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the
treasures

816 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
foundation of the house of the LORD and until it was finished So the
house of the LORD was perfected

817 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber and to Eloth at the sea side in
the land of Edom

818 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and
servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the
servants of Solomon to Ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty
talents of gold and brought them to king Solomon

91 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon she came
to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem with a very great
company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and
precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with
him of all that was in her heart

92 And Solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid
from Solomon which he told her not

93 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon and
the house that he had built 94 And the meat of his table and the
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and
their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent
by which he went up into the house of the LORD there was no more
spirit in her

95 And she said to the king It was a true report which I heard in
mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom 96 Howbeit I believed
not their words until I came and mine eyes had seen it and behold
the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou
exceedest the fame that I heard
