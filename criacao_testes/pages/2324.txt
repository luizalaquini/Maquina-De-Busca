Defeated said Dany bristling

When cowards hide behind great walls it is they who are defeated Khaleesi Ko Jhogo said

Her other bloodriders concurred Blood of my blood said Rakharo when cowards hide and burn the food and fodder great khals must seek for braver foes This is known

It is known Jhiqui agreed as she poured

Not to me Dany set great store by Ser Jorah’s counsel but to leave Meereen untouched was more than she could stomach She could not forget the children on their posts the birds tearing at their entrails their skinny arms pointing up the coast road Ser Jorah you say we have no food left If I march west how can I feed my freedmen

You can’t I am sorry Khaleesi They must feed themselves or starve Many and more will die along the march yes That will be hard but there is no way to save them We need to put this scorched earth well behind us

Dany had left a trail of corpses behind her when she crossed the red waste It was a sight she never meant to see again No she said I will not march my people off to die My children There must be some way into this city

I know a way Brown Ben Plumm stroked his speckled grey-and-white beard Sewers

Sewers What do you mean

Great brick sewers empty into the Skahazadhan carrying the city’s wastes They might be a way in for a few That was how I escaped Meereen after Scarb lost his head Brown Ben made a face The smell has never left me I dream of it some nights

Ser Jorah looked dubious Easier to go out than in it would seem to me These sewers empty into the river you say That would mean the mouths are right below the walls

And closed with iron grates Brown Ben admitted though some have rusted through else I would have drowned in shit Once inside it is a long foul climb in pitch-dark through a maze of brick where a man could lose himself forever The filth is never lower than waist high and can rise over your head from the stains I saw on the walls There’s things down there too Biggest rats you ever saw and worse things Nasty

Daario Naharis laughed As nasty as you when you came crawling out If any man were fool enough to try this every slaver in Meereen would smell them the moment they emerged

Brown Ben shrugged Her Grace asked if there was a way in so I told her    but Ben Plumm isn’t going down in them sewers again not for all the gold in the Seven Kingdoms If there’s others want to try it though they’re welcome

Aggo Jhogo and Grey Worm all tried to speak at once but Dany raised her hand for silence These sewers do not sound promising Grey Worm would lead his Unsullied down the sewers if she commanded it she knew her bloodriders would do no less But none of them was suited to the task The Dothraki were horsemen and the strength of the Unsullied was their discipline on the battlefield Can I send men to die in the dark on such a slender hope I must think on this some more Return to your duties

Her captains bowed and left her with her handmaids and her dragons But as Brown Ben was leaving Viserion spread his pale white wings and flapped lazily at his head One of the wings buffeted the sellsword in his face The white dragon landed awkwardly with one foot on the man’s head and one on his shoulder shrieked and flew off again He likes you Ben said Dany

And well he might Brown Ben laughed I have me a drop of the dragon blood myself you know

You Dany was startled Plumm was a creature of the free companies an amiable mongrel He had a broad brown face with a broken nose and a head of nappy grey hair and his Dothraki mother had bequeathed him large dark almond-shaped eyes He claimed to be part Braavosi part Summer Islander part Ibbenese part Qohorik part Dothraki part Dornish and part Westerosi but this was the first she had heard of Targaryen blood She gave him a searching look and said How could that be

Well said Brown Ben there was some old Plumm in the Sunset Kingdoms who wed a dragon princess My grandmama told me the tale He lived in King Aegon’s day

Which King Aegon Dany asked Five Aegons have ruled in Westeros Her brother’s son would have been the sixth but the Usurper’s men had dashed his head against a wall

Five were there Well that’s a confusion I could not give you a number my queen This old Plumm was a lord though must have been a famous fellow in his day the talk of all the land The thing was begging your royal pardon he had himself a cock six foot long

The three bells in Dany’s braid tinkled when she laughed You mean inches I think

Feet Brown Ben said firmly If it was inches who’d want to talk about it now Your Grace

Dany giggled like a little girl Did your grandmother claim she’d actually seen this prodigy

That the old crone never did She was half-Ibbenese and half-Qohorik never been to Westeros my grandfather must have told her Some Dothraki killed him before I was born

And where did your grandfather’s knowledge come from

One of them tales told at the teat I’d guess Brown Ben shrugged That’s all I know about Aegon the Unnumbered or old Lord Plumm’s mighty manhood I fear I best see to my Sons

Go do that Dany told him

When Brown Ben left she lay back on her cushions If you were grown she told Drogon scratching him between the horns I’d fly you over the walls and melt that harpy down to slag But it would be years before her dragons were large enough to ride And when they are who shall ride them The dragon has three heads but I have only one She thought of Daario If ever there was a man who could rape a woman with his eyes   

To be sure she was just as guilty Dany found herself stealing looks at the Tyroshi when her captains came to council and sometimes at night she remembered the way his gold tooth glittered when he smiled That and his eyes His bright blue eyes On the road from Yunkai Daario had brought her a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when he made his report    to help her learn the land he said Waspwillow dusky roses wild mint lady’s lace daggerleaf broom prickly ben harpy’s gold    He tried to spare me the sight of the dead children too He should not have done that but he meant it kindly And Daario Naharis made her laugh which Ser Jorah never did

Dany tried to imagine what it would be like if she allowed Daario to kiss her the way Jorah had kissed her on the ship The thought was exciting and disturbing both at once It is too great a risk The Tyroshi sellsword was not a good man no one needed to tell her that Under the smiles and the jests he was dangerous even cruel Sallor and Prendahl had woken one morning as his partners that very night he’d given her their heads Khal Drogo could be cruel as well and there was never a man more dangerous She had come to love him all the same Could I love Daario What would it mean if I took him into my bed Would that make him one of the heads of the dragon Ser Jorah would be angry she knew but he was the one who’d said she had to take two husbands Perhaps I should marry them both and be done with it

But these were foolish thoughts She had a city to take and dreaming of kisses and some sellsword’s bright blue eyes would not help her breach the walls of Meereen I am the blood of the dragon Dany reminded herself Her thoughts were spinning in circles like a rat chasing its tail Suddenly she could not stand the close confines of the pavilion another moment I want to feel the wind on my face and smell the sea Missandei she called have my silver saddled Your own mount as well

The little scribe bowed As Your Grace commands Shall I summon your bloodriders to guard you

We’ll take Arstan I do not mean to leave the camps She had no enemies among her children And the old squire would not talk too much as Belwas would or look at her like Daario

The grove of burnt olive trees in which she’d raised her pavilion stood beside the sea between the Dothraki camp and that of the Unsullied When the horses had been saddled Dany and her companions set out along the shoreline away from the city Even so she could feel Meereen at her back mocking her When she looked over one shoulder there it stood the afternoon sun blazing off the bronze harpy atop the Great Pyramid Inside Meereen the slavers would soon be reclining in their fringed tokars to feast on lamb and olives unborn puppies honeyed dormice and other such delicacies whilst outside her children went hungry A sudden wild anger filled her I will bring you down she swore

As they rode past the stakes and pits that surrounded the eunuch encampment Dany could hear Grey Worm and his sergeants running one company through a series of drills with shield shortsword and heavy spear Another company was bathing in the sea clad only in white linen breechclouts The eunuchs were very clean she had noticed Some of her sellswords smelled as if they had not washed or changed their clothes since her father lost the Iron Throne but the Unsullied bathed each evening even if they’d marched all day When no water was available they cleansed themselves with sand the Dothraki way

The eunuchs knelt as she passed raising clenched fists to their breasts Dany returned the salute The tide was coming in and the surf foamed about the feet of her silver She could see her ships standing out to sea Balerion floated nearest the great cog once known as Saduleon her sails furled Further out were the galleys Meraxes and Vhagar formerly Joso’s Prank and Summer Sun They were Magister Illyrio’s ships in truth not hers at all and yet she had given them new names with hardly a thought Dragon names and more in old Valyria before the Doom Balerion Meraxes and Vhagar had been gods

South of the ordered realm of stakes pits drills and bathing eunuchs lay the encampments of her freedmen a far noisier and more chaotic place Dany had armed the former slaves as best she could with weapons from Astapor and Yunkai and Ser Jorah had organized the fighting men into four strong companies yet she saw no one drilling here They passed a driftwood fire where a hundred people had gathered to roast the carcass of a horse She could smell the meat and hear the fat sizzling as the spit boys turned but the sight only made her frown

Children ran behind their horses skipping and laughing Instead of salutes voices called to her on every side in a babble of tongues Some of the freedmen greeted her as Mother while others begged for boons or favors Some prayed for strange gods to bless her and some asked her to bless them instead She smiled at them turning right and left touching their hands when they raised them letting those who knelt reach up to touch her stirrup or her leg Many of the freedmen believed there was good fortune in her touch If it helps give them courage let them touch me she thought There are hard trials yet ahead   

Dany had stopped to speak to a pregnant woman who wanted the Mother of Dragons to name her baby when someone reached up and grabbed her left wrist Turning she glimpsed a tall ragged man with a shaved head and a sunburnt face Not so hard she started to say but before she could finish he’d yanked her bodily from the saddle The ground came up and knocked the breath from her as her silver whinnied and backed away Stunned Dany rolled to her side and pushed herself onto one elbow   

   and then she saw the sword

There’s the treacherous sow he said I knew you’d come to get your feet kissed one day His head was bald as a melon his nose red and peeling but she knew that voice and those pale green eyes I’m going to start by cutting off your teats Dany was dimly aware of Missandei shouting for help A freedman edged forward but only a step One quick slash and he was on his knees blood running down his face Mero wiped his sword on his breeches Who’s next

I am Arstan Whitebeard leapt from his horse and stood over her the salt wind riffling through his snowy hair both hands on his tall hardwood staff

Grandfather Mero said run off before I break your stick in two and bugger you with—

The old man feinted with one end of the staff pulled it back and whipped the other end about faster than Dany would have believed The Titan’s Bastard staggered back into the surf spitting blood and broken teeth from the ruin of his mouth Whitebeard put Dany behind him Mero slashed at his face The old man jerked back cat-quick The staff thumped Mero’s ribs sending him reeling Arstan splashed sideways parried a looping cut danced away from a second checked a third mid-swing The moves were so fast she could hardly follow Missandei was pulling Dany to her feet when she heard a crack She thought Arstan’s staff had snapped until she saw the jagged bone jutting from Mero’s calf As he fell the Titan’s Bastard twisted and lunged sending his point straight at the old man’s chest Whitebeard swept the blade aside almost contemptuously and smashed the other end of his staff against the big man’s temple Mero went sprawling blood bubbling from his mouth as the waves washed over him A moment later the freedmen washed over him too knives and stones and angry fists rising and falling in a frenzy

Dany turned away sickened She was more frightened now than when it had been happening He would have killed me

Your Grace Arstan knelt I am an old man and shamed He should never have gotten close enough to seize you I was lax I did not know him without his beard and hair

No more than I did Dany took a deep breath to stop her shaking Enemies everywhere Take me back to my tent Please

By the time Mormont arrived she was huddled in her lion pelt drinking a cup of spice wine I had a look at the river wall Ser Jorah started It’s a few feet higher than the others and just as strong And the Meereenese have a dozen fire hulks tied up beneath the ramparts—

She cut him off You might have warned me that the Titan’s Bastard had escaped
