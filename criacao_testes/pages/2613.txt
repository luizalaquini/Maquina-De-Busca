315 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD the LORD
raised them up a deliverer Ehud the son of Gera a Benjamite a man
lefthanded and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto
Eglon the king of Moab

316 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit
length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh

317 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab and Eglon was
a very fat man

318 And when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away
the people that bare the present

319 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
Gilgal and said I have a secret errand unto thee O king who said
Keep silence And all that stood by him went out from him

320 And Ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour
which he had for himself alone And Ehud said I have a message from
God unto thee

And he arose out of his seat

321 And Ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his
right thigh and thrust it into his belly 322 And the haft also went
in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he
could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out

323 Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the
parlour upon him and locked them

324 When he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that
behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said Surely he
covereth his feet in his summer chamber

325 And they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened
not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened
them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth

326 And Ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the
quarries and escaped unto Seirath

327 And it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in
the mountain of Ephraim and the children of Israel went down with him
from the mount and he before them

328 And he said unto them Follow after me for the LORD hath
delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand And they went down
after him and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab and suffered not
a man to pass over

329 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men all
lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man

330 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel And the
land had rest fourscore years

331 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered
Israel

41 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
LORD when Ehud was dead

42 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that
reigned in Hazor the captain of whose host was Sisera which dwelt in
Harosheth of the Gentiles

43 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD for he had nine
hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
children of Israel

44 And Deborah a prophetess the wife of Lapidoth she judged Israel
at that time

45 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
Bethel in mount Ephraim and the children of Israel came up to her for
judgment

46 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Kedeshnaphtali and said unto him Hath not the LORD God of Israel
commanded saying Go and draw toward mount Tabor and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun  47 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera
the captain of Jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and
I will deliver him into thine hand

48 And Barak said unto her If thou wilt go with me then I will go
but if thou wilt not go with me then I will not go

49 And she said I will surely go with thee notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the LORD
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman And Deborah arose and
went with Barak to Kedesh

410 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet and Deborah went up with him

411 Now Heber the Kenite which was of the children of Hobab the
