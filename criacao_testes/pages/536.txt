They chose to leave my protection Let them pray perhaps the gods will defend them Where’s my son

The castle gatehouse He wanted to command the crossbowmen There’s a mob howling outside half of them gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate

Bring him inside Maegor’s now

No Lancel was so angry he forgot to keep his voice down Heads turned toward them as he shouted We’ll have the Mud Gate all over again Let him stay where he is he’s the king—

He’s my son Cersei Lannister rose to her feet You claim to be a Lannister as well cousin prove it Osfryd why are you standing there Now means today

Osfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall his brother with him Many of the guests were rushing out as well Some of the women were weeping some praying Others simply remained at the tables and called for more wine Cersei Ser Lancel pleaded if we lose the castle Joffrey will be killed in any case you know that Let him stay I’ll keep him by me I swear—

Get out of my way Cersei slammed her open palm into his wound Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen swept from the room She spared Sansa not so much as a glance She’s forgotten me Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won’t even think about it

Oh gods an old woman wailed We’re lost the battle’s lost she’s running Several children were crying They can smell the fear Sansa found herself alone on the dais Should she stay here or run after the queen and plead for her life

She never knew why she got to her feet but she did Don’t be afraid she told them loudly The queen has raised the drawbridge This is the safest place in the city There’s thick walls the moat the spikes…

What’s happened demanded a woman she knew slightly the wife of a lesser lordling What did Osney tell her Is the king hurt has the city fallen

Tell us someone else shouted One woman asked about her father another her son

Sansa raised her hands for quiet Joffrey’s come back to the castle He’s not hurt They’re still fighting that’s all I know they’re fighting bravely The queen will be back soon The last was a lie but she had to soothe them She noticed the fools standing under the galley Moon Boy make us laugh

Moon Boy did a cartwheel and vaulted on top of a table He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them Every so often one of them would come down and smash him in the head A few nervous laughs echoed through the hall Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside him His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck him Madness he gasped Gods the Imp was right was right…

Help him Sansa commanded two of the serving men One just looked at her and ran flagon and all Other servants were leaving the hall as well but she could not help that Together Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet Take him to Maester Frenken Lancel was one of them yet somehow she still could not bring herself to wish him dead I am soft and weak and stupid just as Joffrey says I should be killing him not helping him

The torches had begun to burn low and one or two had flickered out No one troubled to replace them Cersei did not return Ser Dontos climbed the dais while all eyes were on the other fool Go back to your bedchamber sweet Jonquil he whispered Lock yourself in you’ll be safer there I’ll come for you when the battle’s done

Someone will come for me Sansa thought but will it be you or will it be Ser Ilyn For a mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend her He had been a knight too trained with the sword and sworn to defend the weak No He has not the courage or the skill I would only be killing him as well

It took all the strength she had in her to walk slowly from the Queen’s Ballroom when she wanted so badly to run When she reached the steps she did run up and around until she was breathless and dizzy One of the guards knocked into her on the stair A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he’d wrapped them in and went clattering down the steps He hurried after them paying Sansa no mind once he decided she was not going to try and take his loot

Her bedchamber was black as pitch Sansa barred the door and fumbled through the dark to the window When she ripped back the drapes her breath caught in her throat

The southern sky was aswirl with glowing shifting colors the reflections of the great fires that burned below Baleful green tides moved against the bellies of the clouds and pools of orange light spread out across the heavens The reds and yellows of common flame warred against the emeralds and jades of wildfire each color flaring and then fading birthing armies of short-lived shadows to die again an instant later Green dawns gave way to orange dusks in half a heartbeat The air itself smelled burnt the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if it was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away Embers drifted through the night air like swarms of fireflies

Sansa backed away from the window retreating toward the safety of her bed I’ll go to sleep she told herself and when I wake it will be a new day and the sky will be blue again The fighting will be done and someone will tell me whether I’m to live or die Lady she whimpered softly wondering if she would meet her wolf again when she was dead

Then something stirred behind her and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her wrist

Sansa opened her mouth to scream but another hand clamped down over her face smothering her His fingers were rough and callused and sticky with blood Little bird I knew you’d come The voice was a drunken rasp

Outside a swirling lance of jade light spit at the stars filling the room with green glare She saw him for a moment all black and green the blood on his face dark as tar his eyes glowing like a dog’s in the sudden glare Then the light faded and he was only a hulking darkness in a stained white cloak

If you scream I’ll kill you Believe that He took his hand from her mouth Her breath was coming ragged The Hound had a flagon of wine on her bedside table He took a long pull Don’t you want to ask who’s winning the battle little bird

Who she said too frightened to defy him

The Hound laughed I only know who’s lost Me

He is drunker than I’ve ever seen him He was sleeping in my bed What does he want here What have you lost
