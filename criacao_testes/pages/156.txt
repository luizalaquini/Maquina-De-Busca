This was something else poison in the dark a knife thrust to the soul This he could never forgive no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar He will kill them all Ned realized

And yet he knew he could not keep silent He had a duty to Robert to the realm to the shade of Jon Arryn… and to Bran who surely must have stumbled on some part of the truth Why else would they have tried to slay him

Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard the portly guardsman with the ginger-colored whiskers his children called Fat Tom With Jory dead and Alyn gone Fat Tom had command of his household guard The thought filled Ned with vague disquiet Tomard was a solid man affable loyal tireless capable in a limited way but he was near fifty and even in his youth he had never been energetic Perhaps Ned should not have been so quick to send off half his guard and all his best swords among them

I shall require your help Ned said when Tomard appeared looking faintly apprehensive as he always did when called before his lord Take me to the godswood

Is that wise Lord Eddard With your leg and all

Perhaps not But necessary

Tomard summoned Varly With one arm around each man’s shoulders Ned managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey I want the guard doubled he told Fat Tom No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave

Tom blinked M’lord with Alyn and the others away we are hard-pressed already—

It will only be a short while Lengthen the watches

As you say m’lord Tom answered Might I ask why—

Best not Ned answered crisply

The godswood was empty as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods Ned’s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree Thank you He drew a paper from his sleeve sealed with the sigil of his House Kindly deliver this at once

Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously My lord…

Do as I bid you Tom Ned said

How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood he could not say It was peaceful here The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle and he could hear birds singing the murmur of crickets leaves rustling in a gentle wind The heart tree was an oak brown and faceless yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods His leg did not seem to hurt so much

She came to him at sunset as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers She came alone as he had bid her For once she was dressed simply in leather boots and hunting greens When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak he saw the bruise where the king had struck her The angry plum color had faded to yellow and the swelling was down but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was

Why here Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him

So the gods can see

She sat beside him on the grass Her every move was graceful Her curling blond hair moved in the wind and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty but he saw it now I know the truth Jon Arryn died for he told her

Do you The queen watched his face wary as a cat Is that why you called me here Lord Stark To pose me riddles Or is it your intent to seize me as your wife seized my brother

If you truly believed that you would never have come Ned touched her cheek gently Has he done this before

Once or twice She shied away from his hand Never on the face before Jaime would have killed him even if it meant his own life Cersei looked at him defiantly My brother is worth a hundred of your friend

Your brother Ned said Or your lover

Both She did not flinch from the truth Since we were children together And why not The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years to keep the bloodlines pure And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We are one person in two bodies We shared a womb together He came into this world holding my foot our old maester said When he is in me I feel… whole The ghost of a smile flitted over her lips

My son Bran…

To her credit Cersei did not look away He saw us You love your children do you not

Robert had asked him the very same question the morning of the melee He gave her the same answer With all my heart
