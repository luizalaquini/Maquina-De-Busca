to be succeeded by a deep solemnity He looked out
of the window and regarded the dim outline of the trees
upon the sky and the twilight deepening to darkness
Then he went to a locked closet and took from
a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of
a pilibox and was about to put it into his pocket But
he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary
glance inside It contained a womans finger-ring set
all the way round with small

diamonds and from its
appearance had evidently been recently purchased
Boldwoods eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long
time though that its material aspect concerned him
little was plain from his manner and mien which were
those of a mind following out the presumed thread of
that jewels future history
The noise of wheels at the front of the house became
audible Boldwood closed the box stowed it away
carefully in his pocket and went out upon the landing
The old man who was his indoor factotum came at the
same moment to the foot of the stairs
They be coming sir-iots of em -- a-foot and a+
driving
I was coming down this moment Those wheels I
heard -- is it Mrs Troy
No sir -- tis not she yet
A reserved and sombre expression had returned to
Boldwoods face again but it poorly cloaked his feei
ings when he pronounced Bathshebas name and his
feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a
galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh
as he went down the stairs

How does this cover me said Troy to Pennyways
Nobody would recognize me now Im sure
He was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of
Noachian cut with cape and high collar the latter being
erect and rigid like a girdling wall and nearly reaching
to the verge of travelling cap which was pulled down
over his ears
Pennyways snuffed the candle and then looked up
and deliberately inspected Troy
Youve made up your mind to go then he
said
Made up my mind Yes of course I have
Why not write to her Tis a very queer corner
that you have got into sergeant You see all these things
will come to light if you go back and they wont sound
well at all Faith if I was you Id even bide as you be
 -- a single man of the name of Francis A good wife is
good but the best wife is not so good
P 427
as no wife at all
Now thats my outspoke mind and Ive been called a
long-headed feller here and there
All nonsense said Troy angrily There she is
with plenty of money and a house and farm and
horses and comfort and here am I living from hand to
mouth -- a needy adventurer Besides it is no use
talking now it is too late and I am glad of it  Ive been
seen and recognized here this very afternoon I should
have gone back to her the day after the fair if it hadnt
been for you talking about the law and rubbish about
getting a separation and I dont put it off any longer
What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all
I cant think Humbugging sentiment -- thats what it
was But what man on earth was to know that his wife
would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name
I should have known it Shes bad enough for
anything
Pennyways mind who you are talking to
Well sergeant all I say is this that if I were you Id
go abroad again where I came from -- tisnt too late to do
it now I wouldnt stir up the business and get a bad
name for the sake of living with her -- for all that about
your play-acting is sure to come out you know although
you think otherwise My eyes and limbs therell be a
racket if you go back just now -- in the middle of Bold+
woods Christmasing
Hm yes I expect I shall not be a very welcome
guest if he has her there said the sergeant with a slight
laugh A sort of Alonzo the Brave and when I go in
the guests will sit in silence and fear and all laughter
and pleasure will be hushed and the lights in the
chamber burn blue and the worms -- Ugh horrible --
Ring for some more brandy Pennyways I felt an
awful shudder just then Well what is there besides
A stick-i must have a walking-stick
Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a
difficulty for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon+
ciled it would be necessary to regain her good opinion
if he would secure the patronage of her husband I
sometimes think she likes you yet and is a good woman
at bottom he said as a saving sentence But theres
no telling to a certainty from a bodys outside Well
P 428
youll do as you like about going of course sergeant
and as for me Ill do as you tell me
Now let me see what the time is said Troy after
