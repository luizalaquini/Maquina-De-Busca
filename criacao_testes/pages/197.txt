Tyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland but he was never given the chance The door banged open again The messenger gave Tyrion’s clansmen a quick queer look as he dropped to one knee before Lord Tywin My lord he said Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway

Lord Tywin Lannister did not smile Lord Tywin never smiled but Tyrion had learned to read his father’s pleasure all the same and it was there on his face So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions he said in a voice of quiet satisfaction Splendid Return to Ser Addam and tell him to fall back He is not to engage the northerners until we arrive but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south

It will be as you command The rider took his leave

We are well situated here Ser Kevan pointed out Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes If they are coming south I say let them come and break themselves against us

The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers Lord Tywin replied The sooner the Starks are broken the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon Tell the drummers to beat assembly and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark

As you will Ser Kevan said

Tyrion watched with a grim fascination as his lord father turned next to the half-wild clansmen It is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear

It is said truly Conn of the Stone Crows answered

And the women Chella added

Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more Lord Tywin told them

Would you pay us with our own coin Ulf son of Umar said Why should we need the father’s promise when we have the son’s

I said nothing of need Lord Tywin replied My words were courtesy nothing more You need not join us The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice and even my boldest knights fear to face them

Oh deftly done Tyrion thought smiling crookedly

The Burned Men fear nothing Timett son of Timett will ride with the lions

Wherever the Burned Men go the Stone Crows have been there first Conn declared hotly We ride as well

Shagga son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed them to the crows

We will ride with you lion lord Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed but only if your halfman son goes with us He has bought his breath with promises Until we hold the steel he has pledged us his life is ours

Lord Tywin turned his gold-flecked eyes on his son

Joy Tyrion said with a resigned smile





SANSA

The walls of the throne room had been stripped bare the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap

Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard Sansa hovered by the door for once unguarded The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good yet even so she was escorted everywhere she went Honor guards for my daughter-to-be the queen called them but they did not make Sansa feel honored

Freedom of the castle meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give She couldn’t have gone beyond the walls anyway The gates were watched day and night by Janos Slynt’s gold cloaks and Lannister house guards were always about as well Besides even if she could leave the castle where would she go It was enough that she could walk in the yard pick flowers in Myrcella’s garden and visit the sept to pray for her father Sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well since the Starks kept the old gods

This was the first court session of Joffrey’s reign so Sansa looked about nervously A line of Lannister house guards stood beneath the western windows a line of gold-cloaked City Watchmen beneath the east Of smallfolk and commoners she saw no sign but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly There were no more than twenty where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon King Robert

Sansa slipped in among them murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho gloomy Ser Aron Santagar the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber… only none of them seemed to recognize her Or if they did they shied away as if she had the grey plague Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away
