up to Bethhoron and smote them to Azekah and unto Makkedah

1011 And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were
in the going down to Bethhoron that the LORD cast down great stones
from heaven upon them unto Azekah and they died they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with
the sword

1012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
up the Amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the
sight of Israel Sun stand thou still upon Gibeon and thou Moon in
the valley of Ajalon

1013 And the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies Is not this written in the
book of Jasher So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and
hasted not to go down about a whole day

1014 And there was no day like that before it or after it that the
LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man for the LORD fought for
Israel

1015 And Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to
Gilgal

1016 But these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at
Makkedah

1017 And it was told Joshua saying The five kings are found hid in
a cave at Makkedah

1018 And Joshua said Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave
and set men by it for to keep them 1019 And stay ye not but pursue
after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to
enter into their cities for the LORD your God hath delivered them
into your hand

1020 And it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had
made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they
were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into
fenced cities

1021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel

1022 Then said Joshua Open the mouth of the cave and bring out
those five kings unto me out of the cave

1023 And they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out
of the cave the king of Jerusalem the king of Hebron the king of
Jarmuth the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon

1024 And it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto
Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto
the captains of the men of war which went with him Come near put
your feet upon the necks of these kings And they came near and put
their feet upon the necks of them

1025 And Joshua said unto them Fear not nor be dismayed be strong
and of good courage for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies
against whom ye fight

1026 And afterward Joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them
on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening

1027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun
that Joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast
them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in
the caves mouth which remain until this very day

1028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of
the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all
the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the
king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho

1029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah and all Israel with him unto
Libnah and fought against Libnah 1030 And the LORD delivered it
also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel and he smote it
with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he
let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto
the king of Jericho

1031 And Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him unto
Lachish and encamped against it and fought against it 1032 And the
LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel which took it on the
second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls
that were therein according to all that he had done to Libnah

1033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua
smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining

1034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon and all Israel with
him and they encamped against it and fought against it 1035 And
they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and
all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day
according to all that he had done to Lachish

1036 And Joshua went up from Eglon and all Israel with him unto
Hebron and they fought against it 1037 And they took it and smote
it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the
