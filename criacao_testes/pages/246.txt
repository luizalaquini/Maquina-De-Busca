Ser Kevan frowned over the map forehead creasing Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now Their combined power may exceed our own And with Roose Bolton behind us… Tywin if we remain here I fear we might be caught between three armies

I have no intention of remaining here We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden Bolton does not concern me He is a wary man and we made him warier on the Green Fork He will be slow to give pursuit So… on the morrow we make for Harrenhal Kevan I want Ser Addam’s outriders to screen our movements Give him as many men as he requires and send them out in groups of four I will have no vanishings

As you say my lord but… why Harrenhal That is a grim unlucky place Some call it cursed

Let them Lord Tywin said Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well and Ser Amory Lorch Each is to have three hundred horse Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork

They will burn my lord Ser Kevan said rising I shall give the commands He bowed and made for the door

When they were alone Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion Your savages might relish a bit of rapine Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like—goods stock women they may take what they want and burn the rest

Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow Tyrion commented but I should prefer to keep them with me Uncouth and unruly they might be yet the wildlings were his and he trusted them more than any of his father’s men He was not about to hand them over

Then you had best learn to control them I will not have the city plundered

The city Tyrion was lost What city would that be

King’s Landing I am sending you to court

It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated

He reached for his wine and considered for a moment as he sipped And what am I to do there

Rule his father said curtly

Tyrion hooted with laughter My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that

Let her say what she likes Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all I blame those jackanapes on the council—our friend Petyr the venerable Grand Maester and that cockless wonder Lord Varys What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord The man’s father was a butcher and they grant him Harrenhal Harrenhal that was the seat of kings Not that he will ever set foot inside it if I have a say I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil A bloody cleaver would have been my choice His father had not raised his voice yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes And dismissing Selmy where was the sense in that Yes the man was old but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm He lent honor to any man he served Can anyone say the same of the Hound You feed your dog bones under the table you do not seat him beside you on the high bench He pointed a finger at Tyrion’s face If Cersei cannot curb the boy you must And if these councillors are playing us false…

Tyrion knew Spikes he sighed Heads Walls

I see you have taken a few lessons from me

More than you know Father Tyrion answered quietly He finished his wine and set the cup aside thoughtful A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit Another part was remembering the battle upriver and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again Why me he asked cocking his head to one side Why not my uncle Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett Why not a… bigger man

Lord Tywin rose abruptly You are my son

That was when he knew You have given him up for lost he thought You bloody bastard you think Jaime’s good as dead so I’m all you have left Tyrion wanted to slap him to spit in his face to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold the way the smallfolks said Yet he sat there silent and still

The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father’s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room One last thing he said at the door You will not take the whore to court

Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower The ceiling was low but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf From the window he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard The innkeep’s body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes

Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast and her eyes opened M’lord she said with a drowsy smile

When he felt her nipple stiffen Tyrion kissed her I have a mind to take you to King’s Landing sweetling he whispered
