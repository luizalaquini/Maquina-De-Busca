He begs you attend this carefully Your Grace

Kraznys moved to the next eunuch in line a towering youth with the blue eyes and flaxen hair of Lys Your sword he said The eunuch knelt unsheathed the blade and offered it up hilt first It was a shortsword made more for stabbing than for slashing but the edge looked razor-sharp Stand Kraznys commanded

Your worship The eunuch stood and Kraznys mo Nakloz slid the sword slowly up his torso leaving a thin red line across his belly and between his ribs Then he jabbed the swordpoint in beneath a wide pink nipple and began to work it back and forth

What is he doing Dany demanded of the girl as the blood ran down the man’s chest

Tell the cow to stop her bleating said Kraznys without waiting for the translation This will do him no great harm Men have no need of nipples eunuchs even less so The nipple hung by a thread of skin He slashed and sent it tumbling to the bricks leaving behind a round red eye copiously weeping blood The eunuch did not move until Kraznys offered him back his sword hilt first Here I’m done with you

This one is pleased to have served you

Kraznys turned back to Dany They feel no pain you see

How can that be she demanded through the scribe

The wine of courage was the answer he gave her It is no true wine at all but made from deadly nightshade bloodfly larva black lotus root and many secret things They drink it with every meal from the day they are cut and with each passing year feel less and less It makes them fearless in battle Nor can they be tortured Tell the savage her secrets are safe with the Unsullied She may set them to guard her councils and even her bedchamber and never a worry as to what they might overhear

In Yunkai and Meereen eunuchs are often made by removing a boy’s testicles but leaving the penis Such a creature is infertile yet often still capable of erection Only trouble can come of this We remove the penis as well leaving nothing The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth He gave Dany and Arstan another of his broad white smiles I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children but live only for their duty Is it not so

It is Arstan said when the question was put There are many such orders The maesters of the Citadel the septons and septas who serve the Seven the silent sisters of the dead the Kingsguard and the Night’s Watch…

Poor things growled the slaver after the translation Men were not made to live thus Their days are a torment of temptation any fool must see and no doubt most succumb to their baser selves Not so our Unsullied They are wed to their swords in a way that your Sworn Brothers cannot hope to match No woman can ever tempt them nor any man

His girl conveyed the essence of his speech more politely There are other ways to tempt men besides the flesh Arstan Whitebeard objected when she was done

Men yes but not Unsullied Plunder interests them no more than rape They own nothing but their weapons We do not even permit them names

No names Dany frowned at the little scribe Can that be what the Good Master said They have no names

It is so Your Grace

Kraznys stopped in front of a Ghiscari who might have been his taller fitter brother and flicked his lash at a small bronze disk on the swordbelt at his feet There is his name Ask the whore of Westeros whether she can read Ghiscari glyphs When Dany admitted that she could not the slaver turned to the Unsullied What is your name he demanded

This one’s name is Red Flea your worship

The girl repeated their exchange in the Common Tongue

And yesterday what was it

Black Rat your worship

The day before

Brown Flea your worship

Before that

This one does not recall your worship Blue Toad perhaps Or Blue Worm

Tell her all their names are such Kraznys commanded the girl It reminds them that by themselves they are vermin The name disks are thrown in an empty cask at duty’s end and each dawn plucked up again at random

More madness said Arstan when he heard How can any man possibly remember a new name every day
