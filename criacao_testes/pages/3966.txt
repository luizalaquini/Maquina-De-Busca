Gale shrugs I know he was desperate That makes
people do all kinds of crazy things
I cant help thinking thats directed at me
Bright and early the next morning the brains assemble
to take on the problem of the Nut Im asked to the meeting
although I dont have much to contribute I avoid the
conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has
a view of the mountain in question The commander from 2
a middle-aged woman named Lyme takes us on a virtual
tour of the Nut its interior and fortifications and recounts
the failed attempts to seize it Ive crossed paths with her
briefly a couple of times since my arrival and was dogged
by the feeling Id met her before Shes memorable enough
standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled But its only
when I see a clip of her in the field leading a raid on the
main entrance of the Nut that something clicks and I realize
Im in the presence of another victor Lyme the tribute from
District 2 who won her Hunger Games over a generation
ago Effie sent us her tape among others to prepare for
the Quarter Quell Ive probably caught glimpses of her
during the Games over the years but shes kept a low
profile With my newfound knowledge of Haymitchs and
Finnicks treatment all I can think is What did the Capitol
do to her after she won
When Lyme finishes the presentation the questions
from the brains begin Hours pass and lunch comes and
goes as they try to come up with a realistic plan for taking
the Nut But while Beetee thinks he might be able to
override certain computer systems and theres some
discussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use no
one has any really innovative thoughts As the afternoon
wears on talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been
tried repeatedly--the storming of the entrances I can see
Lymes frustration building because so many variations of
this plan have already failed so many of her soldiers have
been lost Finally she bursts out The next person who
suggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant way
to do it because youre going to be the one leading that
mission
Gale who is too restless to sit at the table for more
than a few hours has been alternating between pacing and
sharing my windowsill Early on he seemed to accept
Lymes assertion that the entrances couldnt be taken and
dropped out of the conversation entirely For the last hour or
so hes sat quietly his brow knitted in concentration
staring at the Nut through the window glass In the silence
that follows Lymes ultimatum he speaks up Is it really so
necessary that we take the Nut Or would it be enough to
disable it
That would be a step in the right direction says
Beetee What do you have in mind
Think of it as a wild dog den Gale continues Youre
not going to fight your way in So you have two choices
Trap the dogs inside or flush them out
Weve tried bombing the entrances says Lyme
Theyre set too far inside the stone for any real damage to
be done
I wasnt thinking of that says Gale I was thinking of
using the mountain Beetee rises and joins Gale at the
window peering through his ill-fitting glasses See
Running down the sides
Avalanche paths says Beetee under his breath Itd
be tricky Wed have to design the detonation sequence
with great care and once its in motion we couldnt hope to
control it
We dont need to control it if we give up the idea that
we have to possess the Nut says Gale Only shut it
down
So youre suggesting we start avalanches and block
the entrances asks Lyme
Thats it says Gale Trap the enemy inside cut off
from supplies Make it impossible for them to send out their
hovercraft
While everyone considers the plan Boggs flips
through a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns You
risk killing everyone inside Look at the ventilation system
Its rudimentary at best Nothing like what we have in
Thirteen It depends entirely on pumping in air from the
mountainsides Block those vents and youll suffocate
whoever is trapped
They could still escape through the train tunnel to the
square says Beetee
Not if we blow it up says Gale brusquely His intent
his full intent becomes clear Gale has no interest in
preserving the lives of those in the Nut No interest in
caging the prey for later use
This is one of his death traps

The implications of what Gale is suggesting settle
quietly around the room You can see the reaction playing
out on peoples faces The expressions range from
pleasure to distress from sorrow to satisfaction
The majority of the workers are citizens from Two
says Beetee neutrally
So what says Gale Well never be able to trust
them again
They should at least have a chance to surrender
says Lyme
Well thats a luxury we werent given when they firebombed
Twelve but youre all so much cozier with the
