4423 Sing O ye heavens for the LORD hath done it shout ye lower
parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains O forest
and every tree therein for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob and
glorified himself in Israel

4424 Thus saith the LORD thy redeemer and he that formed thee from
the womb I am the LORD that maketh all things that stretcheth forth
the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself 4425
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad
that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish
4426 That confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the
counsel of his messengers that saith to Jerusalem Thou shalt be
inhabited and to the cities of Judah Ye shall be built and I will
raise up the decayed places thereof 4427 That saith to the deep Be
dry and I will dry up thy rivers 4428 That saith of Cyrus He is my
shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem
Thou shalt be built and to the temple Thy foundation shall be laid

451 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I
have holden to subdue nations before him and I will loose the loins
of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall
not be shut 452 I will go before thee and make the crooked places
straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder
the bars of iron 453 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness
and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the
LORD which call thee by thy name am the God of Israel

454 For Jacob my servants sake and Israel mine elect I have even
called thee by thy name I have surnamed thee though thou hast not
known me

455 I am the LORD and there is none else there is no God beside me
I girded thee though thou hast not known me 456 That they may know
from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none
beside me I am the LORD and there is none else

457 I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create
evil I the LORD do all these things

458 Drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down
righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation
and let righteousness spring up together I the LORD have created it

459 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker Let the potsherd
strive with the potsherds of the earth Shall the clay say to him that
fashioneth it What makest thou or thy work He hath no hands  4510
Woe unto him that saith unto his father What begettest thou or to
the woman What hast thou brought forth  4511 Thus saith the LORD
the Holy One of Israel and his Maker Ask me of things to come
concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me

4512 I have made the earth and created man upon it I even my
hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have I
commanded

4513 I have raised him up in righteousness and I will direct all his
ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for
price nor reward saith the LORD of hosts

4514 Thus saith the LORD The labour of Egypt and merchandise of
Ethiopia and of the Sabeans men of stature shall come over unto
thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains
they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall
make supplication unto thee saying Surely God is in thee and there
is none else there is no God

4515 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself O God of Israel the
Saviour

4516 They shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they
shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols

4517 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end

4518 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens God himself
that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created
it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the LORD and there
is none else

4519 I have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth I
said not unto the seed of Jacob Seek ye me in vain I the LORD speak
righteousness I declare things that are right

4520 Assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are
escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of
their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save

4521 Tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel
together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it
from that time  have not I the LORD and there is no God else beside
me a just God and a Saviour there is none beside me

4522 Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for I
am God and there is none else

4523 I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in
righteousness and shall not return That unto me every knee shall
bow every tongue shall swear
