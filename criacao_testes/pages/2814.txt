of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned
with fire

14 And it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and
wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God
of heaven 15 And said I beseech thee O LORD God of heaven the
great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments 16 Let thine ear now be
attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of
thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the
children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children
of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my fathers
house have sinned

17 We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the
commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou
commandedst thy servant Moses

18 Remember I beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy
servant Moses saying If ye transgress I will scatter you abroad
among the nations 19 But if ye turn unto me and keep my
commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the heaven yet will I gather them from thence and
will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name
there

110 Now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand

111 O LORD I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire
to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and
grant him mercy in the sight of this man For I was the kings
cupbearer

21 And it came to pass in the month Nisan in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine
and gave it unto the king Now I had not been beforetime sad in his
presence

22 Wherefore the king said unto me Why is thy countenance sad
seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart
Then I was very sore afraid 23 And said unto the king Let the king
live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city
the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates
thereof are consumed with fire  24 Then the king said unto me For
what dost thou make request So I prayed to the God of heaven

25 And I said unto the king If it please the king and if thy
servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me
unto Judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that I may build
it

26 And the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him For
how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return So it
pleased the king to send me and I set him a time

27 Moreover I said unto the king If it please the king let letters
be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me
over till I come into Judah 28 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of
the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall
of the city and for the house that I shall enter into And the king
granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me

29 Then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the
kings letters Now the king had sent captains of the army and
horsemen with me

210 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the
Ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come
a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel

211 So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days

212 And I arose in the night I and some few men with me neither
told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem
neither was there any beast with me save the beast that I rode upon

213 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley even before
the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of
Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed
with fire

214 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kings
pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass

215 Then went I up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall
and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so
returned

216 And the rulers knew not whither I went or what I did neither
had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the
nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work

217 Then said I unto them Ye see the distress that we are in how
Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire
come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a
reproach
