They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery with Maester Luwin following behind hurrying to keep up with the stableboy’s long strides

Robb was seated in Father’s high seat wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants and four strangers in the black of the Night’s Watch Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor carried him through the doors

Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord His sword was across his knees the steel bare for all the world to see Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword

Any man of the Night’s Watch the dwarf repeated but not me do I take your meaning boy

Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword I am the lord here while my mother and father are away Lannister I am not your boy

If you are a lord you might learn a lord’s courtesy the little man replied ignoring the sword point in his face Your bastard brother has all your father’s graces it would seem

Jon Bran gasped out from Hodor’s arms

The dwarf turned to look at him So it is true the boy lives I could scarce believe it You Starks are hard to kill

You Lannisters had best remember that Robb said lowering his sword Hodor bring my brother here

Hodor Hodor said and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North The seat was cold stone polished smooth by countless bottoms the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms Bran clasped them as he sat his useless legs dangling The great seat made him feel half a baby

Robb put a hand on his shoulder You said you had business with Bran Well here he is Lannister

Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister’s eyes One was black and one was green and both were looking at him studying him weighing him I am told you were quite the climber Bran the little man said at last Tell me how is it you happened to fall that day

I never Bran insisted He never fell never never never

The child does not remember anything of the fall or the climb that came before it said Maester Luwin gently

Curious said Tyrion Lannister

My brother is not here to answer questions Lannister Robb said curtly Do your business and be on your way

I have a gift for you the dwarf said to Bran Do you like to ride boy

Maester Luwin came forward My lord the child has lost the use of his legs He cannot sit a horse

Nonsense said Lannister With the right horse and the right saddle even a cripple can ride

The word was a knife through Bran’s heart He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes I’m not a cripple

Then I am not a dwarf the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth My father will rejoice to hear it Greyjoy laughed

What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting Maester Luwin asked

A smart horse Lannister replied The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal so you must shape the horse to the rider teach it to respond to the reins to the voice I would begin with an unbroken yearling with no old training to be unlearned He drew a rolled paper from his belt Give this to your saddler He will provide the rest

Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand curious as a small grey squirrel He unrolled it studied it I see You draw nicely my lord Yes this ought to work I should have thought of this myself

It came easier to me Maester It is not terribly unlike my own saddles

Will I truly be able to ride Bran asked He wanted to believe them but he was afraid Perhaps it was just another lie The crow had promised him that he could fly

You will the dwarf told him And I swear to you boy on horseback you will be as tall as any of them
