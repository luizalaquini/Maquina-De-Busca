month Abib for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt

3419 All that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among
thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male

3420 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and
if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck All the
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem And none shall appear before
me empty

3421 Six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt
rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest

3422 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of
wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years end

3423 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
LORD God the God of Israel

3424 For I will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy
borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up
to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year

3425 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto
the morning

3426 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
the house of the LORD thy God Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mothers milk

3427 And the LORD said unto Moses Write thou these words for after
the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with
Israel

3428 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights he
did neither eat bread nor drink water And he wrote upon the tables
the words of the covenant the ten commandments

3429 And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai with
the two tables of testimony in Moses hand when he came down from the
mount that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him

3430 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold
the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him

3431 And Moses called unto them and Aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with them

3432 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave
them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount
Sinai

3433 And till Moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his
face

3434 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him he
took the vail off until he came out And he came out and spake unto
the children of Israel that which he was commanded

3435 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin
of Moses face shone and Moses put the vail upon his face again
until he went in to speak with him

351 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
together and said unto them These are the words which the LORD hath
commanded that ye should do them

352 Six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the LORD whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to death

353 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
sabbath day

354 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
Israel saying This is the thing which the LORD commanded saying
355 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD whosoever is of
a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the LORD gold and
silver and brass 356 And blue and purple and scarlet and fine
linen and goats hair 357 And rams skins dyed red and badgers
skins and shittim wood 358 And oil for the light and spices for
anointing oil and for the sweet incense 359 And onyx stones and
stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate

3510 And every wise hearted among you shall come and make all that
the LORD hath commanded 3511 The tabernacle his tent and his
covering his taches and his boards his bars his pillars and his
sockets 3512 The ark and the staves thereof with the mercy seat
and the vail of the covering 3513 The table and his staves and all

light and his furniture and his lamps with the oil for the light
3515 And the incense altar and his staves and the anointing oil
and the sweet incense and the hanging for the door at the entering in
