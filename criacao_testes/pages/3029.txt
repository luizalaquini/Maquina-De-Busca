them return unto thee but return not thou unto them

1520 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and
they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against
thee for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the
LORD

1521 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and I
will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible

161 The word of the LORD came also unto me saying 162 Thou shalt
not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in
this place

163 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers
that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this
land 164 They shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be
lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon
the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by
famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and
for the beasts of the earth

165 For thus saith the LORD Enter not into the house of mourning
neither go to lament nor bemoan them for I have taken away my peace
from this people saith the LORD even lovingkindness and mercies

166 Both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall
not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves
nor make themselves bald for them 167 Neither shall men tear
themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither
shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father
or for their mother

168 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with
them to eat and to drink

169 For thus saith the LORD of hosts the God of Israel Behold I
will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days
the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride

1610 And it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all
these words and they shall say unto thee Wherefore hath the LORD
pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or
what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God
1611 Then shalt thou say unto them Because your fathers have
forsaken me saith the LORD and have walked after other gods and
have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and
have not kept my law 1612 And ye have done worse than your fathers
for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil
heart that they may not hearken unto me 1613 Therefore will I cast
you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your
fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where I
will not shew you favour

1614 Therefore behold the days come saith the LORD that it shall
no more be said The LORD liveth that brought up the children of
Israel out of the land of Egypt 1615 But The LORD liveth that
brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from
all the lands whither he had driven them and I will bring them again
into their land that I gave unto their fathers

1616 Behold I will send for many fishers saith the LORD and they
shall fish them and after will I send for many hunters and they
shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of
the holes of the rocks

1617 For mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my
face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes

1618 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double
because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance
with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things

1619 O LORD my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day
of affliction the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the
earth and shall say Surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity
and things wherein there is no profit

1620 Shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods  1621
Therefore behold I will this once cause them to know I will cause
them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name
is The LORD

171 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron and with the
point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and
upon the horns of your altars 172 Whilst their children remember
their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills

173 O my mountain in the field I will give thy substance and all thy
treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all
thy borders

174 And thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage
that I gave thee and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the
land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger
which shall burn for ever

175 Thus saith the LORD Cursed be the man that trusteth in man and
