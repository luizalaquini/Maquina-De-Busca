obtained at the point of resonance em that is
65 dB above the DC value  This is enough
to tax most analogue implementations and can evoke clipping in the formant
filters with a very noticeable effect on speech quality  This
extreme case will not occur during synthesis of realistic speech for
although the formant
ul
ranges
overlap the values for any particular human sound will not coincide exactly  However
it illustrates the difficulty of designing a series synthesizer which copes
sensibly with arbitrary parameter settings and explains why designers often
choose formant bandwidths in the top half of the ranges given in Table 51
pp
The problem of excessive amplification within a series synthesizer can be
alleviated to a small extent by choosing carefully the order in which the
filters are placed in the chain  In a linear system of course the order in
which the components occur does not matter
In physical implementations however it is advantageous to minimize extreme
amplification at intermediate points  By placing the formant 1 filter between
formants 2 and 3 the formant 2 resonance is attenuated somewhat before it
reaches formant 3  Continuing with the extreme example above where both
formants 2 and 3 were set to 2500 Hz assume that formant 1 is at its
nominal value of 500 Hz  It provides attenuation at approximately 12 dBoctave
above this and so at the formant 2 peak 23 octaves higher the attenuation
is 28 dB  Thus the gain at 2500 Hz
which is 20  log sub 10  250050  =  34 dB after
passing through the formant 2 filter is reduced to 6 dB by formant 1 only
to be increased by 20  log sub 10  250070  =  31 dB to
a value of 37 dB by formant 3
This avoids the extreme 65 dB gain of formants 2 and 3 combined
pp
Figure 58 shows only three formant filters modelled explicitly
The effect of the rest em and they do have an effect although it is small
at low frequencies em is
incorporated by lumping them together into the higher-formant correction filter
To calculate the characteristics of this filter assume that the lumped
formants have the values given by the simple uniform-tube model of Chapter 2
namely 3500 Hz for formant 4 4500 Hz for formant 5 and in general
5002n-1 Hz for formant n  The effect of each of these on the spectrum is

following from what was calculated above
We will have to approximate this by assuming that
b sub n sup 2 w sub n sup 2 is
negligible em this is quite reasonable for these higher formants because
Table 51 shows that the bandwidth does not increase in proportion to the
formant frequency range em and approximate the logarithm by the first
term of its series expansion

Although this may at first seem to be a rather small correction
it is in fact 72 dB when
f=5 kHz  On further reflection this is not an unreasonable figure for the
12 dBoctave decays contributed by formants 1 2 and 3 must all be annihilated
by the higher-formant correction to give an overall flat spectral trend
In fact formant 1 will contribute
12 dBoctave from 500 Hz 33 octaves to 5 kHz representing 40 dB formant
2 will contribute 12 dBoctave from 1500 Hz 17 octaves to 5 kHz representing
