computational advantages over the other two methods
However the four-multiplier structure behaves substantially better
in finite word-length implementations  It is easy to show that with this

em a relationship which suggests that the energy in the
the input signals namely  X sup + and Y sup -  is preserved in the output
signals  X sup - and Y sup +
Notice that care must be taken with the z-transforms since squaring is a
non-linear operation  z sup -1 Y sup -  sup 2  means the square of
the previous value of  Y sup -  which is not the same
as  z sup -2 Y sup -  sup 2

It has been shown Gray and Markel 1975 that the four-multiplier
configuration has some stability properties which are not shared by other
digital filter structures

Gray Markel 1975 Normalized digital filter structure

When a linear predictive filter is used for synthesis the parameters
of the filter em the k-parameters in the case of lattice filters
and the a-parameters in the case of direct ones em change with time
It is usually rather difficult to guarantee stability in the case of
time-varying filter parameters but some guarantees can be made for a
chain of four-multiplier lattices  Furthermore if the input is a
discrete delta function the cumulative energies at each stage of the
lattice are the same and so maximum dynamic range will be achieved
for the whole filter if each section is implemented with the same
word size
rh Lattice analysis
It is quite easy to construct a filter which is inverse to
a single-stage lattice
The structure of Figure 612a does the job

Notice that this is exactly the same as the transfer function of the
synthesis lattice of Figure 69 which is reproduced

Hence if the filters of Figures 612a and b were connected together
as shown by the dashed lines they
would cancel each other out and the overall transfer would be unity

Actually such a connection is not possible in physical terms
for although the upper paths can be joined together the lower ones can not
The right-hand lower point of Figure 612a is an

terminal and so is the left-hand lower one of Figure 612b  However
there is no need to envisage a physical connection of the lower paths
It is sufficient for cancellation just to assume that the signals at both
of the points turn out to be the same
