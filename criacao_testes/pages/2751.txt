went to mount Seir having for their captains Pelatiah and Neariah
and Rephaiah and Uzziel the sons of Ishi

443 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped and
dwelt there unto this day

51 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel for he was the
firstborn but forasmuch as he defiled his fathers bed his
birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel and
the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright

52 For Judah prevailed above his brethren and of him came the chief
ruler but the birthright was Josephs 53 The sons I say of
Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu Hezron and
Carmi

generations was reckoned were the chief Jeiel and Zechariah 58
And Bela the son of Azaz the son of Shema the son of Joel who dwelt
in Aroer even unto Nebo and Baalmeon 59 And eastward he inhabited
unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates
because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead

510 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites who
fell by their hand and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the
east land of Gilead

511 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them in the land of
Bashan unto Salcah 512 Joel the chief and Shapham the next and
Jaanai and Shaphat in Bashan

513 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were Michael
and Meshullam and Sheba and Jorai and Jachan and Zia and Heber

514 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri the son of
Jaroah the son of Gilead the son of Michael the son of Jeshishai

of Guni chief of the house of their fathers

516 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan and in her towns and in all
the suburbs of Sharon upon their borders

517 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king
of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel

518 The sons of Reuben and the Gadites and half the tribe of
Manasseh of valiant men men able to bear buckler and sword and to
shoot with bow and skilful in war were four and forty thousand seven
hundred and threescore that went out to the war

519 And they made war with the Hagarites with Jetur and Nephish
and Nodab

520 And they were helped against them and the Hagarites were
delivered into their hand and all that were with them for they cried
to God in the battle and he was intreated of them because they put
their trust in him

521 And they took away their cattle of their camels fifty thousand
and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand and of asses two
thousand and of men an hundred thousand

522 For there fell down many slain because the war was of God And
they dwelt in their steads until the captivity

523 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land
they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir and unto mount
Hermon

524 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers even
Epher and Ishi and Eliel and Azriel and Jeremiah and Hodaviah
and Jahdiel mighty men of valour famous men and heads of the house
of their fathers

525 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers and went
a whoring after the gods of the people of the land whom God destroyed
before them

526 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
Assyria and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria and he
carried them away even the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half
tribe of Manasseh and brought them unto Halah and Habor and Hara
and to the river Gozan unto this day
