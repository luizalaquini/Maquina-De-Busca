Tyrion Lannister sniggered That was when Catelyn knew he was hers This man came a guest into my house and there conspired to murder my son a boy of seven she proclaimed to the room at large pointing Ser Rodrik moved to her side his sword in hand In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king’s justice

She did not know what was more satisfying the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on Tyrion Lannister’s face





SANSA

Sansa rode to the Hand’s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through them They turned the whole world gold Beyond the city walls a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games The splendor of it all took Sansa’s breath away the shining armor the great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold the shouts of the crowd the banners snapping in the wind… and the knights themselves the knights most of all

It is better than the songs she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her among the high lords and ladies Sansa was dressed beautifully that day in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair and she knew they were looking at her and smiling

They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth each more fabulous than the last The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot with a lion’s-head helm and a golden sword Ser Gregor Clegane the Mountain That Rides thundered past them like an avalanche Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce who had guested at Winterfell two years before His armor is bronze thousands and thousands of years old engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm she whispered to Jeyne Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister in indigo chased with silver the wings of an eagle on his helm He had cut down three of Rhaegar’s bannermen on the Trident The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr with his flapping red robes and shaven head until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword in hand

Other riders Sansa did not know hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of Dorne unsung freeriders and new-made squires the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser houses Younger men most had done no great deeds as yet but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names Ser Balon Swann Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches Bronze Yohn’s heir Ser Andar Royce and his younger brother Ser Robar their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father The twins Ser Horas and Ser Hobber whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes burgundy on blue Patrek Mallister Lord Jason’s son Six Freys of the Crossing Ser Jared Ser Hosteen Ser Danwell Ser Emmon Ser Theo Ser Perwyn sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey and his bastard son Martyn Rivers as well

Jeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho an exile prince from the Summer Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night but when she saw young Lord Beric Dondarrion with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant

The Hound entered the lists as well and so too the king’s brother handsome Lord Renly of Storm’s End Jory Alyn and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north Jory looks a beggar among these others Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared Sansa could only agree Jory’s armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag Yet he acquitted himself well unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second In his third match he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his own Neither man lost his seat but Brune’s lance was steadier and his blows better placed and the king gave him the victory Alyn and Harwin fared less well Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann

The jousting went all day and into the dusk the hooves of the great warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth A dozen times Jeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together lances exploding into splinters while the commons screamed for their favorites Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell like a frightened little girl but Sansa was made of sterner stuff A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments Even Septa Mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval

The Kingslayer rode brilliantly He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as easily as if he were riding at rings and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior

Sandor Clegane and his immense brother Ser Gregor the Mountain seemed unstoppable as well riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser Gregor’s second joust when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through his throat killing him instantly The youth fell not ten feet from where Sansa was seated The point of Ser Gregor’s lance had snapped off in his neck and his life’s blood flowed out in slow pulses each weaker than the one before His armor was shiny new a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched arm as the steel caught the light Then the sun went behind a cloud and it was gone His cloak was blue the color of the sky on a clear summer’s day trimmed with a border of crescent moons but as his blood seeped into it the cloth darkened and the moons turned red one by one

Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap watching with a strange fascination She had never seen a man die before She ought to be crying too she thought but the tears would not come Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady and Bran It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father she told herself The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her some stranger from the Vale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it And now the world would forget his name too Sansa realized there would be no songs sung for him That was sad

After they carried off the body a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where he had fallen to cover up the blood Then the jousts resumed

Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor and Lord Renly to the Hound Renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger legs in the air His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp but it was just the golden antler on his helm One of the tines had snapped off beneath him When Lord Renly climbed to his feet the commons cheered wildly for King Robert’s handsome young brother was a great favorite He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored the peace By then Septa Mordane had returned alone Jeyne had been feeling ill she explained she had helped her back to the castle Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne

Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion’s horse and was declared forfeit Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr Ser Aron Santagar and Lothor Brune tilted thrice without result Ser Aron fell afterward to Lord Jason Mallister and Brune to Yohn Royce’s younger son Robar

In the end it came down to four the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer and Ser Loras Tyrell the youth they called the Knight of Flowers

Ser Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South At sixteen he was the youngest rider on the field yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful His plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers and his snow-white stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses After each victory Ser Loras would remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd

His last match of the day was against the younger Royce Ser Robar’s ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent dazed and unmoving Sansa never saw it Her eyes were only for Ser Loras When the white horse stopped in front of her she thought her heart would burst

To the other maidens he had given white roses but the one he plucked for her was red Sweet lady he said no victory is half so beautiful as you Sansa took the flower timidly struck dumb by his gallantry His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls his eyes like liquid gold She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off

When Sansa finally looked up a man was standing over her staring He was short with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair almost as old as her father You must be one of her daughters he said to her He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did You have the Tully look

I’m Sansa Stark she said ill at ease The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar fastened with a silver mockingbird and he had the effortless manner of a high lord but she did not know him I have not had the honor my lord

Septa Mordane quickly took a hand Sweet child this is Lord Petyr Baelish of the king’s small council

Your mother was my queen of beauty once the man said quietly His breath smelled of mint You have her hair His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock Quite abruptly he turned and walked away

By then the moon was well up and the crowd was tired so the king decreed that the last three matches would be fought the next morning before the melee While the commons began their walk home talking of the day’s jousts and the matches to come on the morrow the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit Tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread
