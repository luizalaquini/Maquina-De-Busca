Benhadad Then he said Go ye bring him Then Benhadad came forth to
him and he caused him to come up into the chariot

2034 And Ben-hadad said unto him The cities which my father took
from thy father I will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee
in Damascus as my father made in Samaria Then said Ahab I will send
thee away with this covenant So he made a covenant with him and sent
him away

2035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
neighbour in the word of the LORD Smite me I pray thee And the man
refused to smite him

2036 Then said he unto him Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of
the LORD behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall
slay thee

And as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew
him

2037 Then he found another man and said Smite me I pray thee And
the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him

2038 So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and
disguised himself with ashes upon his face

2039 And as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said
Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man
turned aside and brought a man unto me and said Keep this man if
by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or
else thou shalt pay a talent of silver

2040 And as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone And the
king of Israel said unto him So shall thy judgment be thyself hast
decided it

2041 And he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the
king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets

2042 And he said unto him Thus saith the LORD Because thou hast let
go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction
therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his
people

2043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased
and came to Samaria

211 And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the
Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel hard by the palace of
Ahab king of Samaria

212 And Ahab spake unto Naboth saying Give me thy vineyard that I
may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house
and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem
good to thee I will give thee the worth of it in money

213 And Naboth said to Ahab The LORD forbid it me that I should
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee

214 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I
will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers And he laid him down
upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread

215 But Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him Why is thy
spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread  216 And he said unto her
Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite and said unto him Give me
thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee I will give thee
another vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my
vineyard

217 And Jezebel his wife said unto him Dost thou now govern the
kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry
I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite

218 So she wrote letters in Ahabs name and sealed them with his
seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were
in his city dwelling with Naboth

219 And she wrote in the letters saying Proclaim a fast and set
Naboth on high among the people 2110 And set two men sons of
Belial before him to bear witness against him saying Thou didst
blaspheme God and the king And then carry him out and stone him
that he may die

2111 And the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were
the inhabitants in his city did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as
it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them

2112 They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth on high among the people

2113 And there came in two men children of Belial and sat before
him and the men of Belial witnessed against him even against Naboth
in the presence of the people saying Naboth did blaspheme God and
the king Then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him
with stones that he died

2114 Then they sent to Jezebel saying Naboth is stoned and is
dead
