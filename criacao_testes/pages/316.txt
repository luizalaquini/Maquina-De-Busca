Then the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude I shall see that he has the king’s thanks

The eunuch gave a nervous giggle and made another mark We also have a sudden plague of holy men The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests preachers and prophets it would seem They beg in the winesinks and pot-shops and foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen

Tyrion shrugged We are close on the three hundredth year since Aegon’s Landing I suppose it is only to be expected Let them rant

They are spreading fear my lord

I thought that was your job

Varys covered his mouth with his hand You are very cruel to say so One last matter Lady Tanda gave a small supper last night I have the menu and the guest list for your inspection When the wine was poured Lord Gyles rose to lift a cup to the king and Ser Balon Swann was heard to remark ‘We’ll need three cups for that’ Many laughed…

Tyrion raised a hand Enough Ser Balon made a jest I am not interested in treasonous table talk Lord Varys

You are as wise as you are gentle my lord The parchment vanished up the eunuch’s sleeve We both have much to do I shall leave you

When the eunuch had departed Tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and wondering how his sister would take the news of Janos Slynt’s dismissal Not happily if he was any judge but beyond sending an angry protest to Lord Tywin in Harrenhal he did not see what Cersei could hope to do about it Tyrion had the City Watch now plus a hundred-and-a-half fierce clansmen and a growing force of sellswords recruited by Bronn He would seem well protected

Doubtless Eddard Stark thought the same

The Red Keep was dark and still when Tyrion left the Small Hall Bronn was waiting in his solar Slynt he asked

Lord Janos will be sailing for the Wall on the morning tide Varys would have me believe that I have replaced one of Joffrey’s men with one of my own More likely I have replaced Littlefinger’s man with one belonging to Varys but so be it

You’d best know Timett killed a man—

Varys told me

The sellsword seemed unsurprised The fool figured a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat Timett pinned his wrist to the table with a dagger and ripped out his throat barehanded He has this trick where he stiffens his fingers—

Spare me the grisly details my supper is sitting badly in my belly Tyrion said How goes your recruiting

Well enough Three new men tonight

How do you know which ones to hire

I look them over I question them to learn where they’ve fought and how well they lie Bronn smiled And then I give them a chance to kill me while I do the same for them

Have you killed any

No one we could have used

And if one of them kills you

He’ll be one you’ll want to hire

Tyrion was a little drunk and very tired Tell me Bronn If I told you to kill a babe… an infant girl say still at her mother’s breast… would you do it Without question

Without question No The sellsword rubbed thumb and forefinger together I’d ask how much

And why would I ever need your Allar Deem Lord Slynt Tyrion thought I have a hundred of my own He wanted to laugh he wanted to weep most of all he wanted Shae
