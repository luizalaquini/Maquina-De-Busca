Dancer Reek frowned Aggar says the horses are all there Only the halfwit is missing

They’re afoot then That was the best news he’d heard since he woke Bran would be riding in his basket on Hodor’s back no doubt Osha would need to carry Rickon his little legs wouldn’t take him far on their own Theon was confident that he’d soon have them back in his hands Bran and Rickon have fled he told the castle folk watching their eyes Who knows where they’ve gone No one answered They could not have escaped without help Theon went on Without food clothing weapons He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell but no doubt some had been hidden from him I’ll have the names of all those who aided them All those who turned a blind eye The only sound was the wind Come first light I mean to bring them back He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt I need huntsmen Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter Gage The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt to ask whether he’d brought anything choice for the table but he had nothing to say now Theon walked back the way he had come searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge The wild is no place for a cripple And Rickon young as he is how long will he last out there Nan think how frightened he must be The old woman had nattered at him for ten years telling her endless stories but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger I might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure but instead I protected you Is this the thanks you offer Joseth who’d groomed his horses Farlen who’d taught him all he knew of hounds Barth the brewer’s wife who’d been his first—not one of them would meet his eyes They hate me he realized

Reek stepped close Strip off their skins he urged his thick lips glistening Lord Bolton he used to say a naked man has few secrets but a flayed man’s got none

The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton Theon knew ages past certain of their lords had gone so far as to cloak themselves in the skins of dead enemies A number of Starks had ended thus Supposedly all that had stopped a thousand years ago when the Boltons had bent their knees to Winterfell Or so they say but old ways die hard as well I know

There will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell Theon said loudly I am your only protection against the likes of him he wanted to scream He could not be that blatant but perhaps some were clever enough to take the lesson

The sky was greying over the castle walls Dawn could not be far off Joseth saddle Smiler and a horse for yourself Murch Gariss Poxy Tym you’ll come as well Murch and Gariss were the best huntsmen in the castle and Tym was a fine bowman Aggar Rednose Gelmarr Reek Wex He needed his own to watch his back Farlen I’ll want hounds and you to handle them

The grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms And why would I care to hunt down my own trueborn lords and babes at that

Theon moved close I am your trueborn lord now and the man who keeps Palla safe

He saw the defiance die in Farlen’s eyes Aye m’lord

Stepping back Theon glanced about to see who else he might add Maester Luwin he announced

I know nothing of hunting

No but I don’t trust you in the castle in my absence Then it’s past time you learned

Let me come too I want that wolfskin cloak A boy stepped forward no older than Bran It took Theon a moment to remember him I’ve hunted lots of times before Walder Frey said Red deer and elk and even boar

His cousin laughed at him He rode on a boar hunt with his father but they never let him near the boar

Theon look at the boy doubtfully Come if you like but if you can’t keep up don’t think that I’ll nurse you along He turned back to Black Lorren Winterfell is yours in my absence If we do not return do with it as you will That bloody well ought to have them praying for my success

They assembled by the Hunter’s Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower their breath frosting in the cold morning air Gelmarr had equipped himself with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him The blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow Aggar wore steel greaves Reek arrived carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack bulging with god knows what Theon had his bow he needed nothing else Once he had saved Bran’s life with an arrow He hoped he would not need to take it with another but if it came to that he would

Eleven men two boys and a dozen dogs crossed the moat Beyond the outer wall the tracks were plain to read in the soft ground the pawprints of the wolves Hodor’s heavy tread the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds Once under the trees the stony ground and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see but by then Farlen’s red bitch had the scent The rest of the dogs were close behind the hounds sniffing and barking a pair of monstrous mastiffs bringing up the rear Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a cornered direwolf

He’d have guessed that Osha might run south to Ser Rodrik but the trail led north by northwest into the very heart of the wolfswood Theon did not like that one bit It would be a bitter irony if the Starks made for Deepwood Motte and delivered themselves right into Asha’s hands I’d sooner have them dead he thought bitterly It is better to be seen as cruel than foolish

Wisps of pale mist threaded between the trees Sentinels and soldier pines grew thick about here and there was nothing as dark and gloomy as an evergreen forest The ground was uneven and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing treacherous for the horses so they had to go slowly Not as slowly as a man carrying a cripple though or a bony harridan with a four-year-old on her back He told himself to be patient He’d have them before the day was out

Maester Luwin trotted up to him as they were following a game trail along the lip of a ravine Thus far hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods my lord

Theon smiled There are similarities But with hunting there’s blood at the end

Must it be so This flight was great folly but will you not be merciful These are your foster brothers we seek

No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living than dead

The same is true of the Reeds Moat Cailin sits on the edge of the bogs Lord Howland can make your uncle’s occupation a visit to hell if he chooses but so long as you hold his heirs he must stay his hand

Theon had not considered that In truth he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if she was still a maiden You may be right We will spare them if we can

And Hodor too I hope The boy is simple you know that He does as he is told How many times has he groomed your horse soaped your saddle scoured your mail

Hodor was nothing to him If he does not fight us we will let him live Theon pointed a finger But say one word about sparing the wildling and you can die with her She swore me an oath and pissed on it

The maester inclined his head I make no apologies for oathbreakers Do what you must I thank you for your mercy

Mercy thought Theon as Luwin dropped back There’s a bloody trap Too much and they call you weak too little and you’re monstrous Yet the maester had given him good counsel he knew His father thought only in terms of conquest but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it Force and fear could carry you only so far A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south elsewise Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them Sansa was a pretty little thing too and by now likely even ripe for bedding But she was a thousand leagues away in the clutches of the Lannisters A shame

The wood grew ever wilder The pines and sentinels gave way to huge dark oaks Tangles of hawthorn concealed treacherous gullies and cuts Stony hills rose and fell They passed a crofter’s cottage deserted and overgown and skirted a flooded quarry where the still water had a sheen as grey as steel When the dogs began to bay Theon figured the fugitives were near at hand He spurred Smiler and followed at a trot but what he found was only the carcass of a young elk    or what remained of it

He dismounted for a closer look The kill was still fresh and plainly the work of wolves The dogs sniffed round it eagerly and one of the mastiffs buried his teeth in a haunch until Farlen shouted him off No part of this animal has been butchered Theon realized The wolves ate but not the men Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire she ought to have cut them a few steaks It made no sense to leave so much good meat to rot Farlen are you certain we’re on the right trail he demanded Could your dogs be chasing the wrong wolves

My bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough

I hope so For your sake

Less than an hour later the trail led down a slope toward a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains It was there the dogs lost the scent Farlen and Wex waded across with the hounds and came back shaking their heads while the animals ranged up and down the far bank sniffing They went in here m’lord but I can’t see where they come out the kennelmaster said

Theon dismounted and knelt beside the stream He dipped a hand in it The water was cold They won’t have stayed long in this he said Take half the dogs downstream I’ll go up—

Wex clapped his hands together loudly

What is it Theon said

The mute boy pointed

The ground near the water was sodden and muddy The tracks the wolves had left were plain enough Pawprints yes So

Wex drove his heel into the mud and pivoted his foot this way and that It left a deep gouge

Joseth understood A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud he said More so with the weight of a boy on his back Yet the only boot prints here are our own See for yourself

Appalled Theon saw it was true The wolves had gone into the turgid brown water alone Osha must have turned aside back of us Before the elk most likely She sent the wolves on by themselves hoping we’d chase after them He rounded on his huntsmen If you two have played me false—

There’s been only the one trail my lord I swear it said Gariss defensively And the direwolves would never have parted from them boys Not for long

That’s so Theon thought Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt but soon or late they would return to Bran and Rickon Gariss Murch take four dogs and double back find where we lost them Aggar you watch them I’ll have no trickery Farlen and I will follow the direwolves Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail Two blasts if you catch sight of the beasts themselves Once we find where they went they’ll lead us back to their masters

He took Wex the Frey boy and Gynir Rednose to search upstream He and Wex rode on one side of the brook Rednose and Walder Frey on the other each with a pair of hounds The wolves might have come out on either bank Theon kept an eye out for tracks spoor broken branches any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water He spied the prints of deer elk and badger easily enough Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch But of the direwolves there was no sign

A little farther Theon told himself Past that oak over that rise past the next bend of the stream we’ll find something there He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly It was midday when he wrenched Smiler’s head round in disgust and gave up

Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him It should not have been possible not on foot burdened with a cripple and a young child Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape If they reach a village    The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark’s sons Robb’s brothers They’d have mounts to speed them on their way food Men would fight for the honor of protecting them The whole bloody north would rally around them

The wolves went downstream that’s all He clung to that thought That red bitch will sniff where they came out of the water and we’ll be after them again

But when they joined up with Farlen’s party one look at the kennelmaster’s face smashed all of Theon’s hopes to shards The only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear baiting he said angrily Would that I had a bear

The dogs are not at fault Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch a hand on each Running water don’t hold no scents m’lord
