 I was here
 You are Farmer Oak are you not  
 That or thereabouts Im lately come to this place
 A large farm   she inquired casting her eyes round
and swinging back her hair which was black in the
shaded hollows of its mass but it being now an hour
past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with
a colour of their own
 No  not large About a hundred In speaking
of farms the word acres  is omitted by the natives by
analogy to such old expressions as a stag of ten
 I wanted my hat this morning she went on
had to ride to Tewnell Mill
Yes you had
How do you know
I saw you
Where she inquired a misgiving bringing every
muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstill
Here-going through the plantation and all down
the hill said Farmer Oak with an aspect excessively
knowing with regard to some matter in his mind as he
gazed at a remote point in the direction named and then
turned back to meet his colloquists eyes
A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes
from hers as suddenly as if he had been caught in a
theft Recollection of the strange antics she had
indulged in when passing through the trees was suc+
ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation and that by
a hot face It was a time to see a woman redden who
was not given to reddening s a rule not a point in
the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour From
the Maidens Blush through all varieties of the Provence
down to the Crimson Tuscany the countenance of Oaks
acquaintance quickly graduated  whereupon he in con+
siderateness turned away his head
The sympathetic man still looked the other way and
wondered when she would recover coolness sufficient to
justify him in facing her again He heard what seemed
to be the flitting of a

dead leaf upon the breeze and
looked She had gone away
With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy 
Gabriel returned to his work
Five mornings and evenings passed The young
woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to
attend to the sick one but never allowed her vision to
stray in the direction of Oaks person His want of
tact had deeply offended her -- not by seeing what he
could not help but by letting her know that he had
seen it For as without law there is no sin without
eyes there is no indecorum and she appeared to feel
that Gabriels espial had made her an indecorous woman
without her own connivance It was food for great regret
with him it was also a contretemps which touched into
life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction
The acquaintanceship might however have ended in
a slow forgetting but for an incident which occurred at
the end of the same week One afternoon it began to
freeze and the frost increased with evening which drew
on like a stealthy tightening of bonds It was a time
when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to
the sheets when round the drawing-room fire of a
thick-walled mansion the sitters backs are cold even
whilst their faces are all aglow Many a small bird went
to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs
As the milking-hour drew near Oak kept his usual
watch upon the cowshed At last he felt cold and
shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yeaning
ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon
the stove The wind came in at the bottom of the door
and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the
cot round a little more to the south Then the wind
spouted in at a ventilating hole -- of which there was one
on each side of the hut
Gabriel had always known that when the fire was
lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept
open -- that chosen being always on the side away from
the wind Closing the slide to windward he turned to
open the other on second -- -thoughts the farmer con+
sidered that he would first sit down leaving both
closed for a minute or two till the temperature of the
hut was a little raised He sat down
P 70
His head began to ache in an unwonted manner and
fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of
the preceding nights Oak decided to get up open the
slide and then allow himself to fall asleep He fell
asleep however without having performed the necessary
preliminary
How long he remained unconseious Gabriel never
knew During the first stages of his return to percep+
tion peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment
His dog was howling his head was aching fearfully --
somebody was pulling him about hands were loosening
his neckerchief
On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk
to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness The
young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white
teeth was beside him More than this -- astonishingly
