It is the old Katnisss favorite kind of day Early spring
The woods awakening after the long winter But the spurt of
energy that began with the primroses fades away By the
time I make it back to the fence Im so sick and dizzy
Thom has to give me a ride home in the dead peoples
cart Help me to the sofa in the living room where I watch
the dust motes spin in the thin shafts of afternoon light
My head snaps around at the hiss but it takes awhile
to believe hes real How could he have gotten here I take
in the claw marks from some wild animal the back paw he
holds slightly above the ground the prominent bones in his
face Hes come on foot then all the way from 13 Maybe
they kicked him out or maybe he just couldnt stand it there
without her so he came looking
It was the waste of a trip Shes not here I tell him
Buttercup hisses again Shes not here You can hiss all
you like You wont find Prim At her name he perks up
Raises his flattened ears Begins to meow hopefully Get
out He dodges the pillow I throw at him Go away
Theres nothing left for you here I start to shake furious
with him Shes not coming back Shes never ever coming
back here again I grab another pillow and get to my feet
to improve my aim Out of nowhere the tears begin to pour
down my cheeks Shes dead I clutch my middle to dull
the pain Sink down on my heels rocking the pillow crying
Shes dead you stupid cat Shes dead A new sound
part crying part singing comes out of my body giving
voice to my despair Buttercup begins to wail as well No
matter what I do he wont go He circles me just out of
reach as wave after wave of sobs racks my body until
eventually I fall unconscious But he must understand He
must know that the unthinkable has happened and to
survive will require previously unthinkable acts Because
hours later when I come to in my bed hes there in the
moonlight Crouched beside me yellow eyes alert
guarding me from the night
In the morning he sits stoically as I clean the cuts but
digging the thorn from his paw brings on a round of those
kitten mews We both end up crying again only this time we
comfort each other On the strength of this I open the letter
Haymitch gave me from my mother dial the phone number
and weep with her as well Peeta bearing a warm loaf of
bread shows up with Greasy Sae She makes us breakfast
and I feed all my bacon to Buttercup
Slowly with many lost days I come back to life I try to
follow Dr Aureliuss advice just going through the motions
amazed when one finally has meaning again I tell him my
idea about the book and a large box of parchment sheets
arrives on the next train from the Capitol
I got the idea from our familys plant book The place
where we recorded those things you cannot trust to
memory The page begins with the persons picture A
photo if we can find it If not a sketch or painting by Peeta
Then in my most careful handwriting come all the details it
would be a crime to forget Lady licking Prims cheek My
fathers laugh Peetas father with the cookies The color of
Finnicks eyes What Cinna could do with a length of silk
Boggs reprogramming the Holo Rue poised on her toes
arms slightly extended like a bird about to take flight On
and on We seal the pages with salt water and promises to
live well to make their deaths count Haymitch finally joins
us contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced
to mentor Additions become smaller An old memory that
surfaces A late primrose preserved between the pages
Strange bits of happiness like the photo of Finnick and
Annies newborn son
We learn to keep busy again Peeta bakes I hunt
Haymitch drinks until the liquor runs out and then raises
geese until the next train arrives Fortunately the geese can
take pretty good care of themselves Were not alone A
few hundred others return because whatever has
happened this is our home With the mines closed they
plow the ashes into the earth and plant food Machines from
the Capitol break ground for a new factory where we will
make medicines Although no one seeds it the Meadow
turns green again
Peeta and I grow back together There are still
moments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangs
on until the flashbacks are over I wake screaming from
nightmares of mutts and lost children But his arms are
there to comfort me And eventually his lips On the night I
feel that thing again the hunger that overtook me on the
beach I know this would have happened anyway That what
I need to survive is not Gales fire kindled with rage and
hatred I have plenty of fire myself What I need is the
dandelion in the spring The bright yellow that means rebirth
instead of destruction The promise that life can go on no
matter how bad our losses That it can be good again And
only Peeta can give me that
So after when he whispers You love me Real or not
real
I tell him Real
EPILOGUE
They play in the Meadow The dancing girl with the
dark hair and blue eyes The boy with blond curls and gray
eyes struggling to keep up with her on his chubby toddler
legs It took five ten fifteen years for me to agree But
Peeta wanted them so badly When I first felt her stirring
inside of me I was consumed with a terror that felt as old
as life itself Only the joy of holding her in my arms could
