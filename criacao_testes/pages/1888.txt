quantization error characteristics to the A-law and would be indistinguishable
from it on the scale of Figure 36
rh The pre-sampling filter
Now that we have some idea of the accuracy requirements for quantization
let us discuss quantitative specifications for the pre-sampling filter
Figure 37 sketches the characteristics of this filter
FC Figure 37
Assume a
sampling frequency of 8 kHz and a range of interest from 0 to 34 kHz
Although all components at frequencies above 4 kHz will fold back into
the 0 - 4 kHz baseband those below 46 kHz fold back above 34 kHz and are
therefore outside the range of interest  This gives a guard band between
34 and 46 kHz which separates the passband from the stopband  The filter
should transmit negligible components in the stopband above 46 kHz
To reduce the harmonic distortion caused by aliasing to the same level
as the quantization noise in 11-bit linear conversion the stopband
attenuation should be around -68 dB the signal-to-noise ratio for a full-scale
sine wave  Passband ripple is not so critical
for two reasons  Whilst the presence of aliased components means that
information has been lost about the frequency components within the range of
interest passband ripple does not actually cause a loss of information but
only a distortion and could if necessary be compensated by a suitable
filter acting on the digitized waveform  Secondly distortion of the
passband spectrum is not nearly so audible as the frequency images caused
by aliasing  Hence one usually aims for a passband ripple of around 05 dB
pp
The pass and stopband targets we have mentioned above can be achieved with
a 9th order elliptic filter  While such a filter is often used in
high-quality signal-processing systems for telephone-quality speech
much less stringent specifications seem to be sufficient  Figure 38 for
example shows a template which has been recommended by telecommunications
authorities
FC Figure 38
A 5th order elliptic filter can easily meet this specification
Such filters implemented by switched-capacitor means are available in
single-chip form  Integrated CCD charge-coupled device
filters which meet the same specification
are also marketed  Indeed some codecs provide input filtering on the same
chip as the AD converter
pp
Instead of implementing a filter by analogue means to meet the aliasing
specifications digital filtering can be used  A high sample-rate AD
converter operating at say 32 kHz and preceded by a very simple low-pass
pre-sampling filter is followed by a digital filter which meets the
desired specification and its output is subsampled to provide an 8 kHz sample
rate  While such implementations may be economic where a multichannel digitizing
capability is required as in local telephone exchanges where the subscriber
connection is an analogue one they are unlikely to prove cost-effective for
a single channel
rh Reconstructing the analogue waveform
Having digitized and stored a signal it needs to be passed though a DA
converter digital-to-analogue and low-pass filter when replayed
DA converters are cheaper than AD converters and the characteristics of the
low-pass filter for output can be the same as those for input
However the desampling operation introduces an additional distortion which
has an effect on the component at frequency f of
LB
EQ
 sin  pi ff sub s  over  pi ff sub s   
EN
LE
where f sub s is the sampling frequency  An aperture correction filter is
needed to compensate for this although many systems simply do without it
Such a filter is sometimes incorporated into the codec chip
rh Summary
For telephone-quality speech existing codec chips
coupled if necessary with integrated pre-sampling filters can
be used at a remarkably low cost
For higher-quality speech storage the analogue interface can become quite complex
A comprehensive study of the problems as they relate to digitization of audio
which demands much greater fidelity than speech has been made by Blesser 1978

Blesser 1978

He notes the following sources of error amongst others
LB
NP
slew-rate distortion in the pre-sampling filter for signals at the upper end
of the audio band
NP
insufficient filtering of high-frequency input signals
NP
noise generated by the sample-and-hold amplifier or pre-sampling filter
NP
acquisition errors because of the finite settling time of the sample-and-hold
circuit
NP
insufficient settling time in the AD conversion
NP
errors in the quantization levels of the AD and DA converters
NP
noise in the converters
NP
jitter on the clock used for timing input or output samples
NP
aperture distortion in the output sampler
NP
noise in the output filter as a result of limited dynamic range of the
integrated circuits
