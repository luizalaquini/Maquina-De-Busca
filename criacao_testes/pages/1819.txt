returned with a cloak hat some slices of bread and
butter a tea-cup and some hot tea in a little china jug
P 366
Is Fanny gone   said Bathsheba
 No said her companion pouring out the tea
Bathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank
sparingly Her voice was then a little clearer and
trifling colour returned to her face Now well walk
about again she said
They wandered about the wood for nearly two
REACTION
hours Bathsheba replying in monosyllables to Liddys
prattle for her mind ran on one subject and one only
She interrupted with --
l wonder if Fanny is gone by this time  
I will go and see
She came back with the information that the
men were just taking away the corpse that Bathsheba
had been inquired for that she had replied to the
effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be
seen
Then they think I am in my bedroom 
 Yes Liddy then ventured to add  You said
when I first found you that you might never go home
again -- you didnt mean it maam  
No Ive altered my mind It is only women with
no pride in them who run away from their husbands
There is one position worse than that of being found
dead in your husbands house from his iliusage and
that is to be found alive through having gone away to
The house of somebody else lve thought of it all this
morning and Ive chosen my course A runaway wife
is an encumbrance to everybody a burden to herself and
a byword -- all of which make up a heap of misery
greater than any that comes by staying at home --
though this may include the trifling items of insult
beating and starvation Liddy if ever you marry --
God forbid that you ever should  -- youll find yourself
in a fearful situation  but mind this dont you flinch
Stand your ground and be cut to pieces Thats
what Im going to do
 O mistress dont talk so   said Liddy-taking her
hand but I knew you had too much sense to bide
away May I ask what dreadful thing it is that has
happened between you and him 
 You may ask but I may not tell
In about ten minutes they returned to the house by
a cimuitous route entering at the rear Bathsheba
glided up the
P 367
back stairs to a disused attic and her
companion followed
Liddy she said with a lighter heart for youth an
hope had begun to reassert themselves  you are to b
my confidante for the present -- somebody must be -- and
I choose you Well I shall take up my abode here fo
a while Will you get a fire lighted put down a piece
of carpet and help me to make the place comfortable
Afterwards I want you and Maryann to bring up that
little stump bedstead in the small room and the be
belonging to it and a table and some other things
What shall I do to pass the heavy time away 
Hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing said
Liddy
O no no  I hate needlework-i always did
knitting  
 And that too
You might finish your sampler Only the carn
tions and peacocks want filling in and then it could
be framed and glazed and hung beside your aunt
maam
 Samplers are out of date -- horribly countrified No
Liddy Ill read Bring up some books -- not new ones
I havent heart to read anything new
Some of your uncles old ones maam  
 Yes Some of those we stowed away in boxes 
faint gleam of humour passed over her face as she said
Bring Beaumont and Fletchers Maids Tragedy- an
the Mourning Bride - and-iet me see -- Niht Thoghts
and the Vanity of Human Wishes
And that story of the black man who murdered his
wife Desdemona It is a nice dismal one that would
suit you excellent just now
 Now Liddy youve been looking into my book
without telling me and I said you were not to  How
do you know it would suit me It wouldnt suit me a
all
But if the others do --  -- 
 No they dont  and I wont read dismal books
Why should I read dismal books indeed  Bring me
Love in a Village and Maid of the Mill and Doctor
Syntax and some volumes of the Spectator
All that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic
in a state of
P 368
barricade  a precaution which proved to be
needless as against Troy for he did not appear in the
neighbourhood or trouble them at all Bathsheba sat
at the window till sunset sometimes attempting to read
at other times watching every movement outside without
