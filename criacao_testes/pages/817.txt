Behind Glover’s screen of scouts Robb’s line of march stretched several miles The Greatjon led the van Catelyn traveled in the main column surrounded by plodding warhorses with steelclad men on their backs Next came the baggage train a procession of wayns laden with food fodder camp supplies wedding gifts and the wounded too weak to walk under the watchful eye of Ser Wendel Manderly and his White Harbor knights Herds of sheep and goats and scrawny cattle trailed behind and then a little tail of footsore camp followers Even farther back was Robin Flint and the rearguard There was no enemy in back of them for hundreds of leagues but Robb would take no chances

Thirty-five hundred they were thirty-five hundred who had been blooded in the Whispering Wood who had reddened their swords at the Battle of the Camps at Oxcross Ashemark and the Crag and all through the gold-rich hills of the Lannister west Aside from her brother Edmure’s modest retinue of friends the lords of the Trident had remained to hold the riverlands while the king retook the north Ahead awaited Edmure’s bride and Robb’s next battle… and for me two dead sons an empty bed and a castle full of ghosts It was a cheerless prospect Brienne where are you Bring my girls back to me Brienne Bring them back safe

The drizzle that had sent them off turned into a soft steady rain by midday and continued well past nightfall The next day the northmen never saw the sun at all but rode beneath leaden skies with their hoods pulled up to keep the water from their eyes It was a heavy rain turning roads to mud and fields to quagmires swelling the rivers and stripping the trees of their leaves The constant patter made idle chatter more bother than it was worth so men spoke only when they had something to say and that was seldom enough

We are stronger than we seem my lady Lady Maege Mormont said as they rode Catelyn had grown fond of Lady Maege and her eldest daughter Dacey they were more understanding than most in the matter of Jaime Lannister she had found The daughter was tall and lean the mother short and stout but they dressed alike in mail and leather with the black bear of House Mormont on shield and surcoat By Catelyn’s lights that was queer garb for a lady yet Dacey and Lady Maege seemed more comfortable both as warriors and as women than ever the girl from Tarth had been

I have fought beside the Young Wolf in every battle Dacey Mormont said cheerfully He has not lost one yet

No but he has lost everything else Catelyn thought but it would not do to say it aloud The northmen did not lack for courage but they were far from home with little enough to sustain them but for their faith in their young king That faith must be protected at all costs I must be stronger she told herself I must be strong for Robb If I despair my grief will consume me Everything would turn on this marriage If Edmure and Roslin were happy in one another if the Late Lord Frey could be appeased and his power once more wedded to Robb’s… Even then what chance will we have caught between Lannister and Greyjoy It was a question Catelyn dared not dwell on though Robb dwelt on little else She saw how he studied his maps whenever they made camp searching for some plan that might win back the north

Her brother Edmure had other cares You don’t suppose all Lord Walder’s daughters look like him do you he wondered as he sat in his tall striped pavilion with Catelyn and his friends

With so many different mothers a few of the maids are bound to turn up comely said Ser Marq Piper but why should the old wretch give you a pretty one

No reason at all said Edmure in a glum tone

It was more than Catelyn could stand Cersei Lannister is comely she said sharply You’d be wiser to pray that Roslin is strong and healthy with a good head and a loyal heart And with that she left them

Edmure did not take that well The next day he avoided her entirely on the march preferring the company of Marq Piper Lymond Goodbrook Patrek Mallister and the young Vances They do not scold him except in jest Catelyn told herself when they raced by her that afternoon with nary a word I have always been too hard with Edmure and now grief sharpens my every word She regretted her rebuke There was rain enough falling from the sky without her making more And was it really such a terrible thing to want a pretty wife She remembered her own childish disappointment the first time she had laid eyes on Eddard Stark She had pictured him as a younger version of his brother Brandon but that was wrong Ned was shorter and plainer of face and so somber He spoke courteously enough but beneath the words she sensed a coolness that was all at odds with Brandon whose mirths had been as wild as his rages Even when he took her maidenhood their love had more of duty to it than of passion We made Robb that night though we made a king together And after the war at Winterfell I had love enough for any woman once I found the good sweet heart beneath Ned’s solemn face There is no reason Edmure should not find the same with his Roslin

As the gods would have it their route took them through the Whispering Wood where Robb had won his first great victory They followed the course of the twisting stream on the floor of that pinched narrow valley much as Jaime Lannister’s men had done that fateful night It was warmer then Catelyn remembered the trees were still green and the stream did not overflow its banks Fallen leaves choked the flow now and lay in sodden snarls among the rocks and roots and the trees that had once hidden Robb’s army had exchanged their green raiment for leaves of dull gold spotted with brown and a red that reminded her of rust and dry blood Only the spruce and the soldier pines still showed green thrusting up at the belly of the clouds like tall dark spears

More than the trees have died since then she reflected On the night of the Whispering Wood Ned was still alive in his cell beneath Aegon’s High Hill Bran and Rickon were safe behind the walls of Winterfell And Theon Greyjoy fought at Robb’s side and boasted of how he had almost crossed swords with the Kingslayer Would that he had If Theon had died in place of Lord Karstark’s sons how much ill would have been undone

As they passed through the battleground Catelyn glimpsed signs of the carnage that had been an overturned helm filling with rain a splintered lance the bones of a horse Stone cairns had been raised over some of the men who had fallen here but scavengers had already been at them Amidst the tumbles of rock she spied brightly colored cloth and bits of shiny metal Once she saw a face peering out at her the shape of the skull beginning to emerge from beneath the melting brown flesh

It made her wonder where Ned had come to rest The silent sisters had taken his bones north escorted by Hallis Mollen and a small honor guard Had Ned ever reached Winterfell to be interred beside his brother Brandon in the dark crypts beneath the castle Or did the door slam shut at Moat Cailin before Hal and the sisters could pass

Thirty-five hundred riders wound their way along the valley floor through the heart of the Whispering Wood but Catelyn Stark had seldom felt lonelier Every league she crossed took her farther from Riverrun and she found herself wondering whether she would ever see the castle again Or was it lost to her forever like so much else

Five days later their scouts rode back to warn them that the rising waters had washed out the wooden bridge at Fairmarket Galbart Glover and two of his bolder men had tried swimming their mounts across the turbulent Blue Fork at Ramsford Two of the horses had been swept under and drowned and one of the riders Glover himself managed to cling to a rock until they could pull him in The river hasn’t run this high since spring Edmure said And if this rain keeps falling it will go higher yet

There’s a bridge further upstream near Oldstones remembered Catelyn who had often crossed these lands with her father It’s older and smaller but if it still stands—

It’s gone my lady Galbart Glover said Washed away even before the one at Fairmarket

Robb looked to Catelyn Is there another bridge

No And the fords will be impassable She tried to remember If we cannot cross the Blue Fork we’ll have to go around it through Sevenstreams and Hag’s Mire

Bogs and bad roads or none at all warned Edmure The going will be slow but we’ll get there I suppose

Lord Walder will wait I’m sure said Robb Lothar sent him a bird from Riverrun he knows we are coming

Yes but the man is prickly and suspicious by nature said Catelyn He may take this delay as a deliberate insult

Very well I’ll beg his pardon for our tardiness as well A sorry king I’ll be apologizing with every second breath Robb made a wry face I hope Bolton got across the Trident before the rains began The kingsroad runs straight north he’ll have an easy march Even afoot he should reach the Twins before us

And when you’ve joined his men to yours and seen my brother married what then Catelyn asked him

North Robb scratched Grey Wind behind an ear
