this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and
moor momentarily received additional clothing only
to appear momentarily more naked thereby The vast
arch of cloud above was strangely low and formed as
it were the roof of a large dark cavern gradually sinking
in upon its floor for the instinctive thought was that
the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the
earth would soon unite into one mass without any
intervening stratum of air at all
We turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics 
which were flatness in respect of the river verticality
in respect of the wall behind it and darkness as to
both These features made up the mass If anything
could be darker than the sky it was the wall and if any
thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river
beneath The indistinct summit of the facade was
notched and pronged by chimneys here and there and
upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes
of windows though only in the upper part Below
down to the waters edge the flat was unbroken by
hole or projection
An indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing
in their regularity sent their sound- with difficulty
through the fluffy atmosphere It was a neighbouring
clock striking ten The bell was in the open air and
being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow had
lost its voiee for the time
About this hour the snow abated  ten flakes fell
where twenty had fallen then one had the room of
ten Not long after a form moved by the brink of
the river
By its outline upon the colourless background a close
observer might have seen that it was small This was
all that was positively discoverable though it seemed
human
The shape went slowly along but without much
exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet
more than two inches deep At this time some words
were spoken aloud  --
 One Two Three Four Five
 Between each utterance the little shape advanced
about half a dozen yards It was evident now that
the windows high
P 136
in the wall were being counted
The word Five represented the fifth window from
the end of the wall
Here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller The
figure was stooping Then a morsel of snow flew
across the river towards the fifth window It smacked
against the wall at a point several yards from its mark
The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the
execution of a woman No man who had ever seen bird
rabbit or squirrel in his childhood could possibly have
thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here
Another attempt and another  till by degrees the
wall must have become pimpled with the adhering
lumps of snow  At last one fragment struck the fifth
window
The river would have been seen by day to be of
that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides
with the same gliding precision any irregularities of
speed being immediately corrected by a small whirl+
pool Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but
the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible wheels --
together with a few small sounds which a sad man
would have called moans and a happy man laughter --
caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling
objects in other parts of the stream
The window was struck again in the same manner
Then a noise was heard apparently produced by
the opening of the window This was followed by a
voice from the same quarter
Whos there  
The tones were masculine and not those of surprise
The high wall being that of a barrack and marriage
being looked upon with disfavour in the army assigna+
tions and communications had probably been made
across the river before tonight
Is it Sergeant Troy said the blurred spot in the
snow tremulously
This person was so much like a mere shade upon
the earth and the other speaker so much a part of
the building that one would have said the wall was
holding a conversation with the snow
P 137
Yes came suspiciously from the shadow  What
girl are you  
O Frank -- dont you know me  said the spot
Your wife Fanny Robin
 Fanny  said the wall in utter astonishment
Yes said the girl with a half-suppressed gasp of
emotion
There was something in the womans tone which is
not that of the wife and there was a mannerin the man
which is rarely a husbands The dialogue went on
How did you come here 
I asked which was your window Forgive me  
I did not expect you to-night Indeed I did not
think you would come at all It was a wonder you
