you have Finnick adds cockily
Do not think that fact escapes me he says with an
impatient wave Now back in line Soldiers Odair and
Everdeen I have a presentation to finish
We retreat to our places ignoring the questioning
looks thrown our way I adopt an attitude of extreme
concentration as Plutarch continues nodding my head here
and there shifting my position to get a better view all the
while telling myself to hang on until I can get to the woods
and scream Or curse Or cry Or maybe all three at once
If this was a test Finnick and I both pass it When
Plutarch finishes and the meetings adjourned I have a bad
moment when I learn theres a special order for me But its
merely that I skip the military haircut because they would
like the Mockingjay to look as much like the girl in the arena
as possible at the anticipated surrender For the cameras
you know I shrug to communicate that my hair lengths a
matter of complete indifference to me They dismiss me
without further comment
Finnick and I gravitate toward each other in the
hallway What will I tell Annie he says under his breath
Nothing I answer Thats what my mother and sister
will be hearing from me Bad enough that we know were
heading back into a fully equipped arena No use dropping
it on our loved ones
If she sees that holograph-- he begins
She wont Its classified information It must be I say
Anyway its not like an actual Games Any number of
people will survive Were just overreacting because--well
you know why You still want to go dont you
Of course I want to destroy Snow as much as you
do he says
It wont be like the others I say firmly trying to
convince myself as well Then the real beauty of the
situation dawns on me This time Snow will be a player
too
Before we can continue Haymitch appears He wasnt
at the meeting isnt thinking of arenas but something else
Johannas back in the hospital
I assumed Johanna was fine had passed her exam
but simply wasnt assigned to a sharpshooters unit Shes
wicked throwing an ax but about average with a gun Is she
hurt What happened
It was while she was on the Block They try to ferret
out a soldiers potential weaknesses So they flooded the
street says Haymitch
This doesnt help Johanna can swim At least I seem
to remember her swimming around some in the Quarter
Quell Not like Finnick of course but none of us are like
Finnick So
Thats how they tortured her in the Capitol Soaked
her and then used electric shocks says Haymitch In the
Block she had some kind of flashback Panicked didnt
know where she was Shes back under sedation Finnick
and I just stand there as if weve lost the ability to respond I
think of the way Johanna never showers How she forced
herself into the rain like it was acid that day I had attributed
her misery to the morphling withdrawal
You two should go see her Youre as close to friends
as shes got says Haymitch
That makes the whole thing worse I dont really know
whats between Johanna and Finnick But I hardly know her
No family No friends Not so much as a token from 7 to set
beside her regulation clothes in her anonymous drawer
Nothing
I better go tell Plutarch He wont be happy Haymitch
continues He wants as many victors as possible for the
cameras to follow in the Capitol Thinks it makes for better
television
Are you and Beetee going I ask
As many young and attractive victors as possible
Haymitch corrects himself So no Well be here
Finnick goes directly down to see Johanna but I linger
outside a few minutes until Boggs comes out Hes my
commander now so I guess hes the one to ask for any
special favors When I tell him what I want to do he writes
me a pass so that I can go to the woods during Reflection
provided I stay within sight of the guards I run to my
compartment thinking to use the parachute but its so full of
ugly memories Instead I go across the hall and take one of
the white cotton bandages I brought from 12 Square
Sturdy Just the thing
In the woods I find a pine tree and strip handfuls of
fragrant needles from the boughs After making a neat pile
in the middle of the bandage I gather up the sides give
them a twist and tie them tightly with a length of vine
making an apple-sized bundle
At the hospital room door I watch Johanna for a
moment realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasive
attitude Stripped of that as she is now theres only a slight
young woman her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awake
against the power of the drugs Terrified of what sleep will
bring I cross to her and hold out the bundle
Whats that she says hoarsely Damp edges of her
hair form little spikes over her forehead
I made it for you Something to put in your drawer I
place it in her hands Smell it
She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative
sniff Smells like home Tears flood her eyes
Thats what I was hoping You being from Seven and
