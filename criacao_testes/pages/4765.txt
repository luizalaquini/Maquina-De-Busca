Outrider’s horn Tormund told Mance

Something’s coming Varamyr sat crosslegged on the half-frozen ground his wolves circled restlessly around him A shadow swept over him and Jon looked up to see the eagle’s blue-grey wings Coming from the east

When the dead walk walls and stakes and swords mean nothing he remembered You cannot fight the dead Jon Snow No man knows that half so well as me

Harma scowled East The wights should be behind us

East the skinchanger repeated Something’s coming

The Others Jon asked

Mance shook his head The Others never come when the sun is up Chariots were rattling across the killing ground jammed with riders waving spears of sharpened bone The king groaned Where the bloody hell do they think they’re going Quenn get those fools back where they belong Someone bring my horse The mare not the stallion I’ll want my armor too Mance glanced suspiciously at the Wall Atop the icy parapets the straw soldiers stood collecting arrows but there was no sign of any other activity Harma mount up your raiders Tormund find your sons and give me a triple line of spears

Aye said Tormund striding off

The mousy little skinchanger closed his eyes and said I see them They’re coming along the streams and game trails   

Who

Men Men on horses Men in steel and men in black

Crows Mance made the word a curse He turned on Jon Did my old brothers think they’d catch me with my breeches down if they attacked while we were talking

If they planned an attack they never told me about it Jon did not believe it Lord Janos lacked the men to attack the wildling camp Besides he was on the wrong side of the Wall and the gate was sealed with rubble He had a different sort of treachery in mind this can’t be his work

If you’re lying to me again you won’t be leaving here alive Mance warned His guards brought him his horse and armor Elsewhere around the camp Jon saw people running at cross purposes some men forming up as if to storm the Wall while others slipped into the woods women driving dog carts east mammoths wandering west He reached back over his shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away They wore black mail black halfhelms and black cloaks Half-armored Mance drew his sword You knew nothing of this did you he said to Jon coldly

Slow as honey on a cold morning the rangers swept down on the wildling camp picking their way through clumps of gorse and stands of trees over roots and rocks Wildlings flew to meet them shouting war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint galloping headlong at their ancient enemies A shout a slash and a fine brave death Jon had heard brothers say of the free folk’s way of fighting

Believe what you will Jon told the King-beyond-the-Wall but I knew nothing of any attack

Harma thundered past before Mance could reply riding at the head of thirty raiders Her standard went before her a dead dog impaled on a spear raining blood at every stride Mance watched as she smashed into the rangers Might be you’re telling it true he said Those look like Eastwatch men Sailors on horses Cotter Pyke always had more guts than sense He took the Lord of Bones at Long Barrow he might have thought to do the same with me If so he’s a fool He doesn’t have the men he—

Mance the shout came It was a scout bursting from the trees on a lathered horse Mance there’s more they’re all around us iron men iron a host of iron men

Cursing Mance swung up into the saddle Varamyr stay and see that no harm comes to Dalla The King-beyond-the-Wall pointed his sword at Jon And keep a few extra eyes on this crow If he runs rip out his throat

Aye I’ll do that The skinchanger was a head shorter than Jon slumped and soft but that shadowcat could disembowel him with one paw They’re coming from the north too Varamyr told Mance You best go

Mance donned his helm with its raven wings His men were mounted up as well Arrowhead Mance snapped to me form wedge Yet when he slammed his heels into the mare and flew across the field at the rangers the men who raced to catch him lost all semblance of formation

Jon took a step toward the tent thinking of the Horn of Winter but the shadowcat blocked him tail lashing The beast’s nostrils flared and slaver ran from his curved front teeth He smells my fear He missed Ghost more than ever then The two wolves were behind him growling

Banners he heard Varamyr murmur I see golden banners oh    A mammoth lumbered by trumpeting a half-dozen bowmen in the wooden tower on its back The king    no   

Then the skinchanger threw back his head and screamed

The sound was shocking ear-piercing thick with agony Varamyr fell writhing and the ’cat was screaming too    and high high in the eastern sky against the wall of cloud Jon saw the eagle burning For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star wreathed in red and gold and orange its wings beating wildly at the air as if it could fly from the pain Higher it flew and higher and higher still

The scream brought Val out of the tent white-faced What is it what’s happened Varamyr’s wolves were fighting each other and the shadowcat had raced off into the trees but the man was still twisting on the ground What’s wrong with him Val demanded horrified Where’s Mance

There Jon pointed Gone to fight The king led his ragged wedge into a knot of rangers his sword flashing

Gone He can’t be gone not now It’s started

The battle He watched the rangers scatter before Harma’s bloody dog’s head The raiders screamed and hacked and chased the men in black back into the trees But there were more men coming from the wood a column of horse Knights on heavy horse Jon saw Harma had to regroup and wheel to meet them but half of her men had raced too far ahead

The birth Val was shouting at him

Trumpets were blowing all around loud and brazen The wildlings have no trumpets only warhorns They knew that as well as he did the sound sent free folk running in confusion some toward the fighting others away A mammoth was stomping through a flock of sheep that three men were trying to herd off west The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines but they were too late too disorganized too slow The enemy was emerging from the forest from the east the northeast the north three great columns of heavy horse all dark glinting steel and bright wool surcoats Not the men of Eastwatch those had been no more than a line of scouts An army The king Jon was as confused as the wildlings Could Robb have returned Had the boy on the Iron Throne finally bestirred himself You best get back inside the tent he told Val

Across the field one column had washed over Harma Dogshead Another smashed into the flank of Tormund’s spearmen as he and his sons desperately tried to turn them The giants were climbing onto their mammoths though and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all he could see how the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains But there was fear on the wildling side as well hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle some of them blundering right under the hooves of garrons He saw an old woman’s dog cart veer into the path of three chariots to send them crashing into each other

Gods Val whispered gods why are they doing this

Go inside the tent and stay with Dalla It’s not safe out here It wouldn’t be a great deal safer inside but she didn’t need to hear that

I need to find the midwife Val said

You’re the midwife I’ll stay here until Mance comes back He had lost sight of Mance but now he found him again cutting his way through a knot of mounted men The mammoths had shattered the center column but the other two were closing like pincers On the eastern edge of the camps some archers were loosing fire arrows at the tents He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from his saddle and fling him forty feet with a flick of its trunk Wildlings streamed past women and children running from the battle some with men hurrying them along A few of them gave Jon dark looks but Longclaw was in his hand and no one troubled him Even Varamyr fled crawling off on his hands and knees

More and more men were pouring from the trees not only knights now but freeriders and mounted bowmen and men-at-arms in jacks and kettle helms dozens of men hundreds of men A blaze of banners flew above them The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils but he glimpsed a seahorse a field of birds a ring of flowers And yellow so much yellow yellow banners with a red device whose arms were those

East and north and northeast he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight but the attackers rode right over them The free folk still had the numbers but the attackers had steel armor and heavy horses In the thickest part of the fray Jon saw Mance standing tall in his stirrups His red-and-black cloak and raven-winged helm made him easy to pick out He had his sword raised and men were rallying to him when a wedge of knights smashed into them with lance and sword and longaxe Mance’s mare went up on her hind legs kicking and a spear took her through the breast Then the steel tide washed over him

It’s done Jon thought they’re breaking The wildlings were running throwing down their weapons Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and Thenns in bronze scales they were running Mance was gone someone was waving Harma’s head on a pole Tormund’s lines had broken Only the giants on their mammoths were holding hairy islands in a red steel sea The fires were leaping from tent to tent and some of the tall pines were going up as well And through the smoke another wedge of armored riders came on barded horses Floating above them were the largest banners yet royal standards as big as sheets a yellow one with long pointed tongues that showed a flaming heart and another like a sheet of beaten gold with a black stag prancing and rippling in the wind

Robert Jon thought for one mad moment remembering poor Owen but when the trumpets blew again and the knights charged the name they cried was Stannis Stannis STANNIS

Jon turned away and went inside the tent





ARYA

Outside the inn on a weathered gibbet a woman’s bones were twisting and rattling at every gust of wind

I know this inn There hadn’t been a gibbet outside the door when she had slept here with her sister Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane though We don’t want to go in Arya decided suddenly there might be ghosts

You know how long it’s been since I had a cup of wine Sandor swung down from the saddle Besides we need to learn who holds the ruby ford Stay with the horses if you want it’s no hair off my arse

What if they know you Sandor no longer troubled to hide his face He no longer seemed to care who knew him They might want to take you captive

Let them try He loosened his longsword in its scabbard and pushed through the door

Arya would never have a better chance to escape She could ride off on Craven and take Stranger too She chewed her lip Then she led the horses to the stables and went in after him
