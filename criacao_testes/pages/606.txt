523 For thus saith the LORD Ye have sold yourselves for nought and
ye shall be redeemed without money

524 For thus saith the Lord GOD My people went down aforetime into
Egypt to sojourn there and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause

525 Now therefore what have I here saith the LORD that my people
is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl
saith the LORD and my name continually every day is blasphemed

526 Therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know
in that day that I am he that doth speak behold it is I

527 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good
tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto Zion Thy
God reigneth  528 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the
voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when
the LORD shall bring again Zion

529 Break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of
Jerusalem for the LORD hath comforted his people he hath redeemed
Jerusalem

5210 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our
God

5211 Depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean
thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the
vessels of the LORD

5212 For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the
LORD will go before you and the God of Israel will be your rereward

5213 Behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and
extolled and be very high

5214 As many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more
than any man and his form more than the sons of men 5215 So shall
he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him
for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which
they had not heard shall they consider

531 Who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the LORD
revealed  532 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and
as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and
when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him

533 He is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he
was despised and we esteemed him not

534 Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted

535 But he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our
iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his
stripes we are healed

536 All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to
his own way and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all

537 He was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his
mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth

538 He was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare
his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for
the transgression of my people was he stricken

539 And he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his
death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his
mouth

5310 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him he hath put him to grief
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his
seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the LORD shall
prosper in his hand

5311 He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied
by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall
bear their iniquities

5312 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his
soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he
bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors

541 Sing O barren thou that didst not bear break forth into
singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for
more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married
wife saith the LORD

542 Enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the
curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and
strengthen thy stakes 543 For thou shalt break forth on the right
hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and
make the desolate cities to be inhabited
