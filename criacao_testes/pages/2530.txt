117 And the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium

118 And the people went about and gathered it and ground it in
mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of
it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil

119 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell
upon it

1110 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families
every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the LORD was
kindled greatly Moses also was displeased

1111 And Moses said unto the LORD Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me  1112 Have I conceived
all this people have I begotten them that thou shouldest say unto
me Carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers  1113
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep
unto me saying Give us flesh that we may eat

1114 I am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too
heavy for me

1115 And if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of
hand if I have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my
wretchedness

1116 And the LORD said unto Moses Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people
and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation that they may stand there with thee

1117 And I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take
of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not
thyself alone

1118 And say thou unto the people Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD saying Who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us
in Egypt therefore the LORD will give you flesh and ye shall eat

1119 Ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither
ten days nor twenty days 1120 But even a whole month until it come
out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye
have despised the LORD which is among you and have wept before him
saying Why came we forth out of Egypt  1121 And Moses said The
people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou
hast said I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month

1122 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice
them  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them
to suffice them  1123 And the LORD said unto Moses Is the LORDs
hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to
pass unto thee or not

1124 And Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them
round about the tabernacle

1125 And the LORD came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took
of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders
and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they
prophesied and did not cease

1126 But there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the
one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad and the spirit rested
upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out
unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp

1127 And there ran a young man and told Moses and said Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp

1128 And Joshua the son of Nun the servant of Moses one of his
young men answered and said My lord Moses forbid them

1129 And Moses said unto him Enviest thou for my sake would God
that all the LORDs people were prophets and that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them  1130 And Moses gat him into the camp he and
the elders of Israel

1131 And there went forth a wind from the LORD and brought quails
from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a days
journey on this side and as it were a days journey on the other
side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth

1132 And the people stood up all that day and all that night and
all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least
gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp

1133 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was
chewed the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague

1134 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah because
