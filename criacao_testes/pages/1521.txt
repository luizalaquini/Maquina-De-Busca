There’s another man Sam blurted out Lord Commander Mormont trusted him So did Donal Noye and Qhorin Halfhand Though he’s not as highly born as you he comes from old blood He was castle-born and castle-raised and he learned sword and lance from a knight and letters from a maester of the Citadel His father was a lord and his brother a king

Ser Denys stroked his long white beard Mayhaps he said after a long moment He is very young but… mayhaps He might serve I grant you though I would be more suitable I have no doubt of that I would be the wiser choice

Jon said there could be honor in a lie if it were told for the right reason Sam said If we do not choose a Lord Commander tonight King Stannis means to name Cotter Pyke He said as much to Maester Aemon this morning after all of you had left

I see Ser Denys rose I must think on this Thank you Samwell And give my thanks to Maester Aemon as well

Sam was trembling by the time he left the Lance What have I done he thought What have I said If they caught him in his lie they would… what Send me to the Wall Rip my entrails out Turn me into a wight Suddenly it all seemed absurd How could he be so frightened of Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister when he had seen a raven eating Small Paul’s face

Pyke was not pleased by his return You again Make it quick you are starting to annoy me

I only need a moment more Sam promised You won’t withdraw for Ser Denys you said but you might for someone else

Who is it this time Slayer You

No A fighter Donal Noye gave him the Wall when the wildlings came and he was the Old Bear’s squire The only thing is he’s bastard-born

Cotter Pyke laughed Bloody hell That would shove a spear up Mallister’s arse wouldn’t it Might be worth it just for that How bad could the boy be He snorted I’d be better though I’m what’s needed any fool can see that

Any fool Sam agreed even me But… well I shouldn’t be telling you but… King Stannis means to force Ser Denys on us if we do not choose a man tonight I heard him tell Maester Aemon that after the rest of you were sent away





Jon


Iron Emmett was a long lanky young ranger whose endurance strength and swordsmanship were the pride of Eastwatch Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore and woke the next day covered with bruises which was just the way he wanted it He would never get any better going up against the likes of Satin and Horse or even Grenn

Most days he gave as good as he got Jon liked to think but not today He had hardly slept last night and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt dressed and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up wrestling with Stannis Baratheon’s offer The lack of sleep was catching up with him now and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard driving him back on his heels with one long looping cut after another and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure Jon’s arm had gone numb from the shock of impact and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be growing heavier with every passing moment

He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple He staggered his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur

And then the years were gone and he was back at Winterfell once more wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate His sword was made of wood and it was Robb who stood facing him not Iron Emmett

Every morning they had trained together since they were big enough to walk Snow and Stark spinning and slashing about the wards of Winterfell shouting and laughing sometimes crying when there was no one else to see They were not little boys when they fought but knights and mighty heroes I’m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight Jon would call out and Robb would shout back Well I’m Florian the Fool Or Robb would say I’m the Young Dragon and Jon would reply I’m Ser Ryam Redwyne

That morning he called it first I’m Lord of Winterfell he cried as he had a hundred times before Only this time this time Robb had answered You can’t be Lord of Winterfell you’re bastard-born My lady mother says you can’t ever be the Lord of Winterfell

I thought I had forgotten that Jon could taste blood in his mouth from the blow he’d taken

In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett one man on either arm The ranger sat on the ground dazed his shield half in splinters the visor of his helm knocked askew and his sword six yards away Jon enough Halder was shouting he’s down you disarmed him Enough

No Not enough Never enough Jon let his sword drop I’m sorry he muttered Emmett are you hurt

Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend Lord Snow It was said amiably though Emmett was an amiable man and he loved the song of swords Warrior defend me he groaned now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt

That was too much Jon wrenched free of his friends and retreated to the armory alone His ears were still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt him He sat on the bench and buried his head in his hands Why am I so angry he asked himself but it was a stupid question Lord of Winterfell I could be the Lord of Winterfell My father’s heir

It was not Lord Eddard’s face he saw floating before him though it was Lady Catelyn’s With her deep blue eyes and hard cold mouth she looked a bit like Stannis Iron he thought but brittle She was looking at him the way she used to look at him at Winterfell whenever he had bested Robb at swords or sums or most anything Who are you that look had always seemed to say This is not your place Why are you here

His friends were still out in the practice yard but Jon was in no fit state to face them He left the armory by the back descending a steep flight of stone steps to the wormways the tunnels that linked the castle’s keeps and towers below the earth It was short walk to the bathhouse where he took a cold plunge to wash the sweat off and soaked in a hot stone tub The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles and made him think of Winterfell’s muddy pools steaming and bubbling in the godswood Winterfell he thought Theon left it burned and broken but I could restore it Surely his father would have wanted that and Robb as well They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins

You can’t be the Lord of Winterfell you’re bastard-born he heard Robb say again And the stone kings were growling at him with granite tongues You do not belong here This is not your place When Jon closed his eyes he saw the heart tree with its pale limbs red leaves and solemn face The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell Lord Eddard always said… but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots and feed it to the red woman’s hungry fire god I have no right he thought Winterfell belongs to the old gods

The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black I don’t know a man was saying in a voice thick with doubts Maybe if I knew the man better… Lord Stannis didn’t have much good to say of him I’ll tell you that

When has Stannis Baratheon ever had much good to say of anyone Ser Alliser’s flinty voice was unmistakable If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander we become his bannermen in all but name Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end He’s already beaten Stannis once on the Blackwater

Lord Tywin favors Slynt said Bowen Marsh in a fretful anxious voice I can show you his letter Othell ‘Our faithful friend and servant’ he called him

Jon Snow sat up suddenly and the three men froze at the sound of the slosh My lords he said with cold courtesy

What are you doing here bastard Thorne asked

Bathing But don’t let me spoil your plotting Jon climbed from the water dried dressed and left them to conspire

Outside he found he had no idea where he was going He walked past the shell of the Lord Commander’s Tower where once he’d saved the Old Bear from a dead man past the spot where Ygritte had died with that sad smile on her face past the King’s Tower where he and Satin and Deaf Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and his Thenns past the heaped and charred remains of the great wooden stair The inner gate was open so Jon went down the tunnel through the Wall He could feel the cold around him the weight of all the ice above his head He walked past the place where Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty had fought and died together through the new outer gate and back into the pale cold sunlight

Only then did he permit himself to stop to take a breath to think Othell Yarwyck was not a man of strong convictions except when it came to wood and stone and mortar The Old Bear had known that Thorne and Marsh will sway him Yarwyck will support Lord Janos and Lord Janos will be chosen Lord Commander And what does that leave me if not Winterfell

A wind swirled against the Wall tugging at his cloak He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way heat comes off a fire Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again The afternoon was growing old and the sun was low in the west A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined his wildling captives within a ring of ditches sharpened stakes and high wooden fences To his left were three great firepits where the victors had burned the bodies of all the free folk to die beneath the Wall huge pelted giants and little Hornfoot men alike The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched weeds and hardened pitch but Mance’s people had left traces of themselves everywhere a torn hide that might have been part of a tent a giant’s maul the wheel of a chariot a broken spear a pile of mammoth dung On the edge of the haunted forest where the tents had been Jon found an oakwood stump and sat

Ygritte wanted me to be a wildling Stannis wants me to be the Lord of Winterfell But what do I want The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where it curved through the western hills Jon watched as that towering expanse of ice took on the reds and pinks of sunset Would I sooner be hanged for a turncloak by Lord Janos or forswear my vows marry Val and become the Lord of Winterfell It seemed an easy choice when he thought of it in those terms… though if Ygritte had still been alive it might have been even easier Val was a stranger to him She was not hard on the eyes certainly and she had been sister to Mance Rayder’s queen but still…

I would need to steal her if I wanted her love but she might give me children I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of since he decided to live his life on the Wall I could name him Robb Val would want to keep her sister’s son but we could foster him at Winterfell and Gilly’s boy as well Sam would never need to tell his lie We’d find a place for Gilly too and Sam could come visit her once a year or so Mance’s son and Craster’s would grow up brothers as I once did with Robb

He wanted it Jon knew then He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything I have always wanted it he thought guiltily May the gods forgive me It was a hunger inside him sharp as a dragonglass blade A hunger… he could feel it It was food he needed prey a red deer that stank of fear or a great elk proud and defiant He needed to kill and fill his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood His mouth began to water with the thought

It was a long moment before he understood what was happening When he did he bolted to his feet Ghost He turned toward the wood and there he came padding silently out of the green dusk the breath coming warm and white from his open jaws Ghost he shouted and the direwolf broke into a run He was leaner than he had been but bigger as well and the only sound he made was the soft crunch of dead leaves beneath his paws When he reached Jon he leapt and they wrestled amidst brown grass and long shadows as the stars came out above them Gods wolf where have you been Jon said when Ghost stopped worrying at his forearm I thought you’d died on me like Robb and Ygritte and all the rest I’ve had no sense of you not since I climbed the Wall not even in dreams The direwolf had no answer but he licked Jon’s face with a tongue like a wet rasp and his eyes caught the last light and shone like two great red suns

Red eyes Jon realized but not like Melisandre’s He had a weirwood’s eyes Red eyes red mouth white fur Blood and bone like a heart tree He belongs to the old gods this one And he alone of all the direwolves was white Six pups they’d found in the late summer snows him and Robb five that were grey and black and brown for the five Starks and one white as white as Snow

He had his answer then

Beneath the Wall the queen’s men were kindling their nightfire He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away Come Ghost Jon told the wolf With me You’re hungry I know I could feel it They ran together for the gate circling wide around the nightfire where reaching flames clawed at the black belly of the night

The king’s men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black They stopped as Jon went by and gaped at him None of them had ever seen a direwolf before he realized and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods As he walked toward the armory Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window I’m sorry he thought I’m not the man to steal you out of there

In the practice yard he came upon a dozen king’s men with torches and long spears in their hands Their sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled and a couple of his men lowered their spears until the knight who led them said Move aside and let them pass To Jon he said You’re late for your supper

Then get out of my way ser Jon replied and he did

He could hear the noise even before he reached the bottom of the steps raised voices curses someone pounding on a table Jon stepped into the vault all but unnoticed His brothers crowded the benches and the tables but more were standing and shouting than were sitting and no one was eating There was no food What’s happening here Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about turncloaks and treason Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower… some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again demanding quiet but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling

Pyp was the first to see Jon He grinned at the sight of Ghost put two fingers in his mouth and whistled as only a mummer’s boy could whistle The shrill sound cut through the clamor like a sword As Jon walked toward the tables more of the brothers took note and fell quiet A hush spread across the cellar until the only sounds were Jon’s heels clicking on the stone floor and the soft crackle of the logs in the hearth
