tion like the remarkable creatures known as Chain
Salpae which distinctly organized in other respects have
one will common to a whole family Some were as
usual in snow-white smock-frocks of Russia duck and
some in whitey-brown ones of drabbet -- marked on the
wrists breasts backs and sleeves with honeycomb-work
Two or three womcn in pattens brought up the rear
  The Philistines be upon us said Liddy making her
nose white against the glass
  Oh very well Maryann go down and keep them
in the kitchen till I am dressed and then show them in
to me in the hall

HALF-AN-HOUR later Bathsheba in finished dress
and followed by Liddy entered the upper end of the old
hall to find that her men had all deposited themselves on
a long form and a settle at the lower extremity She sat
down at a table and opened th e time-book pen in her
hand with a canvas money-bag beside her From this
she poured a small heap of coin Liddy chose a
position at her elbow and began to sew sometimes
pausing and looking round or with the air of a privileged
person taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying before
her and surveying it merely as a work of art while
strictly preventing her countenance from expressing any
wish to possess it as money
  Now before I begin men said Bathsheba I have
two matters to speak of The first is that the bailiff is
dismissed for thieving and that I have formed a resolu+
tion to have no bailiff at all but to manage everything
with my own head and hands
  The men breathed an audible breath of amazement
  The next matter is have you heard anything of
Fanny
  Nothing maam
  Have you done anything
  I met Farmer Boldwood said Jacob Smallbury and
I went with him and two of his men and dragged New+
mill Pond but we found nothing
  And the new shepherd have been to Bucks Head
by Yalbury thinking she had gone there but nobody
had seed her said Laban Tall
  Hasnt William Smallbury been to Casterbridge
  Yes maam but hes not yet come home He
promised to be back by six
  It wants a quarter to six at present said Bathsheba
 
P 128
looking at her watch I daresay hell be in directly
Well now then -- she looked into the book -- Joseph
Poorgrass are you there
  Yes sir -- maam I mane said the person addressed
I be the personal name of Poorgrass
  And what are you
  Nothing in my own eye In the eye of other people
 -- well I dont say it though public thought will out
  What do you do on the farm
  I do do carting things all the year and in seed time I
shoots the rooks and sparrows and helps at pig-killing sir
  How much to you 
  Please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny
where twas a bad one sir -- maam I mane
  Quite correct Now here are ten shillings in addi+
tion as a small present as I am a new comer
  Bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being
generous in public and Henery Fray who had drawn
up towards her chair lifted his eyebrows and fingers to
express amazement on a small scale
  How much do I owe you -- that man in the corner --
whats your name continued Bathsheba
  Matthew Moon maam said a singular framework of
clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them
which advanced with the toes in no definite direction
forwards but turned in or out as they chanced to swing
  Matthew Mark did you say -- speak out -- I shall
not hurt you inquired the young farmer kindly
  Matthew Moon mem said Henery Fray correct+
ingly from behind her chair to which point he had
edged himself
  Matthew Moon murmured Bathsheba turning her
bright eyes to the book Ten and twopence halfpenny
is the sum put down to you I see
  Yes misess said Matthew as the rustle of wind
among dead leaves
  Here it is and ten shillings Now -the next -- Andrew
Randle you are a new man I hear How come you to
leave your last farm
P 129
  P-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease maam p-p-p-p-pl-pl+
pl-pl-please maam-pleasem-pleasem --  --  
  As a stammering man mem said Henery Fray in
an undertone and they turned him away because the
only time he ever did speak plain he said his soul was
his own and other iniquities to the squire A can cuss
mem as well as you or I but a cant speak a common
speech to save his life
  Andrew Randle heres yours -- finish thanking me
in a day or two Temperance Miller -- oh heres another
Soberness -- both women I suppose
