Catelyn bowed her head Thank you I have not lost this child at least

We must talk Robb went on You and my uncles Of this and    other things Steward call an end

Utherydes Wayn slammed his staff on the floor and shouted the dismissal and river lords and northerners alike moved toward the doors It was only then that Catelyn realized what was amiss The wolf The wolf is not here Where is Grey Wind She knew the direwolf had returned with Robb she had heard the dogs but he was not in the hall not at her son’s side where he belonged

Before she could think to question Robb however she found herself surrounded by a circle of well-wishers Lady Mormont took her hand and said My lady if Cersei Lannister held two of my daughters I would have done the same The Greatjon no respecter of proprieties lifted her off her feet and squeezed her arms with his huge hairy hands Your wolf pup mauled the Kingslayer once he’ll do it again if need be Galbart Glover and Lord Jason Mallister were cooler and Jonos Bracken almost icy but their words were courteous enough Her brother was the last to approach her I pray for your girls as well Cat I hope you do not doubt that

Of course not She kissed him I love you for it

When all the words were done the Great Hall of Riverrun was empty save for Robb the three Tullys and the six strangers Catelyn could not place She eyed them curiously My lady sers are you new to my son’s cause

New said the younger knight him of the seashells but fierce in our courage and firm in our loyalties as I hope to prove to you my lady

Robb looked uncomfortable Mother he said may I present the Lady Sybell the wife of Lord Gawen Westerling of the Crag The older woman came forward with solemn mien Her husband was one of those we took captive in the Whispering Wood

Westerling yes Catelyn thought Their banner is six seashells white on sand A minor house sworn to the Lannisters

Robb beckoned the other strangers forward each in turn Ser Rolph Spicer Lady Sybell’s brother He was castellan at the Crag when we took it The pepperpot knight inclined his head A square-built man with a broken nose and a close-cropped grey beard he looked doughty enough The children of Lord Gawen and Lady Sybell Ser Raynald Westerling The seashell knight smiled beneath a bushy mustache Young lean rough-hewn he had good teeth and a thick mop of chestnut hair Elenya The little girl did a quick curtsy Rollam Westerling my squire The boy started to kneel saw no one else was kneeling and bowed instead

The honor is mine Catelyn said Can Robb have won the Crag’s allegiance If so it was no wonder the Westerlings were with him Casterly Rock did not suffer such betrayals gently Not since Tywin Lannister had been old enough to go to war   

The maid came forward last and very shy Robb took her hand Mother he said I have the great honor to present you the Lady Jeyne Westerling Lord Gawen’s elder daughter and my    ah    my lady wife

The first thought that flew across Catelyn’s mind was No that cannot be you are only a child

The second was And besides you have pledged another

The third was Mother have mercy Robb what have you done

Only then came her belated remembrance Follies done for love He has bagged me neat as a hare in a snare I seem to have already forgiven him Mixed with her annoyance was a rueful admiration the scene had been staged with the cunning worthy of a master mummer    or a king Catelyn saw no choice but to take Jeyne Westerling’s hands I have a new daughter she said more stiffly than she’d intended She kissed the terrified girl on both cheeks Be welcome to our hall and hearth

Thank you my lady I shall be a good and true wife to Robb I swear And as wise a queen as I can

Queen Yes this pretty little girl is a queen I must remember that She was pretty undeniably with her chestnut curls and heart-shaped face and that shy smile Slender but with good hips Catelyn noted She should have no trouble bearing children at least

Lady Sybell took a hand before any more was said We are honored to be joined to House Stark my lady but we are also very weary We have come a long way in a short time Perhaps we might retire to our chambers so you may visit with your son

That would be best Robb kissed his Jeyne The steward will find you suitable accommodations

I’ll take you to him Ser Edmure Tully volunteered

You are most kind said Lady Sybell

Must I go too asked the boy Rollam I’m your squire

Robb laughed But I’m not in need of squiring just now

Oh

His Grace has gotten along for sixteen years without you Rollam said Ser Raynald of the seashells He will survive a few hours more I think Taking his little brother firmly by the hand he walked him from the hall

Your wife is lovely Catelyn said when they were out of earshot and the Westerlings seem worthy    though Lord Gawen is Tywin Lannister’s sworn man is he not

Yes Jason Mallister captured him in the Whispering Wood and has been holding him at Seagard for ransom Of course I’ll free him now though he may not wish to join me We wed without his consent I fear and this marriage puts him in dire peril The Crag is not strong For love of me Jeyne may lose all

And you she said softly have lost the Freys

His wince told all She understood the angry voices now why Perwyn Frey and Martyn Rivers had left in such haste trampling Robb’s banner into the ground as they went

Dare I ask how many swords come with your bride Robb

Fifty A dozen knights His voice was glum as well it might be When the marriage contract had been made at the Twins old Lord Walder Frey had sent Robb off with a thousand mounted knights and near three thousand foot Jeyne is bright as well as beautiful And kind as well She has a gentle heart

It is swords you need not gentle hearts How could you do this Robb How could you be so heedless so stupid How could you be so    so very    young Reproaches would not serve here however All she said was Tell me how this came to be

I took her castle and she took my heart Robb smiled The Crag was weakly garrisoned so we took it by storm one night Black Walder and the Smalljon led scaling parties over the walls while I broke the main gate with a ram I took an arrow in the arm just before Ser Rolph yielded us the castle It seemed nothing at first but it festered Jeyne had me taken to her own bed and she nursed me until the fever passed And she was with me when the Greatjon brought me the news of    of Winterfell Bran and Rickon He seemed to have trouble saying his brothers’ names That night she    she comforted me Mother

Catelyn did not need to be told what sort of comfort Jeyne Westerling had offered her son And you wed her the next day

He looked her in the eyes proud and miserable all at once It was the only honorable thing to do She’s gentle and sweet Mother she will make me a good wife

Perhaps That will not appease Lord Frey

I know her son said stricken I’ve made a botch of everything but the battles haven’t I I thought the battles would be the hard part but    if I had listened to you and kept Theon as my hostage I’d still rule the north and Bran and Rickon would be alive and safe in Winterfell

Perhaps Or not Lord Balon might still have chanced war The last time he reached for a crown it cost him two sons He might have thought it a bargain to lose only one this time She touched his arm What happened with the Freys after you wed

Robb shook his head With Ser Stevron I might have been able to make amends but Ser Ryman is dull-witted as a stone and Black Walder    that one was not named for the color of his beard I promise you He went so far as to say that his sisters would not be loath to wed a widower I would have killed him for that if Jeyne had not begged me to be merciful

You have done House Frey a grievous insult Robb

I never meant to Ser Stevron died for me and Olyvar was as loyal a squire as any king could want He asked to stay with me but Ser Ryman took him with the rest All their strength The Greatjon urged me to attack them   

Fighting your own in the midst of your enemies she said It would have been the end of you

Yes I thought perhaps we could arrange other matches for Lord Walder’s daughters Ser Wendel Manderly has offered to take one and the Greatjon tells me his uncles wish to wed again If Lord Walder will be reasonable—

He is not reasonable said Catelyn He is proud and prickly to a fault You know that He wanted to be grandfather to a king You will not appease him with the offer of two hoary old brigands and the second son of the fattest man in the Seven Kingdoms Not only have you broken your oath but you’ve slighted the honor of the Twins by choosing a bride from a lesser house

Robb bristled at that The Westerlings are better blood than the Freys They’re an ancient line descended from the First Men The Kings of the Rock sometimes wed Westerlings before the Conquest and there was another Jeyne Westerling who was queen to King Maegor three hundred years ago

All of which will only salt Lord Walder’s wounds It has always rankled him that older houses look down on the Freys as upstarts This insult is not the first he’s borne to hear him tell it Jon Arryn was disinclined to foster his grandsons and my father refused the offer of one of his daughters for Edmure She inclined her head toward her brother as he rejoined them

Your Grace Brynden Blackfish said perhaps we had best continue this in private

Yes Robb sounded tired I would kill for a cup of wine The audience chamber I think

As they started up the steps Catelyn asked the question that had been troubling her since she entered the hall Robb where is Grey Wind
