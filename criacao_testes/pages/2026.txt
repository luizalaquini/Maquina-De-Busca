You’ll miss me all the time in your Red Keep she said as she led him to her room All alone in your cold bed in your Tower of the Hand

Too true Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him but his lord father had forbidden it You will not take the whore to court Lord Tywin had commanded Bringing her to the city was as much defiance as he dared All his authority derived from his father the girl had to understand that You won’t be far he promised You’ll have a house with guards and servants and I’ll visit as often as I’m able

Shae kicked shut the door Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window he could make out the Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya’s Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a different sight Bending Shae took her gown by the hem drew it over her head and tossed it aside She did not believe in smallclothes You’ll never be able to rest she said as she stood before him pink and nude and lovely one hand braced on her hip You’ll think of me every time you go to bed Then you’ll get hard and you’ll have no one to help you and you’ll never be able to sleep unless you—she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well—is that why they call it the Tower of the Hand m’lord

Be quiet and kiss me he commanded

He could taste the wine on her lips and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches My lion she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress My sweet lord my giant of Lannister Tyrion pushed her toward the bed When he entered her she screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb and her nails left gouges in his back He’d never had a pain he liked half so well

Fool he thought to himself afterward as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets Will you never learn dwarf She’s a whore damn you it’s your coin she loves not your cock Remember Tysha Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple it stiffened at the touch and he could see the mark on her breast where he’d bitten her in his passion

So what will you do m’lord now that you’re the Hand of the King Shae asked him as he cupped that warm sweet flesh

Something Cersei will never expect Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck I’ll do    justice





BRAN

Bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets Abed the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him abed the room was his cell and Winterfell his prison Yet outside his window the wide world still called

He could not walk nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had but he could still look He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars

Of late he often dreamed of wolves They are talking to me brother to brother he told himself when the direwolves howled He could almost understand them    not quite not truly but almost    as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten The Walders might be scared of them but the Starks had wolf blood Old Nan told him so Though it is stronger in some than in others she warned

Summer’s howls were long and sad full of grief and longing Shaggydog’s were more savage Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell instead of only two    two where there had once been six Do they miss their brothers and sisters too Bran wondered Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost to Nymeria and Lady’s Shade Do they want them to come home and be a pack together

Who can know the mind of a wolf Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled Bran’s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence and his duties left him little time for idle questions

It’s freedom they’re calling for declared Farlen who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did They don’t like being walled up and who’s to blame them Wild things belong in the wild not in a castle

They want to hunt agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew A wolf smells better’n any man Like as not they’ve caught the scent o’ prey

Maester Luwin did not think so Wolves often howl at the moon These are howling at the comet See how bright it is Bran Perchance they think it is the moon

When Bran repeated that to Osha she laughed aloud Your wolves have more wit than your maester the wildling woman said They know truths the grey man has forgotten The way she said it made him shiver and when he asked what the comet meant she answered Blood and fire boy and nothing sweet

Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire It is the sword that slays the season he replied and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn so doubtless he was right

Though Old Nan did not think so and she’d lived longer than any of them Dragons she said lifting her head and sniffing She was near blind and could not see the comet yet she claimed she could smell it It be dragons boy she insisted Bran got no princes from Nan no more than he ever had

Hodor said only Hodor That was all he ever said

And still the direwolves howled The guards on the walls muttered curses hounds in the kennels barked furiously horses kicked at their stalls the Walders shivered by their fire and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights Only Bran did not mind Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran’s window Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls loping round like sentries He wished that he could see them

He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower and farther back the First Keep squat and round its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings inside and out he had climbed them all scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs Their rooftops had been his secret places and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends

And then he had fallen

Bran did not remember falling yet they said he had so he supposed it must be true He had almost died When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened he got a queer tight feeling in his belly And now he could not climb nor walk nor run nor swordfight and the dreams he’d dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head

Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen and for long after as he lay broken in his bed Robb had told him so before he went away to war Summer had mourned for him and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father’s death the wolves had known that too Bran had been in the maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls

Who are they mourning now Had some enemy slain the King in the North who used to be his brother Robb Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall Had his mother died or one of his sisters Or was this something else as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think

If I were truly a direwolf I would understand the song he thought wistfully In his wolf dreams he could race up the sides of mountains jagged icy mountains taller than any tower and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him the way it used to be

Oooo Bran cried tentatively He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet Ooooooooooooooooooo ahooooooooooooooo he howled It sounded stupid high and hollow and quavering a little boy’s howl not a wolf’s Yet Summer gave answer his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one and Shaggydog made it a chorus Bran haroooed again They howled together last of their pack

The noise brought a guard to his door Hayhead with the wen on his nose He peered in saw Bran howling out the window and said What’s this my prince

It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince though he was Robb’s heir and Robb was King in the North now He turned his head to howl at the guard Oooooooo Oo-oo-oooooooooooo

Hayhead screwed up his face Now you stop that there

Ooo-ooo-oooooo Ooo-ooo-ooooooooooooooooo

The guardsman retreated When he came back Maester Luwin was with him all in grey his chain tight about his neck Bran those beasts make sufficient noise without your help He crossed the room and put his hand on the boy’s brow The hour grows late you ought to be fast asleep

I’m talking to the wolves Bran brushed the hand away

Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed

I can get to bed myself Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall so Bran could pull himself about the room with his arms It was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache but he hated being carried Anyway I don’t have to sleep if I don’t want to

All men must sleep Bran Even princes

When I sleep I turn into a wolf Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night Do wolves dream

All creatures dream I think yet not as men do

Do dead men dream Bran asked thinking of his father In the dark crypts below Winterfell a stonemason was chiseling out his father’s likeness in granite

Some say yes some no the maester answered The dead themselves are silent on the matter

Do trees dream

Trees No   

They do Bran said with sudden certainty They dream tree dreams I dream of a tree sometimes A weirwood like the one in the godswood It calls to me The wolf dreams are better I smell things and sometimes I can taste the blood

Maester Luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck If you would only spend more time with the other children—

I hate the other children Bran said meaning the Walders I commanded you to send them away

Luwin grew stern The Freys are your lady mother’s wards sent here to be fostered at her express command It is not for you to expel them nor is it kind If we turned them out where would they go
