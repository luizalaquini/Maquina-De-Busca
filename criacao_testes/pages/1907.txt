Having found a peak which is thought to represent a pitch pulse
one could define a blanking period based upon the current
pitch estimate within which the next pitch pulse could not
occur  When this period has expired the next pitch pulse is
sought  At first a stringent criterion should be used for
identifying the next peak as a pitch pulse but it can gradually be
relaxed if time goes on without a suitable pulse being
located  Figure 415 shows a convenient way of doing this  a
decaying exponential is begun at the end of the blanking period
and when a peak shows above it is identified as a pitch pulse
FC Figure 415
One big advantage of this type of algorithm is that the data is
greatly reduced by considering peaks only em which can be
detected by simple hardware  Thus it can permit real-time
operation on a small processor with minimal special-purpose
hardware

Such a pitch pulse detector is exceedingly simplistic and will
often identify the pitch incorrectly  However it can be used
in conjunction with other features to produce good pitch
estimates  Gold and Rabiner 1969 who pioneered the
approach used six features

The features are symmetric with regard to peaks and valleys
The first feature is the one described above and the second one works in
exactly the same way
The third feature records the
height between each valley and the succeeding peak and fourth
uses the depth between each peak and the succeeding valley  The
purpose of the final two detectors is to eliminate secondary
but rather large peaks from consideration  Figure 416 shows
the kind of waveform on which the other features might
incorrectly double the pitch but the last two features identify
correctly

Gold and Rabiner also included the last two pitch estimates from each
feature detector
Furthermore for each feature the present estimate
was added to the previous one to make a fourth and the previous one to
the one before that to make a fifth and all three were added together
to make a sixth so that for each feature there were 6 separate estimates of
pitch  The reason for this is that if three consecutive estimates of the
fundamental period are T sub 0 T sub 1 and T sub 2 then if some peaks are
being falsely identified the actual period could be any of

It is essential to do this because
a feature of a given type can occur more than once in a pitch period em
secondary peaks usually exist
pp
Six features each contributing six separate estimates makes 36 estimates
of pitch in all
An overall figure was obtained from this
set by selecting the most popular estimate within some
pre-specified tolerance  The complete scheme has been
evaluated extensively Rabiner

favourably with other methods

However it must be admitted that this procedure seems to be rather
ul
ad hoc
as are many other successful speech parameter estimation
algorithms  Specifically it is not easy to predict what
kinds of waveforms it will fail on and evaluation of it can
only be pragmatic  When used to
estimate the pitch of musical
instruments and singers over a 6-octave range 40 Hz to 25 kHz
