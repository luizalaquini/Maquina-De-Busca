correctly the prediction will closely model the resonances of the
vocal tract  Thus the error will actually be zero except at pitch
pulses

Figure 617 shows a segment of voiced speech together with the prediction
error often called the prediction residual
FC Figure 617
It is apparent that the
error is indeed small except at pitch pulses
This suggests that a good way to determine the pitch period is to examine
the error signal perhaps by looking at its autocorrelation function
As with all pitch detection methods one must be
careful  spurious peaks can occur especially in nasal sounds when
the all-pole model provided by linear prediction fails  Continuity
constraints which use previous values of pitch period when determining
which peak to accept as a new pitch impulse can eliminate many of these
spurious peaks  Unvoiced speech should produce an error signal with no
prominent peaks and this needs to be detected
Voiced fricatives are a difficult case  peaks should be present
but the general noise level of the error signal will be greater than
it is in
purely voiced speech
Such considerations have been taken into account in a practical pitch
estimation system based upon this technique Markel 1972

This method of pitch detection highlights another advantage of the lattice
analysis technique  When using autocorrelation or covariance analysis to
determine the filter or reflection coefficients the error signal is not
normally produced  It can of course be found by taking the speech samples
which constitute the current frame and running them through an analysis
filter whose parameters are those determined by the analysis but this
is a computationally demanding exercise for the filter must run at the
speech sampling rate say 8 kHz instead of at the frame rate say 50 Hz
Usually pitch is estimated by other methods like those discussed in
Chapter 4 when using autocorrelation or covariance linear prediction
However we have seen above that with the lattice method the error
signal is produced as a byproduct  it appears at the right-hand end
of the  upper path of the lattice chain  Thus it is already available
for use in determining pitch periods

In this section the coding requirements of linear predictive parameters
will be examined  The parameters that need to be stored or transmitted
are

NP
pitch
NP
voiced-unvoiced flag
NP
overall amplitude level
NP
filter coefficients or reflection coefficients
LE
The first three are parameters of the excitation source
They can be derived directly from the error signal as indicated above if
it is generated as it is in lattice implementations or by other
methods if no error signal is calculated
The filter or reflection coefficients are of course the main product
of linear predictive analysis
pp
It is generally agreed that around 60 levels logarithmically spaced
are needed to represent pitch for telephone quality speech
The voiced-unvoiced indication requires one bit but since pitch is
irrelevant in unvoiced speech it can be coded as one of the pitch
levels  For example with 6-bit coding of pitch the value 0 can be
reserved to indicate unvoiced speech with values 1-63 indicating the
pitch of voiced speech
The overall gain has not been discussed above  it is simply the average
amplitude of the error signal  Five bits on a logarithmic scale
are sufficient to represent it
pp
Filter coefficients are not very amenable to quantization  At least
8-10 bits are required for each one  However reflection coefficients
are better behaved and 5-6 bits each seems adequate  The number of
coefficients that must be stored or transmitted is the same as the
order of the linear prediction  10 is commonly used for low-quality
speech with as many as 15 for higher qualities
pp
These figures give around 100 bitsframe for a 10th order system using
filter coefficients and around 65 bitsframe for a 10th order system
using reflection coefficients  Frame lengths vary between 10 msec
and 25 msec depending on the quality desired  Thus for 20 msec frames
the data rates work out at around 5000 bits using filter coefficients
and 3250 bits using reflection coefficients
pp
Substantially lower data rates can be achieved by more careful
coding of parameters  In 1976 the US Government defined a standard
coding scheme for 10-pole linear prediction with a data rate of
2400 bits em conveniently chosen as one of the
commonly-used rates for serial data transmission
This standard called LPC-10 tackles the difficult problem of
protection against transmission errors Fussell
