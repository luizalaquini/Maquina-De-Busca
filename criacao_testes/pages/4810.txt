1316 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be
numbered

1317 Arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it for I will give it unto thee

1318 Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of
Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the LORD

141 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar
Arioch king of Ellasar Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of
nations 142 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom and with
Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah and Shemeber king of
Zeboiim and the king of Bela which is Zoar

143 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim which is
the salt sea

144 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled

145 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that
were with him and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim and the
Zuzims in Ham and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim 146 And the
Horites in their mount Seir unto Elparan which is by the wilderness

147 And they returned and came to Enmishpat which is Kadesh and
smote all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites that
dwelt in Hazezontamar

148 And there went out the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah
and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela
the same is Zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of
Siddim 149 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and with Tidal king
of nations and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar
four kings with five

1410 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled
to the mountain

1411 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their
victuals and went their way

1412 And they took Lot Abrams brothers son who dwelt in Sodom
and his goods and departed

1413 And there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew
for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite brother of Eshcol and
brother of Aner and these were confederate with Abram

1414 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he
armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and
eighteen and pursued them unto Dan

1415 And he divided himself against them he and his servants by
night and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah which is on the
left hand of Damascus

1416 And he brought back all the goods and also brought again his
brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the people

1417 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at
the valley of Shaveh which is the kings dale

1418 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and
he was the priest of the most high God

1419 And he blessed him and said Blessed be Abram of the most high
God possessor of heaven and earth 1420 And blessed be the most high
God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand And he gave him
tithes of all

1421 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram Give me the persons and
take the goods to thyself

1422 And Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand
unto the LORD the most high God the possessor of heaven and earth
1423 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and
that I will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say
I have made Abram rich 1424 Save only that which the young men have
eaten and the portion of the men which went with me Aner Eshcol
and Mamre let them take their portion

151 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
vision saying Fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding
great reward

152 And Abram said LORD God what wilt thou give me seeing I go
childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus
153 And Abram said Behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo
one born in my house is mine heir

154 And behold the word of the LORD came unto him saying This
shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir

155 And he brought him forth abroad and said Look now toward
