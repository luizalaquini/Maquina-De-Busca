You think to outlive me dwarf The sellsword grinned He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen’s shield had cracked a tooth in half

Tyrion shrugged Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy I know you love the taste of horse Bronn but if our mounts die under us this time we’ll be trying to saddle shadowcats… and if truth be told I think the clans will find us no matter what we do Their eyes are all around us He swept a gloved hand over the high wind-carved crags that surrounded them

Bronn grimaced Then we’re dead men Lannister

If so I prefer to die comfortable Tyrion replied We need a fire The nights are cold up here and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits Do you suppose there’s any game to be had Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef hard cheese and stale bread but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester

I can find meat Beneath a fall of black hair Bronn’s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously I should leave you here with your fool’s fire If I took your horse I’d have twice the chance to make it through What would you do then dwarf

Die most like Tyrion stooped to get another stick

You don’t think I’d do it

You’d do it in an instant if it meant your life You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly Bronn had yanked back the man’s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound

He was good as dead Bronn said and his moaning was bringing them down on us Chiggen would have done the same for me… and he was no friend only a man I rode with Make no mistake dwarf I fought for you but I do not love you

It was your blade I needed Tyrion said not your love He dumped his armful of wood on the ground

Bronn grinned You’re bold as any sellsword I’ll give you that How did you know I’d take your part

Know Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire I tossed the dice Back at the inn you and Chiggen helped take me captive Why The others saw it as their duty for the honor of the lords they served but not you two You had no lord no duty and precious little honor so why trouble to involve yourselves He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he’d gathered to serve as kindling Well why do sellswords do anything For gold You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help perhaps even take you into her service Here that should do I hope Do you have a flint

Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint Tyrion caught it in the air

My thanks he said The thing is you did not know the Starks Lord Eddard is a proud honorable and honest man and his lady wife is worse Oh no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste but that’s the most you could have hoped for The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them and if truth be told you and Chiggen were lowborn scum Tyrion struck the flint against his dagger trying for a spark Nothing

Bronn snorted You have a bold tongue little man One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it

Everyone tells me that Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword Did I offend you My pardons… but you are scum Bronn make no mistake Duty honor friendship what’s that to you No don’t trouble yourself we both know the answer Still you’re not stupid Once we reached the Vale Lady Stark had no more need of you… but I did and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold When the moment came to toss the dice I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay Happily for me you did He slammed stone and steel together again fruitlessly

Here said Bronn squatting I’ll do it He took the knife and flint from Tyrion’s hands and struck sparks on his first try A curl of bark began to smolder

Well done Tyrion said Scum you may be but you’re undeniably useful and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime What do you want Bronn Gold Land Women Keep me alive and you’ll have it

Bronn blew gently on the fire and the flames leapt up higher And if you die

Why then I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere Tyrion said grinning The gold ends when I do

The fire was blazing up nicely Bronn stood tucked the flint back into his pouch and tossed Tyrion his dagger Fair enough he said My sword’s yours then… but don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and m’lord you every time you take a shit I’m no man’s toady

Nor any man’s friend Tyrion said I’ve no doubt you’d betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark if you saw a profit in it If the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out remember this Bronn—I’ll match their price whatever it is I like living And now do you think you could do something about finding us some supper

Take care of the horses Bronn said unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip He strode into the trees

An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed the fire was crackling away merrily and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames spitting and hissing All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid Tyrion said

That a woman and another dozen swords Bronn said He sat cross-legged beside the fire honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel It will be full dark soon the sellsword pointed out I’ll take first watch… for all the good it will do us It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep

Oh I imagine they’ll be here long before it comes to sleep The smell of the roasting meat made Tyrion’s mouth water

Bronn watched him across the fire You have a plan he said flatly with a scrape of steel on stone
