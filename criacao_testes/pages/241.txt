returned to Ekron the same day

617 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
for a trespass offering unto the LORD for Ashdod one for Gaza one
for Askelon one for Gath one for Ekron one 618 And the golden
mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines
belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country
villages even unto the great stone of Abel whereon they set down the
ark of the LORD which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
Joshua the Bethshemite

619 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh because they had looked into
the ark of the LORD even he smote of the people fifty thousand and
threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the LORD had
smitten many of the people with a great slaughter

620 And the men of Bethshemesh said Who is able to stand before this
holy LORD God and to whom shall he go up from us  621 And they sent
messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim saying The
Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD come ye down and
fetch it up to you

71 And the men of Kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the
LORD and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD

72 And it came to pass while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim that
the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of
Israel lamented after the LORD

73 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying If ye do
return unto the LORD with all your hearts then put away the strange
gods and Ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the
LORD and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of
the Philistines

74 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth and
served the LORD only

75 And Samuel said Gather all Israel to Mizpeh and I will pray for
you unto the LORD

76 And they gathered together to Mizpeh and drew water and poured
it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there We
have sinned against the LORD And Samuel judged the children of Israel
in Mizpeh

77 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
gathered together to Mizpeh the lords of the Philistines went up
against Israel And when the children of Israel heard it they were
afraid of the Philistines

78 And the children of Israel said to Samuel Cease not to cry unto
the LORD our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines

79 And Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt
offering wholly unto the LORD and Samuel cried unto the LORD for
Israel and the LORD heard him

710 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering the Philistines
drew near to battle against Israel but the LORD thundered with a
great thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them
and they were smitten before Israel

711 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh and pursued the
Philistines and smote them until they came under Bethcar

712 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen and
called the name of it Ebenezer saying Hitherto hath the LORD helped
us

713 So the Philistines were subdued and they came no more into the
coast of Israel and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines
all the days of Samuel

714 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
restored to Israel from Ekron even unto Gath and the coasts thereof
did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines And there was
peace between Israel and the Amorites

715 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life

716 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal
and Mizpeh and judged Israel in all those places

717 And his return was to Ramah for there was his house and there
he judged Israel and there he built an altar unto the LORD

81 And it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons
judges over Israel

82 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his
second Abiah they were judges in Beersheba

83 And his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre
and took bribes and perverted judgment

84 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and
came to Samuel unto Ramah 85 And said unto him Behold thou art
