When she woke the third time a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent and her arms were wrapped around a dragon’s egg It was the pale one its scales the color of butter cream veined with whorls of gold and bronze and Dany could feel the heat of it Beneath her bedsilks a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin Dragondew she thought Her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of the shell tracing the wisps of gold and deep in the stone she felt something twist and stretch in response It did not frighten her All her fear was gone burned away

Dany touched her brow Under the film of sweat her skin was cool to the touch her fever gone She made herself sit There was a moment of dizziness and the deep ache between her thighs Yet she felt strong Her maids came running at the sound of her voice Water she told them a flagon of water cold as you can find it And fruit I think Dates

As you say Khaleesi

I want Ser Jorah she said standing Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders And a warm bath and Mirri Maz Duur and… Memory came back to her all at once and she faltered Khal Drogo she forced herself to say watching their faces with dread Is he—

The khal lives Irri answered quietly… yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water

She turned to Doreah Tell me

I… I shall bring Ser Jorah the Lysene girl said bowing her head and fleeing the tent

Jhiqui would have run as well but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive What is it I must know Drogo… and my child Why had she not remembered the child until now My son… Rhaego… where is he I want him

Her handmaid lowered her eyes The boy… he did not live Khaleesi Her voice was a frightened whisper

Dany released her wrist My son is dead she thought as Jhiqui left the tent She had known somehow She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui’s tears No she had known before she woke Her dream came back to her sudden and vivid and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid bursting into flame

She should weep she knew yet her eyes were dry as ash She had wept in her dream and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks All the grief has been burned out of me she told herself She felt sad and yet… she could feel Rhaego receding from her as if he had never been

Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later and found Dany standing over the other dragon’s eggs the two still in their chest It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with which was passing strange Ser Jorah come here she said She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls What do you feel

Shell hard as rock The knight was wary Scales

Heat

No Cold stone He took his hand away Princess are you well Should you be up weak as you are

Weak I am strong Jorah To please him she reclined on a pile of cushions Tell me how my child died

He never lived my princess The women say… He faltered and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him and the way he limped when he moved

Tell me Tell me what the women say

He turned his face away His eyes were haunted They say the child was…

She waited but Ser Jorah could not say it His face grew dark with shame He looked half a corpse himself

Monstrous Mirri Maz Duur finished for him The knight was a powerful man yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger and crueler and infinitely more dangerous Twisted I drew him forth myself He was scaled like a lizard blind with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat When I touched him the flesh sloughed off the bone and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption He had been dead for years

Darkness Dany thought The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her If she looked back she was lost My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent she said I could feel him kicking fighting to be born

That may be as it may be answered Mirri Maz Duur yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said Death was in that tent Khaleesi

Only shadows Ser Jorah husked but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice I saw maegi I saw you alone dancing with the shadows 

The grave casts long shadows Iron Lord Mirri said Long and dark and in the end no light can hold them back

Ser Jorah had killed her son Dany knew He had done what he did for love and loyalty yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness He knew it too the grey face the hollow eyes the limp The shadows have touched you too Ser Jorah she told him The knight made no reply Dany turned to the godswife You warned me that only death could pay for life I thought you meant the horse

No Mirri Maz Duur said That was a lie you told yourself You knew the price
