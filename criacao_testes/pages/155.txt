I sleep too much already

Sleep is the great healer

I had hoped that was you

Pycelle smiled wanly It is good to see you in such a fierce humor my lord He leaned close and lowered his voice There was a raven this morning a letter for the queen from her lord father I thought you had best know

Dark wings dark words Ned said grimly What of it

Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane the maester confided I feared he would be You will recall I said as much in council

Let him be wroth Ned said Every time his leg throbbed he remembered Jaime Lannister’s smile and Jory dead in his arms Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes Lord Beric rides beneath the king’s own banner If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king’s justice he will have Robert to answer to The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him

Pycelle pulled back his maester’s chain jangling As you say I shall visit again on the morrow The old man hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave Ned had little doubt that he was bound straight for the royal apartments to whisper at the queen I thought you had best know indeed… as if Cersei had not instructed him to pass along her father’s threats He hoped his response rattled those perfect teeth of hers Ned was not near as confident of Robert as he pretended but there was no reason Cersei need know that

When Pycelle was gone Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine That clouded the mind as well yet not as badly He needed to be able to think A thousand times he asked himself what Jon Arryn might have done had he lived long enough to act on what he’d learned Or perhaps he had acted and died for it

It was queer how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to Someday when Sansa was grown he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king she had declared angry and unknowing and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him cold as death This was the sword that killed Jon Arryn Ned thought then and it will kill Robert as well a slower death but full as certain Shattered legs may heal in time but some betrayals fester and poison the soul

Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left clad in a plum-colored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread and a striped cloak of black and white I cannot visit long my lord he announced Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf If it’s near as fatted as her daughter I’m like to rupture and die And how is your leg

Inflamed and painful with an itch that is driving me mad

Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow In future try not to let any horses fall on it I would urge you to heal quickly The realm grows restive Varys has heard ominous whispers from the west Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywin’s conversation

Is there word of the king Ned demanded Just how long does Robert intend to hunt

Given his preferences I believe he’d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile Lacking that I imagine he’ll return as soon as he’s killed something They found the white hart it seems… or rather what remained of it Some wolves found it first and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn Robert was in a fury until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest Then nothing would do but he must have it Prince Joffrey returned this morning with the Royces Ser Balon Swann and some twenty others of the party The rest are still with the king

The Hound Ned asked frowning Of all the Lannister party Sandor Clegane was the one who concerned him the most now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to join his father

Oh returned with Joffrey and went straight to the queen Littlefinger smiled I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother

Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother

Ah but Gregor was his to loathe not yours to kill Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor but I wouldn’t hold my water waiting for his thanks not that one And now you must forgive me Lady Tanda awaits with her fatted calves

On the way to the door Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon’s massive tome on the table and paused to idly flip open the cover The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children he read Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it A sleeping potion my lord

For a brief moment Ned considered telling him all of it but there was something in Littlefinger’s japes that irked him The man was too clever by half a mocking smile never far from his lips Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick Ned said in a careful tone to see how he might respond

And he responded as he always did with a quip In that case he said death must have come as a blessed relief Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave

Eddard Stark allowed himself a curse Aside from his own retainers there was scarcely a man in this city he trusted Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in his inquiries yet his haste to save his own skin when Jaime and his swords had come out of the rain still rankled Varys was worse For all his protestations of loyalty the eunuch knew too much and did too little Grand Maester Pycelle seemed more Cersei’s creature with every passing day and Ser Barristan was an old man and rigid He would tell Ned to do his duty

Time was perilously short The king would return from his hunt soon and honor would require Ned to go to him with all he had learned Vayon Poole had arranged for Sansa and Arya to sail on the Wind Witch out of Braavos three days hence They would be back at Winterfell before the harvest Ned could no longer use his concern for their safety to excuse his delay

Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard That was clever of him the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth The little princess had been barefoot still dressed in her bed gown and the boy… the boy…

Ned could not let that happen again The realm could not withstand a second mad king another dance of blood and vengeance He must find some way to save the children

Robert could be merciful Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned Grand Maester Pycelle Varys the Spider Lord Balon Greyjoy each had been counted an enemy to Robert once and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty So long as a man was brave and honest Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy
