FG Table 82  Syllable patterns and rhythms

A foot may have the rhythmical characteristics of a two-syllable foot
while having only one syllable if the first place in it is filled by a
silent stress marked by 
This is shown in the second one-syllable example of
Table 82
A similar effect may occur with two- and three-syllable feet
although examples are not given in the table
Feet of four and five syllables em with or without a silent stress em are
considerably rarer
pp
Syllabification em splitting an utterance into syllables em is a job
which had to be done for the pitch-transfer procedure described earlier
and the nature of syllable rhythms calls for it here too
Even though the utterance is now specified phonetically instead of
acoustically the same basic principle applies
Syllables normally coincide with peaks of sonority
where sonority measures the inherent loudness of a sound relative to
other sounds of the same duration and pitch
However difficult cases exist where it seems to be unclear how many syllables
there are in a word  Ladefoged 1975 discusses this problem with examples
such as real realistic and reality  Furthermore

care must be taken to avoid counting two syllables in a word like sky

where  means repetition that is occurrence zero or more times
This sidesteps the sky problem by giving fricatives the same
sonority as stops
It is easy to use the above structure to count the number
of syllables in a given utterance by counting the sonority
peaks
pp
However what is required is an indication of syllable
ul
boundaries
as well as a syllable count
For slow conversational speech these can be approximated as follows
Word divisions obviously form syllable boundaries as should
foot markers em but it may be wise not to assume that the latter do if the
utterance has been prepared by someone with little knowledge of linguistics
Syllable boundaries should be made to coincide with sonority minima
As an
ul
ad hoc
pragmatic
rule if only one segment has the minimum sonority the boundary is placed
before it
If there are two segments each with the minimum sonority it is placed between
them while for three or more it is placed after the first two
pp
These rules produce obviously acceptable divisions in many cases
today ashtray taxfree with perhaps unexpected positioning of the
boundary in others inspire department
Actually people do differ in placement of syllable boundaries

rh From syllables to segments
The theory of isochronous feet with the caveats noted earlier
and that of syllable rhythms provide a way of producing durations for
individual syllables  But where are these durations supposed to be measured
There is a beat point or tapping point near the beginning of each syllable
This is the place where a listener will tap if asked to give one tap to each
syllable it has been investigated experimentally by Allen 1972
