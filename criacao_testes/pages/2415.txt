203 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him
Behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken
for she is a mans wife

204 But Abimelech had not come near her and he said LORD wilt thou
slay also a righteous nation  205 Said he not unto me She is my
sister and she even she herself said He is my brother in the
integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this

206 And God said unto him in a dream Yea I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart for I also withheld thee from
sinning against me therefore suffered I thee not to touch her

207 Now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and
he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her
not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are
thine

208 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his
servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were
sore afraid

209 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him What hast thou
done unto us and what have I offended thee that thou hast brought on
me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that
ought not to be done

2010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham What sawest thou that thou
hast done this thing  2011 And Abraham said Because I thought
Surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for
my wifes sake

2012 And yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my
father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife

2013 And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my
fathers house that I said unto her This is thy kindness which thou
shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me
He is my brother

2014 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and
womenservants and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his
wife

2015 And Abimelech said Behold my land is before thee dwell where
it pleaseth thee

2016 And unto Sarah he said Behold I have given thy brother a
thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the
eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was
reproved

2017 So Abraham prayed unto God and God healed Abimelech and his
wife and his maidservants and they bare children

2018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech because of Sarah Abrahams wife

211 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said and the LORD did unto
Sarah as he had spoken

212 For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at
the set time of which God had spoken to him

213 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him
whom Sarah bare to him Isaac

214 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as
God had commanded him

215 And Abraham was an hundred years old when his son Isaac was born
unto him

216 And Sarah said God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear
will laugh with me

217 And she said Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should
have given children suck for I have born him a son in his old age

218 And the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great
feast the same day that Isaac was weaned

219 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had born
unto Abraham mocking

2110 Wherefore she said unto Abraham Cast out this bondwoman and her
son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even
with Isaac

2111 And the thing was very grievous in Abrahams sight because of
his son

2112 And God said unto Abraham Let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that Sarah
hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy
seed be called

2113 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation
because he is thy seed
