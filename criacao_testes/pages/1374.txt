I… I… I got the messages away

Good On Mormont’s shoulder his own raven echoed Good good

The Lord Commander looked huge in fur and mail Behind his black iron visor his eyes were fierce You’re in the way here Go back to your cages If I need to send another message I don’t want to have to find you first See that the birds are ready He did not wait for a response but turned his horse and trotted around the ring shouting Fire Give them fire

Sam did not need to be told twice He went back to the birds as fast as his fat legs could carry him I should write the message ahead of time he thought so we can get the birds away as fast as need be It took him longer than it should have to light his little fire to warm the frozen ink He sat beside it on a rock with quill and parchment and wrote his messages

Attacked amidst snow and cold but we’ve thrown them back with fire arrows he wrote as he heard Thoren Smallwood’s voice ring out with a command of Notch draw… loose The flight of arrows made a sound as sweet as a mother’s prayer Burn you dead bastards burn Dywen sang out cackling The brothers cheered and cursed All safe he wrote We remain on the Fist of the First Men Sam hoped they were better archers than him

He put that note aside and found another blank parchment Still fighting on the Fist amidst heavy snow he wrote when someone shouted They’re still coming Result uncertain Spears someone said It might have been Ser Mallador but Sam could not swear to it Wights attacked us on the Fist in snow he wrote but we drove them off with fire He turned his head Through the drifting snow all he could see was the huge fire at the center of the camp with mounted men moving restlessly around it The reserve he knew ready to ride down anything that breached the ringwall They had armed themselves with torches in place of swords and were lighting them in the flames

Wights all around us he wrote when he heard the shouts from the north face Coming up from north and south at once Spears and swords don’t stop them only fire Loose loose loose a voice screamed in the night and another shouted Bloody huge and a third voice said A giant and a fourth insisted A bear a bear A horse shrieked and the hounds began to bay and there was so much shouting that Sam couldn’t make out the voices anymore He wrote faster note after note Dead wildlings and a giant or maybe a bear on us all around He heard the crash of steel on wood which could only mean one thing Wights over the ringwall Fighting inside the camp A dozen mounted brothers pounded past him toward the east wall burning brands streaming flames in each rider’s hand Lord Commander Mormont is meeting them with fire We’ve won We’re winning We’re holding our own We’re cutting our way free and retreating for the Wall We’re trapped on the Fist hard pressed

One of the Shadow Tower men came staggering out of the darkness to fall at Sam’s feet He crawled within a foot of the fire before he died Lost Sam wrote the battle’s lost We’re all lost

Why must he remember the fight at the Fist He didn’t want to remember Not that He tried to make himself remember his mother or his little sister Talla or that girl Gilly at Craster’s Keep Someone was shaking him by the shoulder Get up a voice said Sam you can’t go to sleep here Get up and keep walking

I wasn’t asleep I was remembering Go away he said his words frosting in the cold air I’m well I want to rest

Get up Grenn’s voice harsh and husky He loomed over Sam his blacks crusty with snow There’s no resting the Old Bear said You’ll die

Grenn He smiled No truly I’m good here You just go on I’ll catch you after I’ve rested a bit longer

You won’t Grenn’s thick brown beard was frozen all around his mouth It made him look like some old man You’ll freeze or the Others will get you Sam get up

The night before they left the Wall Pyp had teased Grenn the way he did Sam remembered smiling and saying how Grenn was a good choice for the ranging since he was too stupid to be terrified Grenn hotly denied it until he realized what he was saying He was stocky and thick-necked and strong—Ser Alliser Thorne had called him Aurochs the same way he called Sam Ser Piggy and Jon Lord Snow—but he had always treated Sam nice enough That was only because of Jon though If it weren’t for Jon none of them would have liked me And now Jon was gone lost in the Skirling Pass with Qhorin Halfhand most likely dead Sam would have cried for him but those tears would only freeze as well and he could scarcely keep his eyes open now

A tall brother with a torch stopped beside them and for a wonderful moment Sam felt the warmth on his face Leave him the man said to Grenn If they can’t walk they’re done Save your strength for yourself Grenn

He’ll get up Grenn replied He only needs a hand

The man moved on taking the blessed warmth with him Grenn tried to pull Sam to his feet That hurts he complained Stop it Grenn you’re hurting my arm Stop it

You’re too bloody heavy Grenn jammed his hands into Sam’s armpits gave a grunt and hauled him upright But the moment he let go the fat boy sat back down in the snow Grenn kicked him a solid thump that cracked the crust of snow around his boot and sent it flying everywhere Get up He kicked him again Get up and walk You have to walk

Sam fell over sideways curling up into a tight ball to protect himself from the kicks He hardly felt them through all his wool and leather and mail but even so they hurt I thought Grenn was my friend You shouldn’t kick your friends Why won’t they let me be I just need to rest that’s all to rest and sleep some and maybe die a little

If you take the torch I can take the fat boy

Suddenly he was jerked up into the cold air away from his sweet soft snow he was floating There was an arm under his knees and another one under his back Sam raised his head and blinked A face loomed close a broad brutal face with a flat nose and small dark eyes and a thicket of coarse brown beard He had seen the face before but it took him a moment to remember Paul Small Paul Melting ice ran down into his eyes from the heat of the torch Can you carry him he heard Grenn ask

I carried a calf once was heavier than him I carried him down to his mother so he could get a drink of milk

Sam’s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took Stop it he muttered put me down I’m not a baby I’m a man of the Night’s Watch He sobbed Just let me die

Be quiet Sam said Grenn Save your strength Think about your sisters and brother Maester Aemon Your favorite foods Sing a song if you like

Aloud

In your head

Sam knew a hundred songs but when he tried to think of one he couldn’t The words had all gone from his head He sobbed again and said I don’t know any songs Grenn I did know some but now I don’t

Yes you do said Grenn How about ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ everybody knows that one A bear there was a bear a bear All black and brown and covered with hair

No not that one Sam pleaded The bear that had come up the Fist had no hair left on its rotted flesh He didn’t want to think about bears No songs Please Grenn

Think about your ravens then

They were never mine They were the Lord Commander’s ravens the ravens of the Night’s Watch They belonged to Castle Black and the Shadow Tower

Small Paul frowned Chett said I could have the Old Bear’s raven the one that talks I saved food for it and everything He shook his head I forgot though I left the food where I hid it He plodded onward pale white breath coming from his mouth with every step then suddenly said Could I have one of your ravens Just the one I’d never let Lark eat it

They’re gone said Sam I’m sorry So sorry They’re flying back to the Wall now He had set the birds free when he’d heard the warhorns sound once more calling the Watch to horse Two short blasts and a long one that was the call to mount up But there was no reason to mount unless to abandon the Fist and that meant the battle was lost The fear bit him so strong then that it was all Sam could do to open the cages Only as he watched the last raven flap up into the snowstorm did he realize that he had forgotten to send any of the messages he’d written

No he’d squealed oh no oh no The snow fell and the horns blew ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo they cried to horse to horse to horse Sam saw two ravens perched on a rock and ran after them but the birds flapped off lazily through the swirling snow in opposite directions He chased one his breath puffing out his nose in thick white clouds stumbled and found himself ten feet from the ringwall

After that… he remembered the dead coming over the stones with arrows in their faces and through their throats Some were all in ringmail and some were almost naked… wildlings most of them but a few wore faded blacks He remembered one of the Shadow Tower men shoving his spear through a wight’s pale soft belly and out his back and how the thing staggered right up the shaft and reached out his black hands and twisted the brother’s head around until blood came out his mouth That was when his bladder let go the first time he was almost sure

He did not remember running but he must have because the next he knew he was near the fire half a camp away with old Ser Ottyn Wythers and some archers Ser Ottyn was on his knees in the snow staring at the chaos around them until a riderless horse came by and kicked him in the face The archers paid him no mind They were loosing fire arrows at shadows in the dark Sam saw one wight hit saw the flames engulf it but there were a dozen more behind it and a huge pale shape that must have been the bear and soon enough the bowmen had no arrows

And then Sam found himself on a horse It wasn’t his own horse and he never recalled mounting up either Maybe it was the horse that had smashed Ser Ottyn’s face in The horns were still blowing so he kicked the horse and turned him toward the sound

In the midst of carnage and chaos and blowing snow he found Dolorous Edd sitting on his garron with a plain black banner on a spear Sam Edd said when he saw him would you wake me please I am having this terrible nightmare

More men were mounting up every moment The warhorns called them back Ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo They’re over the west wall m’lord Thoren Smallwood screamed at the Old Bear as he fought to control his horse I’ll send reserves…

NO Mormont had to bellow at the top of his lungs to be heard over the horns Call them back we have to cut our way out He stood in his stirrups his black cloak snapping in the wind the fire shining off his armor Spearhead he roared Form wedge we ride Down the south face then east

My lord the south slope’s crawling with them

The others are too steep Mormont said We have—

His garron screamed and reared and almost threw him as the bear came staggering through the snow Sam pissed himself all over again I didn’t think I had any more left inside me The bear was dead pale and rotting its fur and skin all sloughed off and half its right arm burned to bone yet still it came on Only its eyes lived Bright blue just as Jon said They shone like frozen stars Thoren Smallwood charged his longsword shining all orange and red from the light of the fire His swing near took the bear’s head off And then the bear took his

RIDE the Lord Commander shouted wheeling

They were at the gallop by the time they reached the ring Sam had always been too frightened to jump a horse before but when the low stone wall loomed up before him he knew he had no choice He kicked and closed his eyes and whimpered and the garron took him over somehow somehow the garron took him over The rider to his right came crashing down in a tangle of steel and leather and screaming horseflesh and then the wights were swarming over him and the wedge was closing up They plunged down the hillside at a run through clutching black hands and burning blue eyes and blowing snow Horses stumbled and rolled men were swept from their saddles torches spun through the air axes and swords hacked at dead flesh and Samwell Tarly sobbed clutching desperately to his horse with a strength he never knew he had

He was in the middle of the flying spearhead with brothers on either side and before and behind him as well A dog ran with them for a ways bounding down the snowy slope and in and out among the horses but it could not keep up The wights stood their ground and were ridden down and trampled underhoof Even as they fell they clutched at swords and stirrups and the legs of passing horses Sam saw one claw open a garron’s belly with its right hand while it clung to the saddle with its left

Suddenly the trees were all about them and Sam was splashing through a frozen stream with the sounds of slaughter dwindling behind He turned breathless with relief… until a man in black leapt from the brush and yanked him out of the saddle Who he was Sam never saw he was up in an instant and galloping away the next When he tried to run after the horse his feet tangled in a root and he fell hard on his face and lay weeping like a baby until Dolorous Edd found him there

That was his last coherent memory of the Fist of the First Men Later hours later he stood shivering among the other survivors half mounted and half afoot They were miles from the Fist by then though Sam did not remember how Dywen had led down five packhorses heavy laden with food and oil and torches and three had made it this far The Old Bear made them redistribute the loads so the loss of any one horse and its provisions would not be such a catastrophe He took garrons from the healthy men and gave them to the wounded organized the walkers and set torches to guard their flanks and rear All I need do is walk Sam told himself as he took that first step toward home But before an hour was gone he had begun to struggle and to lag…

They were lagging now as well he saw He remembered Pyp saying once how Small Paul was the strongest man in the Watch He must be to carry me Yet even so the snow was growing deeper the ground more treacherous and Paul’s strides had begun to shorten More horsemen passed wounded men who looked at Sam with dull incurious eyes Some torch bearers went by as well You’re falling behind one told them The next agreed No one’s like to wait for you Paul Leave the pig for the dead men

He promised I could have a bird Small Paul said even though Sam hadn’t not truly They aren’t mine to give I want me a bird that talks and eats corn from my hand
