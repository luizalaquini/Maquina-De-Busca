You threatened to geld me Joffrey said shrilly

I did Your Grace said Tyrion but only because I envied your royal manhood Mine own is so small and stunted His face twisted into a leer And if you take my tongue you will leave me no way at all to pleasure this sweet wife you gave me

Laughter burst from the lips of Ser Osmund Kettleblack Someone else sniggered But Joff did not laugh nor Lord Tywin Your Grace he said my son is drunk you can see that

I am the Imp confessed but not so drunk that I cannot attend to my own bedding He hopped down from the dais and grabbed Sansa roughly Come wife time to smash your portcullis I want to play come-into-the-castle

Red-faced Sansa went with him from the Small Hall What choice do I have Tyrion waddled when he walked especially when he walked as quickly as he did now The gods were merciful and neither Joffrey nor any of the others moved to follow

For their wedding night they had been granted the use of an airy bedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand Tyrion kicked the door shut behind them There is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard Sansa Will you be so kind as to pour me a cup

Is that wise my lord

Nothing was ever wiser I am not truly drunk you see But I mean to be

Sansa filled a goblet for each of them It will be easier if I am drunk as well She sat on the edge of the great curtained bed and drained half her cup in three long swallows No doubt it was very flne wine but she was too nervous to taste it It made her head swim Would you have me undress my lord

Tyrion He cocked his head My name is Tyrion Sansa

Tyrion My lord Should I take off my gown or do you want to undress me She took another swallow of wine

The imp turned away from her The first time I wed there was us and a drunken septon and some pigs to bear witness We ate one of our witnesses at our wedding feast Tysha fed me crackling and I licked the grease off her fingers and we were laughing when we fell into bed

You were wed before I… I had forgotten

You did not forget You never knew

Who was she my lord Sansa was curious despite herself

Lady Tysha His mouth twisted Of House Silverfist Their arms have one gold coin and a hundred silver upon a bloody sheet Ours was a very short marriage… as befits a very short man I suppose

Sansa stared down at her hands and said nothing

How old are you Sansa asked Tyrion after a moment

Thirteen she said when the moon turns

Gods have mercy The dwarf took another swallow of wine Well talk won’t make you older Shall we get on with this my lady If it please you

It will please me to please my lord husband

That seemed to anger him You hide behind courtesy as if it were a castle wall

Courtesy is a lady’s armor Sansa said Her septa had always told her that

I am your husband You can take off your armor now

And my clothing

That too He waved his wine cup at her My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage

Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes She had ten thumbs instead of fingers and all of them were broken Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes Gooseprickles covered her arms and legs She kept her eyes on the floor too shy to look at him but when she was done she glanced up and found him staring There was hunger in his green eye it seemed to her and fury in the black Sansa did not know which scared her more
