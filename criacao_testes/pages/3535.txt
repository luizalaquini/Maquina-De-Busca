It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated

He reached for his wine and considered for a moment as he sipped And what am I to do there

Rule his father said curtly

Tyrion hooted with laughter My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that

Let her say what she likes Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all I blame those jackanapes on the council—our friend Petyr the venerable Grand Maester and that cockless wonder Lord Varys What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord The man’s father was a butcher and they grant him Harrenhal Harrenhal that was the seat of kings Not that he will ever set foot inside it if I have a say I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil A bloody cleaver would have been my choice His father had not raised his voice yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes And dismissing Selmy where was the sense in that Yes the man was old but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm He lent honor to any man he served Can anyone say the same of the Hound You feed your dog bones under the table you do not seat him beside you on the high bench He pointed a finger at Tyrion’s face If Cersei cannot curb the boy you must And if these councillors are playing us false…

Tyrion knew Spikes he sighed Heads Walls

I see you have taken a few lessons from me

More than you know Father Tyrion answered quietly He finished his wine and set the cup aside thoughtful A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit Another part was remembering the battle upriver and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again Why me he asked cocking his head to one side Why not my uncle Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett Why not a… bigger man

Lord Tywin rose abruptly You are my son

That was when he knew You have given him up for lost he thought You bloody bastard you think Jaime’s good as dead so I’m all you have left Tyrion wanted to slap him to spit in his face to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold the way the smallfolks said Yet he sat there silent and still

The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father’s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room One last thing he said at the door You will not take the whore to court

Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower The ceiling was low but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf From the window he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard The innkeep’s body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes

Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast and her eyes opened M’lord she said with a drowsy smile

When he felt her nipple stiffen Tyrion kissed her I have a mind to take you to King’s Landing sweetling he whispered





JON

The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch Easy sweet lady he said in a soft voice quieting her with a touch Wind whispered through the stable a cold dead breath on his face but Jon paid it no mind He strapped his roll to the saddle his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy Ghost he called softly to me And the wolf was there eyes like embers

Jon please You must not do this

He mounted the reins in his hand and wheeled the horse around to face the night Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door a full moon peering over his shoulder He threw a giant’s shadow immense and black Get out of my way Sam

Jon you can’t Sam said I won’t let you

I would sooner not hurt you Jon told him Move aside Sam or I’ll ride you down

You won’t You have to listen to me Please…

Jon put his spurs to horseflesh and the mare bolted for the door For an instant Sam stood his ground his face as round and pale as the moon behind him his mouth a widening O of surprise At the last moment when they were almost on him he jumped aside as Jon had known he would stumbled and fell The mare leapt over him out into the night

Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out with Ghost racing at his side Men watched from the Wall behind him he knew but their eyes were turned north not south No one would see him go no one but Sam Tarly struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables He hoped Sam hadn’t hurt himself falling like that He was so heavy and so ungainly it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way I warned him Jon said aloud It was nothing to do with him anyway He flexed his burned hand as he rode opening and closing the scarred fingers They still pained him but it felt good to have the wrappings off

Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit but for the moment speed was more important than deception It was not as though they would not guess where he was going

The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall… if Sam Tarly did not betray him The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened but he loved Jon like a brother If questioned Sam would doubtless tell them the truth but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King’s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep

When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear’s breakfast from the kitchen they’d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed It had been hard to abandon it but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him Even Jorah Mormont had not done that when he fled in disgrace Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son’s disgrace That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust but it couldn’t be helped No matter what he did Jon felt as though he were betraying someone

Even now he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing The southron had it easier They had their septons to talk to someone to tell them the gods’ will and help sort out right from wrong But the Starks worshiped the old gods the nameless gods and if the heart trees heard they did not speak

When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him Jon slowed his mare to a walk He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one but not if she were injured or blown

He would need to find new clothes soon most like he’d need to steal them He was clad in black from head to heel high leather riding boots roughspun breeches and tunic sleeveless leather jerkin and heavy wool cloak His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck and men would soon be watching for him Once Maester Aemon’s ravens took flight Jon knew he would find no safe haven Not even at Winterfell Bran might want to let him in but Maester Luwin had better sense He would bar the gates and send Jon away as he should Better not to call there at all

Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind’s eye as if he had left it only yesterday the towering granite walls the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat his father’s solar the turret room where he had slept Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again to sup on one of Gage’s beef-and-bacon pies to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool

But he had not left the Wall for that he had left because he was after all his father’s son and Robb’s brother The gift of a sword even a sword as fine as Longclaw did not make him a Mormont Nor was he Aemon Targaryen Three times the old man had chosen and three times he had chosen honor but that was him Even now Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven or because he was strong and true Yet he understood what the old man had meant about the pain of choosing he understood that all too well

Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it but Jon was done with denials He was who he was Jon Snow bastard and oathbreaker motherless friendless and damned For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms he would need to live a lie lest every man’s hand be raised against him But it made no matter so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother’s side and help avenge his father

He remembered Robb as he had last seen him standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair Jon would have to come to him in secret disguised He tried to imagine the look on Robb’s face when he revealed himself His brother would shake his head and smile and he’d say… he’d say…

He could not see the smile Hard as he tried he could not see it He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they’d found the direwolves You said the words Lord Eddard had told him You took a vow before your brothers before the old gods and the new Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump Bran’s eyes had been wide as saucers and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand He remembered the look on Father’s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice the spray of blood on the snow the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet

He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger Would it have been any different It must surely surely… and Robb would welcome him for a certainty He had to or else…

It did not bear thinking about Pain throbbed deep in his fingers as he clutched the reins Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop racing down the kingsroad as if to outrun his doubts Jon was not afraid of death but he did not want to die like that trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand If he must perish let it be with a sword in his hand fighting his father’s killers He was no true Stark had never been one… but he could die like one Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons not three

Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile red tongue lolling from his mouth Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed The wolf slowed stopped watching his eyes glowing red in the moonlight He vanished behind but Jon knew he would follow at his own pace

Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him on both sides of the road Mole’s Town A dog barked as he rode through and he heard a mule’s raucous haw from the stable but otherwise the village was still Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows leaking between wooden slats but only a few

Mole’s Town was bigger than it seemed but three quarters of it was under the ground in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels Even the whorehouse was down there nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy with a red lantern hung over the door On the Wall he’d heard men call the whores buried treasures He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight mining That was oathbreaking too yet no one seemed to care

Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat He dismounted shivering his burned hand aching A bank of melting snow lay under the trees bright in the moonlight water trickling off to form small shallow pools Jon squatted and brought his hands together cupping the runoff between his fingers The snowmelt was icy cold He drank and splashed some on his face until his cheeks tingled His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days and his head was pounding too I am doing the right thing he told himself so why do I feel so bad

The horse was well lathered so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone That run had been truly stupid an invitation to a broken neck Jon wondered what had gotten into him Was he in such a great rush to die

Off in the trees the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up His mare whinnied nervously Had his wolf found some prey He cupped his hands around his mouth Ghost he shouted Ghost to me The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight

Frowning Jon continued on his way He led the mare for half an hour until she was dry Ghost did not appear Jon wanted to mount up and ride again but he was concerned about his missing wolf Ghost he called again Where are you To me Ghost Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf even a half-grown direwolf unless… no Ghost was too smart to attack a bear and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling

He should eat he decided Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up There was no danger yet Castle Black still slept In his saddlebag he found a biscuit a piece of cheese and a small withered brown apple He’d brought salt beef as well and a rasher of bacon he’d filched from the kitchens but he would save the meat for the morrow After it was gone he’d need to hunt and that would slow him

Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad He kept the apple for last It had gone a little soft but the flesh was still tart and juicy He was down to the core when he heard the sounds horses and from the north Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare Could he outrun them No they were too close they’d hear him for a certainty and if they were from Castle Black…

He led the mare off the road behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels Ouiet now he said in a hushed voice crouching down to peer through the branches If the gods were kind the riders would pass by Likely as not they were only smallfolk from Mole’s Town farmers on their way to their fields although what they were doing out in the middle of the night…

He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad From the sound there were five or six of them at the least Their voices drifted through the trees

…certain he came this way
