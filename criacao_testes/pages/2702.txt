859 And let these my words wherewith I have made supplication before
the LORD be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night that he
maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel
at all times as the matter shall require 860 That all the people of
the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is none else

861 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God to
walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day

862 And the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before
the LORD

863 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he
offered unto the LORD two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred
and twenty thousand sheep So the king and all the children of Israel
dedicated the house of the LORD

864 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
before the house of the LORD for there he offered burnt offerings
and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the
brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the
burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace
offerings

865 And at that time Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him a
great congregation from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
Egypt before the LORD our God seven days and seven days even
fourteen days

866 On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the
king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant and for Israel
his people

91 And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the
house of the LORD and the kings house and all Solomons desire
which he was pleased to do 92 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the
second time as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon

93 And the LORD said unto him I have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication that thou hast made before me I have hallowed this
house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually

94 And if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked in
integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I
have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments 95
Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever
as I promised to David thy father saying There shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of Israel

96 But if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your
children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I
have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
97 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
them and this house which I have hallowed for my name will I cast
out of my sight and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people 98 And at this house which is high every one that passeth
by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say Why
hath the LORD done thus unto this land and to this house  99 And
they shall answer Because they forsook the LORD their God who
brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have taken
hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them
therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil

910 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years when Solomon had
built the two houses the house of the LORD and the kings house
911 Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that
then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee

912 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
given him and they pleased him not

913 And he said What cities are these which thou hast given me my
brother And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day

914 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold

915 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised for
to build the house of the LORD and his own house and Millo and the
wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer

916 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burnt
it with fire and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city and
given it for a present unto his daughter Solomons wife

917 And Solomon built Gezer and Bethhoron the nether 918 And
Baalath and Tadmor in the wilderness in the land 919 And all the
cities of store that Solomon had and cities for his chariots and
cities for his horsemen and that which Solomon desired to build in
Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion

920 And all the people that were left of the Amorites Hittites
Perizzites Hivites and Jebusites which were not of the children of
Israel 921 Their children that were left after them in the land
whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy
upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day

922 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen but
