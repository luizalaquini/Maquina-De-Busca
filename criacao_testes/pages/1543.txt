Beetee on weapons or something so I get permission to
take Finnick to the woods We wander around awhile and
then ditch our communicators under a bush When were a
safe distance away we sit and discuss Peetas broadcast
I havent heard one word about it No ones told you
anything Finnick says I shake my head He pauses
before he asks Not even Gale Im clinging to a shred of
hope that Gale honestly knows nothing about Peetas
message But I have a bad feeling he does Maybe hes
trying to find a time to tell you privately
Maybe I say
We stay silent so long that a buck wanders into range I
take it down with an arrow Finnick hauls it back to the
fence
For dinner theres minced venison in the stew Gale
walks me back to Compartment E after we eat When I ask
him whats been going on again theres no mention of
Peeta As soon as my mother and sister are asleep I slip
the pearl from the drawer and spend a second sleepless
night clutching it in my hand replaying Peetas words in my
head Ask yourself do you really trust the people youre
working with Do you really know whats going on And if
you dontfind out Find out What From who And how
can Peeta know anything except what the Capitol tells him
Its just a Capitol propo More noise But if Plutarch thinks
its just the Capitol line why didnt he tell me about it Why
hasnt anyone let me or Finnick know
Under this debate lies the real source of my distress
Peeta What have they done to him And what are they
doing to him right now Clearly Snow did not buy the story
that Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion And his
suspicions have been reinforced now that I have come out
as the Mockingjay Peeta can only guess about the rebel
tactics or make up things to tell his torturers Lies once
discovered would be severely punished How abandoned
by me he must feel In his first interview he tried to protect
me from the Capitol and rebels alike and not only have I
failed to protect him Ive brought down more horrors upon
him
Come morning I stick my forearm in the wall and stare
groggily at the days schedule Immediately after breakfast
I am slated for Production In the dining hall as I down my
hot grain and milk and mushy beets I spot a communicuff
on Gales wrist When did you get that back Soldier
Hawthorne I ask
Yesterday They thought if Im going to be in the field
with you it could be a backup system of communication
says Gale
No one has ever offered me a communicuff I wonder
if I asked for one would I get it Well I guess one of us
has to be accessible I say with an edge to my voice
Whats that mean he says
Nothing Just repeating what you said I tell him And
I totally agree that the accessible one should be you I just
hope I still have access to you as well
Our eyes lock and I realize how furious I am with Gale
That I dont believe for a second that he didnt see Peetas
propo That I feel completely betrayed that he didnt tell me
about it We know each other too well for him not to read
my mood and guess what has caused it
Katniss-- he begins Already the admission of guilt is
in his tone
I grab my tray cross to the deposit area and slam the
dishes onto the rack By the time Im in the hallway hes
caught up with me
Why didnt you say something he asks taking my
arm
Why didnt I I jerk my arm free Why didnt you
Gale And I did by the way when I asked you last night
about what had been going on
Im sorry All right I didnt know what to do I wanted to
tell you but everyone was afraid that seeing Peetas propo
would make you sick he says
They were right It did But not quite as sick as you
lying to me for Coin At that moment his communicuff
starts beeping There she is Better run You have things to
tell her
For a moment real hurt registers on his face Then
cold anger replaces it He turns on his heel and goes
Maybe I have been too spiteful not given him enough time
to explain Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by
lying to me I dont care Im sick of people lying to me for
my own good Because really its mostly for their own good
Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesnt do
anything crazy Send her into the arena without a clue so we
can fish her out Dont tell her about Peetas propo because
it might make her sick and its hard enough to get a decent
performance out of her as it is
I do feel sick Heartsick And too tired for a day of
production But Im already at Remake so I go in Today I
discover we will be returning to District 12 Cressida wants
to do unscripted interviews with Gale and me throwing light
on our demolished city
If youre both up for that says Cressida looking
closely at my face
Count me in I say I stand uncommunicative and
stiff a mannequin as my prep team dresses me does my
hair and dabs makeup on my face Not enough to show
only enough to take the edge off the circles under my
sleepless eyes
