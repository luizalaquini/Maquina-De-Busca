ROSALIND	Nay you were better speak first and when you were
	gravelled for lack of matter you might take
	occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
	out they will spit and for lovers lacking--God
	warn us--matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied

ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

ORLANDO	Who could be out being before his beloved mistress

ROSALIND	Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

ORLANDO	What of my suit

ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
	Am not I your Rosalind

ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are because I would be
	talking of her

ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you

ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die

ROSALIND	No faith die by attorney The poor world is
	almost six thousand years old and in all this time
	there was not any man died in his own person
	videlicit in a love-cause Troilus had his brains
	dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
	could to die before and he is one of the patterns
	of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
	year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
	for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
	coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
	But these are all lies men have died from time to
	time and worms have eaten them but not for love

ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
	for I protest her frown might kill me

ROSALIND	By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
	I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
	disposition and ask me what you will I will grant
	it

ORLANDO	Then love me Rosalind

ROSALIND	Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all

ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me

ROSALIND	Ay and twenty such

ORLANDO	What sayest thou

ROSALIND	Are you not good

ORLANDO	I hope so

ROSALIND	Why then can one desire too much of a good thing
	Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
	Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister

ORLANDO	Pray thee marry us

CELIA	I cannot say the words

ROSALIND	You must begin Will you Orlando--

CELIA	Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind

ORLANDO	I will

ROSALIND	Ay but when

ORLANDO	Why now as fast as she can marry us

ROSALIND	Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife

ORLANDO	I take thee Rosalind for wife

ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission but I do take
	thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes
	before the priest and certainly a womans thought
	runs before her actions

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts they are winged

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her

ORLANDO	For ever and a day

ROSALIND	Say a day without the ever No no Orlando
