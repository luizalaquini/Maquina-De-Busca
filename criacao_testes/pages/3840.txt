I have come this way before Jaime reflected a few miles further on when they passed a deserted mill beside the lake Weeds now grew where once the miller’s daughter had smiled shyly at him and the miller himself had shouted out The tourney’s back the other way ser As if I had not known

King Aerys made a great show of Jaime’s investiture He said his vows before the king’s pavilion kneeling on the green grass in white armor while half the realm looked on When Ser Gerold Hightower raised him up and put the white cloak about his shoulders a roar went up that Jaime still remembered all these years later But that very night Aerys had turned sour declaring that he had no need of seven Kingsguard here at Harrenhal Jaime was commanded to return to King’s Landing to guard the queen and little Prince Viserys who’d remained behind Even when the White Bull offered to take that duty himself so Jaime might compete in Lord Whent’s tourney Aerys had refused He’ll win no glory here the king had said He’s mine now not Tywin’s He’ll serve as I see fit I am the king I rule and he’ll obey

That was the first time that Jaime understood It was not his skill with sword and lance that had won him his white cloak nor any feats of valor he’d performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood Aerys had chosen him to spite his father to rob Lord Tywin of his heir

Even now all these years later the thought was bitter And that day as he’d ridden south in his new white cloak to guard an empty castle it had been almost too much to stomach He would have ripped the cloak off then and there if he could have but it was too late He had said the words whilst half the realm looked on and a Kingsguard served for life

Qyburn fell in beside him Is your hand troubling you

The lack of my hand is troubling me The mornings were the hardest In his dreams Jaime was a whole man and each dawn he would lie half-awake and feel his fingers move It was a nightmare some part of him would whisper refusing to believe even now only a nightmare But then he would open his eyes

I understand you had a visitor last night said Qyburn I trust that you enjoyed her

Jaime gave him a cool look She did not say who sent her

The maester smiled modestly Your fever was largely gone and I thought you might enjoy a bit of exercise Pia is quite skilled would you not agree And so… willing

She had been that certainly She had slipped in his door and out of her clothes so quickly that Jaime had thought he was still dreaming

It hadn’t been until the woman slid in under his blankets and put his good hand on her breast that he roused She was a pretty little thing too I was a slip of a girl when you came for Lord Whent’s tourney and the king gave you your cloak she confessed You were so handsome all in white and everyone said what a brave knight you were Sometimes when I’m with some man I close my eyes and pretend it’s you on top of me with your smooth skin and gold curls I never truly thought I’d have you though

Sending her away had not been easy after that but Jaime had done it all the same I have a woman he reminded himself Do you send girls to everyone you leech he asked Qyburn

More often Lord Vargo sends them to me He likes me to examine them before… well suffice it to say that once he loved unwisely and he has no wish to do so again But have no fear Pia is quite healthy As is your maid of Tarth

Jaime gave him a sharp look Brienne

Yes A strong girl that one And her maidenhead is still intact As of last night at least Qyburn gave a chuckle

He sent you to examine her

To be sure He is… fastidious shall we say

Does this concern the ransom Jaime asked Does her father require proof she is still maiden

You have not heard Qyburn gave a shrug We had a bird from Lord Selwyn In answer to mine The Evenstar offers three hundred dragons for his daughter’s safe return I had told Lord Vargo there were no sapphires on Tarth but he will not listen He is convinced the Evenstar intends to cheat him

Three hundred dragons is a fair ransom for a knight The goat should take what he can get

The goat is Lord of Harrenhal and the Lord of Harrenhal does not haggle

The news irritated him though he supposed he should have seen it coming The lie spared you awhile wench Be grateful for that much If her maidenhead’s as hard as the rest of her the goat will break his cock off trying to get in he jested Brienne was tough enough to survive a few rapes Jaime judged though if she resisted too vigorously Vargo Hoat might start lopping off her hands and feet And if he does why should I care I might still have a hand if she had let me have my cousin’s sword without getting stupid He had almost taken off her leg himself with that first stroke of his but after that she had given him more than he wanted Hoat may not know how freakish strong she is He had best be careful or she’ll snap that skinny neck of his and wouldn’t that be sweet

Qyburn’s companionship was wearing on him Jaime trotted toward the head of the column A round little tick of a northman name of Nage went before Steelshanks with the peace banner a rainbow-striped flag with seven long tails on a staff topped by a seven-pointed star Shouldn’t you northmen have a different sort of peace banner he asked Walton What are the Seven to you

Southron gods the man said but it’s a southron peace we need to get you safe to your father

My father Jaime wondered whether Lord Tywin had received the goat’s demand for ransom with or without his rotted hand What is a swordsman worth without his sword hand Half the gold in Casterly Rock Three hundred dragons Or nothing His father had never been unduly swayed by sentiment Tywin Lannister’s own father Lord Tytos had once imprisoned an unruly bannerman Lord Tarbeck The redoubtable Lady Tarbeck responded by capturing three Lannisters including young Stafford whose sister was betrothed to cousin Tywin Send back my lord and love or these three shall answer for any harm that comes him she had written to Casterly Rock Young Tywin suggested his father oblige by sending back Lord Tarbeck in three pieces Lord Tytos was a gentler sort of lion however so Lady Tarbeck won a few more years for her muttonheaded lord and Stafford wed and bred and blundered on till Oxcross But Tywin Lannister endured eternal as Casterly Rock And now you have a cripple for a son as well as a dwarf my lord How you will hate that…

The road led them through a burned village It must have been a year or more since the place had been put to torch The hovels stood blackened and roofless but weeds were growing waist high in all the surrounding fields Steelshanks called a halt to allow them to water the horses I know this place too Jaime thought as he waited by the well There had been a small inn where only a few foundation stones and a chimney now stood and he had gone in for a cup of ale A dark-eyed serving wench brought him cheese and apples but the innkeep had refused his coin It’s an honor to have a knight of the Kingsguard under my roof ser the man had said It’s a tale I’ll tell my grandchildren Jaime looked at the chimney poking out of the weeds and wondered whether he had ever gotten those grandchildren Did he tell them the Kingslayer once drank his ale and ate his cheese and apples or was he ashamed to admit he fed the likes of me Not that he would ever know whoever burned the inn had likely killed the grandchildren as well

He could feel his phantom fingers clench When Steelshanks said that perhaps they should have a fire and a bit of food Jaime shook his head I mislike this place We’ll ride on

By evenfall they had left the lake to follow a rutted track through a wood of oak and elm Jaime’s stump was throbbing dully when Steelshanks decided to make camp Qyburn had brought a skin of dreamwine thankfully While Walton set the watches Jaime stretched out near the fire and propped a rolled-up bearskin against a stump as a pillow for his head The wench would have told him he had to eat before he slept to keep his strength up but he was more tired than hungry He closed his eyes and hoped to dream of Cersei The fever dreams were all so vivid…

Naked and alone he stood surrounded by enemies with stone walls all around him pressing close The Rock he knew He could feel the immense weight of it above his head He was home He was home and whole

He held his right hand up and flexed his fingers to feel the strength in them It felt as good as sex As good as swordplay Four fingers and a thumb He had dreamed that he was maimed but it wasn’t so Relief made him dizzy My hand my good hand Nothing could hurt him so long as he was whole

Around him stood a dozen tall dark figures in cowled robes that hid their faces In their hands were spears Who are you he demanded of them What business do you have in Casterly Rock

They gave no answer only prodded him with the points of their spears He had no choice but to descend Down a twisting passageway he went narrow steps carved from the living rock down and down I must go up he told himself Up not down Why am I going down Below the earth his doom awaited he knew with the certainty of dream something dark and terrible lurked there something that wanted him Jaime tried to halt but their spears prodded him on If only I had my sword nothing could harm me

The steps ended abruptly on echoing darkness Jaime had the sense of vast space before him He jerked to a halt teetering on the edge of nothingness A spearpoint jabbed at the small of the back shoving him into the abyss He shouted but the fall was short He landed on his hands and knees upon soft sand and shallow water There were watery caverns deep below Casterly Rock but this one was strange to him What place is this

Your place The voice echoed it was a hundred voices a thousand the voices of all the Lannisters since Lann the Clever who’d lived at the dawn of days But most of all it was his father’s voice and beside Lord Tywin stood his sister pale and beautiful a torch burning in her hand Joffrey was there as well the son they’d made together and behind them a dozen more dark shapes with golden hair

Sister why has Father brought us here

Us This is your place Brother This is your darkness Her torch was the only light in the cavern Her torch was the only light in the world She turned to go

Stay with me Jaime pleaded Don’t leave me here alone But they were leaving Don’t leave me in the dark Something terrible lived down here Give me a sword at least

I gave you a sword Lord Tywin said

It was at his feet Jaime groped under the water until his hand closed upon the hilt Nothing can hurt me so long as I have a sword As he raised the sword a finger of pale flame flickered at the point and crept up along the edge stopping a hand’s breath from the hilt The fire took on the color of the steel itself so it burned with a silvery-blue light and the gloom pulled back Crouching listening Jaime moved in a circle ready for anything that might come out of the darkness The water flowed into his boots ankle deep and bitterly cold Beware the water he told himself There may be creatures living in it hidden deeps…

From behind came a great splash Jaime whirled toward the sound… but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth her hands bound in heavy chains I swore to keep you safe the wench said stubbornly I swore an oath Naked she raised her hands to Jaime Ser Please If you would be so good

The steel links parted like silk A sword Brienne begged and there it was scabbard belt and all She buckled it around her thick waist The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her though they stood a scant few feet apart In this light she could almost be a beauty he thought In this light she could almost be a knight Brienne’s sword took flame as well burning silvery blue The darkness retreated a little more

The flames will burn so long as you live he heard Cersei call When they die so must you

Sister he shouted Stay with me Stay There was no reply but the soft sound of retreating footsteps

Brienne moved her longsword back and forth watching the silvery flames shift and shimmer Beneath her feet a reflection of the burning blade shone on the surface of the flat black water She was as tall and strong as he remembered yet it seemed to Jaime that she had more of a woman’s shape now

Do they keep a bear down here Brienne was moving slow and wary sword to hand step turn and listen Each step made a little splash A cave lion Direwolves Some bear Tell me Jaime What lives here What lives in the darkness

Doom No bear he knew No lion Only doom

In the cool silvery-blue light of the swords the big wench looked pale and fierce I mislike this place

I’m not fond of it myself Their blades made a little island of light but all around them stretched a sea of darkness unending My feet are wet

We could go back the way they brought us If you climbed on my shoulders you’d have no trouble reaching that tunnel mouth

Then I could follow Cersei He could feel himself growing hard at the thought and turned away so Brienne would not see
