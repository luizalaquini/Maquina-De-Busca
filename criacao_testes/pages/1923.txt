This little book by one of Britains foremost workers in the field
introduces the subject of speech synthesis and speech synthesizers
It has a particularly good discussion of parallel synthesizers

CH 6  LINEAR PREDICTION OF SPEECH
ds RT Linear prediction of speech
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
The speech coding techniques which were discussed in Chapter 3 operate
in the time domain while the analysis and synthesis techniques
of Chapters 4 and 5 are
based in the frequency domain  Linear prediction is a relatively
new method of speech analysis-synthesis
introduced in the early 1970s and used
extensively since then which is primarily a time-domain coding method
but can be used to give frequency-domain parameters like formant
frequency bandwidth and amplitude
pp
It has several advantages over other speech analysis techniques and is
likely to become increasingly dominant in speech output systems
As well as bridging the gap between time- and frequency-domain techniques it
is of equal value for both speech storage and speech synthesis and forms
an extremely convenient basis for speech-output systems which use high-quality
stored speech for routine messages and synthesis from phonetics or text
for unusual or exceptional conditions  Linear prediction can be used to
separate the excitation source properties of pitch and amplitude from the
vocal tract filter which governs phoneme articulation or in other words
to separate much of the prosodic from the segmental information
Hence it makes it easy to use stored segmentals with synthetic prosody
which is just what is needed to enhance the flexibility of stored speech by
providing overall intonation contours for utterances formed by word
concatenation see Chapter 7
pp
The frequency-domain analysis technique
of Fourier transformation necessarily involves approximation because it
applies only to periodic waveforms and so the artificial operation
of windowing is required to suppress the aperiodicity of real
speech  In contrast the linear predictive technique being a time-domain
method can em in certain forms em deal more rationally with aperiodic
signals
pp
The basic idea of linear predictive coding is exactly the same as
one form of adaptive differential pulse code modulation which
was introduced briefly in Chapter 3  There it was noted that a speech
sample xn can be predicted quite closely by the previous sample
xn-1  The prediction can be improved by multiplying the previous
sample by a number say a sub 1 which is adapted on a syllabic
time-scale  This can be utilized for speech coding by transmitting
only the prediction error

and using it and the value of a sub 1 to reconstitute the signal
xn at the receiver  It is worthwhile noting that
exactly the same relationship was used for digital
preemphasis in Chapter 4 with the value of a sub 1
being constant at about 09 em although
the possibility of adapting it to take into account the difference
between voiced and unvoiced speech was discussed
pp
An obvious extension is to use several past values of the signal to form
the prediction instead of just one  Different multipliers for each would
be needed so that the prediction error could be written as

en mark =xn-a sub 1 xn-1-a sub 2 xn-2--a sub p xn-p

The multipliers a sub k should be adapted to minimize the error signal
and we will consider how to do this in the next section  It turns out
that they must be re-calculated and transmitted on a time-scale that is
rather faster than syllabic but much slower than
the basic sampling rate  intervals
of 10-25 msec are usually used compare this with the 125 musec sampling
rate for telephone-quality speech
A configuration for high-order adaptive differential
pulse code modulation is shown in Figure 61
