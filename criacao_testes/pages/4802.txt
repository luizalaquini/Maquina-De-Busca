224 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh

225 And they were both naked the man and his wife and were not
ashamed

31 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made And he said unto the woman Yea hath God said
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden  32 And the woman said
unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
33 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden
God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
ye die

34 And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surely die 35
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil

36 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that
it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one
wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto
her husband with her and he did eat

37 And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they
were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
aprons

38 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden

39 And the LORD God called unto Adam and said unto him Where art
thou  310 And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was
afraid because I was naked and I hid myself

311 And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thou eaten
of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
312 And the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
gave me of the tree and I did eat

313 And the LORD God said unto the woman What is this that thou hast
done And the woman said The serpent beguiled me and I did eat

314 And the LORD God said unto the serpent Because thou hast done
this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life 315 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head
and thou shalt bruise his heel

316 Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy
desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee

317 And unto Adam he said Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee
saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life 318 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field 319 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for
dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return

320 And Adam called his wifes name Eve because she was the mother
of all living

321 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins and clothed them

322 And the LORD God said Behold the man is become as one of us to
know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also
of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 323 Therefore the
LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground
from whence he was taken

324 So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep
the way of the tree of life

41 And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and
said I have gotten a man from the LORD

42 And she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeper of
sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground

43 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD

44 And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering 45 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect
And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell

46 And the LORD said unto Cain Why art thou wroth and why is thy
countenance fallen  47 If thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door And unto
thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him

48 And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when
