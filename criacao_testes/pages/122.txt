The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age No doubt she’d been a virgin the better brothels could always find a virgin if the purse was fat enough She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe he saw that her bosom was freckled as well I named her Barra she said as the child nursed She looks so like him does she not milord She has his nose and his hair…

She does Eddard Stark had touched the baby’s fine dark hair It flowed through his fingers like black silk Robert’s firstborn had had the same fine hair he seemed to recall

Tell him that when you see him milord as it… as it please you Tell him how beautiful she is

I will Ned had promised her That was his curse Robert would swear undying love and forget them before evenfall but Ned Stark kept his vows He thought of the promises he’d made Lyanna as she lay dying and the price he’d paid to keep them

And tell him I’ve not been with no one else I swear it milord by the old gods and new Chataya said I could have half a year for the baby and for hoping he’d come back So you’ll tell him I’m waiting won’t you I don’t want no jewels or nothing just him He was always good to me truly

Good to you Ned thought hollowly I will tell him child and I promise you Barra shall not go wanting

She had smiled then a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him Riding through the rainy night Ned saw Jon Snow’s face in front of him so like a younger version of his own If the gods frowned so on bastards he thought dully why did they fill men with such lusts Lord Baelish what do you know of Robert’s bastards

Well he has more than you for a start

How many

Littlefinger shrugged Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak Does it matter If you bed enough women some will give you presents and His Grace has never been shy on that count I know he’s acknowledged that boy at Storm’s End the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed He could hardly do otherwise The mother was a Florent niece to the Lady Selyse one of her bedmaids Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife’s House so when the boy was born he shipped him off to Renly He gave Ned a sideways glance I’ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin’s tourney Cersei had the babes killed and sold the mother to a passing slaver Too much an affront to Lannister pride that close to home

Ned Stark grimaced Ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the realm He could believe it of Cersei Lannister readily enough… but would the king stand by and let it happen The Robert he had known would not have but the Robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king’s baseborn children

The short man gave a sodden shrug He was the King’s Hand Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for

Ned was soaked through to the bone and his soul had grown cold It had to be more than that or why kill him

Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed Now I see Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives and for that he had to be silenced Small wonder Allow a man like that to live and next he’s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east

There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown For the first time in years he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels somehow he thought not

The rain was falling harder now stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out My lord his voice hoarse with alarm And in an instant the street was full of soldiers

Ned glimpsed ringmail over leather gauntlets and greaves steel helms with golden lions on the crests Their cloaks clung to their backs sodden with rain He had no time to count but there were ten at least a line of them on foot blocking the street with longswords and iron-tipped spears Behind he heard Wyl cry and when he turned his horse there were more in back of them cutting off their retreat Jory’s sword came singing from its scabbard Make way or die

The wolves are howling their leader said Ned could see rain running down his face Such a small pack though

Littlefinger walked his horse forward step by careful step What is the meaning of this This is the Hand of the King

He was the Hand of the King The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion The line parted before him On a golden breastplate the lion of Lannister roared its defiance Now if truth be told I’m not sure what he is

Lannister this is madness Littlefinger said Let us pass We are expected back at the castle What do you think you’re doing

He knows what he’s doing Ned said calmly

Jaime Lannister smiled Quite true I’m looking for my brother You remember my brother don’t you Lord Stark He was with us at Winterfell Fair-haired mismatched eyes sharp of tongue A short man

I remember him well Ned replied

It would seem he has met some trouble on the road My lord father is quite vexed You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill would you

Your brother has been taken at my command to answer for his crimes Ned Stark said

Littlefinger groaned in dismay My lords—
