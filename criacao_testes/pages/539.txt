Dany blushed She hated begging A ship yes

Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose I am a trader Khaleesi So perhaps we should speak no more of giving but rather of trade For one of your dragons you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet You need only say that one sweet word

No she said

Alas Xaro sobbed that was not the word I meant

Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children

Whyever not They can always make more Mothers sell their children every day

Not the Mother of Dragons

Not even for twenty ships

Not for a hundred

His mouth curled downward I do not have a hundred But you have three dragons Grant me one for all my kindnesses You will still have two and thirty ships as well

Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros But I do not have a small army How many ships do you own Xaro

Eighty-three if one does not count my pleasure barge

And your colleagues in the Thirteen

Among us all perhaps a thousand

And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Their trifling fleets are of no account

Even so she said tell me

Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood

And the Asshai’i the Braavosi the Summer Islanders the Ibbenese and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea how many ships do they have All together

Many and more he said irritably What does this matter

I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world Dany smiled at him sweetly it seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair

Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose Did I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust This is the very thing I feared The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife A third of all the ships in the world Pah Pah I say Pah

Dany had not seen him since His seneschal brought her messages each cooler than the last She must quit his house He was done feeding her and her people He demanded the return of his gifts which she had accepted in bad faith Her only consolation was that at least she’d had the great good sense not to marry him

The warlocks whispered of three treasons… once for blood and once for gold and once for love The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third She did not think so What Pyat did was not for gold and Xaro had never truly loved her

The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side Her bell rang softly and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth Child of three they had called her daughter of death slayer of lies bride of fire So many threes Three fires three mounts to ride three treasons The dragon has three heads she sighed Do you know what that means Jorah

Your Grace The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon red on black

I know that But there are no three-headed dragons
