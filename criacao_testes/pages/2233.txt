Tyrion noted the look that passed between Paxter Redwyne and Mace Tyrell It might serve Lord Rowan said if you are certain that you can keep the woman loyal to the King’s Grace

My lords pronounced the High Septon autumn is upon us and all men of good heart are weary of war If Lord Baelish can bring the Vale back into the king’s peace without more shedding of blood the gods will surely bless him

But can he asked Lord Redwyne Jon Arryn’s son is Lord of the Eyrie now The Lord Robert

Only a boy said Littlefinger I will see that he grows to be Joffrey’s most loyal subject and a fast friend to us all

Tyrion studied the slender man with the pointed beard and irreverent grey-green eyes Lord of Harrenhal an empty honor Bugger that Father Even if he never sets foot in the castle the title makes this match possible as he’s known all along

We have no lack of foes said Ser Kevan Lannister If the Eyrie can be kept out of the war all to the good I am of a mind to see what Lord Petyr can accomplish

Ser Kevan was his brother’s vanguard in council Tyrion knew from long experience he never had a thought that Lord Tywin had not had first It has all been settled beforehand he concluded and this discussion’s no more than show

The sheep were bleating their agreement unaware of how neatly they’d been shorn so it fell to Tyrion to object How will the crown pay its debts without Lord Petyr He is our wizard of coin and we have no one to replace him

Littlefinger smiled My little friend is too kind All I do is count coppers as King Robert used to say Any clever tradesman could do as well    and a Lannister blessed with the golden touch of Casterly Rock will no doubt far surpass me

A Lannister Tyrion had a bad feeling about this

Lord Tywin’s gold-flecked eyes met his son’s mismatched ones You are admirably suited to the task I believe

Indeed Ser Kevan said heartily I’ve no doubt you’ll make a splendid master of coin Tyrion

Lord Tywin turned back to Littlefinger If Lysa Arryn will take you for a husband and return to the king’s peace we shall restore the Lord Robert to the honor of Warden of the East How soon might you leave

On the morrow if the winds permit There’s a Braavosi galley standing out past the chain taking on cargo by boat The Merling King I’ll see her captain about a berth

You will miss the king’s wedding said Mace Tyrell

Petyr Baelish gave a shrug Tides and brides wait on no man my lord Once the autumn storms begin the voyage will be much more hazardous Drowning would definitely diminish my charms as a bridegroom

Lord Tyrell chuckled True Best you do not linger

May the gods speed you on your way the High Septon said All King’s Landing shall pray for your success

Lord Redwyne pinched at his nose May we return to the matter of the Greyjoy alliance In my view there is much to be said for it Greyjoy’s longships will augment my own fleet and give us sufficient strength at sea to assault Dragonstone and end Stannis Baratheon’s pretensions

King Balon’s longships are occupied for the nonce Lord Tywin said politely as are we Greyjoy demands half the kingdom as the price of alliance but what will he do to earn it Fight the Starks He is doing that already Why should we pay for what he has given us for free The best thing to do about our lord of Pyke is nothing in my view Granted enough time a better option may well present itself One that does not require the king to give up half his kingdom

Tyrion watched his father closely There’s something he’s not saying He remembered those important letters Lord Tywin had been writing the night Tyrion had demanded Casterly Rock What was it he said Some battles are won with swords and spears others with quills and ravens    He wondered who the better option was and what sort of price he was demanding

Perhaps we ought move on to the wedding Ser Kevan said

The High Septon spoke of the preparations being made at the Great Sept of Baelor and Cersei detailed the plans she had been making for the feast They would feed a thousand in the throne room but many more outside in the yards The outer and middle wards would be tented in silk with tables of food and casks of ale for all those who could not be accommodated within the hall

Your Grace said Grand Maester Pycelle in regard to the number of guests    we have had a raven from Sunspear Three hundred Dornishmen are riding toward King’s Landing as we speak and hope to arrive before the wedding

How do they come asked Mace Tyrell gruffly They have not asked leave to cross my lands His thick neck had turned a dark red Tyrion noted Dornishmen and Highgardeners had never had great love for one another over the centuries they had fought border wars beyond count and raided back and forth across mountains and marches even when at peace The enmity had waned a bit after Dorne had become part of the Seven Kingdoms    until the Dornish prince they called the Red Viper had crippled the young heir of Highgarden in a tourney This could be ticklish the dwarf thought waiting to see how his father would handle it

Prince Doran comes at my son’s invitation Lord Tywin said calmly not only to join in our celebration but to claim his seat on this council and the justice Robert denied him for the murder of his sister Elia and her children

Tyrion watched the faces of the Lords Tyrell Redwyne and Rowan wondering if any of the three would be bold enough to say But Lord Tywin wasn’t it you who presented the bodies to Robert all wrapped up in Lannister cloaks None of them did but it was there on their faces all the same Redwyne does not give a fig he thought but Rowan looks fit to gag

When the king is wed to your Margaery and Myrcella to Prince Trystane we shall all be one great House Ser Kevan reminded Mace Tyrell The enmities of the past should remain there would you not agree my lord

This is my daughter’s wedding—

—and my grandson’s said Lord Tywin firmly No place for old quarrels surely

I have no quarrel with Doran Martell insisted Lord Tyrell though his tone was more than a little grudging If he wishes to cross the Reach in peace he need only ask my leave

Small chance of that thought Tyrion He’ll climb the Boneway turn east near Summerhall and come up the kingsroad

Three hundred Dornishmen need not trouble our plans said Cersei We can feed the men-at-arms in the yard squeeze some extra benches into the throne room for the lordlings and highborn knights and find Prince Doran a place of honor on the dais

Not by me was the message Tyrion saw in Mace Tyrell’s eyes but the Lord of Highgarden made no reply but a curt nod

Perhaps we can move to a more pleasant task said Lord Tywin The fruits of victory await division

What could be sweeter said Littlefinger who had already swallowed his own fruit Harrenhal

Each lord had his own demands this castle and that village tracts of lands a small river a forest the wardship of certain minors left fatherless by the battle Fortunately these fruits were plentiful and there were orphans and castles for all Varys had lists Forty-seven lesser lordlings and six hundred nineteen knights had lost their lives beneath the fiery heart of Stannis and his Lord of Light along with several thousand common men-at-arms Traitors all their heirs were disinherited their lands and castles granted to those who had proved more loyal

Highgarden reaped the richest harvest Tyrion eyed Mace Tyrell’s broad belly and thought He has a prodigious appetite this one Tyrell demanded the lands and castles of Lord Alester Florent his own bannerman who’d had the singular ill judgment to back first Renly and then Stannis Lord Tywin was pleased to oblige Brightwater Keep and all its lands and incomes were granted to Lord Tyrell’s second son Ser Garlan transforming him into a great lord in the blink of an eye His elder brother of course stood to inherit Highgarden itself

Lesser tracts were granted to Lord Rowan and set aside for Lord Tarly Lady Oakheart Lord Hightower and other worthies not present Lord Redwyne asked only for thirty years’ remission of the taxes that Littlefinger and his wine factors had levied on certain of the Arbor’s finest vintages When that was granted he pronounced himself well satisfied and suggested that they send for a cask of Arbor gold to toast good King Joffrey and his wise and benevolent Hand At that Cersei lost patience It’s swords Joff needs not toasts she snapped His realm is still plagued with would-be usurpers and self-styled kings

But not for long I think said Varys unctuously

A few more items remain my lords Ser Kevan consulted his papers Ser Addam has found some crystals from the High Septon’s crown It appears certain now that the thieves broke up the crystals and melted down the gold

Our Father Above knows their guilt and will sit in judgment on them all the High Septon said piously

No doubt he will said Lord Tywin All the same you must be crowned at the king’s wedding Cersei summon your goldsmiths we must see to a replacement He did not wait for her reply but turned at once to Varys You have reports

The eunuch drew a parchment from his sleeve A kraken has been seen off the Fingers He giggled Not a Greyjoy mind you a true kraken It attacked an Ibbenese whaler and pulled it under There is fighting on the Stepstones and a new war between Tyrosh and Lys seems likely Both hope to win Myr as ally Sailors back from the Jade Sea report that a three-headed dragon has hatched in Qarth and is the wonder of that city—

Dragons and krakens do not interest me regardless of the number of their heads said Lord Tywin Have your whisperers perchance found some trace of my brother’s son

Alas our beloved Tyrek has quite vanished the poor brave lad Varys sounded close to tears

Tywin Ser Kevan said before Lord Tywin could vent his obvious displeasure some of the gold cloaks who deserted during the battle have drifted back to barracks thinking to take up duty once again Ser Addam wishes to know what to do with them

They might have endangered Joff with their cowardice Cersei said at once I want them put to death

Varys sighed They have surely earned death Your Grace none can deny it And yet perhaps we might be wiser to send them to the Night’s Watch We have had disturbing messages from the Wall of late Of wildlings astir   

Wildlings krakens and dragons Mace Tyrell chuckled Why is there anyone not stirring
