251 Unto thee O LORD do I lift up my soul

252 O my God I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine
enemies triumph over me

253 Yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause

254 Shew me thy ways O LORD teach me thy paths

255 Lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the God of my
salvation on thee do I wait all the day

256 Remember O LORD thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses
for they have been ever of old

257 Remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake O
LORD

258 Good and upright is the LORD therefore will he teach sinners in
the way

259 The meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach
his way

2510 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies

2511 For thy names sake O LORD pardon mine iniquity for it is
great

2512 What man is he that feareth the LORD him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose

2513 His soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the
earth

2514 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him and he will
shew them his covenant

2515 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD for he shall pluck my feet
out of the net

2516 Turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for I am desolate and
afflicted

2517 The troubles of my heart are enlarged O bring thou me out of my
distresses

2518 Look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins

2519 Consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with
cruel hatred

2520 O keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for I put
my trust in thee

2521 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me for I wait on thee

2522 Redeem Israel O God out of all his troubles



261 Judge me O LORD for I have walked in mine integrity I have
trusted also in the LORD therefore I shall not slide

262 Examine me O LORD and prove me try my reins and my heart

263 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and I have walked in
thy truth

264 I have not sat with vain persons neither will I go in with
dissemblers

265 I have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit
with the wicked

266 I will wash mine hands in innocency so will I compass thine
altar O LORD

267 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of
all thy wondrous works

268 LORD I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place
where thine honour dwelleth

269 Gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men

2610 In whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of
bribes

2611 But as for me I will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be
merciful unto me

2612 My foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will I
bless the LORD
