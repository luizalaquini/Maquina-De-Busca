It caught him full in the face Viserys let go of her Blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open You are the one who forgets himself Dany said to him Didn’t you learn anything that day in the grass Leave me now before I summon my khas to drag you out And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails

Viserys scrambled back to his feet When I come into my kingdom you will rue this day slut He walked off holding his torn face leaving her gifts behind him

Drops of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak Dany clutched the soft cloth to her cheek and sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats

Your supper is ready Khaleesi Jhiqui announced

I’m not hungry Dany said sadly She was suddenly very tired Share the food among yourselves and send some to Ser Jorah if you would After a moment she added Please bring me one of the dragon’s eggs

Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she turned it in her small hands Dany curled up on her side pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small tender breasts She liked to hold them They were so beautiful and sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger braver as if somehow she were drawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside

She was lying there holding the egg when she felt the child move within her… as if he were reaching out brother to brother blood to blood You are the dragon Dany whispered to him the true dragon I know it I know it And she smiled and went to sleep dreaming of home





BRAN

A light snow was falling Bran could feel the flakes on his face melting as they touched his skin like the gentlest of rains He sat straight atop his horse watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward Try as he might to keep calm his heart was fluttering in his chest

Are you ready Robb asked

Bran nodded trying not to let his fear show He had not been outside Winterfell since his fall but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight

Let’s ride then Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding and the horse walked under the portcullis

Go Bran whispered to his own horse He touched her neck lightly and the small chestnut filly started forward Bran had named her Dancer She was two years old and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be They had trained her special to respond to rein and voice and touch Up to now Bran had only ridden her around the yard At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own trotting her round and round and growing bolder with every circuit

They passed beneath the gatehouse over the drawbridge through the outer walls Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them sniffing at the wind Close behind came Theon Greyjoy with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads he had a mind to take a deer he had told them He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs and Joseth a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away Maester Luwin brought up the rear riding on a donkey Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone just the two of them but Hal Mollen would not hear of it and Maester Luwin backed him If Bran fell off his horse or injured himself the maester was determined to be with him

Beyond the castle lay the market square its wooden stalls deserted now They rode down the muddy streets of the village past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone Less than one in five were occupied thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north Old Nan said farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts loaded up their wagons and then the winter town came alive Bran had never seen it happen but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer The end of the long summer was near at hand Winter is coming

A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past and one man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight They bent the knee when they saw the boys and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod

With his legs unable to grip the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural His anxiety faded and a tremulous smile crept across his face

Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log the local alehouse When Theon Greyjoy called out to them the younger girl turned red and covered her face Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb Sweet Kyra he said with a laugh She squirms like a weasel in bed but say a word to her on the street and she blushes pink as a maid Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa—

Not where my brother can hear Theon Robb warned him with a glance at Bran

Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard but he could feel Greyjoy’s eyes on him No doubt he was smiling He smiled a lot as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company but Bran had never warmed to his father’s ward

Robb rode closer You are doing well Bran

I want to go faster Bran replied

Robb smiled As you will He sent his gelding into a trot The wolves raced after him Bran snapped the reins sharply and Dancer picked up her pace He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him

Bran’s cloak billowed out rippling in the wind and the snow seemed to rush at his face Robb was well ahead glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following He snapped the reins again Smooth as silk Dancer slid into a gallop The distance closed By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood two miles beyond the winter town they had left the others well behind I can ride Bran shouted grinning It felt almost as good as flying

I’d race you but I fear you’d win Robb’s tone was light and joking yet Bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile
