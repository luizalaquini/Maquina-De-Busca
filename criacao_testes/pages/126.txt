between the two cherubims and he spake unto him

say unto him When thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give
light over against the candlestick

83 And Aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick as the LORD commanded Moses

shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses so he made the
candlestick

among the children of Israel and cleanse them

of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let
them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean

congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
of Israel together 810 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the
LORD and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the
Levites 811 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
