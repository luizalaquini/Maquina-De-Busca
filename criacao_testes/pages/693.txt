Oh said Mace Tyrell cheerfully women have no stomach for war Let her be I say she’s not like to trouble us

I agree said Redwyne The Lady Lysa took no part in the fighting nor has she committed any overt acts of treason

Tyrionstirred She did throw me in a cell and put me on trial for my life he pointed out with a certain amount of rancor Nor has she returned to King’s Landing to swear fealty to Joff as she was commanded My lords grant me the men and I will sort out Lysa Arryn He could think of nothing he would enjoy more except perhaps strangling Cersei Sometimes he still dreamed of the Eyrie’s sky cells and woke drenched in cold sweat

Mace Tyrell’s smile was jovial but behind it Tyrion sensed contempt Perhaps you’d best leave the fighting to fighters said the Lord of Highgarden Better men than you have lost great armies in the Mountains of the Moon or shattered them against the Bloody Gate We know your worth my lord no need to tempt fate

Tyrion pushed off his cushions bristling but his father spoke before he could lash back I have other tasks in mind for Tyrion I believe Lord Petyr may hold the key to the Eyrie

Oh I do said Littleflnger I have it here between my legs There was mischief in his grey-green eyes My lords with your leave I propose to travel to the Vale and there woo and win Lady Lysa Arryn Once I am her consort I shall deliver you the Vale of Arryn without a drop of blood being spilled

Lord Rowan looked doubtful Would Lady Lysa have you

She’s had me a few times before Lord Mathis and voiced no complaints

Bedding said Cersei is not wedding Even a cow like Lysa Arryn might be able to grasp the difference

To be sure It would not have been fitting for a daughter of Riverrun to marry one so far below her Littlefinger spread his hands Now though… a match between the Lady of the Eyrie and the Lord of Harrenhal is not so unthinkable is it

Tyrion noted the look that passed between Paxter Redwyne and Mace Tyrell It might serve Lord Rowan said if you are certain that you can keep the woman loyal to the King’s Grace

My lords pronounced the High Septon autumn is upon us and all men of good heart are weary of war If Lord Baelish can bring the Vale back into the king’s peace without more shedding of blood the gods will surely bless him

But can he asked Lord Redwyne Jon Arryn’s son is Lord of the Eyrie now The Lord Robert

Only a boy said Littleflnger I will see that he grows to be Joffrey’s most loyal subject and a fast friend to us all

Tyrion studied the slender man with the pointed beard and irreverent grey-green eyes Lord of Harrenhal an empty honor Bugger that Father Even if he never sets foot in the castle the title makes this match possible as he’s known all along

We have no lack of foes said Ser Kevan Lannister If the Eyrie can be kept out of the war all to the good I am of a mind to see what Lord Petyr can accomplish

Ser Kevan was his brother’s vanguard in council Tyrion knew from long experience he never had a thought that Lord Tywin had not had first It has all been settled beforehand he concluded and this discussion’s no more than show

The sheep were bleating their agreement unaware of how neatly they’d been shorn so it fell to Tyrion to object How will the crown pay its debts without Lord Petyr He is our wizard of coin and we have no one to replace him

Littlefinger smiled My little friend is too kind All I do is count coppers as King Robert used to say Any clever tradesman could do as well… and a Lannister blessed with the golden touch of Casterly Rock will no doubt far surpass me

A Lannister Tyrion had a bad feeling about this

Lord Tywin’s gold-flecked eyes met his son’s mismatched ones You are admirably suited to the task I believe

Indeed Ser Kevan said heartily I’ve no doubt you’ll make a splendid master of coin Tyrion

Lord Tywin turned back to Littlefinger If Lysa Arryn will take you for a husband and return to the king’s peace we shall restore the Lord Robert to the honor of Warden of the East How soon might you leave

On the morrow if the winds permit There’s a Braavosi galley standing out past the chain taking on cargo by boat The Merling King I’ll see her captain about a berth

You will miss the king’s wedding said Mace Tyrell

Petyr Baelish gave a shrug Tides and brides wait on no man my lord Once the autumn storms begin the voyage will be much more hazardous Drowning would definitely diminish my charms as a bridegroom

Lord Tyrell chuckled True Best you do not linger
