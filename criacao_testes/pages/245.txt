if we ask for a truce they will think us weak Ser Addarn argued We should march on them at once

Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops said Ser Harys And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host

Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet They have my son he said once more in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet Leave me All of you

Ever the soul of obedience Tyrion rose to depart with the rest but his father gave him a look Not you Tyrion Remain And you as well Kevan The rest of you out

Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench startled into speechlessness Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks Uncle Tyrion called if you would be so kind—

Here His father offered him his cup the wine untouched

Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed He drank

Lord Tywin seated himself You have the right of it about Stark Alive we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers Dead… His hand curled into a fist Madness Rank madness

Joff’s only a boy Tyrion pointed out At his age I committed a few follies of my own

His father gave him a sharp look I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore

Tyrion sipped at his wine wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face

Our position is worse than you know his father went on It would seem we have a new king

Ser Kevan looked poleaxed A new—who What have they done to Joffrey

The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin’s thin lips Nothing… yet My grandson still sits the Iron Throne but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past and now he has claimed the crown The bride’s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords

Those are grave tidings When Ser Kevan frowned the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons

My daughter commands us to ride for King’s Landing at once to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers His mouth tightened Commands us mind you In the name of the king and council

How is King Joffrey taking the news Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement

Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet Lord Tywin said She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself

With what army Tyrion asked You don’t plan to give him this one I hope

He talks of leading the City Watch Lord Tywin said

If he takes the Watch he’ll leave the city undefended Ser Kevan said And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone…

Yes Lord Tywin looked down at his son I had thought you were the one made for motley Tyrion but it would appear that I was wrong

Why Father said Tyrion that almost sounds like praise He leaned forward intently What of Stannis He’s the elder not Renly How does he feel about his brother’s claim

His father frowned I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined Yet he does nothing Oh Varys hears his whispers Stannis is building ships Stannis is hiring sellswords Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai What does it mean Is any of it true He gave an irritated shrug Kevan bring us the map

Ser Kevan did as he was bid Lord Tywin unrolled the leather smoothing it flat Jaime has left us in a bad way Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin Robb Stark sits to the west so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle Jaime is taken and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties To our east we have the Arryns Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone and in the south Highgarden and Storm’s End are calling their banners

Tyrion smiled crookedly Take heart Father At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead

I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes Tyrion Lord Tywin Lannister said
