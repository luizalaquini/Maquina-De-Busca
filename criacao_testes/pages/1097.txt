We put the steward’s girl in with her Ser Boros said We did not know what else to do with her

The queen frowned Next time you will ask she said her voice sharp The gods only know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with

Jeyne’s scared Sansa said She won’t stop crying I promised her I’d ask if she could see her father

Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes

Her father is well isn’t he Sansa said anxiously She knew there had been fighting but surely no one would harm a steward Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword

Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn I won’t have Sansa fretting needlessly What shall we do with this little friend of hers my lords

Lord Petyr leaned forward I’ll find a place for her

Not in the city said the queen

Do you take me for a fool

The queen ignored that Ser Boros escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father that ought to calm her down I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber

As you command Your Grace Ser Boros said He bowed deeply spun on his heel and took his leave his long white cloak stirring the air behind him

Sansa was confused I don’t understand she said Where is Jeyne’s father Why can’t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it She had promised herself she would be a lady gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother the Lady Catelyn but all of a sudden she was scared again For a second she thought she might cry Where are you sending her She hasn’t done anything wrong she’s a good girl

She’s upset you the queen said gently We can’t be having that Not another word now Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne’s well taken care of I promise you She patted the chair beside her Sit down Sansa I want to talk to you

Sansa seated herself beside the queen Cersei smiled again but that did not make her feel any less anxious Varys was wringing his soft hands together Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him but she could feel Littlefinger staring Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on Goose bumps pimpled her skin

Sweet Sansa Queen Cersei said laying a soft hand on her wrist Such a beautiful child I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you

You do Sansa said breathless Littlefinger was forgotten Her prince loved her Nothing else mattered

The queen smiled I think of you almost as my own daughter And I know the love you bear for Joffrey She gave a weary shake of her head I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father You must be brave child

Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill What is it

Your father is a traitor dear Lord Varys said

Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head With my own ears I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons And yet the moment the king was dead he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne

No Sansa blurted He wouldn’t do that He wouldn’t

The queen picked up a letter The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood but the broken seal was her father’s the direwolf stamped in pale wax We found this on the captain of your household guard Sansa It is a letter to my late husband’s brother Stannis inviting him to take the crown

Please Your Grace there’s been a mistake Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint Please send for my father he’ll tell you he would never write such a letter the king was his friend

Robert thought so said the queen This betrayal would have broken his heart The gods are kind that he did not live to see it She sighed Sansa sweetling you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in You are innocent of any wrong we all know that and yet you are the daughter of a traitor How can I allow you to marry my son

But I love him Sansa wailed confused and frightened What did they mean to do to her What had they done to her father It was not supposed to happen this way She had to wed Joffrey they were betrothed he was promised to her she had even dreamed about it It wasn’t fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done

How well I know that child Cersei said her voice so kind and sweet Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father’s plan to send you away from us if not for love

It was for love Sansa said in a rush Father wouldn’t even give me leave to say farewell She was the good girl the obedient girl but she had felt as wicked as Arya that morning sneaking away from Septa Mordane defying her lord father She had never done anything so willful before and she would never have done it then if she hadn’t loved Joffrey as much as she did He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight even though it was Joff I wanted I told him but he wouldn’t listen The king had been her last hope The king could command Father to let her stay in King’s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey Sansa knew he could but the king had always frightened her He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not and he would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard if they even let her see him So she went to the queen instead and poured out her heart and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly… only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast and posted guards and a few hours later the fighting had begun outside Please she finished you have to let me marry Joffrey I’ll be ever so good a wife to him you’ll see I’ll be a queen just like you I promise

Queen Cersei looked to the others My lords of the council what do you say to her plea

The poor child murmured Varys A love so true and innocent Your Grace it would be cruel to deny it… and yet what can we do Her father stands condemned His soft hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress

A child born of traitor’s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her said Grand Maester Pycelle She is a sweet thing now but in ten years who can say what treasons she may hatch

No Sansa said horrified I’m not I’d never… I wouldn’t betray Joffrey I love him I swear it I do

Oh so poignant said Varys And yet it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths

She reminds me of the mother not the father Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly Look at her The hair the eyes She is the very image of Cat at the same age

The queen looked at her troubled and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes Child she said if I could truly believe that you were not like your father why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey I know he loves you with all his heart She sighed And yet I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it The blood will tell I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son

I’m not like Arya Sansa blurted She has the traitor’s blood not me I’m good ask Septa Mordane she’ll tell you I only want to be Joffrey’s loyal and loving wife

She felt the weight of Cersei’s eyes as the queen studied her face I believe you mean it child She turned to face the others My lords it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest

Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard his wide brow furrowed in thought Lord Eddard has three sons

Mere boys Lord Petyr said with a shrug I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys

The queen took Sansa’s hand in both of hers Child do you know your letters

Sansa nodded nervously She could read and write better than any of her brothers although she was hopeless at sums

I am pleased to hear that Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still…

What do you want me to do

You must write your lady mother and your brother the eldest… what is his name

Robb Sansa said

The word of your lord father’s treason will no doubt reach them soon Better that it should come from you You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king

Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking But he never… I don’t… Your Grace I wouldn’t know what to say…

The queen patted her hand We will tell you what to write child The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king’s peace

It will go hard for them if they don’t said Grand Maester Pycelle By the love you bear them you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom

Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully the queen said You must tell her that you are well and in our care that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want Bid them to come to King’s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne If they do that… why then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood and when you come into the flower of your womanhood you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor before the eyes of gods and men

…wed the king… The words made her breath come faster yet still Sansa hesitated Perhaps… if I might see my father talk to him about…
