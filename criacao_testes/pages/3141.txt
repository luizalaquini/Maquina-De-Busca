518 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD to what end is it
for you the day of the LORD is darkness and not light

519 As if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went
into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit
him

520 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness and not light even
very dark and no brightness in it  521 I hate I despise your feast
days and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies

522 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings I
will not accept them neither will I regard the peace offerings of
your fat beasts

523 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for I will not
hear the melody of thy viols

524 But let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a
mighty stream

525 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years O house of Israel  526 But ye have borne the
tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images the star of your god
which ye made to yourselves

527 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus
saith the LORD whose name is The God of hosts

61 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion and trust in the mountain of
Samaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house of
Israel came  62 Pass ye unto Calneh and see and from thence go ye
to Hamath the great then go down to Gath of the Philistines be they
better than these kingdoms or their border greater than your border
63 Ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence
to come near 64 That lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves
upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves
out of the midst of the stall 65 That chant to the sound of the
viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like David 66
That drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief
ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph

67 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
captive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be
removed

68 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself saith the LORD the God of
hosts I abhor the excellency of Jacob and hate his palaces
therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein

69 And it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house
that they shall die

610 And a mans uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him to
bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is
by the sides of the house Is there yet any with thee and he shall
say No Then shall he say Hold thy tongue for we may not make
mention of the name of the LORD

611 For behold the LORD commandeth and he will smite the great
house with breaches and the little house with clefts

612 Shall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxen
for ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness
into hemlock 613 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought which say
Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength  614 But behold
I will raise up against you a nation O house of Israel saith the
LORD the God of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering in
of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness

71 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me and behold he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth
and lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowings

72 And it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land then I said O Lord GOD forgive I beseech thee
by whom shall Jacob arise for he is small

73 The LORD repented for this It shall not be saith the LORD

74 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me and behold the Lord GOD
called to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eat
up a part

75 Then said I O Lord GOD cease I beseech thee by whom shall
Jacob arise for he is small

76 The LORD repented for this This also shall not be saith the Lord
GOD

77 Thus he shewed me and behold the LORD stood upon a wall made by
a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand

78 And the LORD said unto me Amos what seest thou And I said A
plumbline Then said the LORD Behold I will set a plumbline in the
midst of my people Israel I will not again pass by them any more 79
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of
Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise against the house of
Jeroboam with the sword
