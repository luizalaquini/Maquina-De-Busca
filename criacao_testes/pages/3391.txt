129 And the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the
Devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out
into the earth and his angels were cast out with him

1210 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven Now is come
salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of
his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which
accused them before our God day and night

1211 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death

1212 Therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them Woe to
the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down
unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a
short time

1213 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child

1214 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she
might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished
for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent

1215 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood

1216 And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth

1217 And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war
with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of God and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ

131 And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out
of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten
crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy

132 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and
the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority

133 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his
deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast

134 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying Who is like unto the beast who
is able to make war with him  135 And there was given unto him a
mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto
him to continue forty and two months

136 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme
his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven

137 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to
overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues
and nations

138 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world

139 If any man have an ear let him hear

1310 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that
killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword Here is the
patience and the faith of the saints

1311 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he
had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon

1312 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him
and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
first beast whose deadly wound was healed

1313 And he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth in the sight of men 1314 And deceiveth them
that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had
power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on
the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the
wound by a sword and did live

1315 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that
the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as
would not worship the image of the beast should be killed

1316 And he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free
and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their
foreheads 1317 And that no man might buy or sell save he that had
the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name

1318 Here is wisdom Let him that hath understanding count the number
of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is Six
hundred threescore and six

141 And I looked and lo a Lamb stood on the mount Sion and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand having his Fathers name
written in their foreheads
