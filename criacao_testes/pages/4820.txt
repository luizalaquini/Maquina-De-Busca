mouth

2458 And they called Rebekah and said unto her Wilt thou go with
this man And she said I will go

2459 And they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse and
Abrahams servant and his men

2460 And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her Thou art our
sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed
possess the gate of those which hate them

2461 And Rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the
camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebekah and went
his way

2462 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi for he dwelt
in the south country

2463 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and
he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming

2464 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac she
lighted off the camel

2465 For she had said unto the servant What man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us And the servant had said It is my master
therefore she took a vail and covered herself

2466 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done

2467 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarahs tent and took
Rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was
comforted after his mothers death

251 Then again Abraham took a wife and her name was Keturah

252 And she bare him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and
Ishbak and Shuah

253 And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan And the sons of Dedan were
Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim

254 And the sons of Midian Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abidah
and Eldaah All these were the children of Keturah

255 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac

256 But unto the sons of the concubines which Abraham had Abraham
gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived
eastward unto the east country

257 And these are the days of the years of Abrahams life which he
lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years

258 Then Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an
old man and full of years and was gathered to his people

259 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
Machpelah in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite which
is before Mamre 2510 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons
of Heth there was Abraham buried and Sarah his wife

2511 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed
his son Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi

2512 Now these are the generations of Ishmael Abrahams son whom
Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs handmaid bare unto Abraham 2513 And
these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according
to their generations the firstborn of Ishmael Nebajoth and Kedar
and Adbeel and Mibsam 2514 And Mishma and Dumah and Massa 2515
Hadar and Tema Jetur Naphish and Kedemah 2516 These are the sons
of Ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their
castles twelve princes according to their nations

2517 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael an hundred and
thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was
gathered unto his people

2518 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt as
thou goest toward Assyria and he died in the presence of all his
brethren

2519 And these are the generations of Isaac Abrahams son Abraham
begat Isaac 2520 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah
to wife the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram the sister
to Laban the Syrian

2521 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife because she was
barren and the LORD was intreated of him and Rebekah his wife
conceived

2522 And the children struggled together within her and she said If
it be so why am I thus And she went to enquire of the LORD

2523 And the LORD said unto her Two nations are in thy womb and two
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall
serve the younger
