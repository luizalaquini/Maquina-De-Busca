directs the operator to cut 25 of red wire attach one end to a specified point
on the terminal strip and attach the other to a pin of the tube socket  The
tape recorder is fitted with a pedal switch to allow a sequence of such instructions
to be executed by the operator at his own pace
pp
The usual way of recording the instruction tape is to have a human reader
dictate them from a printed list
The tape is then checked against the list by another listener to ensure that
the instructions are correct  Since wiring lists are usually stored and
maintained in machine-readable form it is natural to consider whether speech
synthesis techniques could be used to generate the acoustic tape directly by
a computer Flanagan

FG Table 12  Vocabulary needed for computer-generated wiring instructions
It is rather larger
than that of the talking calculator em about 25 seconds of speech em but well
within the limits of single-chip storage in ROM compressed by the linear
predictive technique  However at the time that the scheme was investigated
1970-71 the method of linear predictive coding had not been fully developed
and the technology for low-cost microcircuit implementation was not available
But this is not important for this particular application for there is
no need to perform the synthesis on a miniature low-cost computer system
nor need it
be accomplished in real time  In fact a technique of concatenating
spectrally-encoded words was used described in Chapter 7 and it was
implemented on a minicomputer  Operating much slower than real-time the system
calculated the speech waveform and wrote it to disk storage  A subsequent phase
read the pre-computed messages and recorded them on a computer-controlled analogue
tape recorder
pp
Informal evaluation showed the scheme to be quite successful  Indeed the
synthetic speech whose quality was not high was actually preferred to
natural speech in the noisy environment of the production line for each
instruction was spoken in the same format with the same programmed pause
between the items
A list of 58 instructions of the form shown above was recorded and used
to wire several pieces of apparatus without errors

The computer-generated wiring scheme illustrates how speech can be used to give
instructions without diverting visual attention from the task at hand
The next system we examine shows how speech output can make the telephone
receiver into a remote computer terminal for a variety of purposes
