the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the
LORD even that man shall be cut off from among his people

1710 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel or of the
strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood I
will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will
cut him off from among his people

1711 For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is
the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul

1712 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel No soul of you
shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you
eat blood

1713 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel or of the
strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast
or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof
and cover it with dust

1714 For it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life
thereof therefore I said unto the children of Israel Ye shall eat
the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the
blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off

1715 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that
which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or
a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in
water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean

1716 But if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear
his iniquity

181 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 182 Speak unto the
children of Israel and say unto them I am the LORD your God

183 After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye
not do and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I bring
you shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their ordinances

184 Ye shall do my judgments and keep mine ordinances to walk
therein I am the LORD your God

185 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments which if a
man do he shall live in them I am the LORD

186 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to
uncover their nakedness I am the LORD
