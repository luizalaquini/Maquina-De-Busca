and then lifting it showed her a thin shaving of scarf+
skin dangling therefrom
 But you said before beginning that it was blunt and
couldnt cut me 
That was to get you to stand still and so make sure
of your safety The risk of injuring you through your
moving was too great not to force me to tell you a
fib to escape it
She shuddered I have been within an inch of my
life and didnt know it 
More precisely speaking you have been within half
an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety-five
tinies
 Cruel cruel tis of you  
 You have been perfectly safe nevertheless My
sword never errs And Troy returned the weapon to
the scabbard
Bathsheba overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel
ings resulting from the scene abstractedly sat down on
a tuft of heather
I must leave you now said Troy softly  And Ill
venture to take and keep this in remembrance of you
She saw him stoop to the grass pick up the winding
lock which he had severcd from her manifold tresses
twist it round his fingers unfasten a button in the hreast
of his coat and carefully put it inside She felt power+
less to withstand or deny him He was altogether too
much for her and Bathsheba

seemed as one who facing
a reviving wind finds it blow so strongly that it stops
the breath
He drew near and said I must be leaving you
He drew nearer still A minute later and she saw his
scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket almost in
a flash like a brand swiftly waved
That minutes interval had brought the blood beating
into her face set her stinging as if aflame to the very
hollows oi her feet and enlarged emotion to a compass
which quite swamped thought It had brought upon
her a stroke resulting as did that of Moses in Horeh in
a liquid stream -- here a stream of tears She felt like
one who has sinned a great sin
The circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troys
mouth downwards upon her own He had kissed her

PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
WE now see the element of folly distinctly mingling
with the many varying particulars which made up the
character of Bathsheba Everdene It was almost foreign
to her intrinsic nature Introduced as lymph on the
dart of Eros it eventually permeated and coloured
her whole constitution Bathsheba though she had too
much understanding to be entirely governed by her
womanliness had too much womanliness to use her
understanding to the best advantage Perhaps in no
minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
than in the strange power she possesses of believing
cajoleries that she knows to be false -- except indeed in
that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she
knows to be true
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant
women love when they abandon their self-reliance
When a strong woman recklessly throws away her
strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never
had any strength to throw away One source of her
inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion She has
never had practice in making the best of such a
condition Weakness is doubly weak by being new
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter
Though in one sense a woman of the world it was after
all that world of daylight coteries and green carpets
wherein cattle form the passing crowd and winds the
busy hum  where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives
on the other side of your party-wall where your neigh+
bour is everybody in the tything and where calculation
formulated self-indulgence of bad nothing at all Had
her utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly
worded and by herself they never were they would
P 244
only have amounted to such a matter as that she felt
her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion 
Her love was entire as a childs and though warm as
summer it was fresh as spring Her culpability lay in
her making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and
careful inquiry into consuences She could show others
the steep and thorny way but reckd not her own rede
And Troys deformities lay deep down from a
womans vision whilst his embellishments were upon
the verysurface thus contrasting with homely Oak
whose defects were patent to the blindest and whose
vertues were as metals in a mine
The difference between love and respect was mark+
edly shown in her conduct Bathsheba had spoken of
her interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to
Liddy but she had only communed with her own heart
concerning Troy
All this infatuation Gabriel saw and was troubled
