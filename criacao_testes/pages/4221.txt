was struck for the first time with a thought that Fanny
had been really prevented by illness from keeping her
promise This time she could have made no mistake
He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge
and made inquiries Reaching home he quietly un+
harnessed the horse and came indoors as we have seen
to the fearful shock that awaited him
As soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects
Troy arose from the coverlet of the bed and in a mood
of absolute indifference to Bathshebas whereabouts a
almost oblivious of her existence he stalked downstairs
and left the house by the back door His walk was
towards the churchyard entering which he searched
around till he found a newly dug unoccupied grave --
the grave dug the day before for Fanny The position
of this having been marked he hastened on to Caster+
bridge only pausing
whereon he had last seen Fanny alive
Reaching the town Troy descended into a side
street and entered a pair of gates surmounted by a board
bearing the words Lester stone and marble mason
Within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs
inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed
persons who had not yet died
Troy was so unlike himself now in look word and
deed that the want of likeness was perceptible even to
his own consciousness His method of engaging himself
in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an
absolutely unpractised man He could not bring him+
self to consider calculate or
P 371
economize He waywardly
wished for something and he set about obtaining it like
a child in a nursery I want a good tomb he said to
the man who stood in a little office within the yard
I want as good a one as you can give me for twenty+
seven pounds
It was all the money he possessed
That sum to include everything
 Everything Cutting the name carriage to Weather+
bury and erection And I want it now at once 
 We could not get anything special worked this
week
If you would like one of these in stock it could be
got ready immediately
Very well said Troy impatiently  Lets see what
you have
The best I have in stock is this one said the stone+
cutter going into a shed  Heres a marble headstone
beautifully crocketed with medallions beneath of typical
subjects  heres the footstone after the same pattern
and heres the coping to enclose the- grave The
slabs are the best of their kind and I can warrant them
Well I couId add the name and put it up at
visitor who wore not a shred of mourning Troy then
settled the account and went away In the afternoon
almost done He waited in the yard till the tomb was
way to Weatherbury giving directions to the two men
the grave of the person named in the inscription
bridge He carried rather a heavy basket upon his
occasionally at bridges and
P 372
gates whereon he deposited
returning in the darkness the men and the waggon
the work was done and on being assured that it was
Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten
had marked the vacant grave early in the morning It
extent from the view of passers along the road -- a spot
and bushes of alder but now it was cleared and made
the ground elsewhere
Here now stood the tomb as the men had stated snow+
white and shapely in the gloom consisting of head and
foot-stone and enclosing border of marble-work uniting
them In the midst was mould suitable for plants
Troy deposited his basket beside the tomb and
vanished for a few minutes When he returned he
carried a spade and a lantern the light of which he
directed for a few moments upon the marble whilst he
read the inscription He hung his lantern on the lowest
bough of the yew-tree and took from his basket flower+
roots of several varieties There were bundles of snow+
drop hyacinth and crocus bulbs violets and double
daisies which were to bloom in early spring and of
carnations pinks picotees lilies of the valley forget-me+
not summers-farewell meadow-saffron and others for
the later seasons of the year
Troy laid these out upon the grass and with an im+
passive face set to work to plant them The snowdrops
were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping
the remainder within the enclosure of the grave The
crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows some of
the summer flowers he placed over her head and feet
the lilies and forget-me-nots over her heart The
remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these
Troy in his prostration at this time had no percep+
tion that in the futility of these romantic doings dictated
by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference there
was any element
P 373
of absurdity Deriving his idiosyn+
