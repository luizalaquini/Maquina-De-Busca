bowed themselves

337 And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves
and after came Joseph near and Rachel and they bowed themselves

338 And he said What meanest thou by all this drove which I met And
he said These are to find grace in the sight of my lord

339 And Esau said I have enough my brother keep that thou hast
unto thyself

3310 And Jacob said Nay I pray thee if now I have found grace in
thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore I have
seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God and thou wast
pleased with me

3311 Take I pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because
God hath dealt graciously with me and because I have enough And he
urged him and he took it

3312 And he said Let us take our journey and let us go and I will
go before thee

3313 And he said unto him My lord knoweth that the children are
tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men
should overdrive them one day all the flock will die

3314 Let my lord I pray thee pass over before his servant and I
will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and
the children be able to endure until I come unto my lord unto Seir

3315 And Esau said Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
are with me And he said What needeth it let me find grace in the
sight of my lord

3316 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir

3317 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built him an house and made
booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called
Succoth

3318 And Jacob came to Shalem a city of Shechem which is in the
land of Canaan when he came from Padanaram and pitched his tent
before the city

3319 And he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent
at the hand of the children of Hamor Shechems father for an hundred
pieces of money

3320 And he erected there an altar and called it EleloheIsrael

341 And Dinah the daughter of Leah which she bare unto Jacob went
out to see the daughters of the land

342 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite prince of the
country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her

343 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob and he loved
the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel

344 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor saying Get me this
damsel to wife

345 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter now his
sons were with his cattle in the field and Jacob held his peace until
they were come

346 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
with him

347 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it
and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had
wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacobs daughter which thing
ought not to be done

348 And Hamor communed with them saying The soul of my son Shechem
longeth for your daughter I pray you give her him to wife

349 And make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us
and take our daughters unto you

3410 And ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you
dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein

3411 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren Let me
find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me I will give

3412 Ask me never so much dowry and gift and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife

3413 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
deceitfully and said because he had defiled Dinah their sister
3414 And they said unto them We cannot do this thing to give our
sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
3415 But in this will we consent unto you If ye will be as we be
that every male of you be circumcised 3416 Then will we give our
daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will
dwell with you and we will become one people

3417 But if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will
