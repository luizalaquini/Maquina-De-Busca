1626 For all the gods of the people are idols but the LORD made the
heavens

1627 Glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are
in his place

1628 Give unto the LORD ye kindreds of the people give unto the
LORD glory and strength

1629 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name bring an
offering and come before him worship the LORD in the beauty of
holiness

1630 Fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable
that it be not moved

1631 Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men
say among the nations The LORD reigneth

1632 Let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields
rejoice and all that is therein

1633 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
LORD because he cometh to judge the earth

1634 O give thanks unto the LORD for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever

1635 And say ye Save us O God of our salvation and gather us
together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to
thy holy name and glory in thy praise

1636 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever And all the
people said Amen and praised the LORD

1637 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as
every days work required 1638 And Obededom with their brethren
threescore and eight Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to
be porters 1639 And Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests
before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at
Gibeon 1640 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of
the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do
according to all that is written in the law of the LORD which he
commanded Israel 1641 And with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest
that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the
LORD because his mercy endureth for ever 1642 And with them Heman
and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a
sound and with musical instruments of God And the sons of Jeduthun
were porters

1643 And all the people departed every man to his house and David
returned to bless his house

171 Now it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said
to Nathan the prophet Lo I dwell in an house of cedars but the ark
of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains

172 Then Nathan said unto David Do all that is in thine heart for
God is with thee

173 And it came to pass the same night that the word of God came to
Nathan saying 174 Go and tell David my servant Thus saith the
LORD Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in 175 For I have
not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this
day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to
another

176 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel spake I a word to any
of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people saying
Why have ye not built me an house of cedars  177 Now therefore thus
shalt thou say unto my servant David Thus saith the LORD of hosts I
took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou
shouldest be ruler over my people Israel 178 And I have been with
thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine
enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of
the great men that are in the earth

179 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel and will plant
them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at
the beginning 1710 And since the time that I commanded judges to be
over my people Israel Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies
Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house

1711 And it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou
must go to be with thy fathers that I will raise up thy seed after
thee which shall be of thy sons and I will establish his kingdom

1712 He shall build me an house and I will stablish his throne for
ever

1713 I will be his father and he shall be my son and I will not
take my mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before
thee 1714 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
ever and his throne shall be established for evermore

1715 According to all these words and according to all this vision
so did Nathan speak unto David
