There is clearly a trade-off between the size of the morph dictionary
and the complexity of the concatenation rules
pp
Since a text-to-speech system is presented with already-concatenated
morphs it must be prepared to reverse the effects of the concatenation
rules to deduce the constituents of a word
When two morphs combine with any of the three rules given above
the changes in spelling occur only in the lefthand one
Therefore the word is best scanned in a right-to-left direction to
split off the morphs starting with suffixes as McIlroys program does
If the procedure fails at any point one of the three rules is
hypothesized its effect is undone and splitting continues
For example consider the word
LB
NI
grasshoppers	em  grass + hop + er + s
LE
Lee 1969

Lee 1969

The -s is detected first then -er these are both stored in
the dictionary as suffixes
The remainder grasshopp cannot be decomposed and does not appear
in the dictionary
So each of the rules above is hypothesized in turn and the
result investigated  The y em i rule is obviously not
applicable  When
the final-consonant-doubling rule is considered the sequence
grasshop is investigated
Shop could be split off this but then the unknown morph gras
would result
The alternative to remove hop leaves a remainder grass which
ul
is
a free morph as desired
Thus a unique and correct decomposition is obtained
Notice that the procedure would fail if for example grass had
been inadvertently omitted from the dictionary
pp
Sometimes several seemingly valid decompositions present themselves

The last distinction is important because the pronunciation of wind
depends on whether it is a noun or a verb

Several sources of information can be used to resolve these ambiguities
The word structure of Figure 93 together with the division of root
morphs into bound and free ones may eliminate some possibilities
Certain letter sequences such as rp do not appear at the beginning
of a word or morph and others never occur at the end
Knowledge of these sequences can reject some unacceptable
decompositions em or perhaps more importantly can enable intelligent guesses
to be made in cases where a constituent morph has been omitted from the
dictionary
The grammatical function of suffixes allows suffix sequences to be
checked for compatibility
The syntax of the sentence together with suffix knowledge can
rule out other combinations
Semantic knowledge will occasionally be necessary as in the unionized
and winding examples above em compare a winding road with a winding
blow
Finally Allen 1976 suggests that a preference structure on composition
rules can be used to resolve ambiguity
