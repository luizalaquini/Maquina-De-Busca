For Winterfell Robb said at once With Bran and Rickon dead Sansa is my heir If anything should happen to me…

She clutched tight at his hand Nothing will happen to you Nothing I could not stand it They took Ned and your sweet brothers Sansa is married Arya is lost my father’s dead… if anything befell you I would go mad Robb You are all I have left You are all the north has left

I am not dead yet Mother

Suddenly Catelyn was full of dread Wars need not be fought until the last drop of blood Even she could hear the desperation in her voice You would not be the first king to bend the knee nor even the first Stark

His mouth tightened No Never

There is no shame in it Balon Greyjoy bent the knee to Robert when his rebellion failed Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires

Did Aegon kill King Torrhen’s father He pulled his hand from hers Never I said

He is playing the boy now not the king The Lannisters do not need the north They will require homage and hostages no more… and the Imp will keep Sansa no matter what we do so they have their hostage The ironmen will prove a more implacable enemy I promise you To have any hope of holding the north the Greyjoys must leave no single sprig of House Stark alive to dispute their right Theon’s murdered Bran and Rickon so now all they need do is kill you… and Jeyne yes Do you think Lord Balon can afford to let her live to bear you heirs

Robb’s face was cold Is that why you freed the Kingslayer To make a peace with the Lannisters

I freed Jaime for Sansa’s sake… and Arya’s if she still lives You know that But if I nurtured some hope of buying peace as well was that so ill

Yes he said The Lannisters killed my father

Do you think I have forgotten that

I don’t know Have you

Catelyn had never struck her children in anger but she almost struck Robb then It was an effort to remind herself how frightened and alone he must feel You are King in the North the choice is yours I only ask that you think on what I’ve said The singers make much of kings who die valiantly in battle but your life is worth more than a song To me at least who gave it to you She lowered her head Do I have your leave to go

Yes He turned away and drew his sword What he meant to do with it she could not say There was no enemy there no one to fight Only her and him amongst tall trees and fallen leaves There are fights no sword can win Catelyn wanted to tell him but she feared the king was deaf to such words

Hours later she was sewing in her bedchamber when young Rollam Westerling came running with the summons to supper Good Catelyn thought relieved She had not been certain that her son would want her there after their quarrel A dutiful squire she said to Rollam gravely Bran would have been the same

If Robb seemed cool at table and Edmure surly Lame Lothar made up for them both He was the model of courtesy reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill and thanking Robb for the swift sure justice he had meted out to Rickard Karstark Lothar’s bastard brother Walder Rivers was another matter a harsh sour man with old Lord Walder’s suspicious face he spoke but seldom and devoted most of his attention to the meat and mead that was set before him

When all the empty words were said the queen and the other Westerlings excused themselves the remains of the meal were cleared away and Lothar Frey cleared his throat Before we turn to the business that brings us here there is another matter he said solemnly A grave matter I fear I had hoped it would not fall to me to bring you these tidings but it seems I must My lord father has had a letter from his grandsons

Catelyn had been so lost in grief for her own that she had almost forgotten the two Freys she had agreed to foster No more she thought Mother have mercy how many more blows can we bear Somehow she knew the next words she heard would plunge yet another blade into her heart The grandsons at Winterfell she made herself ask My wards

Walder and Walder yes But they are presently at the Dreadfort my lady I grieve to tell you this but there has been a battle Winterfell is burned

Burned Robb’s voice was incredulous

Your northern lords tried to retake it from the ironmen When Theon Greyjoy saw that his prize was lost he put the castle to the torch

We have heard naught of any battle said Ser Brynden

My nephews are young I grant you but they were there Big Walder wrote the letter though his cousin signed as well It was a bloody bit of business by their account Your castellan was slain Ser Rodrik was that his name

Ser Rodrik Cassel said Catelyn numbly That dear brave loyal old soul She could almost see him tugging on his fierce white whiskers What of our other people

The ironmen put many of them to the sword I fear

Wordless with rage Robb slammed a fist down on the table and turned his face away so the Freys would not see his tears

But his mother saw them The world grows a little darker every day Catelyn’s thoughts went to Ser Rodrik’s little daughter Beth to tireless Maester Luwin and cheerful Septon Chayle Mikken at the forge Farlen and Palla in the kennels Old Nan and simple Hodor Her heart was sick Please not all

No said Lame Lothar The women and children hid my nephews Walder and Walder among them With Winterfell in ruins the survivors were carried back to the Dreadfort by this son of Lord Bolton’s

Bolton’s son Robb’s voice was strained

Walder Rivers spoke up A bastard son I believe

Not Ramsay Snow Does Lord Roose have another bastard Robb scowled This Ramsay was a monster and a murderer and he died a coward Or so I was told

I cannot speak to that There is much confusion in any war Many false reports All I can tell you is that my nephews claim it was this bastard son of Bolton’s who saved the women of Winterfell and the little ones They are safe at the Dreadfort now all those who remain

Theon Robb said suddenly What happened to Theon Greyjoy Was he slain

Lame Lothar spread his hands That I cannot say Your Grace Walder and Walder made no mention of his fate Perhaps Lord Bolton might know if he has had word from this son of his

Ser Brynden said We will be certain to ask him

You are all distraught I see I am sorry to have brought you such fresh grief Perhaps we should adjourn until the morrow Our business can wait until you have composed yourselves…

No said Robb I want the matter settled

Her brother Edmure nodded Me as well Do you have an answer to our offer my lord

I do Lothar smiled My lord father bids me tell Your Grace that he will agree to this new marriage alliance between our houses and renew his fealty to the King in the North upon the condition that the King’s Grace apologize for the insult done to House Frey in his royal person face to face

An apology was a small enough price to pay but Catelyn misliked this petty condition of Lord Walder’s at once

I am pleased Robb said cautiously It was never my wish to cause this rift between us Lothar The Freys have fought valiantly for my cause I would have them at my side once more

You are too kind Your Grace As you accept these terms I am then instructed to offer Lord Tully the hand of my sister the Lady Roslin a maid of sixteen years Roslin is my lord father’s youngest daughter by Lady Bethany of House Rosby his sixth wife She has a gentle nature and a gift for music

Edmure shifted in his seat Might not it be better if I first met—

You’ll meet when you’re wed said Walder Rivers curtly Unless Lord Tully feels a need to count her teeth first

Edmure kept his temper I will take your word so far as her teeth are concerned but it would be pleasant if I might gaze upon her face before I espoused her

You must accept her now my lord said Walder Rivers Else my father’s offer is withdrawn

Lame Lothar spread his hands My brother has a soldier’s bluntness but what he says is true It is my lord father’s wish that this marriage take place at once

At once Edmure sounded so unhappy that Catelyn had the unworthy thought that perhaps he had been entertaining notions of breaking the betrothal after the fighting was done

Has Lord Walder forgotten that we are fighting a war Brynden Blackfish asked sharply
