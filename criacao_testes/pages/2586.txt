established thee  327 Remember the days of old consider the years
of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy
elders and they will tell thee

328 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance when
he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel

329 For the LORDs portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance

3210 He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling
wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the
apple of his eye

3211 As an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young
spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings
3212 So the LORD alone did lead him and there was no strange god
with him

3213 He made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might
eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of
the rock and oil out of the flinty rock 3214 Butter of kine and
milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan and
goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure
blood of the grape

3215 But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art
grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook God which
made him and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation

3216 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with
abominations provoked they him to anger

3217 They sacrificed unto devils not to God to gods whom they knew
not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not

3218 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast
forgotten God that formed thee

3219 And when the LORD saw it he abhorred them because of the
provoking of his sons and of his daughters

3220 And he said I will hide my face from them I will see what
their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children
in whom is no faith

3221 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God they
have provoked me to anger with their vanities and I will move them to
jealousy with those which are not a people I will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation

3222 For a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the
lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on
fire the foundations of the mountains

3223 I will heap mischiefs upon them I will spend mine arrows upon
them

3224 They shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat
and with bitter destruction I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
them with the poison of serpents of the dust

3225 The sword without and terror within shall destroy both the
young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs

3226 I said I would scatter them into corners I would make the
remembrance of them to cease from among men 3227 Were it not that I
feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangely and lest they should say Our hand is high and
the LORD hath not done all this

3228 For they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any
understanding in them

3229 O that they were wise that they understood this that they
would consider their latter end  3230 How should one chase a
thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their Rock had
sold them and the LORD had shut them up  3231 For their rock is not
as our Rock even our enemies themselves being judges

3232 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of
Gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter
3233 Their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of
asps

3234 Is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my
treasures  3235 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot
shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and
the things that shall come upon them make haste

3236 For the LORD shall judge his people and repent himself for his
servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none
shut up or left

3237 And he shall say Where are their gods their rock in whom they
trusted 3238 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank
the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and
be your protection
