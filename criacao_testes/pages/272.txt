THE OLD DYNASTY

HOUSE TARGARYEN

The Targaryens are the blood of the dragon descended from the high lords of the ancient Freehold of Valyria their heritage proclaimed in a striking some say inhuman beauty with lilac or indigo or violet eyes and hair of silver-gold or platinum white



Aegon the Dragon’s ancestors escaped the Doom of Valyria and the chaos and slaughter that followed to settle on Dragonstone a rocky island in the narrow sea It was from there that Aegon and his sisters sailed to conquer the Seven Kingdoms To preserve the blood royal and keep it pure House Targaryen has often followed the Valyrian custom of wedding brother to sister Aegon himself took both his sisters to wife and fathered sons on each The Targaryen banner is a three-headed dragon red on black the three heads representing Aegon and his sisters The Targaryen words are Fire and Blood
