while to come And is this the manner of man O Lord GOD  720 And
what can David say more unto thee for thou Lord GOD knowest thy
servant

721 For thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou
done all these great things to make thy servant know them

722 Wherefore thou art great O LORD God for there is none like
thee neither is there any God beside thee according to all that we
have heard with our ears

723 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like
Israel whom God went to redeem for a people to himself and to make
him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land
before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt from the
nations and their gods  724 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy
people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou LORD art
become their God

725 And now O LORD God the word that thou hast spoken concerning
thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do
as thou hast said

726 And let thy name be magnified for ever saying The LORD of hosts
is the God over Israel and let the house of thy servant David be
established before thee

727 For thou O LORD of hosts God of Israel hast revealed to thy
servant saying I will build thee an house therefore hath thy
servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee

728 And now O Lord GOD thou art that God and thy words be true
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant 729 Therefore
now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may
continue for ever before thee for thou O Lord GOD hast spoken it
and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for
ever

and subdued them and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the
Philistines

82 And he smote Moab and measured them with a line casting them

David whithersoever he went

87 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem

88 And from Betah and from Berothai cities of Hadadezer king David
took exceeding much brass

89 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
of Hadadezer 810 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David to
salute him and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer
and smitten him for Hadadezer had wars with Toi And Joram brought
with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass
811 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD with the silver
and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued 812
Of Syria and of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the
Philistines and of Amalek and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of
Rehob king of Zobah

813 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
Syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men

814 And he put garrisons in Edom throughout all Edom put he
garrisons and all they of Edom became Davids servants And the LORD
preserved David whithersoever he went

815 And David reigned over all Israel and David executed judgment
and justice unto all his people

816 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud was recorder 817 And Zadok the son of Ahitub and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests and Seraiah was the
scribe 818 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the
Cherethites and the Pelethites and Davids sons were chief rulers

91 And David said Is there yet any that is left of the house of
Saul that I may shew him kindness for Jonathans sake  92 And there
was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba And when they
had called him unto David the king said unto him Art thou Ziba  And
he said Thy servant is he
