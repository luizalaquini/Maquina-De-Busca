Robb’s captains and lords bannermen stood about the hall some mailed and armed others in various states of dishevelment and undress Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph were among them but Robb had seen fit to spare his queen this ugliness The Crag is not far from Casterly Rock Catelyn recalled Leyne may well have played with these boys when all of them were children

She looked down again upon the corpses of the squires Tion Frey and Willem Lannister and waited for her son to speak

It seemed a very long time before Robb lifted his eyes from the bloody dead Smalljon he said tell your father to bring them in Wordless Smalljon Umber turned to obey his steps echoing in the great stone hall

As the Greatjon marched his prisoners through the doors Catelyn made note of how some other men stepped back to give them room as if treason could somehow be passed by a touch a glance a cough The captors and the captives looked much alike big men every one with thick beards and long hair Two of the Greatjon’s men were wounded and three of their prisoners Only the fact that some had spears and others empty scabbards served to set them apart All were clad in mail hauberks or shirts of sewn rings with heavy boots and thick cloaks some of wool and some of fur The north is hard and cold and has no mercy Ned had told her when she first came to Winterfell a thousand years ago

Five said Robb when the prisoners stood before him wet and silent Is that all of them

There were eight rumbled the Greatjon We killed two taking them and a third is dying now

Robb studied the faces of the captives It required eight of you to kill two unarmed squires

Edmure Tully spoke up They murdered two of my men as well to get into the tower Delp and Elwood

It was no murder ser said Lord Rickard Karstark no more discomfited by the ropes about his wrists than by the blood that trickled down his face Any man who steps between a father and his vengeance asks for death

His words rang against Catelyn’s ears harsh and cruel as the pounding of a war drum Her throat was dry as bone I did this These two boys died so my daughters might live

I saw your sons die that night in the Whispering Wood Robb told Lord Karstark Tion Frey did not kill Torrhen Willem Lannister did not slay Eddard How then can you call this vengeance This was folly and bloody murder Your sons died honorably on a battlefield with swords in their hands

They died said Rickard Karstark yielding no inch of ground The Kingslayer cut them down These two were of his ilk Only blood can pay for blood

The blood of children Robb pointed at the corpses How old were they Twelve thirteen Squires

Squires die in every battle

Die fighting yes Tion Frey and Willem Lannister gave up their swords in the Whispering Wood They were captives locked in a cell asleep unarmed… boys Look at them

Lord Karstark looked instead at Catelyn Tell your mother to look at them he said She slew them as much as L

Catelyn put a hand on the back of Robb’s seat The hall seemed to spin about her She felt as though she might retch

My mother had naught to do with this Robb said angrily This was your work Your murder Your treason

How can it be treason to kill Lannisters when it is not treason to free them asked Karstark harshly Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock In war you kill your enemies Didn’t your father teach you that boy

Boy The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to his knees

Leave him Robb’s voice rang with command Umber stepped back away from the captive

Lord Karstark spit out a broken tooth Yes Lord Umber leave me to the king He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me That’s how he deals with treason our King in the North He smiled a wet red smile or should I call you the King Who Lost the North Your Grace

The Greatjon snatched a spear from the man beside him and jerked it to his shoulder Let me spit him sire Let me open his belly so we can see the color of his guts

The doors of the hall crashed open and the Blackfish entered with water running from his cloak and helm Tully men-at-arms followed him in while outside lightning cracked across the sky and a hard black rain pounded against the stones of Riverrun Ser Brynden removed his helm and went to one knee Your Grace was all he said but the grimness of his tone spoke volumes

I will hear Ser Brynden privily in the audience chamber Robb rose to his feet Greatjon keep Lord Karstark here till I return and hang the other seven

The Greatjon lowered the spear Even the dead ones

Yes I will not have such fouling my lord uncle’s rivers Let them feed the crows
