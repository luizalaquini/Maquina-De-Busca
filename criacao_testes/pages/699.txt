344 The diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed
that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken
neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have
ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye
ruled them

345 And they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they
became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered

346 My sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high
hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and
none did search or seek after them

347 Therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the LORD 348 As I
live saith the Lord GOD surely because my flock became a prey and
my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no
shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the
shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock 349 Therefore O ye
shepherds hear the word of the LORD 3410 Thus saith the Lord GOD
Behold I am against the shepherds and I will require my flock at
their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither
shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for I will deliver my
flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them

3411 For thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I even I will both search
my sheep and seek them out

3412 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among
his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will
deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the
cloudy and dark day

3413 And I will bring them out from the people and gather them from
the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them
upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited
places of the country

3414 I will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains
of Israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold
and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel

3415 I will feed my flock and I will cause them to lie down saith
the Lord GOD

3416 I will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was
driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will
strengthen that which was sick but I will destroy the fat and the
strong I will feed them with judgment

3417 And as for you O my flock thus saith the Lord GOD Behold I
judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats

3418 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your
pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the
residue with your feet  3419 And as for my flock they eat that
which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye
have fouled with your feet

3420 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them Behold I even I
will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle

3421 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed
all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad
3422 Therefore will I save my flock and they shall no more be a
prey and I will judge between cattle and cattle

3423 And I will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed
them even my servant David he shall feed them and he shall be their
shepherd

3424 And I the LORD will be their God and my servant David a prince
among them I the LORD have spoken it

3425 And I will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause
the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely
in the wilderness and sleep in the woods

3426 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
blessing and I will cause the shower to come down in his season
there shall be showers of blessing

3427 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth
shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and
shall know that I am the LORD when I have broken the bands of their
yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served
themselves of them

3428 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall
the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and
none shall make them afraid

3429 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall
be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of
the heathen any more

3430 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them and
that they even the house of Israel are my people saith the Lord
GOD
