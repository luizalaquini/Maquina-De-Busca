225 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear
report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee

226 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace saying 227 Let me pass
through thy land I will go along by the high way I will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left

228 Thou shalt sell me meat for money that I may eat and give me
water for money that I may drink only I will pass through on my
feet 229 As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir and the
Moabites which dwell in Ar did unto me until I shall pass over
Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us

230 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him for the
LORD thy God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that
he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day

231 And the LORD said unto me Behold I have begun to give Sihon and
his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his
land

232 Then Sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight
at Jahaz

233 And the LORD our God delivered him before us and we smote him
and his sons and all his people

234 And we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed
the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left
none to remain 235 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto
ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took

236 From Aroer which is by the brink of the river of Arnon and from
the city that is by the river even unto Gilead there was not one
city too strong for us the LORD our God delivered all unto us 237
Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not nor unto
any place of the river Jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains
nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us

31 Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan and Og the king of
Bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at Edrei

32 And the LORD said unto me Fear him not for I will deliver him
and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites which dwelt at
Heshbon

33 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of
Bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to
him remaining

34 And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city
which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of
Argob the kingdom of Og in Bashan

35 All these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars
beside unwalled towns a great many

36 And we utterly destroyed them as we did unto Sihon king of
Heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every
city

37 But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a
prey to ourselves

38 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan from the river of
Arnon unto mount Hermon 39 Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion
and the Amorites call it Shenir 310 All the cities of the plain
and all Gilead and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei cities of the
kingdom of Og in Bashan

311 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants
behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in Rabbath of
the children of Ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four
cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man

312 And this land which we possessed at that time from Aroer which
is by the river Arnon and half mount Gilead and the cities thereof
gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites

313 And the rest of Gilead and all Bashan being the kingdom of Og
gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh all the region of Argob with
all Bashan which was called the land of giants

314 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi and called them after his own name
Bashanhavothjair unto this day

315 And I gave Gilead unto Machir

316 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
even unto the river Arnon half the valley and the border even unto
the river Jabbok which is the border of the children of Ammon 317
The plain also and Jordan and the coast thereof from Chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under Ashdothpisgah
eastward
