Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself inside her Three quick strokes and it was done The stallion who mounts the world Drogo whispered hoarsely His hands still smelled of horse blood He bit at her throat hard in the moment of his pleasure and when he lifted her off his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs Only then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet

Khal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command and horses were brought to the lakeshore Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver Drogo spurred his stallion and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and stars On her silver Dany easily kept pace

The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo’s hall had been rolled up tonight and the moon followed them inside Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stone-lined firepits The air was thick with the smells of roasting meat and curdled fermented mare’s milk The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them at the ceremony As Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle every eye was on her The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts hailing the life within her She could not understand all they shouted but one phrase came clear The stallion that mounts the world she heard bellowed in a thousand voices

The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night Half-clothed women spun and danced on the low tables amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegranates Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare’s milk yet Dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight not here in the sacred city where blades and bloodshed were forbidden

Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo who had been in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived were given seats of high honor to Drogo’s right and left The bloodriders of the three khals sat below them and farther down Khal Jommo’s four wives

Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves As Doreah and Irri arranged her cushions she searched for her brother Even across the length of the crowded hall Viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin silvery hair and beggar’s rags but she did not see him anywhere

Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls where men whose braids were even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables but all the faces she saw had black eyes and copper skin She spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall close to the middle firepit It was a place of respect if not high honor the Dothraki esteemed the knight’s prowess with a sword Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table Mormont came at once and went to one knee before her Khaleesi he said I am yours to command

She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her Sit and talk with me

You honor me The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion A slave knelt before him offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs Ser Jorah took one and bit it in half

Where is my brother Dany asked He ought to have come by now for the feast

I saw His Grace this morning he told her He told me he was going to the Western Market in search of wine

Wine Dany said doubtfully Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare’s milk the Dothraki drank she knew that and he was oft at the bazaars these days drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from east and west He seemed to find their company more congenial than hers

Wine Ser Jorah confirmed and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him and he attacked it with both hands

Is that wise she asked He has no gold to pay soldiers What if he’s betrayed Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor and the Usurper in King’s Landing would pay well for her brother’s head You ought to have gone with him to keep him safe You are his sworn sword

We are in Vaes Dothrak he reminded her No one may carry a blade here or shed a man’s blood

Yet men die she said Jhogo told me Some of the traders have eunuchs with them huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered

Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything Ser Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table He had planned to take your dragon’s eggs until I warned him that I’d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them

For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words My eggs… but they’re mine Magister Illyrio gave them to me a bride gift why would Viserys want… they’re only stones…

The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals Princess… and dragon’s eggs are rarer by far Those traders he’s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need

Dany had not known had not even suspected Then… he should have them He does not need to steal them He had only to ask He is my brother… and my true king

He is your brother Ser Jorah acknowledged

You do not understand ser she said My mother died giving me birth and my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys had not been there to tell me He was the only one left The only one He is all I have

Once said Ser Jorah No longer Khaleesi You belong to the Dothraki now In your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world He held out his cup and a slave filled it with fermented mare’s milk sour-smelling and thick with clots

Dany waved her away Even the smell of it made her feel ill and she would take no chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat What does it mean she asked What is this stallion Everyone was shouting it at me but I don’t understand

The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy child He will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth or so it was promised All the people of the world will be his herd

Oh Dany said in a small voice Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach I named him Rhaego

A name to make the Usurper’s blood run cold
