That was unworthy of me she told herself Gods be good what is to become of me He is doing his best trying so hard I know it I see it and yet… I have lost my Ned the rock my life was built on I could not bear to lose the girls as well…

I’ll do all I can for my sisters Robb said If the queen has any sense she’ll accept my terms If not I’ll make her rue the day she refused me

Plainly he’d had enough of the subject Mother are you certain you will not consent to go to the Twins You would be farther from the fighting and you could acquaint yourself with Lord Frey’s daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done

He wants me gone Catelyn thought wearily Kings are not supposed to have mothers it would seem and I tell him things he does not want to hear You’re old enough to decide which of Lord Walder’s girls you prefer without your mother’s help Robb

Then go with Theon He leaves on the morrow He’ll help the Mallisters escort that lot of captives to Seagard and then take ship for the Iron Islands You could find a ship as well and be back at Winterfell with a moon’s turn if the winds are kind Bran and Rickon need you

And you do not is that what you mean to say My lord father has little enough time remaining him So long as your grandfather lives my place is at Riverrun with him

I could command you to go As king I could

Catelyn ignored that I’ll say again I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke and kept Theon close to you

Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son

Jason Mallister offered Catelyn Tytos Blackwood Stevron Frey Anyone… but not Theon

Her son squatted beside Grey Wind ruffling the wolf’s fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes Theon’s fought bravely for us I told you how he saved Bran from those wildlings in the wolfswood If the Lannisters won’t make peace I’ll have need of Lord Greyjoy’s longships

You’ll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage

He’s been a hostage half his life

For good reason Catelyn said Balon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted He wore a crown himself remember if only for a season He may aspire to wear one again

Robb stood I will not grudge him that If I’m King in the North let him be King of the Iron Islands if that’s his desire I’ll give him a crown gladly so long as he helps us bring down the Lannisters

Robb—

I’m sending Theon Good day Mother Grey Wind come Robb walked off briskly the direwolf padding beside him

Catelyn could only watch him go Her son and now her king How queer that felt Command she had told him back in Moat Cailin And so he did I am going to visit Father she announced abruptly Come with me Edmure

I need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training I’ll visit him later

If he still lives Catelyn thought but she said nothing Her brother would sooner face battle than that sickroom

The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood A wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past Autumn had come the Conclave had declared but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet For that Catelyn was duly grateful Autumn was always a fearful time with the specter of winter looming ahead Even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last

Hoster Tully Lord of Riverrun lay abed in his solar with its commanding view to the east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle He was sleeping when Catelyn entered his hair and beard as white as his featherbed his once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him

Beside the bed still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak sat her father’s brother the Blackfish His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud Does Robb know you are returned Uncle Ser Brynden Tully was Robb’s eyes and ears the commander of his scouts and outriders

No I came here straight from the stables when they told me the king was holding court His Grace will want to hear my tidings in private first I’d think The Blackfish was a tall lean man grey of hair and precise in his movements his clean-shaven face lined and windburnt How is he he asked and she knew he did not mean Robb

Much the same The maester gives him dreamwine and milk of the poppy for his pain so he sleeps most of the time and eats too little He seems weaker with each day that passes

Does he speak

Yes… but there is less and less sense to the things he says He talks of his regrets of unfinished tasks of people long dead and times long past Sometimes he does not know what season it is or who I am Once he called me by Mother’s name
