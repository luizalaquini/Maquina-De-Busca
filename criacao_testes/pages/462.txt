Lord Caron agreed An easy victory to be sure And what glory to win Storm’s End with a single stroke

Stannis raked them all with a look You chatter like magpies and with less sense I will have quiet The king’s eyes fell on Davos Ser Ride with me He spurred his horse away from his followers Only Melisandre kept pace bearing the great standard of the fiery heart with the crowned stag within As if it had been swallowed whole

Davos saw the looks that passed between the lordlings as he rode past them to join the king These were no onion knights but proud men from houses whose names were old in honor Somehow he knew that Renly had never chided them in such a fashion The youngest of the Baratheons had been born with a gift for easy courtesy that his brother sadly lacked

He eased back to a slow trot when his horse came up beside the king’s Your Grace Seen at close hand Stannis looked worse than Davos had realized from afar His face had grown haggard and he had dark circles under his eyes

A smuggler must be a fair judge of men the king said What do you make of this Ser Cortnay Penrose

A stubborn man said Davos carefully

Hungry for death I call it He throws my pardon in my face Aye and throws his life away in the bargain and the lives of every man inside those walls Single combat The king snorted in derision No doubt he mistook me for Robert

More like he was desperate What other hope does he have

None The castle will fall But how to do it quickly Stannis brooded on that for a moment Under the steady clop-clop of hooves Davos could hear the faint sound of the king grinding his teeth Lord Alester urges me to bring old Lord Penrose here Ser Cortnay’s father You know the man I believe

When I came as your envoy Lord Penrose received me more courteously than most Davos said He is an old done man sire Sickly and failing

Florent would have him fail more visibly In his son’s sight with a noose about his neck

It was dangerous to oppose the queen’s men but Davos had vowed always to tell his king the truth I think that would be ill done my liege Ser Cortnay will watch his father die before he would ever betray his trust It would gain us nothing and bring dishonor to our cause

What dishonor Stannis bristled Would you have me spare the lives of traitors

You have spared the lives of those behind us

Do you scold me for that smuggler

It is not my place Davos feared he had said too much

The king was relentless You esteem this Penrose more than you do my lords bannermen Why

He keeps faith

A misplaced faith in a dead usurper

Yes Davos admitted but still he keeps faith

As those behind us do not

Davos had come too far with Stannis to play coy now Last year they were Robert’s men A moon ago they were Renly’s This morning they are yours Whose will they be on the morrow

And Stannis laughed A sudden gust rough and full of scorn I told you Melisandre he said to the red woman my Onion Knight tells me the truth

I see you know him well Your Grace the red woman said

Davos I have missed you sorely the king said Aye I have a tail of traitors your nose does not deceive you My lords bannermen are inconstant even in their treasons I need them but you should know how it sickens me to pardon such as these when I have punished better men for lesser crimes You have every right to reproach me Ser Davos

You reproach yourself more than I ever could Your Grace You must have these great lords to win your throne—

Fingers and all it seems Stannis smiled grimly
