1228 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear 1229 For our God is a consuming fire

131 Let brotherly love continue

132 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares

133 Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them
which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body

134 Marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge

135 Let your conversation be without covetousness and be content
with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee

136 So that we may boldly say The Lord is my helper and I will not
fear what man shall do unto me

137 Remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto
you the word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their
conversation

138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever

139 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines For it is
a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats
which have not profited them that have been occupied therein

1310 We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve
the tabernacle

1311 For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp

1312 Wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his
own blood suffered without the gate

1313 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his
reproach

1314 For here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come

1315 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name

1316 But to do good and to communicate forget not for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased

1317 Obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves
for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that
they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable
for you

1318 Pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all
things willing to live honestly

1319 But I beseech you the rather to do this that I may be restored
to you the sooner

1320 Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord
Jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the
everlasting covenant 1321 Make you perfect in every good work to do
his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight
through Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever Amen

1322 And I beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for
I have written a letter unto you in few words

1323 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty with whom
if he come shortly I will see you

1324 Salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints

They of Italy salute you

1325 Grace be with you all Amen




The General Epistle of James


11 James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ
to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting

12 My brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations 13 Knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh
patience

14 But let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and
entire wanting nothing

15 If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all
men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
