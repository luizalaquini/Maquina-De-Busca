there hoping hed kill you but Peeta doesnt know that He
doesnt understand whats happened to him So you cant
blame him--
I dont I say
You do Youre punishing him over and over for things
that are out of his control Now Im not saying you shouldnt
have a fully loaded weapon next to you round the clock But
I think its time you flipped this little scenario around in your
head If youd been taken by the Capitol and hijacked and
then tried to kill Peeta is this the way he would be treating
you demands Haymitch
I fall silent It isnt It isnt how he would be treating me at
all He would be trying to get me back at any cost Not
shutting me out abandoning me greeting me with hostility
at every turn
You and me we made a deal to try and save him
Remember Haymitch says When I dont respond he
disconnects after a curt Try and remember
The autumn day turns from brisk to cold Most of the
squad hunker down in their sleeping bags Some sleep
under the open sky close to the heater in the center of our
camp while others retreat to their tents Leeg 1 has finally
broken down over her sisters death and her muffled sobs
reach us through the canvas I huddle in my tent thinking
over Haymitchs words Realizing with shame that my
fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore
a much more difficult problem Trying to rescue Peeta from
the shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in I dont
know how to find him let alone lead him out I cant even
conceive of a plan It makes the task of crossing a loaded
arena locating Snow and putting a bullet through his head
look like childs play
At midnight I crawl out of my tent and position myself
on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with
Jackson Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where
the rest of us could keep an eye on him He isnt sleeping
though Instead he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest
clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope I
know it well Its the one Finnick lent me that night in the
bunker Seeing it in his hands its like Finnicks echoing
what Haymitch just said that Ive cast off Peeta Now might
be a good time to begin to remedy that If I could think of
something to say But I cant So I dont I just let the sounds
of soldiers breathing fill the night
After about an hour Peeta speaks up These last
couple of years must have been exhausting for you Trying
to decide whether to kill me or not Back and forth Back
and forth
That seems grossly unfair and my first impulse is to
say something cutting But I revisit my conversation with
Haymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peetas
direction I never wanted to kill you Except when I thought
you were helping the Careers kill me After that I always
thought of you asan ally Thats a good safe word Empty
of any emotional obligation but nonthreatening
Ally Peeta says the word slowly tasting it Friend
Lover Victor Enemy Fiancee Target Mutt Neighbor
Hunter Tribute Ally Ill add it to the list of words I use to try
to figure you out He weaves the rope in and out of his
fingers The problem is I cant tell whats real anymore
and whats made up
The cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests that
either people have woken or have never really been asleep
at all I suspect the latter
Finnicks voice rises from a bundle in the shadows
Then you should ask Peeta Thats what Annie does
Ask who Peeta says Who can I trust
Well us for starters Were your squad says
Jackson
Youre my guards he points out
That too she says But you saved a lot of lives in
Thirteen Its not the kind of thing we forget
In the quiet that follows I try to imagine not being able
to tell illusion from reality Not knowing if Prim or my mother
loved me If Snow was my enemy If the person across the
heater saved or sacrificed me With very little effort my life
rapidly morphs into a nightmare I suddenly want to tell
Peeta everything about who he is and who I am and how
we ended up here But I dont know how to start Worthless
Im worthless
At a few minutes before four Peeta turns to me again
Your favorite colorits green
Thats right Then I think of something to add And
yours is orange
Orange He seems unconvinced
Not bright orange But soft Like the sunset I say At
least thats what you told me once
Oh He closes his eyes briefly maybe trying to
conjure up that sunset then nods his head Thank you
But more words tumble out Youre a painter Youre a
baker You like to sleep with the windows open You never
take sugar in your tea And you always double-knot your
shoelaces
Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid
like cry
In the morning Gale Finnick and I go out to shoot
some glass off the buildings for the camera crew When we
get back to camp Peetas sitting in a circle with the
soldiers from 13 who are armed but talking openly with
him Jackson has devised a game called Real or Not
