lie still that the poor of thy people may eat and what they leave
the beasts of the field shall eat In like manner thou shalt deal with
thy vineyard and with thy oliveyard

2312 Six days thou shalt do thy work and on the seventh day thou
shalt rest that thine ox and thine ass may rest and the son of thy
handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed
