at once It was great neglect in that man to keep me
waiting here till so late I should have gone two hours
ago if it had not been for him I had no idea of
coming in here but theres nothing so refreshing as a
cup of tea though I should never have got one if you
hadnt helped me
Troy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles
and watched each varying shade thereon and the
white shell-like sinuosities
P 408
of her little ear She took
out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on paying
for her tea for herself when at this moment Pennyways
entered the tent Troy trembled  here was his scheme
for respectability endangered at once He was about
to leave his hole of espial attempt to follow Pennyways
and find out if the ex-bailiff had recognized him when
he was arrested by the conversation and found he was
too late
Excuse me maam said Pennyways  Ive some
private information for your ear alone
I cannot hear it now she said coldly That
Bathsheba could not endure this man was evident in
fact he was continually coming to her with some tale
or other by which he might creep into favour at the
expense of persons maligned
Ill write it down said Pennyways confidently He
stooped over the table pulled a leaf from a warped
pocket-book and wrote upon the paper in a round
hand --
 1Your husband is here Ive seen him Whos the fool
now
This he folded small and handed towards her
Bathsheba would not read it  she would not even put
out her hand to take it Pennyways then with a laugh
of derision tossed it into her lap and turning away
left her
From the words and action of Pennyways Troy
though he had not been able to see what the ex-bailiff
wrote had not a moments doubt that the note referred
to him Nothing that he could think of could be done
to check the exposure  Curse my luck he whispered
and added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like
a pestilent wind Meanwhile Boldwood said taking up
the note from her lap --
Dont you wish to read it Mrs Troy If not
Ill destroy it
 Oh well said Bathsheba carelessly perhaps it is
unjust not to read it but I can guess what it is about
He wants me to recommend him or it is to tell me of
some little scandal or another connected with my work+
people Hes always doing that
Bathsheba held the note in her right hand Bold+
wood handed towards her a plate of cut bread-and+
butter when in order to take a slice she put the note
into her left hand where she was still holding the purse
and then allowed her hand to drop
P 409
beside her close to
the canvas The moment had come for saving his game
and Troy impulsively felt that he would play the card
For yet another time he looked at the fair hand and
saw the pink finger-tips and the blue veins of the
wrrist encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which
she wore how familiar it all was to him Then with
the lightning action in which he was such an adept he
noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the
tent-cloth which was far from being pinned tightly down
lifted it a little way keeping his eye to the hole
snatched the note from her fingers dropped the canvas
and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch
smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from
her Troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart
hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to
a distance of a hundred yards ascended again and
crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance
of the tent His object was now to get to Pennyways
and prevent a repetition of the announcement until
such time as he should choose
Troy reached the tent door and standing among the
groups there gathered looked anxiously for Pennyways
evidently not wishing to make himself prominent by
inquiring for him One or two men were speaking of
a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a
young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her
It was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of
paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note
for he had seized it and made off with it leaving her
purse behind His chagrin and disappointment at dis+
covering its worthlessness would be a good joke it was
said However the occurrence seemed to have become
known to few for it had not interrupted a fiddler who
had lately begun playing by the door of the tent nor
the four bowed old men with grim countenances and
walking-sticks in hand who were dancing Major
Malleys Reel to the tune Behind these stood
Pennyways Troy glided up to him beckoned and
whispered a few words  and with a mutual glance of
concurrence the two men went into the night together
