1416 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they
shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor
their daughters for I will pour their wickedness upon them

1417 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them Let mine eyes run
down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin
daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very
grievous blow

1418 If I go forth into the field then behold the slain with the
sword  and if I enter into the city then behold them that are sick
with famine  yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a
land that they know not

1419 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah hath thy soul lothed Zion why
hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for
peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold
trouble  1420 We acknowledge O LORD our wickedness and the
iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee

1421 Do not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne
of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us

1422 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he O LORD our
God  therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these
things

151 Then said the LORD unto me Though Moses and Samuel stood before
me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my
sight and let them go forth

152 And it shall come to pass if they say unto thee Whither shall
we go forth then thou shalt tell them Thus saith the LORD Such as
are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword
and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the
captivity to the captivity

153 And I will appoint over them four kinds saith the LORD the
sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and
the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy

154 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
earth because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah for that
which he did in Jerusalem

155 For who shall have pity upon thee O Jerusalem or who shall
bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest  156 Thou
hast forsaken me saith the LORD thou art gone backward therefore
will I stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee I am weary
with repenting

157 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land I will
bereave them of children I will destroy my people since they return
not from their ways

158 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas I
have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler
at noonday I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors
upon the city

159 She that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the
ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been
ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will I deliver to the
sword before their enemies saith the LORD

1510 Woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife
and a man of contention to the whole earth I have neither lent on
usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth
curse me

1511 The LORD said Verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily
I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in
the time of affliction

1512 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel  1513 Thy
substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price
and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders

1514 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which
shall burn upon you

1515 O LORD thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me
of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that
for thy sake I have suffered rebuke

1516 Thy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was unto
me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for I am called by thy name O
LORD God of hosts

1517 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced I sat
alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation

1518 Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth
to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters
that fail  1519 Therefore thus saith the LORD If thou return then
will I bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou
take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let
