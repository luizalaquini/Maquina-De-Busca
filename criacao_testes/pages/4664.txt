Six singers would be as unfortunate as eight to be sure I will inquire after the health of Cersei’s seven If any of them should be indisposed my man Bronn will find you

Very good my lord Symon might have left it at that but flushed with triumph he added I shall sing the night of King Joffrey’s wedding Should it happen that I am called to court why I will want to offer the king my very best compositions songs I have sung a thousand times that are certain to please If I should find myself singing in some dreary winesink though    well that would be an apt occasion to try my new song For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm

That will not be necessary said Tyrion You have my word as a Lannister Bronn will call upon you soon

Very good my lord The balding kettle-bellied singer took up his woodharp again

Bronn was waiting with the horses at the mouth of the alley He helped Tyrion into his saddle When do I take the man to Duskendale

You don’t Tyrion turned his horse Give him three days then inform him that Hamish the Harper has broken his arm Tell him that his clothes will never serve for court so he must be fitted for new garb at once He’ll come with you quick enough He grimaced You may want his tongue I understand it’s made of silver The rest of him should never be found

Bronn grinned There’s a pot shop I know in Flea Bottom makes a savory bowl of brown All kinds of meat in it I hear

Make certain I never eat there Tyrion spurred to a trot He wanted a bath and the hotter the better

Even that modest pleasure was denied him however no sooner had he returned to his chambers than Podrick Payne informed him that he had been summoned to the Tower of the Hand His lordship wants to see you The Hand Lord Tywin

I recall who the Hand is Pod Tyrion said I lost my nose not my wits

Bronn laughed Don’t bite the boy’s head off now

Why not He never uses it Tyrion wondered what he’d done now Or more like what I have failed to do A summons from Lord Tywin always had teeth his father never sent for him just to share a meal or a cup of wine that was for certain

As he entered his lord father’s solar a few moments later he heard a voice saying    cherrywood for the scabbards bound in red leather and ornamented with a row of lion’s-head studs in pure gold Perhaps with garnets for the eyes   

Rubies Lord Tywin said Garnets lack the fire

Tyrion cleared his throat My lord You sent for me

His father glanced up I did Come have a look at this A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand A wedding gift for Joffrey he told Tyrion The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold With this fool’s jabber of Stannis and his magic sword it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well A king should bear a kingly weapon

That’s much too much sword for Joff Tyrion said

He will grow into it Here feel the weight of it He offered the weapon hilt first

The sword was much lighter than he had expected As he turned it in his hand he saw why Only one metal could be beaten so thin and still have strength enough to fight with and there was no mistaking those ripples the mark of steel that has been folded back on itself many thousands of times Valyrian steel

Yes Lord Tywin said in a tone of deep satisfaction

At long last Father Valyrian steel blades were scarce and costly yet thousands remained in the world perhaps two hundred in the Seven Kingdoms alone It had always irked his father that none belonged to House Lannister The old Kings of the Rock had owned such a weapon but the greatsword Brightroar had been lost when the second King Tommen carried it back to Valyria on his fool’s quest He had never returned nor had Uncle Gery the youngest and most reckless of his father’s brothers who had gone seeking after the lost sword some eight years past

Thrice at least Lord Tywin had offered to buy Valyrian longswords from impoverished lesser houses but his advances had always been firmly rebuffed The little lordlings would gladly part with their daughters should a Lannister come asking but they cherished their old family swords

Tyrion wondered where the metal for this one had come from A few master armorers could rework old Valyrian steel but the secrets of its making had been lost when the Doom came to old Valyria The colors are strange he commented as he turned the blade in the sunlight Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark it looked almost black as was true here as well But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching each ripple distinct like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore How did you get this patterning I’ve never seen anything like it

Nor I my lord said the armorer I confess these colors were not what I intended and I do not know that I could duplicate them Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House and it was that color I set out to infuse into the metal But Valyrian steel is stubborn These old swords remember it is said and they do not change easily I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again but always the color would darken as if the blade was drinking the sun from it And some folds would not take the red at all as you can see If my lords of Lannister are displeased I will of course try again as many times as you should require but—

No need Lord Tywin said This will serve

A crimson sword might flash prettily in the sun but if truth be told I like these colors better said Tyrion They have an ominous beauty    and they make this blade unique There is no other sword like it in all the world I should think

There is one The armorer bent over the table and unfolded the bundle of oilcloth to reveal a second longsword

Tyrion put down Joffrey’s sword and took up the other If not twins the two were at least close cousins This one was thicker and heavier a half-inch wider and three inches longer but they shared the same fine clean lines and the same distinctive color the ripples of blood and night Three fullers deeply incised ran down the second blade from hilt to point the king’s sword had only two Joff’s hilt was a good deal more ornate the arms of its crossguard done as lions’ paws with ruby claws unsheathed but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions’ heads for pommels

Magnificent Even in hands as unskilled as Tyrion’s the blade felt alive I have never felt better balance

It is meant for my son

No need to ask which son Tyrion placed Jaime’s sword back on the table beside Joffrey’s wondering if Robb Stark would let his brother live long enough to wield it Our father must surely think so else why have this blade forged

You have done good work Master Mott Lord Tywin told the armorer My steward will see to your payment And remember rubies for the scabbards

I shall my lord You are most generous The man folded the swords up in the oilcloth tucked the bundle under one arm and went to his knee It is an honor to serve the King’s Hand I shall deliver the swords the day before the wedding

See that you do

When the guards had seen the armorer out Tyrion clambered up onto a chair So    a sword for Joff a sword for Jaime and not even a dagger for the dwarf Is that the way of it Father

The steel was sufficient for two blades not three If you have need of a dagger take one from the armory Robert left a hundred when he died Gerion gave him a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a sapphire pommel for a wedding gift and half the envoys who came to court tried to curry favor by presenting His Grace with jewel-encrusted knives and silver inlay swords

Tyrion smiled They’d have pleased him more if they’d presented him with their daughters

No doubt The only blade he ever used was the hunting knife he had from Jon Arryn when he was a boy Lord Tywin waved a hand dismissing King Robert and all his knives What did you find at the riverfront

Mud said Tyrion and a few dead things no one’s bothered to bury Before we can open the port again the Blackwater’s going to have to be dredged the sunken ships broken up or raised Three-quarters of the quays need repair and some may have to be torn down and rebuilt The entire fish market is gone and both the River Gate and the King’s Gate are splintered from the battering Stannis gave them and should be replaced I shudder to think of the cost If you do shit gold Father find a privy and get busy he wanted to say but he knew better

You will find whatever gold is required

Will I Where The treasury is empty I’ve told you that We’re not done paying the alchemists for all that wildfire or the smiths for my chain and Cersei’s pledged the crown to pay half the costs of Joff’s wedding—seventy-seven bloody courses a thousand guests a pie full of doves singers jugglers   

Extravagance has its uses We must demonstrate the power and wealth of Casterly Rock for all the realm to see

Then perhaps Casterly Rock should pay

Why I have seen Littlefinger’s accounts Crown incomes are ten times higher than they were under Aerys

As are the crown’s expenses Robert was as generous with his coin as he was with his cock Littlefinger borrowed heavily From you amongst others Yes the incomes are considerable but they are barely sufficient to cover the usury on Littlefinger’s loans Will you forgive the throne’s debt to House Lannister

Don’t be absurd

Then perhaps seven courses would suffice Three hundred guests instead of a thousand I understand that a marriage can be just as binding without a dancing bear

The Tyrells would think us niggardly I will have the wedding and the waterfront If you cannot pay for them say so and I shall find a master of coin who can

The disgrace of being dismissed after so short a time was not something Tyrion cared to suffer I will find your money

You will his father promised and while you are about it see if you can find your wife’s bed as well
