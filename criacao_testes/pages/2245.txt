May said Dany That was such a slippery word may In any language She turned back to Kraznys mo Nakloz and his slave girl I must consider carefully

The slaver shrugged Tell her to consider quickly There are many other buyers Only three days past I showed these same Unsullied to a corsair king who hopes to buy them all

The corsair wanted only a hundred your worship Dany heard the slave girl say

He poked her with the end of the whip Consairs are all liars He’ll buy them all Tell her that girl

Dany knew she would take more than a hundred if she took any at all Remind your Good Master of who I am Remind him that I am Daenerys Stormborn Mother of Dragons the Unburnt trueborn queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros My blood is the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and of old Valyria before him

Yet her words did not move the plump perfumed slaver even when rendered in his own ugly tongue Old Ghis ruled an empire when the Valyrians were still fucking sheep he growled at the poor little scribe and we are the sons of the harpy He gave a shrug My tongue is wasted wagging at women East or west it makes no matter they cannot decide until they have been pampered and flattered and stuffed with sweetmeats Well if this is my fate so be it Tell the whore that if she requires a guide to our sweet city Kraznys mo Nakloz will gladly serve her    and service her as well if she is more woman than she looks

Good Master Kraznys would be most pleased to show you Astapor while you ponder Your Grace the translator said

I will feed her jellied dog brains and a fine rich stew of red octopus and unborn puppy He wiped his lips

Many delicious dishes can be had here he says

Tell her how pretty the pyramids are at night the slaver growled Tell her I will lick honey off her breasts or allow her to lick honey off mine if she prefers

Astapor is most beautiful at dusk Your Grace said the slave girl The Good Masters light silk lanterns on every terrace so all the pyramids glow with colored lights Pleasure barges ply the Worm playing soft music and calling at the little islands for food and wine and other delights

Ask her if she wishes to view our fighting pits Kraznys added Douquor’s Pit has a fine folly scheduled for the evening A bear and three small boys One boy will be rolled in honey one in blood and one in rotting fish and she may wager on which the bear will eat first

Tap tap tap Dany heard Arstan Whitebeard’s face was still but his staff beat out his rage Tap tap tap She made herself smile I have my own bear on Balerion she told the translator and he may well eat me if I do not return to him

See said Kraznys when her words were translated It is not the woman who decides it is this man she runs to As ever

Thank the Good Master for his patient kindness Dany said and tell him that I will think on all I learned here She gave her arm to Arstan Whitebeard to lead her back across the plaza to her litter Aggo and Jhogo fell in to either side of them walking with the bowlegged swagger all the horselords affected when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals

Dany climbed into her litter frowning and beckoned Arstan to climb in beside her A man as old as him should not be walking in such heat She did not close the curtains as they got under way With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red brick every stray breeze was to be cherished even if it did come with a swirl of fine red dust Besides I need to see

Astapor was a queer city even to the eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb of the World beneath the Mother of Mountains All the streets were made of the same red brick that had paved the plaza So too were the stepped pyramids the deep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats the sulfurous fountains and gloomy wine caves and the ancient walls that encircled them So many bricks she thought and so old and crumbling Their fine red dust was everywhere dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces the brick dust stung the eyes worse than sand

Make way Jhogo shouted as he rode before her litter Make way for the Mother of Dragons But when he uncoiled the great silver-handled whip that Dany had given him and made to crack it in the air she leaned out and told him nay Not in this place blood of my blood she said in his own tongue These bricks have heard too much of the sound of whips

The streets had been largely deserted when they had set out from the port that morning and scarcely seemed more crowded now An elephant lumbered past with a latticework litter on its back A naked boy with peeling skin sat in a dry brick gutter picking his nose and staring sullenly at some ants in the street He lifted his head at the sound of hooves and gaped as a column of mounted guards trotted by in a cloud of red dust and brittle laughter The copper disks sewn to their cloaks of yellow silk glittered like so many suns but their tunics were embroidered linen and below the waist they wore sandals and pleated linen skirts Bareheaded each man had teased and oiled and twisted his stiff red-black hair into some fantastic shape horns and wings and blades and even grasping hands so they looked like some troupe of demons escaped from the seventh hell The naked boy watched them for a bit along with Dany but soon enough they were gone and he went back to his ants and a knuckle up his nose

An old city this she reflected but not so populous as it was in its glory nor near so crowded as Qarth or Pentos or Lys

Her litter came to a sudden halt at the cross street to allow a coffle of slaves to shuffle across her path urged along by the crack of an overseer’s lash These were no Unsullied Dany noted but a more common sort of men with pale brown skins and black hair There were women among them but no children All were naked Two Astapori rode behind them on white asses a man in a red silk tokar and a veiled woman in sheer blue linen decorated with flakes of lapis lazuli In her red-black hair she wore an ivory comb The man laughed as he whispered to her paying no more mind to Dany than to his slaves nor the overseer with his twisted five-thonged lash a squat broad Dothraki who had the harpy and chains tattooed proudly across his muscular chest

Bricks and blood built Astapor Whitebeard murmured at her side and bricks and blood her people

What is that Dany asked him curious

An old rhyme a maester taught me when I was a boy I never knew how true it was The bricks of Astapor are red with the blood of the slaves who make them

I can well believe that said Dany

Then leave this place before your heart turns to brick as well Sail this very night on the evening tide

Would that I could thought Dany When I leave Astapor it must be with an army Ser Jorah says

Ser Jorah was a slaver himself Your Grace the old man reminded her There are sellswords in Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh you can hire A man who kills for coin has no honor but at least they are no slaves Find your army there I beg you

My brother visited Pentos Myr Braavos near all the Free Cities The magisters and archons fed him wine and promises but his soul was starved to death A man cannot sup from the beggar’s bowl all his life and stay a man I had my taste in Qarth that was enough I will not come to Pentos bowl in hand

Better to come a beggar than a slaver Arstan said

There speaks one who has been neither Dany’s nostrils flared Do you know what it is like to be sold squire I do My brother sold me to Khal Drogo for the promise of a golden crown Well Drogo crowned him in gold though not as he had wished and I    my sun-and-stars made a queen of me but if he had been a different man it might have been much otherwise Do you think I have forgotten how it felt to be afraid

Whitebeard bowed his head Your Grace I did not mean to give offense

Only lies offend me never honest counsel Dany patted Arstan’s spotted hand to reassure him I have a dragon’s temper that’s all You must not let it frighten you

I shall try and remember Whitebeard smiled

He has a good face and great strength to him Dany thought She could not understand why Ser Jorah mistrusted the old man so Could he be jealous that I have found another man to talk to Unbidden her thoughts went back to the night on Balerion when the exile knight had kissed her He should never have done that He is thrice my age and of too low a birth for me and I never gave him leave No true knight would ever kiss a queen without her leave She had taken care never to be alone with Ser Jorah after that keeping her handmaids with her aboard ship and sometimes her bloodriders He wants to kiss me again I see it in his eyes

What Dany wanted she could not begin to say but Jorah’s kiss had woken something in her something that had been sleeping since Khal Drogo died Lying abed in her narrow bunk she found herself wondering how it would be to have a man squeezed in beside her in place of her handmaid and the thought was more exciting than it should have been Sometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of her lover was always younger and more comely though his face remained a shifting shadow

Once so tormented she could not sleep Dany slid a hand down between her legs and gasped when she felt how wet she was Scarce daring to breathe she moved her fingers back and forth between her lower lips slowly so as not to wake Irri beside her until she found one sweet spot and lingered there touching herself lightly timidly at first and then faster Still the relief she wanted seemed to recede before her until her dragons stirred and one screamed out across the cabin and Irri woke and saw what she was doing

Dany knew her face was flushed but in the darkness Irri surely could not tell Wordless the handmaid put a hand on her breast then bent to take a nipple in her mouth Her other hand drifted down across the soft curve of belly through the mound of fine silvery-gold hair and went to work between Dany’s thighs It was no more than a few moments until her legs twisted and her breasts heaved and her whole body shuddered She screamed then Or perhaps that was Drogon Irri never said a thing only curled back up and went back to sleep the instant the thing was done

The next day it all seemed a dream And what did Ser Jorah have to do with it if anything It is Drogo I want my sun-and-stars Dany reminded herself Not Irri and not Ser Jorah only Drogo Drogo was dead though She’d thought these feelings had died with him there in the red waste but one treacherous kiss had somehow brought them back to life He should never have kissed me He presumed too much and I permitted it It must never happen again She set her mouth grimly and gave her head a shake and the bell in her braid chimed softly

Closer to the bay the city presented a fairer face The great brick pyramids lined the shore the largest four hundred feet high All manner of trees and vines and flowers grew on their broad terraces and the winds that swirled around them smelled green and fragrant Another gigantic harpy stood atop the gate this one made of baked red clay and crumbling visibly with no more than a stub of her scorpion’s tail remaining The chain she grasped in her clay claws was old iron rotten with rust It was cooler down by the water though The lapping of the waves against the rotting pilings made a curiously soothing sound

Aggo helped Dany down from her litter Strong Belwas was seated on a massive piling eating a great haunch of brown roasted meat Dog he said happily when he saw Dany Good dog in Astapor little queen Eat He offered it with a greasy grin

That is kind of you Belwas but no Dany had eaten dog in other places at other times but just now all she could think of was the Unsullied and their stupid puppies She swept past the huge eunuch and up the plank onto the deck of Balerion

Ser Jorah Mormont stood waiting for her Your Grace he said bowing his head The slavers have come and gone Three of them with a dozen scribes and as many slaves to lift and fetch They crawled over every foot of our holds and made note of all we had He walked her aft How many men do they have for sale

None Was it Mormont she was angry with or this city with its sullen heat its stinks and sweats and crumbling bricks They sell eunuchs not men Eunuchs made of brick like the rest of Astapor Shall I buy eight thousand brick eunuchs with dead eyes that never move who kill suckling babes for the sake of a spiked hat and strangle their own dogs They don’t even have names So don’t call them men ser

Khaleesi he said taken aback by her fury the Unsullied are chosen as boys and trained—

I have heard all I care to of their training Dany could feel tears welling in her eyes sudden and unwanted Her hand flashed up and cracked Ser Jorah hard across the face It was either that or cry

Mormont touched the cheek she’d slapped If I have displeased my queen—

You have You’ve displeased me greatly ser If you were my true knight you would never have brought me to this vile sty If you were my true knight you would never have kissed me or looked at my breasts the way you did or   

As Your Grace commands I shall tell Captain Groleo to make ready to sail on the evening tide for some sty less vile

No said Dany Groleo watched them from the forecastle and his crew was watching too Whitebeard her bloodriders Jhiqui every one had stopped what they were doing at the sound of the slap I want to sail now not on the tide I want to sail far and fast and never look back But I can’t can I There are eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale and I must find some way to buy them And with that she left him and went below
