Alone and humiliated Sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew Septa Mordane would be waiting Lady padded quietly by her side She was almost in tears All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs Why couldn’t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind like Princess Myrcella She would have liked a sister like that

Sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard like their half brother Jon She even looked like Jon with the long face and brown hair of the Starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring And Jon’s mother had been common or so people whispered Once when she was littler Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn’t been some mistake Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister But Mother had only laughed and said no Arya was her daughter and Sansa’s trueborn sister blood of their blood Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true

As she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten A crowd had gathered around the queen’s wheelhouse Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees The doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone She heard her saying The council does us great honor my good lords

What’s happening she asked a squire she knew

The council sent riders from King’s Landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her An honor guard for the king

Anxious to see Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd People moved aside hastily for the direwolf When she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink

One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun When he removed his helm Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard

His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold

At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger He did not kneel with the others He stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence His face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks Though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a woman’s His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a two-handed greatsword too long to be worn at his side

The king is gone hunting but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze Slowly he turned his head Lady growled A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly She stepped backward and bumped into someone

Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile You are shaking girl he said his voice rasping Do I frighten you so much

He did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other Still Sansa wrenched away from him and the Hound laughed and Lady moved between them rumbling a warning Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf They were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter

A wolf a man said and someone else said Seven hells that’s a direwolf and the first man said What’s it doing in camp and the Hound’s rasping voice replied The Starks use them for wet nurses and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed Tears filled her eyes

She heard the queen say Joffrey go to her

And her prince was there

Leave her alone Joffrey said He stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown He gave her his hand drew her to her feet What is it sweet lady Why are you afraid No one will hurt you Put away your swords all of you The wolf is her little pet that’s all He looked at Sandor Clegane And you dog away with you you’re scaring my betrothed

The Hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press Sansa struggled to steady herself She felt like such a fool She was a Stark of Winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen It was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain It was the other one

The two stranger knights exchanged a look Payne chuckled the young man in the green armor

The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady He has a fearsome aspect

As well he should The queen had descended from the wheelhouse The spectators parted to make way for her If the wicked do not fear the Mng’s Justice you have put the wrong man in the office

Sansa finally found her words Then surely you have chosen the right one Your Grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her

Well spoken child said the old man in white As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark I am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting I am Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard He bowed

Sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came back to her The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard she said and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him The honor is mine good knight Even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold

The green knight laughed again Barristan the Old you mean Don’t flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already He smiled at her Now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then I must concede that you are truly our Hand’s daughter

Joffrey stiffened beside her Have a care how you address my betrothed

I can answer Sansa said quickly to quell her prince’s anger She smiled at the green knight Your helmet bears golden antlers my lord The stag is the sigil of the royal House King Robert has two brothers By your extreme youth you can only be Renly Baratheon Lord of Storm’s End and councillor to the king and so I name you

Ser Barristan chuckled By his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so I name him
