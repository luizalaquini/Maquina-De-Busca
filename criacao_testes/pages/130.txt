Yes

You want him alive you do what I say Off the horse

Robb hesitated a moment Then slowly and deliberately he dismounted and stood with his sword in hand

Now kill the wolves

Robb did not move

You do it The wolves or the boy

No Bran screamed If Robb did as they asked Stiv would kill them both anyway once the direwolves were dead

The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly till Bran sobbed in pain You shut your mouth cripple you hear me He twisted harder You hear me

A low thrum came from the woods behind them Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest The arrow was bright red as if it had been painted in blood

The dagger fell away from Bran’s throat The big man swayed and collapsed facedown in the stream The arrow broke beneath him Bran watched his life go swirling off in the water

Osha glanced around as Father’s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees steel in hand She threw down her spear Mercy m’lord she called to Robb

The guardsmen had a strange pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of slaughter They eyed the wolves uncertainly and when Summer returned to Hali’s corpse to feed Joseth dropped his knife and scrambled for the bush heaving Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree but only for an instant Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran’s side Are you hurt

He cut my leg Bran said but I couldn’t feel it

As the maester knelt to examine the wound Bran turned his head Theon Greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree his bow in hand He was smiling Ever smiling A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet but it had taken only one A dead enemy is a thing of beauty he announced

Jon always said you were an ass Greyjoy Robb said loudly I ought to chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you

You should be thanking me for saving your brother’s life

What if you had missed the shot Robb said What if you’d only wounded him What if you had made his hand jump or hit Bran instead For all you knew the man might have been wearing a breastplate all you could see was the back of his cloak What would have happened to my brother then Did you ever think of that Greyjoy

Theon’s smile was gone He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground one by one

Robb glared at his guardsmen Where were you he demanded of them I was sure you were close behind us

The men traded unhappy glances We were following m’lord said Quent the youngest of them his beard a soft brown fuzz Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass begging your pardons and then well as it were… He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away abashed

I spied a turkey Theon said annoyed by the question How was I to know that you’d leave the boy alone

Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more Bran had never seen him so angry yet he said nothing Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin How badly is my brother wounded

No more than a scratch the maester said He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut Two of them wear the black he told Robb as he worked

Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it Deserters from the Night’s Watch he said grimly They must have been fools to come so close to Winterfell

Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart said Maester Luwin

Shall we bury them m’lord asked Quent

They would not have buried us Robb said Hack off their heads we’ll send them back to the Wall Leave the rest for the carrion crows
