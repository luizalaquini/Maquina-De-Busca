Troy went across to her
come madam do you hear what I say he said
peremptorily
A strange voice came from the fireplace -- a voice
sounding far off and confined as if from a dungeon
Hardly a soul in the assembly recognized the thin tones
to be those of Boldwood Sudden dispaire had trans+
formed him
Bathsheba go with your husband
Nevertheless she did not move The truth was
that Bathsheba was beyond the pale of activity -- and
yet not in a swoon She was in a state of mental 1gutta1
1serena1 her mind was for the minute totally deprived of
light at the same time no obscuration was apparent
from without
Troy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him
when she quickly shrank back This visible dread of
him seemed to irritate Troy and he seized her arm and
pulled it sharply
P 439
Whether his grasp pinched her or
whether his mere touch was the ccause was never known
but at the moment of his seizure she writhed and gave
a quick low scream
The scream had been heard but a few seconds When
it was followed by sudden deafening report that
echoed through the room and stupefied them all The
oak partition shook with the concussion and the place
was filled with grey smoke
In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood
at his back as stood before the fireplace was a gun+
rack as is usual in farmhouses constructed to hold two
guns When Bathsheba had cried out in her husbands
grasp Boldwoods face of gnashing despair had changed
The veins had swollen and a frenzied look had gleamed
in his eye He had turned quickly taken one of the
guns cocked it and at once discharged it at Troy
Troy fell The distance apart of the two men was
so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the
least but passed like a bullet into his body He uttered
a long guttural sigh -- there was a contraction -- an exten+
sion -- then his muscles relaxed and he lay still
Boldwood was seen through the smoke to be now
again engaged with the gun It was double-barrelled
and he had meanwhile in some way fastened his hand+
kerchief to the trigger and with his foot on the other
end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon
himself Samway his man was the first to see this and
in the midst of the general horror darted up to him
Boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief and
the gun exploded a second time sending its contents
by a timely blow from Samway into the beam which
crossed the ceiling
Well it makes no difference Boldwood gasped
There is another way for me to die
Then he broke from Samway crossed the room to
Bathsheba and kissed her hand He put on his hat
opened the door and went into the darkness nobody
thinking of preventing him

AFTER THE SHOCK
BOLDWOOD passed into the high road and turned
in the direction of Casterbridge Here he walked at
an even steady pace over Yalbury Hill along the dead
level beyond mounted Mellstock Hill and between
eleven and twelve oclock crossed the Moor into the town
The streets were nearly deserted now and the waving
lamp-flames only lighted up rows of grey shop-shutters
and strips of white paving upon which his step echoed
as his passed along He turned to the right and halted
before an archway of heavy stonework which was closed
by an iron studded pair of doors This was the entrance
to the gaol and over it a lamp was fixed the light en+
abling the wretched traveller to find a belipull
The small wicket at last opened and a porter
appeared Boldwood stepped forward and said some+
thing in a low tone when after a delay another man
came Boldwood entered and the door was closed
behind him and he walked the world no more
Long before this time Weatherbury had been
thoroughly aroused and the wild deed which had ter+
minated Boldwoods merrymaking became known to
all Of those out of the house Oak was one of the
first to hear of the catastophe and when he entered
the room which was about five minutes after Boldwoods
exit the scene was terrible All the female guests were
huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm
and the men were bewildered as to what to do As for
Bathsheba she had changed She was sitting on the
floor beside the body of Troy his head pillowed in her
lap where she had herself lifted it With one hand she
held her handkerchief to his breast and covered the
wound though scarcely a single drop of blood had
flowed and with the other she tightly clasped one of
his The household convulsion had made her herself
again The
