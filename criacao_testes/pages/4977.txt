them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with
stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the
city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so
thou shalt put away evil from among you

2225 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man
force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall
die

2226 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the
damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his
neighbour and slayeth him even so is this matter 2227 For he found
her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none
to save her

2228 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed
and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found 2229 Then
the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father fifty
shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled
her he may not put her away all his days

2230 A man shall not take his fathers wife nor discover his
fathers skirt

231 He that is wounded in the stones or hath his privy member cut
off shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD

232 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD even
to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of
the LORD

233 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of
the LORD even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
congregation of the LORD for ever 234 Because they met you not with
bread and with water in the way when ye came forth out of Egypt and
because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of
Mesopotamia to curse thee

235 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam but
the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because
the LORD thy God loved thee

236 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days
for ever

237 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite for he is thy brother thou
shalt not abhor an Egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land

238 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
congregation of the LORD in their third generation

239 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies then keep thee
from every wicked thing

2310 If there be among you any man that is not clean by reason of
uncleanness that chanceth him by night then shall he go abroad out of
the camp he shall not come within the camp 2311 But it shall be
when evening cometh on he shall wash himself with water and when the
sun is down he shall come into the camp again

2312 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp whither thou
shalt go forth abroad 2313 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy
weapon and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad thou
shalt dig therewith and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh
from thee 2314 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy
camp to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee
therefore shall thy camp be holy that he see no unclean thing in
thee and turn away from thee

2315 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
escaped from his master unto thee 2316 He shall dwell with thee
even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy
gates where it liketh him best thou shalt not oppress him

2317 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel nor a
sodomite of the sons of Israel

2318 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog
into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow for even both these
are abomination unto the LORD thy God

2319 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother usury of money
usury of victuals usury of any thing that is lent upon usury 2320
Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury but unto thy brother thou
shalt not lend upon usury that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all
that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to
possess it

2321 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God thou shalt not
slack to pay it for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee
and it would be sin in thee

2322 But if thou shalt forbear to vow it shall be no sin in thee

2323 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform
even a freewill offering according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD
thy God which thou hast promised with thy mouth

2324 When thou comest into thy neighbours vineyard then thou mayest
eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure but thou shalt not put any
