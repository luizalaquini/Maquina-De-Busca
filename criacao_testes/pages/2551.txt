3125 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 3126 Take the sum of the
prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and Eleazar the
priest and the chief fathers of the congregation 3127 And divide
the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who
went out to battle and between all the congregation 3128 And levy a
tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle one
soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of
the asses and of the sheep 3129 Take it of their half and give it
unto Eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the LORD

3130 And of the children of Israels half thou shalt take one
portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of
the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the Levites
which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD

3131 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
Moses

3132 And the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war
had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five
thousand sheep 3133 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves 3134
And threescore and one thousand asses 3135 And thirty and two
thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with
him

3136 And the half which was the portion of them that went out to
war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
thousand and five hundred sheep 3137 And the LORDs tribute of the
sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen

3138 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the LORDs
tribute was threescore and twelve

3139 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which
the LORDs tribute was threescore and one

3140 And the persons were sixteen thousand of which the LORDs
tribute was thirty and two persons

3141 And Moses gave the tribute which was the LORDs heave offering
unto Eleazar the priest as the LORD commanded Moses

3142 And of the children of Israels half which Moses divided from
the men that warred 3143 Now the half that pertained unto the
congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven
thousand and five hundred sheep 3144 And thirty and six thousand
beeves 3145 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred 3146 And
sixteen thousand persons 3147 Even of the children of Israels
half Moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and
gave them unto the Levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of
the LORD as the LORD commanded Moses

3148 And the officers which were over thousands of the host the
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto Moses
3149 And they said unto Moses Thy servants have taken the sum of the
men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man
of us

3150 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD what every
man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings
earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the
LORD

3151 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all
wrought jewels

3152 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
LORD of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds
was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels

3153 For the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself
3154 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of
the congregation for a memorial for the children of Israel before the
LORD

321 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of Jazer and
the land of Gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
322 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
unto Moses and to Eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the
congregation saying 323 Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah
and Heshbon and Elealeh and Shebam and Nebo and Beon 324 Even
the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel is
a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle 325 Wherefore said
they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto
thy servants for a possession and bring us not over Jordan

326 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
Reuben Shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here  327
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the LORD hath given them  328 Thus
did your fathers when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land

329 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol and saw the
land they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel that they
should not go into the land which the LORD had given them

3210 And the LORDs anger was kindled the same time and he sware
saying 3211 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from
