never stop owing him for
Cressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins of
the old Justice Building which is something of a joke since
the Capitols been using it as a backdrop for fake news
broadcasts for years to show that the district no longer
existed Now with the recent attack the Justice Building
sits about ten yards away from the edge of a new crater
As we approach what used to be the grand entrance
Gale points out something and the whole party slows down
I dont know what the problem is at first and then I see the
ground strewn with fresh pink and red roses Dont touch
them I yell Theyre for me
The sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose and my
heart begins to hammer against my chest So I didnt
imagine it The rose on my dresser Before me lies Snows
second delivery Long-stemmed pink and red beauties the
very flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and I
performed our post-victory interview Flowers not meant for
one but for a pair of lovers
I explain to the others as best I can Upon inspection
they appear to be harmless if genetically enhanced
flowers Two dozen roses Slightly wilted Most likely
dropped after the last bombing A crew in special suits
collects them and carts them away I feel certain they will
find nothing extraordinary in them though Snow knows
exactly what hes doing to me Its like having Cinna beaten
to a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube Designed to
unhinge me
Like then I try to rally and fight back But as Cressida
gets Castor and Pollux in place I feel my anxiety building
Im so tired so wired and so unable to keep my mind on
anything but Peeta since Ive seen the roses The coffee
was a huge mistake What I didnt need was a stimulant My
body visibly shakes and I cant seem to catch my breath
After days in the bunker Im squinting no matter what
direction I turn and the light hurts Even in the cool breeze
sweat trickles down my face
So what exactly do you need from me again I ask
Just a few quick lines that show youre alive and still
fighting says Cressida
Okay I take my position and then Im staring into the
red light Staring Staring Im sorry Ive got nothing
Cressida walks up to me You feeling okay I nod
She pulls a small cloth from her pocket and blots my face
How about we do the old Q-and-A thing
Yeah That would help I think I cross my arms to hide
the shaking Glance at Finnick who gives me a thumbs-up
But hes looking pretty shaky himself
Cressidas back in position now So Katniss Youve
survived the Capitol bombing of Thirteen How did it
compare with what you experienced on the ground in
Eight
We were so far underground this time there was no
real danger Thirteens alive and well and so am-- My voice
cuts off in a dry squeaking sound
Try the line again says Cressida Thirteens alive
and well and so am I
I take a breath trying to force air down into my
diaphragm Thirteens alive and so-- No thats wrong
I swear I can still smell those roses
Katniss just this one line and youre done today I
promise says Cressida Thirteens alive and well and so
am I
I swing my arms to loosen myself up Place my fists on
my hips Then drop them to my sides Salivas filling my
mouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit at the back of my
throat I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get the
stupid line out and go hide in the woods and--thats when I
start crying
Its impossible to be the Mockingjay Impossible to
complete even this one sentence Because now I know that
everything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta Result in
his torture But not his death no nothing so merciful as that
Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death
Cut I hear Cressida say quietly
Whats wrong with her Plutarch says under his
breath
Shes figured out how Snows using Peeta says
Finnick
Theres something like a collective sigh of regret from
the semicircle of people spread out before me Because I
know this now Because there will never be a way for me to
not know this again Because beyond the military
disadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails I am broken
Several sets of arms would embrace me But in the
end the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitch
because he loves Peeta too I reach out for him and say
something like his name and hes there holding me and
patting my back Its okay Itll be okay sweetheart He sits
me on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an arm
around me while I sob
I cant do this anymore I say
I know he says
All I can think of is--what hes going to do to Peeta--
because Im the Mockingjay I get out
I know Haymitchs arm tightens around me
Did you see How weird he acted What are they--
doing to him Im gasping for air between sobs but I
manage one last phrase Its my fault And then I cross
some line into hysteria and theres a needle in my arm and
