the anointing oil and sprinkle it upon Aaron and upon his garments
and upon his sons and upon the garments of his sons with him and he
shall be hallowed and his garments and his sons and his sons
garments with him

2922 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump and the
fat that covereth the inwards and the caul above the liver and the
two kidneys and the fat that is upon them and the right shoulder
for it is a ram of consecration 2923 And one loaf of bread and one
cake of oiled bread and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened
bread that is before the LORD 2924 And thou shalt put all in the
hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and shalt wave them for
a wave offering before the LORD

2925 And thou shalt receive them of their hands and burn them upon
the altar for a burnt offering for a sweet savour before the LORD it
is an offering made by fire unto the LORD

2926 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aarons
consecration and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD and it
shall be thy part

2927 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the
shoulder of the heave offering which is waved and which is heaved
up of the ram of the consecration even of that which is for Aaron
and of that which is for his sons 2928 And it shall be Aarons and
his sons by a statute for ever from the children of Israel for it is
an heave offering and it shall be an heave offering from the children
of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings even their heave
offering unto the LORD

2929 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons after him to
be anointed therein and to be consecrated in them

2930 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven
days when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to
minister in the holy place

2931 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration and seethe his
flesh in the holy place

2932 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the
bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation

2933 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
made to consecrate and to sanctify them but a stranger shall not eat
thereof because they are holy

2934 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations or of the bread
remain unto the morning then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire
it shall not be eaten because it is holy

2935 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron and to his sons according to
all things which I have commanded thee seven days shalt thou
consecrate them

2936 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for
atonement and thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou hast made an
atonement for it and thou shalt anoint it to sanctify it

2937 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar and
sanctify it and it shall be an altar most holy whatsoever toucheth
the altar shall be holy

2938 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar two
lambs of the first year day by day continually

2939 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning and the other lamb
thou shalt offer at even 2940 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of
flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil and the
fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering

2941 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even and shalt do
thereto according to the meat offering of the morning and according
to the drink offering thereof for a sweet savour an offering made by
fire unto the LORD

2942 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before
the LORD where I will meet you to speak there unto thee

2943 And there I will meet with the children of Israel and the
tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory

2944 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the
altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to me
in the priests office

2945 And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their
God

2946 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God that brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell among them I am
the LORD their God

301 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon of shittim
wood shalt thou make it

302 A cubit shall be the length thereof and a cubit the breadth
