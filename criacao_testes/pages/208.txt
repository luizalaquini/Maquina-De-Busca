in the LORD

2228 Therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to
us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again
Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made
not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness
between us and you

2229 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD and turn this
day from following the LORD to build an altar for burnt offerings
for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the LORD
our God that is before his tabernacle

2230 And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the
congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him
heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
and the children of Manasseh spake it pleased them

2231 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
children of Reuben and to the children of Gad and to the children of
Manasseh This day we perceive that the LORD is among us because ye
have not committed this trespass against the LORD now ye have
delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD

2232 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the princes
returned from the children of Reuben and from the children of Gad
out of the land of Gilead unto the land of Canaan to the children of
Israel and brought them word again

2233 And the thing pleased the children of Israel and the children
of Israel blessed God and did not intend to go up against them in
battle to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad
dwelt

2234 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
altar Ed for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God

231 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua waxed
old and stricken in age

232 And Joshua called for all Israel and for their elders and for
their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said
unto them I am old and stricken in age 233 And ye have seen all
that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of
you for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you

234 Behold I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain
to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the
nations that I have cut off even unto the great sea westward

235 And the LORD your God he shall expel them from before you and
drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as
the LORD your God hath promised unto you

236 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
written in the book of the law of Moses that ye turn not aside
therefrom to the right hand or to the left 237 That ye come not
among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention
of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve
them nor bow yourselves unto them 238 But cleave unto the LORD your
God as ye have done unto this day

239 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto
this day

2310 One man of you shall chase a thousand for the LORD your God he
it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you

2311 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the LORD
your God

2312 Else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant
of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make
marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you 2313 Know
for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of
these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto
you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye
perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you

2314 And behold this day I am going the way of all the earth and
ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing
hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake
concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath
failed thereof

2315 Therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are
come upon you which the LORD your God promised you so shall the LORD
bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off
this good land which the LORD your God hath given you

2316 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God
which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed
yourselves to them then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled
against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which
he hath given unto you

241 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and
called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their
