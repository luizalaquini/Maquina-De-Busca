Can I refuse

Not if you wish to cross

I consent Robb said solemnly He had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment Boys might play with swords but it took a lord to make a marriage pact knowing what it meant

They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river The double column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake slithering across the courtyard into the keep and over the bridge to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank

Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent with her son and her uncle Ser Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey Behind followed nine tenths of their horse knights lancers freeriders and mounted bowmen It took hours for them all to cross Afterward Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass the glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the Water Tower

The larger part of the northern host pikes and archers and great masses of men-at-arms on foot remained upon the east bank under the command of Roose Bolton Robb had commanded him to continue the march south to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin

For good or ill her son had thrown the dice





JON

Are you well Snow Lord Mormont asked scowling

Well his raven squawked Well

I am my lord Jon lied… loudly as if that could make it true And you

Mormont frowned A dead man tried to kill me How well could I be He scratched under his chin His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire and he’d hacked it off The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old disreputable and grumpy You do not look well How is your hand

Healing Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow At the time he’d felt nothing the agony had come after His cracked red skin oozed fluid and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers big as roaches The maester says I’ll have scars but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before

A scarred hand is nothing On the Wall you’ll be wearing gloves often as not

As you say my lord It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon it was the rest of it Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy yet even so the pain had been hideous At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame burning day and night Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed whimpering from the pain And when at last he did sleep he dreamt and that was even worse In the dream the corpse he fought had blue eyes black hands and his father’s face but he dared not tell Mormont that

Dywen and Hake returned last night the Old Bear said They found no sign of your uncle no more than the others did

I know Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends and the failure of the rangers’ search had been all the men had been talking of

You know Mormont grumbled How is it that everyone knows everything around here He did not seem to expect an answer It would seem there were only the two of… of those creatures whatever they were I will not call them men And thank the gods for that Any more and… well that doesn’t bear thinking of There will be more though I can feel it in these old bones of mine and Maester Aemon agrees The cold winds are rising Summer is at an end and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen

Winter is coming The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now My lord he asked hesitantly it’s said there was a bird last night…

There was What of it

I had hoped for some word of my father

Father taunted the old raven bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont’s shoulders Father

The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut but the raven hopped up on his head fluttered its wings and flew across the chamber to light above a window Grief and noise Mormont grumbled That’s all they’re good for ravens Why I put up with that pestilential bird… if there was news of Lord Eddard don’t you think I would have sent for you Bastard or no you’re still his blood The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy It seems he’s been removed from the Kingsguard They gave his place to that black dog Clegane and now Selmy’s wanted for treason The fools sent some watchmen to seize him but he slew two of them and escaped Mormont snorted leaving no doubt of his view of men who’d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls and a boy sits the Iron Throne he said in disgust

The raven laughed shrilly Boy boy boy boy

Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear’s best hope Jon remembered if he had fallen what chance was there that Mormont’s letter would be heeded He curled his hand into a fist Pain shot through his burned fingers What of my sisters
