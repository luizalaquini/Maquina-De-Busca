I am to wed Lord Bolton’s son Ramsay He used to be a Snow but His Grace has made him a Bolton They say he’s very brave I am so happy

Then why do you sound so frightened I wish you joy my lady Jaime turned back to Steelshanks You have the coin you were promised

Aye and we’ve shared it out You have my thanks The northman grinned A Lannister always pays his debts

Always said Jaime with a last glance at the girl He wondered if there was much resemblance Not that it mattered The real Arya Stark was buried in some unmarked grave in Flea Bottom in all likelihood With her brothers dead and both parents who would dare name this one a fraud Good speed he told Steelshanks Nage raised his peace banner and the northmen formed a column as ragged as their fur cloaks and trotted out the castle gate The thin girl on the grey mare looked small and forlorn in their midst

A few of the horses still shied away from the dark splotch on the hard-packed ground where the earth had drunk the life’s blood of the stableboy Gregor Clegane had killed so clumsily The sight of it made Jaime angry all over again He had told his Kingsguard to keep the crowd out of the way but that oaf Ser Boros had let himself be distracted by the duel The fool boy himself shared some of the blame to be sure the dead Dornishman as well And Clegane most of all The blow that took the boy’s arm off had been mischance but that second cut…

Well Gregor is paying for it now Grand Maester Pycelle was tending to the man’s wounds but the howls heard ringing from the maester’s chambers suggested that the healing was not going as well as it might The flesh mortifies and the wounds ooze pus Pycelle told the council Even maggots will not touch such foulness His convulsions are so violent that I have had to gag him to prevent him from biting off his tongue I have cut away as much tissue as I dare and treated the rot with boiling wine and bread mold to no avail The veins in his arm are turning black When I leeched him all the leeches died My lords I must know what malignant substance Prince Oberyn used on his spear Let us detain these other Dornishmen until they are more forthcoming

Lord Tywin had refused him There will be trouble enough with Sunspear over Prince Oberyn’s death I do not mean to make matters worse by holding his companions captive

Then I fear Ser Gregor may die

Undoubtedly I swore as much in the letter I sent to Prince Doran with his brother’s body But it must be seen to be the sword of the King’s Justice that slays him not a poisoned spear Heal him

Grand Maester Pycelle blinked in dismay My lord—

Heal him Lord Tywin said again vexed You are aware that Lord Varys has sent fishermen into the waters around Dragonstone They report that only a token force remains to defend the island The Lyseni are gone from the bay and the great part of Lord Stannis’s strength with them

Well and good announced Pycelle Let Stannis rot in Lys I say We are well rid of the man and his ambitions

Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard This is Stannis Baratheon The man will fight to the bitter end and then some If he is gone it can only mean he intends to resume the war Most likely he will land at Storm’s End and try and rouse the storm lords If so he’s finished But a bolder man might roll the dice for Dorne If he should win Sunspear to his cause he might prolong this war for years So we will not offend the Martells any further for any reason The Dornishmen are free to go and you will heal Ser Gregor

And so the Mountain screamed day and night Lord Tywin Lannister could cow even the Stranger it would seem

As Jaime climbed the winding steps of White Sword Tower he could hear Ser Boros snoring in his cell Ser Balon’s door was shut as well he had the king tonight and would sleep all day Aside from Blount’s snores the tower was very quiet That suited Jaime well enough I ought to rest myself Last night after his dance with Ser Addam he’d been too sore to sleep

But when he stepped into his bedchamber he found his sister waiting for him

She stood beside the open window looking over the curtain walls and out to sea The bay wind swirled around her flattening her gown against her body in a way that quickened Jaime’s pulse It was white that gown like the hangings on the wall and the draperies on his bed Swirls of tiny emeralds brightened the ends of her wide sleeves and spiraled down her bodice Larger emeralds were set in the golden spiderweb that bound her golden hair The gown was cut low to bare her shoulders and the tops of her breasts She is so beautiful He wanted nothing more than to take her in his arms

Cersei He closed the door softly Why are you here

Where else could I go When she turned to him there were tears in her eyes Father’s made it clear that I am no longer wanted on the council Jaime won’t you talk to him

Jaime took off his cloak and hung it from a peg on the wall I talk to Lord Tywin every day

Must you be so stubborn All he wants…

…is to force me from the Kingsguard and send me back to Casterly Rock

That need not be so terrible He is sending me back to Casterly Rock as well He wants me far away so he’ll have a free hand with Tommen Tommen is my son not his

Tommen is the king

He is a boy A frightened little boy who saw his brother murdered at his own wedding And now they are telling him that he must marry The girl is twice his age and twice a widow

He eased himself into a chair trying to ignore the ache of bruised muscles The Tyrells are insisting I see no harm in it Tommen’s been lonely since Myrcella went to Dorne He likes having Margaery and her ladies about Let them wed

He is your son…

He is my seed He’s never called me Father No more than Joffrey ever did You warned me a thousand times never to show any undue interest in them

To keep them safe You as well How would it have looked if my brother had played the father to the king’s children Even Robert might have grown suspicious

Well he’s beyond suspicion now Robert’s death still left a bitter taste in Jaime’s mouth It should have been me who killed him not Cersei I only wished he’d died at my hands When I still had two of them If I’d let kingslaying become a habit as he liked to say I could have taken you as my wife for all the world to see I’m not ashamed of loving you only of the things I’ve done to hide it That boy at Winterfell…

Did I tell you to throw him out the window If you’d gone hunting as I begged you nothing would have happened But no you had to have me you could not wait until we returned to the city

I’d waited long enough I hated watching Robert stumble to your bed every night always wondering if maybe this night he’d decide to claim his rights as husband Jaime suddenly remembered something else that troubled him about Winterfell At Riverrun Catelyn Stark seemed convinced I’d sent some footpad to slit her son’s throat That I’d given him a dagger

That she said scornfully Tyrion asked me about that

There was a dagger The scars on Lady Catelyn’s hands were real enough she showed them to me Did you…

Oh don’t be absurd Cersei closed the window Yes I hoped the boy would die So did you Even Robert thought that would have been for the best ‘We kill our horses when they break a leg and our dogs when they go blind but we are too weak to give the same mercy to crippled children’ he told me He was blind himself at the time from drink

Robert Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups that he would have denied angrily the next day Were you alone when Robert said this

You don’t think he said it to Ned Stark I hope Of course we were alone Us and the children Cersei removed her hairnet and draped it over a bedpost then shook out her golden curls Perhaps Myrcella sent this man with the dagger do you think so

It was meant as mockery but she’d cut right to the heart of it Jaime saw at once Not Myrcella Joffrey

Cersei frowned Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark but the younger boy was nothing to him He was only a child himself  

A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father He had an uncomfortable thought Tyrion almost died because of this bloody dagger If he knew the whole thing was Joffrey’s work that might be why…

I don’t care why Cersei said He can take his reasons down to hell with him If you had seen how Joff died… he fought Jaime he fought for every breath but it was as if some malign spirit had its hands about his throat He had such terror in his eyes… When he was little he’d run to me when he was scared or hurt and I would protect him But that night there was nothing I could do Tyrion murdered him in front of me and there was nothing I could do Cersei sank to her knees before his chair and took Jaime’s good hand between both of hers Joff is dead and Myrcella’s in Dorne Tommen’s all I have left You mustn’t let Father take him from me Jaime please

Lord Tywin has not asked for my approval I can talk to him but he will not listen…

He will if you agree to leave the Kingsguard

I’m not leaving the Kingsguard

His sister fought back tears Jaime you’re my shining knight You cannot abandon me when I need you most He is stealing my son sending me away… and unless you stop him Father is going to force me to wed again

Jaime should not have been surprised but he was The words were a blow to his gut harder than any that Ser Addam Marbrand had dealt him Who

Does it matter Some lord or other Someone Father thinks he needs I don’t care I will not have another husband You are the only man I want in my bed ever again

Then tell him that

She pulled her hands away You are talking madness again Would you have us ripped apart as Mother did that time she caught us playing Tommen would lose the throne Myrcella her marriage… I want to be your wife we belong to each other but it can never be Jaime We are brother and sister

The Targaryens…
