crasies from both sides of the Channel he showed at
such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the
Englishman together with that blindness to the line
where sentiment verges on mawkishness characteristic
of the French
lt was a cloudy muggy and very dark night and
the rays from Troys lantern spread into the two old
yews with a strange illuminating power flickering as it
seemed up to the black ceiling of cloud above He
felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand and
presently one came and entered one of the holes of the
lantern whereupon the candle sputtered and went out+
Troy was weary and it being now not far from midnight
and the rain threatening to increase he resolved to leave
the finishing touches of his labour until the day should
break He groped along the wall and over the graves
in the dark till he found himself round at the north side
Here he entered the porch and reclining upon the
bench within fell asleep

THE GURGOYLE  ITS DOINGS
THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square
erection of fourteenth-century date having two stone
gurgoyles on each of the four faces of its parapet Of
these eight carved protuberances only two at this time
continued to serve the purpose of their erection -- that
of spouting the water from the lead roof within One
mouth in each front had been closed hy bygone church+
wardens as superfluous and two others were broken
away and choked -- a matter not of much consequence
to the welibeing of the tower for the two mouths which
still remained open and active were gaping enough to do
all the work
It has been sometimes argued that there is no truer
criterion of the vitality of any given art-period than the
power of the master-spirits of that time in grotesque 
and certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is no
disputing the proposition Weatherbury tower was a
somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental
parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches
and the gurgoyles which are the necessary correlatives
of a parapet were exccptionally prominent -- of the
boldest cut that the hand could shape and of the most
original design that a human brain could conceive
There was so to speak that symmetry in their distortion
which is less the characteristic of British than of
Continental grotesques of the period All the eight
were different from each other A beholder was con+
vinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous
than those he saw on the north side until he went
round to the south Of the two on this latter face only
that at the south-eastern corner concerns the story It
was too human to be called like a dragon too impish
to be like a man too animal to be like a fiend and not
enough like a bird to be called a griffin This horrible
stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a

hide it had short erect ears eyes starting from their
sockets and its fingers and hands were seizing the
corners of its mouth which they thus seemed to pull
open to give free passage to the water it vomited The
lower row of teeth was quite washed away though the
upper still remained Here and thus jutting a couple
of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a
support the creature had for four hundred years
laughed at the surrounding landscape voicelessly in
dry weather and in wet with a gurgling and snorting
sound
Troy slept on in the porch and the rain increased
outside Presently the gurgoyle spat In due time a
small stream began to trickle through the seventy feet
of aerial space between its mouth and the ground which
the water-drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated
velocity The stream thickened in substance and in+
creased in power gradually spouting further and yet
further from the side of the tower When the rain fell
in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed
downward in volumes
We follow its course to the ground at this point of
time The end of the liquid parabola has come forward
from the wall has advanced over the plinth mouldings
over a heap of stones over the marble border into the
midst of Fanny Robins grave
The force of the stream had until very lately been
received upon some loose stones spread thereabout
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset
These during the summer had been cleared from the
ground and there was now nothing to resist the down+
fall but the bare earth For several years the stream
had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing
on this night and such a contingency had been over+
looked Sometimes this obscure corner received no
inhabitant for the space of two or three years and
then it was usually but a pauper a poacher or other
sinner of undignified sins
The persistent torrent from the gurgoyles jaws
directed all its vengeance into the grave The rich
tawny mould was stirred into motion and boiled like
