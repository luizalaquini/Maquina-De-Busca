Maester Luwin averted his eyes Even Ned looked shocked What are you doing he asked

Lighting a fire Catelyn told him She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it then knelt over the cold hearth

Maester Luwin— Ned began

Maester Luwin has delivered all my children Catelyn said This is no time for false modesty She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it

Ned crossed the room took her by the arm and pulled her to her feet He held her there his face inches from her My lady tell me What was this message

Catelyn stiffened in his grasp A warning she said softly If we have the wits to hear

His eyes searched her face Go on

Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered

His fingers tightened on her arm By whom

The Lannisters she told him The queen

Ned released his hold on her arm There were deep red marks on her skin Gods he whispered His voice was hoarse Your sister is sick with grief She cannot know what she is saying

She knows Catelyn said Lysa is impulsive yes but this message was carefully planned cleverly hidden She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands To risk so much she must have had more than mere suspicion Catelyn looked to her husband Now we truly have no choice You must be Robert’s Hand You must go south with him and learn the truth

She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion The only truths I know are here The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid

Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat The Hand of the King has great power my lord Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn’s death to bring his killers to the king’s justice Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son if the worst be true

Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber Catelyn’s heart went out to him but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then First the victory must be won for her children’s sake You say you love Robert like a brother Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters

The Others take both of you Ned muttered darkly He turned away from them and went to the window She did not speak nor did the maester They waited quiet while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved When he turned away from the window at last his voice was tired and full of melancholy and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes My father went south once to answer the summons of a king He never came home again

A different time Maester Luwin said A different king

Yes Ned said dully He seated himself in a chair by the hearth Catelyn you shall stay here in Winterfell

His words were like an icy draft through her heart No she said suddenly afraid Was this to be her punishment Never to see his face again nor to feel his arms around her

Yes Ned said in words that would brook no argument You must govern the north in my stead while I run Robert’s errands There must always be a Stark in Winterfell Robb is fourteen Soon enough he will be a man grown He must learn to rule and I will not be here for him Make him part of your councils He must be ready when his time comes

Gods will not for many years Maester Luwin murmured

Maester Luwin I trust you as I would my own blood Give my wife your voice in all things great and small Teach my son the things he needs to know Winter is coming

Maester Luwin nodded gravely Then silence fell until Catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded What of the other children

Ned stood and took her in his arms and held her face close to his Rickon is very young he said gently He should stay here with you and Robb The others I would take with me

I could not bear it Catelyn said trembling

You must he said Sansa must wed Joffrey that is clear now we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court In a few years she will be of an age to marry too

Sansa would shine in the south Catelyn thought to herself and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement Reluctantly she let go of them in her heart But not Bran Never Bran Yes she said but please Ned for the love you bear me let Bran remain here at Winterfell He is only seven
