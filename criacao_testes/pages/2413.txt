1811 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it
ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women

1812 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying After I am waxed
old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also  1813 And the LORD
said unto Abraham Wherefore did Sarah laugh saying Shall I of a
surety bear a child which am old  1814 Is any thing too hard for
the LORD At the time appointed I will return unto thee according to
the time of life and Sarah shall have a son

1815 Then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid
And he said Nay but thou didst laugh

1816 And the men rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom and
Abraham went with them to bring them on the way

1817 And the LORD said Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
do 1818 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
1819 For I know him that he will command his children and his
household after him and they shall keep the way of the LORD to do
justice and judgment that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which
he hath spoken of him

1820 And the LORD said Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great and because their sin is very grievous 1821 I will go down
now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
it which is come unto me and if not I will know

1822 And the men turned their faces from thence and went toward
Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the LORD

1823 And Abraham drew near and said Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked  1824 Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
place for the fifty righteous that are therein  1825 That be far
from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the
wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far
from thee Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right  1826 And
the LORD said If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city
then I will spare all the place for their sakes

1827 And Abraham answered and said Behold now I have taken upon me
to speak unto the LORD which am but dust and ashes 1828
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five And he said If I find there
forty and five I will not destroy it

1829 And he spake unto him yet again and said Peradventure there
shall be forty found there And he said I will not do it for fortys
sake

1830 And he said unto him Oh let not the LORD be angry and I will
speak Peradventure there shall thirty be found there And he said I
will not do it if I find thirty there

1831 And he said Behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the
LORD Peradventure there shall be twenty found there And he said I
will not destroy it for twentys sake

1832 And he said Oh let not the LORD be angry and I will speak yet
but this once Peradventure ten shall be found there And he said I
will not destroy it for tens sake

1833 And the LORD went his way as soon as he had left communing with
Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place

191 And there came two angels to Sodom at even and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground 192 And he said Behold now
my lords turn in I pray you into your servants house and tarry
all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on
your ways And they said Nay but we will abide in the street all
night

193 And he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him
and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake
unleavened bread and they did eat

194 But before they lay down the men of the city even the men of
Sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people
from every quarter 195 And they called unto Lot and said unto him
Where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out
unto us that we may know them

196 And Lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after
him 197 And said I pray you brethren do not so wickedly

198 Behold now I have two daughters which have not known man let
me I pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good
in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they
under the shadow of my roof

199 And they said Stand back And they said again This one fellow
came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal
worse with thee than with them And they pressed sore upon the man
even Lot and came near to break the door

1910 But the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house
to them and shut to the door
