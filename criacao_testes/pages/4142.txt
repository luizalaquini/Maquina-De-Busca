self-contained There was a  change in Boldwoods
exterior from its former impassibleness  and his face
showed that he was now living outside his defences
for the first time and with a fearful sense of exposure
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
love
At last he arrived at a conclusion It was to go
across and inquire boldly of her
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these
many years without a channel of any kind for disposable
emotion had worked its effect It has been observed
more than once that the causes of love are chiefly

subjective and Boldwood was a living testimony to
the truth of the proposition No mother existed to
absorb his devotion no sister for his tenderness no
idle ties for sense He became surcharged with the
compound which was genuine lovers love
He approached the gate of the meadow Beyond
it the ground was melodious with ripples and the sky
with larks the low bleating of the flock mingling with
both Mistress and man were engaged in the operation
of making a lamb take which is performed whenever
an ewe has lost her own offspring one of the twins of
another ewe being given her as a substitute Gabriel
had skinned the dead lamb and was tying the skin
over the body of the live lamb in the customary manner
whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four
hurdles into which the Mother and foisted lamb were
driven where they would remain till the old sheep
conceived an affection for the young one
Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the
manouvre and saw the farmer by the gate where he
was overhung by a willow tree in full bloom Gabriel
to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April
day was ever regardful of its faintest changes and
instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence
from without in the form of a keenly self-conscious
reddening He also turned and beheld Boldwood
At onee connecting these signs with the letter Bold+
wood had shown him Gabriel suspected her of some
coquettish procedure begun by that means and carried
on since he knew not how
Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting
that they were aware of his presence and the perception
was as too much light turned upon his new sensibility
He was still in the road and by moving on he hoped
that neither would recognize that he had originally
intended to enter the field He passed by with an
utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance shyness
and doubt Perhaps in her manner there were signs
that she wished to see him -- perhaps not -- he could not
read a woman The cabala of this erotic philosophy
seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in
misleading ways
P 174
Every turn look word and accent
contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
import and not one had ever been pondered by him
until now
As for Bathsheba she was not deceived into the
belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business
or in idleness She collected the probabilities of the
case and concluded that she was herself responsible for
Boldwoods appearance there It troubled her much
to see what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to
kindle Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage nor
was she deliberately a trifler with the affections of men
and a censors experience on seeing an actual flirt after
observing her would have been a feeling of surprise
that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one
and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be
She resolved never again by look or by sign to
interrupt the steady flow of this mans life But a
resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil
is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible

THE SHEEP-WASHING -- THE OFFER
BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her She was
not at home  Of course not he murmured In con+
templating Bathsheba as a woman he had forgotten the
accidents of her position as an agriculturist -- that being
as much of a farmer and as extensive a farmer as
himself her probable whereabouts was out-of-dooTs at
this time of the year This and the other oversights
Boldwood was guilty of were natural to the mood and
still more natural to the circumstances The great aids
to idealization in love were present here  occasional
observation of her from a distance and the absence of
social intercourse with her -- visual familiarity oral
strangeness The smaller human elements were kept
out of sight  the pettinesses that enter so largely into
all earthly living and doing were disguised by the
accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting
terms  and there was hardly awakened a thought in
Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to
her or that she like all others had moments of
commonplace when to be least plainly seen was to be
most prettily remembered Thus a mild sort of
