What indeed You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage

I have little doubt you’ll be equal to the task

I once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into Tyrion’s mismatched eyes Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown

That will do nicely

His guest rose This has been quite the pleasant morning Lannister And profitable    for both of us I trust He bowed his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door

Two thought Tyrion

He went up to his bedchamber to await Varys who would soon be making an appearance Evenfall he guessed Perhaps as late as moonrise though he hoped not He hoped to visit Shae tonight He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door You are a cruel man to make the Grand Maester squirm so the eunuch scolded The man cannot abide a secret

Is that a crow I hear calling the raven black Or would you sooner not hear what I’ve proposed to Doran Martell

Varys giggled Perhaps my little birds have told me

Have they indeed He wanted to hear this Go on

The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars Doran Martell has called his banners but no more His hatred for House Lannister is well known and it is commonly thought he will join Lord Renly You wish to dissuade him

All this is obvious said Tyrion

The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance The prince is a sentimental man and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe

My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition    and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council now that Lord Janos has taken the black

A council seat is not to be despised Varys admitted yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sister’s murder

Why forget Tyrion smiled I’ve promised to deliver his sister’s killers alive or dead as he prefers After the war is done to be sure

Varys gave him a shrewd look My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a    certain name    when they came for her

Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it In Casterly Rock it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe They said he had raped the princess with her son’s blood and brains still on his hands

This secret is your lord father’s sworn man

My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog

Varys stroked a powdered cheek And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed   

Robert Baratheon led the rebellion All commands came from him in the end

Robert was not at King’s Landing

Neither was Doran Martell

So Blood for his pride a chair for his ambition Gold and land that goes without saying A sweet offer    yet sweets can be poisoned If I were the prince something more would I require before I should reach for this honeycomb Some token of good faith some sure safeguard against betrayal Varys smiled his slimiest smile Which one will you give him I wonder

Tyrion sighed You know don’t you

Since you put it that way—yes Tommen You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran Martell and Lysa Arryn both

Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again You cheat

Prince Tommen is a good boy

If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he’s still young he may even grow to be a good man

And a good king

Joffrey is king

And Tommen is heir should anything ill befall His Grace Tommen whose nature is so sweet and notably    tractable

You have a suspicious mind Varys

I shall take that as a tribute my lord In any case Prince Doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do him Very deftly done I would say    but for one small flaw

The dwarf laughed Named Cersei

What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb Perhaps for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm the queen might be persuaded to send away Tommen or Myrcella But both of them Surely not

What Cersei does not know will never hurt me

And if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe

Why he said then I would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy And when Varys giggled he thought Three





SANSA

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

The words were the same on the hundredth reading as they’d been on the first when Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow She did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it The note was unsigned unsealed and the hand unfamiliar She crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home she breathed ever so faintly

What could it mean Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good Nervously she rubbed her stomach The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given her had faded to an ugly yellow but still hurt His fist had been mailed when he hit her It was her own fault She must learn to hide her feelings better so as not to anger Joffrey When she heard that the Imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall she had forgotten herself and said I hope the Others get him The king had not been pleased

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

Sansa had prayed so hard Could this be her answer at last a true knight sent to save her Perhaps it was one of the Redwyne twins or bold Ser Balon Swann    or even Beric Dondarrion the young lord her friend Jeyne Poole had loved with his red-gold hair and the spray of stars on his black cloak

Come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home

What if it was some cruel jape of Joffrey’s like the day he had taken her up to the battlements to show her Father’s head Or perhaps it was some subtle snare to prove she was not loyal If she went to the godswood would she find Ser Ilyn Payne waiting for her sitting silent under the heart tree with Ice in his hand his pale eyes watching to see if she’d come
