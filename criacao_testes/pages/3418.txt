Tyrion gave her a crooked smile Why only that Tommen may get his wish The maester thinks the boy may yet live He took a sip of beer

Myrcella gave a happy gasp and Tommen smiled nervously but it was not the children Tyrion was watching The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second but he did not miss it Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table That is no mercy These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain

What were the maester’s words Jaime asked

The bacon crunched when he bit into it Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said He thinks that if the boy were going to die he would have done so already It has been four days with no change

Will Bran get better Uncle little Myrcella asked She had all of her mother’s beauty and none of her nature

His back is broken little one Tyrion told her The fall shattered his legs as well They keep him alive with honey and water or he would starve to death Perhaps if he wakes he will be able to eat real food but he will never walk again

If he wakes Cersei repeated Is that likely

The gods alone know Tyrion told her The maester only hopes He chewed some more bread I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive The creature is outside his window day and night howling Every time they chase it away it returns The maester said they closed the window once to shut out the noise and Bran seemed to weaken When they opened it again his heart beat stronger

The queen shuddered There is something unnatural about those animals she said They are dangerous I will not have any of them coming south with us

Jaime said You’ll have a hard time stopping them sister They follow those girls everywhere

Tyrion started on his fish Are you leaving soon then

Not near soon enough Cersei said Then she frowned Are we leaving she echoed What about you Gods don’t tell me you are staying here

Tyrion shrugged Benjen Stark is returning to the Night’s Watch with his brother’s bastard I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of

Jaime smiled I hope you’re not thinking of taking the black on us sweet brother

Tyrion laughed What me celibate The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock No I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world

Cersei stood abruptly The children don’t need to hear this filth Tommen Myrcella come She strode briskly from the morning room her train and her pups trailing behind her

Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death

He will if Robert commands it Tyrion said And Robert will command it There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case

He could end his torment Jaime said I would if it were my son It would be a mercy

I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard sweet brother Tyrion said He would not take it kindly

Even if the boy does live he will be a cripple Worse than a cripple A grotesque Give me a good clean death

Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders Speaking for the grotesques he said I beg to differ Death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities

Jaime smiled You are a perverse little imp aren’t you

Oh yes Tyrion admitted I hope the boy does wake I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say

His brother’s smile curdled like sour milk Tyrion my sweet brother he said darkly there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on

Tyrion’s mouth was full of bread and fish He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime Why Jaime my sweet brother he said you wound me You know how much I love my family





JON

Jon climbed the steps slowly trying not to think that this might be the last time ever Ghost padded silently beside him Outside snow swirled through the castle gates and the yard was all noise and chaos but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet Too quiet for Jon’s liking

He reached the landing and stood for a long moment afraid Ghost nuzzled at his hand He took courage from that He straightened and entered the room

Lady Stark was there beside his bed She had been there day and night for close on a fortnight Not for a moment had she left Bran’s side She had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all She fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life Not once did she leave the room So Jon had stayed away

But now there was no more time

He stood in the door for a moment afraid to speak afraid to come closer The window was open Below a wolf howled Ghost heard and lifted his head

Lady Stark looked over For a moment she did not seem to recognize him Finally she blinked What are you doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless

I came to see Bran Jon said To say good-bye

Her face did not change Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled She looked as though she had aged twenty years You’ve said it Now go away

Part of him wanted only to flee but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again He took a nervous step into the room Please he said

Something cold moved in her eyes I told you to leave she said We don’t want you here

Once that would have sent him running Once that might even have made him cry Now it only made him angry He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch soon and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark He’s my brother he said

Shall I call the guards

Call them Jon said defiant You can’t stop me from seeing him He crossed the room keeping the bed between them and looked down on Bran where he lay

She was holding one of his hands It looked like a claw This was not the Bran he remembered The flesh had all gone from him His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks Under the blanket his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick His eyes were sunken deep into black pits open but they saw nothing The fall had shrunken him somehow He looked half a leaf as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave

Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath

Bran he said I’m sorry I didn’t come before I was afraid He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks Jon no longer cared Don’t die Bran Please We’re all waiting for you to wake up Me and Robb and the girls everyone…

Lady Stark was watching She had not raised a cry Jon took that for acceptance Outside the window the direwolf howled again The wolf that Bran had not had time to name

I have to go now Jon said Uncle Benjen is waiting I’m to go north to the Wall We have to leave today before the snows come He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey It was more than he could bear the thought of leaving him behind like this Jon brushed away his tears leaned over and kissed his brother lightly on the lips

I wanted him to stay here with me Lady Stark said softly

Jon watched her wary She was not even looking at him She was talking to him but for a part of her it was as though he were not even in the room

I prayed for it she said dully He was my special boy I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me Sometimes prayers are answered
