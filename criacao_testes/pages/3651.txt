Lord Alester Florent cleared his throat Ser Cortnay mind your tongue His Grace means the boy no harm The child is his own blood and mine as well My niece Delena was the mother as all men know If you will not trust to the king trust to me You know me for a man of honor—

I know you for a man of ambition Ser Cortnay broke in A man who changes kings and gods the way I change my boots As do these other turncloaks I see before me

An angry clamor went up from the king’s men He is not far wrong Davos thought Only a short time before the Fossoways Guyard Morrigen and the Lords Caron Varner Errol and Estermont had all belonged to Renly They had sat in his pavilion helped him make his battle plans plotted how Stannis might be brought low And Lord Florent had been with them—he might be Queen Selyse’s own uncle but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater from bending his knee to Renly when Renly’s star was rising

Bryce Caron walked his horse forward a few paces his long rainbow-striped cloak twisting in the wind off the bay No man here is a turncloak ser My fealty belongs to Storm’s End and King Stannis is its rightful lord… and our true king He is the last of House Baratheon Robert’s heir and Renly’s

If that is so why is the Knight of Flowers not among you And where is Mathis Rowan Randyll Tarly Lady Oakheart Why are they not here in your company they who loved Renly best Where is Brienne of Tarth I ask you

That one Ser Guyard Morrigen laughed harshly She ran As well she might Hers was the hand that slew the king

A lie Ser Cortnay said I knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at her father’s feet in Evenfall Hall and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to Storm’s End She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him a blind man could see it

To be sure declared Lord Florent airily and she would scarcely be the first maid maddened to murder by a man who spurned her Though for my own part I believe it was Lady Stark who slew the king She had journeyed all the way from Riverrun to plead for an alliance and Renly had refused her No doubt she saw him as a danger to her son and so removed him

It was Brienne insisted Lord Caron Ser Emmon Cuy swore as much before he died You have my oath on that Ser Cortnay

Contempt thickened Ser Cortnay’s voice And what is that worth You wear your cloak of many colors I see The one Renly gave you when you swore your oath to protect him If he is dead how is it you are not He turned his scorn on Guyard Morrigen I might ask the same of you ser Guyard the Green yes Of the Rainbow Guard Sworn to give his own life for his king’s if I had such a cloak I would be ashamed to wear it

Morrigen bristled Be glad this is a parley Penrose or I would have your tongue for those words

And cast it in the same fire where you left your manhood

Enough Stannis said The Lord of Light willed that my brother die for his treason Who did the deed matters not

Not to you perhaps said Ser Cortnay I have heard your proposal Lord Stannis Now here is mine He pulled off his glove and flung it full in the king’s face Single combat Sword lance or any weapon you care to name Or if you fear to hazard your magic sword and royal skin against an old man name you a champion and I shall do the same He gave Guyard Morrigen and Bryce Caron a scathing look Either of these pups would do nicely I should think

Ser Guyard Morrigen grew dark with fury I will take up the gage if it please the king

As would I Bryce Caron looked to Stannis

The king ground his teeth No

Ser Cortnay did not seem surprised Is it the justice of your cause you doubt my lord or the strength of your arm Are you afraid I’ll piss on your burning sword and put it out

Do you take me for an utter fool ser asked Stannis I have twenty thousand men You are besieged by land and sea Why would I choose single combat when my eventual victory is certain The king pointed a finger at him I give you fair warning If you force me to take my castle by storm you may expect no mercy I will hang you for traitors every one of you

As the gods will it Bring on your storm my lord—and recall if you do the name of this castle Ser Cortnay gave a pull on his reins and rode back toward the gate

Stannis said no word but turned his horse around and started back toward his camp The others followed If we storm these walls thousands will die fretted ancient Lord Estermont who was the king’s grandfather on his mother’s side Better to hazard but a single life surely Our cause is righteous so the gods must surely bless our champion’s arms with victory

God old man thought Davos You forget we have only one now Melisandre’s Lord of Light

Ser Jon Fossoway said I would gladly take this challenge myself though I’m not half the swordsman Lord Caron is or Ser Guyard Renly left no notable knights at Storm’s End Garrison duty is for old men and green boys

Lord Caron agreed An easy victory to be sure And what glory to win Storm’s End with a single stroke

Stannis raked them all with a look You chatter like magpies and with less sense I will have quiet The king’s eyes fell on Davos Ser Ride with me He spurred his horse away from his followers Only Melisandre kept pace bearing the great standard of the fiery heart with the crowned stag within As if it had been swallowed whole

Davos saw the looks that passed between the lordlings as he rode past them to join the king These were no onion knights but proud men from houses whose names were old in honor Somehow he knew that Renly had never chided them in such a fashion The youngest of the Baratheons had been born with a gift for easy courtesy that his brother sadly lacked

He eased back to a slow trot when his horse came up beside the king’s Your Grace Seen at close hand Stannis looked worse than Davos had realized from afar His face had grown haggard and he had dark circles under his eyes

A smuggler must be a fair judge of men the king said What do you make of this Ser Cortnay Penrose

A stubborn man said Davos carefully

Hungry for death I call it He throws my pardon in my face Aye and throws his life away in the bargain and the lives of every man inside those walls Single combat The king snorted in derision No doubt he mistook me for Robert

More like he was desperate What other hope does he have

None The castle will fall But how to do it quickly Stannis brooded on that for a moment Under the steady clop-clop of hooves Davos could hear the faint sound of the king grinding his teeth Lord Alester urges me to bring old Lord Penrose here Ser Cortnay’s father You know the man I believe

When I came as your envoy Lord Penrose received me more courteously than most Davos said He is an old done man sire Sickly and failing

Florent would have him fail more visibly In his son’s sight with a noose about his neck

It was dangerous to oppose the queen’s men but Davos had vowed always to tell his king the truth I think that would be ill done my liege Ser Cortnay will watch his father die before he would ever betray his trust It would gain us nothing and bring dishonor to our cause

What dishonor Stannis bristled Would you have me spare the lives of traitors

You have spared the lives of those behind us

Do you scold me for that smuggler

It is not my place Davos feared he had said too much

The king was relentless You esteem this Penrose more than you do my lords bannermen Why

He keeps faith

A misplaced faith in a dead usurper

Yes Davos admitted but still he keeps faith

As those behind us do not

Davos had come too far with Stannis to play coy now Last year they were Robert’s men A moon ago they were Renly’s This morning they are yours Whose will they be on the morrow

And Stannis laughed A sudden gust rough and full of scorn I told you Melisandre he said to the red woman my Onion Knight tells me the truth

I see you know him well Your Grace the red woman said

Davos I have missed you sorely the king said Aye I have a tail of traitors your nose does not deceive you My lords bannermen are inconstant even in their treasons I need them but you should know how it sickens me to pardon such as these when I have punished better men for lesser crimes You have every right to reproach me Ser Davos

You reproach yourself more than I ever could Your Grace You must have these great lords to win your throne—

Fingers and all it seems Stannis smiled grimly
