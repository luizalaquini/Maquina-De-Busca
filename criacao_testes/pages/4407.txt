excellent results can be

rh Duration and pitch qualifiers
Each sound segment has a different duration
Table 112 shows the measured duration of the segments although no
calibration data is given by Votrax
As mentioned earlier a 2-bit number accompanies each segment to modify
its duration and
this was set to 3 least duration for the measurements
The qualifier has a multiplicative effect shown in Table 113

As well as the 2-bit rate qualifier each sound segment is accompanied by
a 3-bit pitch specification  This provides a linear control over fundamental
frequency and Table 114 shows the measured values

FG Table 114  Effect of the 3-bit per-segment pitch specifier
The quantization interval varies from
one to two semitones
Votrax interpolates pitch from phoneme to phoneme in a highly satisfactory
manner and this permits surprisingly sophisticated intonation contours
to be generated considering the crude 8-level quantization
pp
The notation in which the Votrax manual defines utterances
gives duration qualifiers and pitch specifications as digits
preceding the sound segment and separated from it by a slash 
Thus for example
LB
14THV
LE
defines the sound segment THV with duration qualifier 1 multiplies the
70 msec duration of Table 112 by 122 em from Table 113 em to give 85 msec
and pitch specification 4 81 Hz
This representation of a segment is transformed into two ASCII characters before transmission
to the synthesizer
rh Converting a phonetic transcription to sound segments
It would be useful to have a computer procedure to produce a specification for
an utterance in terms of Votrax sound segments from a standard phonetic
transcription
This could remove much of the tedium from utterance preparation
by incorporating the contextual rules given in the Votrax manual
Starting with a phonetic transcription each phoneme should be converted
to its default Votrax representative
The resulting wide Votrax transcription must be
transformed into a narrow one by application of contextual rules
Separate rules are needed for
LB

vowel clusters diphthongs
