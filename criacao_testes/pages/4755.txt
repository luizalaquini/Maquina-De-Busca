down from his hill on high

O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles

he rode to a woman’s sigh

For she was his secret treasure

she was his shame and his bliss

And a chain and a keep are nothing

compared to a woman’s kiss

Ser Kevan did not visit him that night He was probably with Lord Tywin trying to placate the Tyrells I have seen the last of that uncle I fear He poured another cup of wine A pity he’d had Symon Silver Tongue killed before learning all the words of that song It wasn’t a bad song if truth be told Especially compared to the ones that would be written about him henceforth For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm he sang Perhaps he should write the other verses himself If he lived so long

That night surprisingly Tyrion Lannister slept long and deep He rose at first light well rested and with a hearty appetite and broke his fast on fried bread blood sausage applecakes and a double helping of eggs cooked with onions and fiery Dornish peppers Then he begged leave of his guards to attend his champion Ser Addam gave his consent

Tyrion found Prince Oberyn drinking a cup of red wine as he donned his armor He was attended by four of his younger Dornish lordlings Good morrow to you my lord the prince said Will you take a cup of wine

Should you be drinking before battle

I always drink before battle

That could get you killed Worse it could get me killed

Prince Oberyn laughed The gods defend the innocent You are innocent I trust

Only of killing Joffrey Tyrion admitted I do hope you know what you are about to face Gregor Clegane is—

—large So I have heard

He is almost eight feet tall and must weigh thirty stone all of it muscle He fights with a two-handed greatsword but needs only one hand to wield it He has been known to cut men in half with a single blow His armor is so heavy that no lesser man could bear the weight let alone move in it

Prince Oberyn was unimpressed I have killed large men before The trick is to get them off their feet Once they go down they’re dead The Dornishman sounded so blithely confident that Tyrion felt almost reassured until he turned and said Daemon my spear Ser Daemon tossed it to him and the Red Viper snatched it from the air

You mean to face the Mountain with a spear That made Tyrion uneasy all over again In battle ranks of massed spears made for a formidable front but single combat against a skilled swordsman was a very different matter

We are fond of spears in Dorne Besides it is the only way to counter his reach Have a look Lord Imp but see you do not touch The spear was turned ash eight feet long the shaft smooth thick and heavy The last two feet of that was steel a slender leaf-shaped spearhead narrowing to a wicked spike The edges looked sharp enough to shave with When Oberyn spun the haft between the palms of his hand they glistened black Oil Or poison Tyrion decided that he would sooner not know I hope you are good with that he said doubtfully

You will have no cause for complaint Though Ser Gregor may However thick his plate there will be gaps at the joints Inside the elbow and knee beneath the arms    I will find a place to tickle him I promise you He set the spear aside It is said that a Lannister always pays his debts Perhaps you will return to Sunspear with me when the day’s bloodletting is done My brother Doran would be most pleased to meet the rightful heir to Casterly Rock    especially if he brought his lovely wife the Lady of Winterfell

Does the snake think I have Sansa squirreled away somewhere like a nut I’m hoarding for winter If so Tyrion was not about to disabuse him A trip to Dorne might be very pleasant now that I reflect on it

Plan on a lengthy visit Prince Oberyn sipped his wine You and Doran have many matters of mutual interest to discuss Music trade history wine the dwarf’s penny    the laws of inheritance and succession No doubt an uncle’s counsel would be of benefit to Queen Myrcella in the trying times ahead

If Varys had his little birds listening Oberyn was giving them a ripe earful I believe I will have that cup of wine said Tyrion Queen Myrcella It would have been more tempting if only he did have Sansa tucked beneath his cloak If she declared for Myrcella over Tommen would the north follow What the Red Viper was hinting at was treason Could Tyrion truly take up arms against Tommen against his own father Cersei would spit blood It might be worth it for that alone

Do you recall the tale I told you of our first meeting Imp Prince Oberyn asked as the Bastard of Godsgrace knelt before him to fasten his greaves It was not for your tail alone that my sister and I came to Casterly Rock We were on a quest of sorts A quest that took us to Starfall the Arbor Oldtown the Shield Islands Crakehall and finally Casterly Rock    but our true destination was marriage Doran was betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos so he had been left behind as castellan of Sunspear My sister and I were yet unpromised

Elia found it all exciting She was of that age and her delicate health had never permitted her much travel I preferred to amuse myself by mocking my sister’s suitors There was Little Lord Lazyeye Squire Squishlips one I named the Whale That Walks that sort of thing The only one who was even halfway presentable was young Baelor Hightower A pretty lad and my sister was half in love with him until he had the misfortune to fart once in our presence I promptly named him Baelor Breakwind and after that Elia couldn’t look at him without laughing I was a monstrous young fellow someone should have sliced out my vile tongue

Yes Tyrion agreed silently Baelor Hightower was no longer young but he remained Lord Leyton’s heir wealthy handsome and a knight of splendid repute Baelor Brightsmile they called him now Had Elia wed him in place of Rhaegar Targaryen she might be in Oldtown with her children growing tall around her He wondered how many lives had been snuffed out by that fart

Lannisport was the end of our voyage Prince Oberyn went on as Ser Arron Qorgyle helped him into a padded leather tunic and began lacing it up the back Were you aware that our mothers knew each other of old

They had been at court together as girls I seem to recall Companions to Princess Rhaella

Just so It was my belief that the mothers had cooked up this plot between them Squire Squishlips and his ilk and the various pimply young maidens who’d been paraded before me were the almonds before the feast meant only to whet our appetites The main course was to be served at Casterly Rock

Cersei and Jaime

Such a clever dwarf Elia and I were older to be sure Your brother and sister could not have been more than eight or nine Still a difference of five or six years is little enough And there was an empty cabin on our ship a very nice cabin such as might be kept for a person of high birth As if it were intended that we take someone back to Sunspear A young page perhaps Or a companion for Elia Your lady mother meant to betroth Jaime to my sister or Cersei to me Perhaps both

Perhaps said Tyrion but my father—

—ruled the Seven Kingdoms but was ruled at home by his lady wife or so my mother always said Prince Oberyn raised his arms so Lord Dagos Manwoody and the Bastard of Godsgrace could slip a chainmail byrnie down over his head At Oldtown we learned of your mother’s death and the monstrous child she had borne We might have turned back there but my mother chose to sail on I told you of the welcome we found at Casterly Rock

What I did not tell you was that my mother waited as long as was decent and then broached your father about our purpose Years later on her deathbed she told me that Lord Tywin had refused us brusquely His daughter was meant for Prince Rhaegar he informed her And when she asked for Jaime to espouse Elia he offered her you instead

Which offer she took for an outrage

It was Even you can see that surely

Oh surely It all goes back and back Tyrion thought to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance on in our steads Well Prince Rhaegar married Elia of Dorne not Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock So it would seem your mother won that tilt

She thought so Prince Oberyn agreed but your father is not a man to forget such slights He taught that lesson to Lord and Lady Tarbeck once and to the Reynes of Castamere And at King’s Landing he taught it to my sister My helm Dagos Manwoody handed it to him a high golden helm with a copper disk mounted on the brow the sun of Dorne The visor had been removed Tyrion saw Elia and her children have waited long for justice Prince Oberyn pulled on soft red leather gloves and took up his spear again But this day they shall have it

The outer ward had been chosen for the combat Tyrion had to skip and run to keep up with Prince Oberyn’s long strides The snake is eager he thought Let us hope he is venomous as well The day was grey and windy The sun was struggling to break through the clouds but Tyrion could no more have said who was going to win that fight than the one on which his life depended

It looked as though a thousand people had come to see if he would live or die They lined the castle wallwalks and elbowed one another on the steps of keeps and towers They watched from the stable doors from windows and bridges from balconies and roofs And the yard was packed with them so many that the gold cloaks and the knights of the Kingsguard had to shove them back to make enough room for the fight Some had dragged out chairs to watch more comfortably while others perched on barrels We should have done this in the Dragonpit Tyrion thought sourly We could have charged a penny a head and paid for Joffrey’s wedding and funeral both Some of the onlookers even had small children sitting on their shoulders to get a better view They shouted and pointed at the sight of Tyrion

Cersei seemed half a child herself beside Ser Gregor In his armor the Mountain looked bigger than any man had any right to be Beneath a long yellow surcoat bearing the three black dogs of Clegane he wore heavy plate over chainmail dull grey steel dinted and scarred in battle Beneath that would be boiled leather and a layer of quilting A flat-topped greathelm was bolted to his gorget with breaths around the mouth and nose and a narrow slit for vision The crest atop it was a stone fist

If Ser Gregor was suffering from wounds Tyrion could see no sign of it from across the yard He looks as though he was chiseled out of rock standing there His greatsword was planted in the ground before him six feet of scarred metal Ser Gregor’s huge hands clad in gauntlets of lobstered steel clasped the crosshilt to either side of the grip Even Prince Oberyn’s paramour paled at the sight of him You are going to fight that Ellaria Sand said in a hushed voice

I am going to kill that her lover replied carelessly

Tyrion had his own doubts now that they stood on the brink When he looked at Prince Oberyn he found himself wishing he had Bronn defending him    or even better Jaime The Red Viper was lightly armored greaves vambraces gorget spaulder steel codpiece Elsewise Oberyn was clad in supple leather and flowing silks Over his byrnie he wore his scales of gleaming copper but mail and scale together would not give him a quarter the protection of Gregor’s heavy plate With its visor removed the prince’s helm was effectively no better than a half-helm lacking even a nasal His round steel shield was brightly polished and showed the sun-and-spear in red gold yellow gold white gold and copper

Dance around him until he’s so tired he can hardly lift his arm then put him on his back The Red Viper seemed to have the same notion as Bronn But the sellsword had been blunt about the risks of such tactics I hope to seven hells that you know what you are doing snake

A platform had been erected beside the Tower of the Hand halfway between the two champions That was where Lord Tywin sat with his brother Ser Kevan King Tommen was not in evidence for that at least Tyrion was grateful

Lord Tywin glanced briefly at his dwarf son then lifted his hand A dozen trumpeters blew a fanfare to quiet the crowd The High Septon shuffled forward in his tall crystal crown and prayed that the Father Above would help them in this judgment and that the Warrior would lend his strength to the arm of the man whose cause was just That would be me Tyrion almost shouted but they would only laugh and he was sick unto death of laughter

Ser Osmund Kettleblack brought Clegane his shield a massive thing of heavy oak rimmed in black iron As the Mountain slid his left arm through the straps Tyrion saw that the hounds of Clegane had been painted over This morning Ser Gregor bore the seven-pointed star the Andals had brought to Westeros when they crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the First Men and their gods Very pious of you Cersei but I doubt the gods will be impressed

There were fifty yards between them Prince Oberyn advanced quickly Ser Gregor more ominously The ground does not shake when he walks Tyrion told himself That is only my heart fluttering When the two men were ten yards apart the Red Viper stopped and called out Have they told you who I am
