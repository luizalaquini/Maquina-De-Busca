clearly that her mistake had been a fatal one she
accepted her position and waited coldly for the end
The first Saturday after Troys departure she went
to Casterbridge alone a journey she had not before
taken since her marriage On this Saturday Bathsheba
was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of rural
business-men gathered as usual in front ot the market+
house who were as usual gazed upon by the burghers
with feelings that those healthy lives were dearly paid
for by exclusion from possible aldermanship when a
man who had apparently been following her said some
words to another on her left hand Bathshebas ears
were keen as those of any wild animal and she dis+
tinctly heard what the speaker said though her back
was towards him
I am looking for Mrs Troy Is that she there
 Yes  thats the young lady I believe said the
the person addressed
I have some awkward news to break to her Her
husband is drowned
As if endowed with the spirit of prophecy Bathsheba
gasped out No it is not true it cannot be true
Then she said and heard no more The ice of self+
command which had latterly gathered over her was
broken and the currents burst forth again and over
whelmed her A darkness came into her eyes and she
fell
But not to the ground A gloomy man who had
been observing her from under the portico of the old
corn-exchange when she passed through the group
without stepped quickly to her side at the moment of
her exclamation and caught her in his arms as she sank
down

What is it said Boldwood looking up at the
bringer of the big news as he supported her
Her husband was drowned this week while bathing
in Lulwind Cove A coastguardsman found his clothes
and brought them into Budmouth yestersay
Thereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwoods eye
and his face flushed with the suppressed excitement of
an unutterable thought Everybodys glance was now
centred upon him and the unconsious Bathsheba He
lifted her bodily off the ground and smoothed down
the folds of her dress as a child might have taken a
storm-beaten bird and arranged its ruffled plumes and
bore her along the pavement to the Kings Arms Inn
Here he passed with her under the archway into a
private room and by the time he had deposited -- so
lothly -- the precious burden upon a sofa Bathsheba had
opened her eyes Remembering all that had occurred
she murmured I want to go home  
Boldwood left the room He stood for a moment in
the passage to recover his senses The experience had
been too much for his consciousness to keep up with
and now that he had grasped it it had gone again For
those few heavenly golden moments she had been in his
arms What did it matter about her not knowing it She
had been close to his breast  he had been close to hers
He started onward again and sending a woman to
her went out to ascertain all the facts of the case
These appeared to be limited to what he had already
heard He then ordered her horse to be put into the
gig and when all was ready returned to inform her
He found that though still pale and unwell she had in
the meantime sent for the Budmouth man who brought
the tidings and learnt from him all there was to know
Being hardly in a condition to drive home as she
had driven to town Boldwood with every delicacy of
manner and feeling offered to get her a driver or to
give her a seat in his phaeton which was more com+
fortable than her own conveyance These proposals
Bathsheba gently declined and the farmer at once de+
parted
About half-an-hour later she invigorated herself by
an effort and took her seat and the reins as usuai-in

appearance much as if nothing had happened
She went out of the town by a tortuous back street and
drove slowly along unconscious of the road and the
scene The first shades of evening were showing them+
selves when Bathsheba reached home where silently
alighting and leaving the horse in the hands of the boy
she proceeded at once upstairs Liddy met her on the
landing The news had preceded Bathsheba to Weather+
bury by half-an-hour and Liddy looked inquiringly into
her mistresss face Bathsheba had nothing to say
She entered her bedroom and sat by the window and
thought and thought till night enveloped her and the
extreme lines only of her shape were visible Somebody
came to the door knocked and opened it
 Well what is it Liddy   she said
I was thinking there must be something got for you
to wear said Liddy with hesitation
What do you mean 
 Mourning
 No no no said Bathsheba hurriedly
But I suppose there must be something done for
poor --  --
