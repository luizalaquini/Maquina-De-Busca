Hodor Hodor had put a hand over his eyes as well only he was looking the wrong way Hodor

He is in no haste said Meera but he’s making for this village it seems to me

We had best go inside before we’re seen said Jojen

Summer’s near the village Bran objected

Summer will be fine Meera promised It’s only one man on a tired horse

A few fat wet drops began to patter against the stone as they retreated to the floor below That was well timed the rain began to fall in earnest a short time later Even through the thick walls they could hear it lashing against the surface of the lake They sat on the floor in the round empty room amidst gathering gloom The north-facing balcony looked out toward the abandoned village Meera crept out on her belly to peer across the lake and see what had become of the horseman He’s taken shelter in the ruins of the inn she told them when she came back It looks as though he’s making a fire in the hearth

I wish we could have a fire Bran said I’m cold There’s broken furniture down the stairs I saw it We could have Hodor chop it up and get warm

Hodor liked that idea Hodor he said hopefully

Jojen shook his head Fire means smoke Smoke from this tower could be seen a long way off

If there were anyone to see his sister argued

There’s a man in the village

One man

One man would be enough to betray Bran to his enemies if he’s the wrong man We still have half a duck from yesterday We should eat and rest Come morning the man will go on his way and we will do the same

Jojen had his way he always did Meera divided the duck between the four of them She’d caught it in her net the day before as it tried to rise from the marsh where she’d surprised it It wasn’t as tasty cold as it had been hot and crisp from the spit but at least they did not go hungry Bran and Meera shared the breast while Jojen ate the thigh Hodor devoured the wing and leg muttering Hodor and licking the grease off his fingers after every bite It was Bran’s turn to tell a story so he told them about another Brandon Stark the one called Brandon the Shipwright who had sailed off beyond the Sunset Sea

Dusk was settling by the time duck and tale were done and the rain still fell Bran wondered how far Summer had roamed and whether he had caught one of the deer

Grey gloom filled the tower and slowly changed to darkness Hodor grew restless and walked awhile striding round and round the walls and stopping to peer into the privy on every circuit as if he had forgotten what was in there Jojen stood by the north balcony hidden by the shadows looking out at the night and the rain Somewhere to the north a lightning bolt crackled across the sky brightening the inside of the tower for an instant Hodor jumped and made a frightened noise Bran counted to eight waiting for the thunder When it came Hodor shouted Hodor

I hope Summer isn’t scared too Bran thought The dogs in Winterfell’s kennels had always been spooked by thunderstorms just like Hodor I should go see to calm him   

The lightning flashed again and this time the thunder came at six Hodor Hodor yelled again HODOR HODOR He snatched up his sword as if to fight the storm

Jojen said Be quiet Hodor Bran tell him not to shout Can you get the sword away from him Meera

I can try

Hodor hush said Bran Be quiet now No more stupid hodoring Sit down

Hodor He gave the longsword to Meera meekly enough but his face was a mask of confusion

Jojen turned back to the darkness and they all heard him suck in his breath What is it Meera asked

Men in the village

The man we saw before

Other men Armed I saw an axe and spears as well Jojen had never sounded so much like the boy he was I saw them when the lightning flashed moving under the trees

How many

Many and more Too many to count

Mounted

No

Hodor Hodor sounded frightened Hodor Hodor

Bran felt a little scared himself though he didn’t want to say so in front of Meera What if they come out here

They won’t She sat down beside him Why should they

For shelter Jojen’s voice was grim Unless the storm lets up Meera could you go down and bar the door

I couldn’t even close it The wood’s too warped They won’t get past those iron gates though

They might They could break the lock or the hinges Or climb up through the murder hole as we did

Lightning slashed the sky and Hodor whimpered Then a clap of thunder rolled across the lake HODOR he roared clapping his hands over his ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness HODOR HODOR HODOR

NO Bran shouted back NO HODORING

It did no good HOOOODOR moaned Hodor Meera tried to catch him and calm him but he was too strong He flung her aside with no more than a shrug HOOOOOODOOOOOOOR the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again and even Jojen was shouting now shouting at Bran and Meera to shut him up

Be quiet Bran said in a shrill scared voice reaching up uselessly for Hodor’s leg as he crashed past reaching reaching

Hodor staggered and closed his mouth He shook his head slowly from side to side sank back to the floor and sat crosslegged When the thunder boomed he scarcely seemed to hear it The four of them sat in the dark tower scarce daring to breathe

Bran what did you do Meera whispered

Nothing Bran shook his head I don’t know But he did I reached for him the way I reach for Summer He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat It scared him

Something is happening across the lake said Jojen I thought I saw a man pointing at the tower

I won’t be afraid He was the Prince of Winterfell Eddard Stark’s son almost a man grown and a warg too not some little baby boy like Rickon Summer would not be afraid Most like they’re just some Umbers he said Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains or even brothers from the Night’s Watch Were they wearing black cloaks Jojen

By night all cloaks are black Your Grace And the flash came and went too fast for me to tell what they were wearing

Meera was wary If they were black brothers they’d be mounted wouldn’t they

Bran had thought of something else It doesn’t matter he said confidently They couldn’t get out to us even if they wanted Not unless they had a boat or knew about the causeway

The causeway Meera mussed Bran’s hair and kissed him on the forehead Our sweet prince He’s right Jojen they won’t know about the causeway Even if they did they could never find the way across at night in the rain

The night will end though If they stay till morning    Jojen left the rest unsaid After a few moments he said They are feeding the fire the first man started Lightning crashed through the sky and light filled the tower and etched them all in shadow Hodor rocked back and forth humming
