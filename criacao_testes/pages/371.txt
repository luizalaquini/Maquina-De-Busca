Are you utterly ignorant or simply perverse You know as well as I that the Martells have no cause to love us

The Martells have every cause to hate us Nonetheless I expect them to agree Prince Doran’s grievance against House Lannister goes back only a generation but the Dornishmen have warred against Storm’s End and Highgarden for a thousand years and Renly has taken Dorne’s allegiance for granted Myrcella is nine Trystane Martell eleven I have proposed they wed when she reaches her fourteenth year Until such time she would be an honored guest at Sunspear under Prince Doran’s protection

A hostage Cersei said mouth tightening

An honored guest Tyrion insisted and I suspect Martell will treat Myrcella more kindly than Joffrey has treated Sansa Stark I had in mind to send Ser Arys Oakheart with her With a knight of the Kingsguard as her sworn shield no one is like to forget who or what she is

Small good Ser Arys will do her if Doran Martell decides that my daughter’s death would wash out his sister’s

Martell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl particularly one as sweet and innocent as Myrcella So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we’ll keep faith on our side and the terms are too rich to refuse Myrcella is the least part of it I’ve also offered him his sister’s killer a council seat some castles on the Marches…

Too much Cersei paced away from him restless as a lioness skirts swirling You’ve offered too much and without my authority or consent

This is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of If I’d offered less he’d likely spit in my face

Too much Cersei insisted whirling back

What would you have offered him that hole between your legs Tyrion said his own anger flaring

This time he saw the slap coming His head snapped around with a crack Sweet sweet sister he said I promise you that was the last time you will ever strike me

His sister laughed Don’t threaten me little man Do you think Father’s letter keeps you safe A piece of paper Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too for all the good it did him

Eddard Stark did not have the City Watch Tyrion thought nor my clansmen nor the sellswords that Bronn has hired I do Or so he hoped Trusting in Varys in Ser Jacelyn Bywater in Bronn Lord Stark had probably had his delusions as well

Yet he said nothing A wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier Instead he poured a fresh cup of wine How safe do you think Myrcella will be if King’s Landing falls Renly and Stannis will mount her head beside yours

And Cersei began to cry

Tyrion Lannister could not have been more astonished if Aegon the Conqueror himself had burst into the room riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies He had not seen his sister weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock Awkwardly he took a step toward her When your sister cries you were supposed to comfort her… but this was Cersei He reached a tentative hand for her shoulder

Don’t touch me she said wrenching away It should not have hurt yet it did more than any slap Red-faced as angry as she was grief-stricken Cersei struggled for breath Don’t look at me not… not like this… not you

Politely Tyrion turned his back I did not mean to frighten you I promise you nothing will happen to Myrcella

Liar she said behind him I’m not a child to be soothed with empty promises You told me you would free Jaime too Well where is he 

In Riverrun I should imagine Safe and under guard until I find a way to free him

Cersei sniffed I should have been born a man I would have no need of any of you then None of this would have been allowed to happen How could Jaime let himself be captured by that boy And Father I trusted in him fool that I am but where is he now that he’s wanted What is he doing

Making war

From behind the walls of Harrenhal she said scornfully A curious way of fighting It looks suspiciously like hiding

Look again

What else would you call it Father sits in one castle and Robb Stark sits in another and no one does anything

There is sitting and there is sitting Tyrion suggested Each one waits for the other to move but the lion is still poised his tail twitching while the fawn is frozen by fear bowels turned to jelly No matter which way he bounds the lion will have him and he knows it

And you’re quite certain that Father is the lion
