under because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the
stars of the heavens

2724 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number but he finished not
because there fell wrath for it against Israel neither was the number
put in the account of the chronicles of king David

2725 And over the kings treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel and
over the storehouses in the fields in the cities and in the
villages and in the castles was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah 2726
And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground
was Ezri the son of Chelub 2727 And over the vineyards was Shimei
the Ramathite over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars
was Zabdi the Shiphmite 2728 And over the olive trees and the
sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite
and over the cellars of oil was Joash 2729 And over the herds that
fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite and over the herds that were
in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai 2730 Over the camels
also was Obil the Ishmaelite and over the asses was Jehdeiah the
Meronothite 2731 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite All
these were the rulers of the substance which was king Davids

2732 Also Jonathan Davids uncle was a counsellor a wise man and a
scribe and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the kings sons 2733
And Ahithophel was the kings counsellor and Hushai the Archite was
the kings companion 2734 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son
of Benaiah and Abiathar and the general of the kings army was Joab

281 And David assembled all the princes of Israel the princes of the
tribes and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king
by course and the captains over the thousands and captains over the
hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possession of
the king and of his sons with the officers and with the mighty men
and with all the valiant men unto Jerusalem

282 Then David the king stood up upon his feet and said Hear me my
brethren and my people As for me I had in mine heart to build an
house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the
footstool of our God and had made ready for the building 283 But
God said unto me Thou shalt not build an house for my name because
thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood

284 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of
my father to be king over Israel for ever for he hath chosen Judah to
be the ruler and of the house of Judah the house of my father and
among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all
Israel 285 And of all my sons for the LORD hath given me many
sons he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
kingdom of the LORD over Israel

286 And he said unto me Solomon thy son he shall build my house and
my courts for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his
father

287 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant
to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day

288 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
LORD and in the audience of our God keep and seek for all the
commandments of the LORD your God that ye may possess this good land
and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever

289 And thou Solomon my son know thou the God of thy father and
serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the LORD
searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the
thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou
forsake him he will cast thee off for ever

2810 Take heed now for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
for the sanctuary be strong and do it

2811 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and
of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper
chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place
of the mercy seat 2812 And the pattern of all that he had by the
spirit of the courts of the house of the LORD and of all the
chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of God and of
the treasuries of the dedicated things 2813 Also for the courses of
the priests and the Levites and for all the work of the service of
the house of the LORD and for all the vessels of service in the house
of the LORD

2814 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold for all
instruments of all manner of service silver also for all instruments
of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service
2815 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their
lamps of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps
thereof and for the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the
candlestick and also for the lamps thereof according to the use of
every candlestick

2816 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread for
every table and likewise silver for the tables of silver 2817 Also

golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason and likewise
