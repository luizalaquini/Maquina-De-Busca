416 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we
may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need

51 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins 52 Who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them
that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with
infirmity

53 And by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for
himself to offer for sins

54 And no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called
of God as was Aaron

55 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest
but he that said unto him Thou art my Son to day have I begotten
thee

56 As he saith also in another place Thou art a priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedec

57 Who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
save him from death and was heard in that he feared 58 Though he
were a Son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
59 And being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him 510 Called of God an high priest after
the order of Melchisedec

511 Of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered
seeing ye are dull of hearing

512 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that
one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of
God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat

513 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
righteousness for he is a babe

514 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even
those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both
good and evil

61 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us
go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance
from dead works and of faith toward God 62 Of the doctrine of
baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead
and of eternal judgment

63 And this will we do if God permit

64 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have
tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost 65 And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the
world to come 66 If they shall fall away to renew them again unto
repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh
and put him to an open shame

67 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed
receiveth blessing from God 68 But that which beareth thorns and
briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be
burned

69 But beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things
that accompany salvation though we thus speak

610 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered
to the saints and do minister

611 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end 612 That ye be not slothful
but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the
promises

613 For when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by
no greater he sware by himself 614 Saying Surely blessing I will
bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee

615 And so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise

616 For men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife

617 Wherein God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath 618
That by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to
lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to
lay hold upon the hope set before us 619 Which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into
that within the veil 620 Whither the forerunner is for us entered
even Jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec

71 For this Melchisedec king of Salem priest of the most high God
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed
him 72 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by
