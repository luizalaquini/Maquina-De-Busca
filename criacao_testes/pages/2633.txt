according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and
they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the
cities and dwelt in them

2124 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time every
man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence
every man to his inheritance

2125 In those days there was no king in Israel every man did that
which was right in his own eyes




The Book of Ruth


11 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there
was a famine in the land And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to
sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons

12 And the name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife
Naomi and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion Ephrathites of
Bethlehemjudah And they came into the country of Moab and continued
there

13 And Elimelech Naomis husband died and she was left and her two
sons

14 And they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one
was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there
about ten years

15 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them and the woman was
left of her two sons and her husband

16 Then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return
from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how
that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread

17 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her
two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto
the land of Judah

18 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law Go return each to
her mothers house the LORD deal kindly with you as ye have dealt
with the dead and with me

19 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house
of her husband Then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice
and wept

110 And they said unto her Surely we will return with thee unto thy
people

111 And Naomi said Turn again my daughters why will ye go with me
are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your
husbands  112 Turn again my daughters go your way for I am too
old to have an husband If I should say I have hope if I should have
an husband also to night and should also bear sons 113 Would ye
tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from
having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your
sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me

114 And they lifted up their voice and wept again and Orpah kissed
her mother in law but Ruth clave unto her

115 And she said Behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her
people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law

116 And Ruth said Intreat me not to leave thee or to return from
following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where
thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God
my God 117 Where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried
the LORD do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and
me

118 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then
she left speaking unto her

119 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem And it came to
pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved
about them and they said Is this Naomi  120 And she said unto
them Call me not Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty hath dealt
very bitterly with me

121 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty
why then call ye me Naomi seeing the LORD hath testified against me
and the Almighty hath afflicted me  122 So Naomi returned and Ruth
the Moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of
the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of
barley harvest

21 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth
of the family of Elimelech and his name was Boaz

22 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi Let me now go to the
field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find
grace
