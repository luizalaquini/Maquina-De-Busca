1121 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers
and that Joab the captain of the host was dead Hadad said to Pharaoh
Let me depart that I may go to mine own country

1122 Then Pharaoh said unto him But what hast thou lacked with me
that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country And he
answered Nothing howbeit let me go in any wise

1123 And God stirred him up another adversary Rezon the son of
Eliadah which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah 1124 And
he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when David
slew them of Zobah and they went to Damascus and dwelt therein and
reigned in Damascus

1125 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon
beside the mischief that Hadad did and he abhorred Israel and
reigned over Syria

1126 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephrathite of Zereda
Solomons servant whose mothers name was Zeruah a widow woman even
he lifted up his hand against the king

1127 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
king Solomon built Millo and repaired the breaches of the city of
David his father

1128 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over
all the charge of the house of Joseph

1129 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way
and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in
the field 1130 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him
and rent it in twelve pieces 1131 And he said to Jeroboam Take thee
ten pieces for thus saith the LORD the God of Israel Behold I will
rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes
to thee 1132 But he shall have one tribe for my servant Davids
sake and for Jerusalems sake the city which I have chosen out of
all the tribes of Israel 1133 Because that they have forsaken me
and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians Chemosh
the god of the Moabites and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon
and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine
eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did David his
father

1134 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I
will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servants
sake whom I chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes
1135 But I will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give
it unto thee even ten tribes

1136 And unto his son will I give one tribe that David my servant
may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there

1137 And I will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that
thy soul desireth and shalt be king over Israel

1138 And it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to
keep my statutes and my commandments as David my servant did that I
will be with thee and build thee a sure house as I built for David
and will give Israel unto thee

1139 And I will for this afflict the seed of David but not for ever

1140 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam And Jeroboam arose
and fled into Egypt unto Shishak king of Egypt and was in Egypt
until the death of Solomon

1141 And the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and
his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon
1142 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
was forty years

1143 And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city
of David his father and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead

121 And Rehoboam went to Shechem for all Israel were come to Shechem
to make him king

122 And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat who was yet
in Egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king
Solomon and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt 123 That they sent and called
him And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spake
unto Rehoboam saying 124 Thy father made our yoke grievous now
therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy
yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee

125 And he said unto them Depart yet for three days then come again
to me And the people departed

126 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before
Solomon his father while he yet lived and said How do ye advise that
I may answer this people  127 And they spake unto him saying If
thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them
and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy
servants for ever
