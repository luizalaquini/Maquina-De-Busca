Now at last she had him High walls pressed close on either side and ahead was a blank windowless mass of stone Quiet as a shadow she repeated sliding forward light as a feather

When she was three steps away from him the tomcat bolted Left then right he went and right then left went Arya cutting off his escape He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs Quick as a snake she thought Her hands closed around him She hugged him to her chest whirling and laughing aloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin Ever so fast she kissed him right between the eyes and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face The tomcat yowled and spit

What’s he doing to that cat

Startled Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice The tom bounded off in the blink of an eye At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls dressed as pretty as a doll in blue satin Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen Arya thought A septa as large as a draft horse hovered over them and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks Lannister house guards

What were you doing to that cat boy Myrcella asked again sternly To her brother she said He’s a ragged boy isn’t he Look at him She giggled

A ragged dirty smelly boy Tommen agreed

They don’t know me Arya realized They don’t even know I’m a girl Small wonder she was barefoot and dirty her hair tangled from the long run through the castle clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees You don’t wear skirts and silks when you’re catching cats Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee Maybe they wouldn’t recognize her If they did she would never hear the end of it Septa Mordane would be mortified and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame

The old fat septa moved forward Boy how did you come here You have no business in this part of the castle

You can’t keep this sort out one of the red cloaks said Like trying to keep out rats

Who do you belong to boy the septa demanded Answer me What’s wrong with you are you mute

Arya’s voice caught in her throat If she answered Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain

Godwyn bring him here the septa said The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley

Panic gripped her throat like a giant’s hand Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it Calm as still water she mouthed silently

As Godwyn reached for her Arya moved Quick as a snake She leaned to her left letting his fingers brush her arm spinning around him Smooth as summer silk By the time he got himself turned she was sprinting down the alley Swift as a deer The septa was screeching at her Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns bounded to her feet bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard and said Oof spun away from the second guard and then she was past them all running full out

She heard shouts then pounding footsteps closing behind her She dropped and rolled The red cloak went careening past her stumbling Arya sprang back to her feet She saw a window above her high and narrow scarcely more than an arrow slit Arya leapt caught the sill pulled herself up She held her breath as she wriggled through Slippery as an eel Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman she hopped up brushed the rushes off her clothes and was off again out the door and along a long hall down a stair across a hidden courtyard around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar The sounds grew more and more distant behind her

Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost She was in for it now if they had recognized her but she didn’t think they had She’d moved too fast Swift as a deer

She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water Quiet as a shadow she told herself She wondered where she was When they had first come to King’s Landing she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell but in her dreams it had been immense an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her She would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries descending endless circular stairs darting through courtyards or over bridges her shouts echoing unanswered In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood and nowhere could she find a window Sometimes she would hear her father’s voice but always from a long way off and no matter how hard she ran after it it would grow fainter and fainter until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark

It was very dark right now she realized She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home

By the time she had reached eighty-seven the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the blackness Slowly the shapes around her took on form Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth She had lost the count She closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away When she looked again the monsters would be gone Would never have been She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark whispering in her ear Calm as still water she told herself Strong as a bear Fierce as a wolverine She opened her eyes again

The monsters were still there but the fear was gone

Arya got to her feet moving warily The heads were all around her She touched one curious wondering if it was real Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw It felt real enough The bone was smooth beneath her hand cold and hard to the touch She ran her fingers down a tooth black and sharp a dagger made of darkness It made her shiver

It’s dead she said aloud It’s just a skull it can’t hurt me Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom and there was something in that dim cavernous room that did not love her She edged away from the skull and backed into a second larger than the first For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder as if it wanted a bite of her flesh Arya whirled felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin and then she was running Another skull loomed ahead the biggest monster of all but Arya did not even slow She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords dashed through hungry jaws and threw herself against the door

Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood and she yanked at it The door resisted a moment before it slowly began to swing inward with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city She opened the door just far enough to slip through into the hallway beyond

If the room with the monsters had been dark the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells Calm as still water Arya told herself but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through She wiggled her fingers in front of her face felt the air move saw nothing She was blind A water dancer sees with all her senses she reminded herself She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three drank in the quiet reached out with her hands

Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left She followed the wall her hand skimming along the surface taking small gliding steps through the darkness All halls lead somewhere Where there is a way in there is a way out Fear cuts deeper than swords Arya would not be afraid It seemed as if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek Loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin

From somewhere far below her she heard noises The scrape of boots the distant sound of voices A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black well a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps circling down and down dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of And something was coming up out of the darkness out of the bowels of the earth…

Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face Far below she saw the light of a single torch small as the flame of a candle Two men she made out Their shadows writhed against the sides of the well tall as giants She could hear their voices echoing up the shaft
