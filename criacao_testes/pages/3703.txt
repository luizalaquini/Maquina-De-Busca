Do It Louder that time

Bowing the man left the room only to return a few moments later bearing a long knife with a slender sawtooth blade a basin of water a pile of soft cloths and several flasks By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches so he was half sitting against his pillow The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin beneath the mask A slip of the hand here and Cersei will be free of me he thought He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen only inches above his throat

Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister’s braver creatures After a moment he felt cool air on his cheeks There was pain as well but he did his best to ignore that The maester discarded the bandages still crusty with potion Be still now I must wash out the wound His touch was gentle the water warm and soothing The wound Tyrion thought remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes This is like to sting some the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs It did more than sting It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion’s face and twisted a burning poker up his nose His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in his breath but somehow he managed not to scream The maester was clucking like an old hen It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit my lord Still it looks clean good good When we found you down in that cellar among the dead and dying your wounds were filthy One of your ribs was broken doubtless you can feel it the blow of some mace perhaps or a fall it’s hard to say And you took an arrow in the arm there where it joins the shoulder It showed signs of mortification and for a time I feared you might lose the limb but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots and now it seems to be healing clean…

Name Tyrion breathed up at him Name

The maester blinked Why you are Tyrion Lannister my lord Brother to the queen Do you remember the battle Sometimes with head wounds—

Your name His throat was raw and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words

I am Maester Ballabar

Ballabar Tyrion repeated Bring me Looking glass

My lord the maester said I would not counsel… that might be ah unwise as it were… your wound…

Bring it he had to say His mouth was stiff and sore as if a punch had split his lip And drink Wine No poppy

The maester rose flush-faced and hurried off He came back with a flagon of pale amber wine and a small silvered looking glass in an ornate golden frame Sitting on the edge of the bed he poured half a cup of wine and held it to Tyrion’s swollen lips The trickle went down cool though he could hardly taste it More he said when the cup was empty Maester Ballabar poured again By the end of the second cup Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to face his face

He turned over the glass and did not know whether he ought to laugh or cry The gash was long and crooked starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw Three-quarters of his nose was gone and a chunk of his lip Someone had sewn the torn flesh together with catgut and their clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw red half-healed flesh Pretty he croaked flinging the glass aside

He remembered now The bridge of boats Ser Mandon Moore a hand a sword coming at his face If I had not pulled back that cut would have taken off the top of my head Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard because his dead empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions I should never have trusted any of them He’d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s and Ser Osmund later but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle Why else I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of Tyrion touched his face plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers Another gift from my sweet sister

The maester stood beside the bed like a goose about to take flight My lord there there will most like be a scar…

Most like His snort of laughter turned into a wince of pain There would be a scar to be sure Nor was it likely that his nose would be growing back anytime soon It was not as if his face had ever been fit to look at Teach me not to play with axes His grin felt tight Where are we What what place It hurt to talk but Tyrion had been too long in silence

Ah you are in Maegor’s Holdfast my lord A chamber over the Queen’s Ballroom Her Grace wanted you kept close so she might watch over you herself

I’ll wager she did Return me Tyrion commanded Own bed Own chambers Where I will have my own men about me and my own maester too if I find one I can trust

Your own… my lord that would not be possible The King’s Hand has taken up residence in your former chambers

I Am King’s Hand He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking and confused by what he was hearing

Maester Ballabar looked distressed No my lord I… you were wounded near death Your lord father has taken up those duties now Lord Tywin he…

Here

Since the night of the battle Lord Tywin saved us all The smallfolk say it was King Renly’s ghost but wiser men know better It was your father and Lord Tyrell with the Knight of Flowers and Lord Littlefinger They rode through the ashes and took the usurper Stannis in the rear It was a great victory and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help His Grace set the realm to rights gods be praised

Gods be praised Tyrion repeated hollowly His bloody father and bloody Littlefinger and Renly’s ghost I want… Who do I want He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch him Shae Who could he send for who could he trust Varys Bronn Ser Jacelyn …my squire he finished Pod Payne It was Pod on the bridge of boats the lad saved my life

The boy The odd boy

Odd boy Podrick Payne You go Send him

As you will my lord Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited He wondered how long he had been here asleep Cersei would have me sleep forever but I won’t be so obliging

Podrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse My lord He crept close to the bed How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom Tyrion wondered I meant to stay by you but the maester sent me away

Send him away Hear me Talk’s hard Need dreamwine Dreamwine not milk of the poppy Go to Frenken Frenken not Ballabar Watch him make it Bring it here Pod stole a glance at Tyrion’s face and just as quickly averted his eyes Well I cannot blame him for that I want Tyrion went on mine own Guard Bronn Where’s Bronn

They made him a knight

Even frowning hurt Find him Bring him

As you say My lord Bronn

Tyrion seized the lad’s wrist Ser Mandon

The boy flinched I n-never meant to k-k-k-k—

Dead You’re certain Dead

He shuffled his feet sheepish Drowned

Good Say nothing Of him Of me Any of it Nothing

By the time his squire left the last of Tyrion’s strength was gone as well He lay back and closed his eyes Perhaps he would dream of Tysha again I wonder how she’d like my face now he thought bitterly





JON

When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire Jon knew their end was near

It will be good to feel warm again if only for a little while he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree Ghost sat on his haunches watching silent as ever Will he howl for me when I’m dead as Bran’s wolf howled when he fell Jon wondered Will Shaggydog howl far off in Winterfell and Grey Wind and Nymeria wherever they might be

The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger until finally a wisp of smoke appeared Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles As shy as a maid on her wedding night the big ranger said in a soft voice and near as fair Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be

He was not a man you’d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights So far as Jon knew Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding He could not ask Instead he fanned the fire When the blaze was all acrackle he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands and sighed wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter

The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs

At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass But when they’d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers

They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains Each time it seemed a little louder a little closer When night fell the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire’s garron as well as his own and ride east for Mormont with all haste back the way they had come The rest of them would draw off the pursuit Send Jon Ebben had urged He can ride as fast as me

Jon has a different part to play

He is half a boy still

No said Qhorin he is a man of the Night’s Watch
