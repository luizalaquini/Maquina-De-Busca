run so fast my dear he said with a grateful sense of
favours to come Wait a bit till youve found your
breath
 -- It was quite a mistake-aunts telling you I had
a young man already- Bathsheba went on  I havent
a sweetheart at all -- and I never had one and I thought
that as times go with women it was such a pity to send
you away thinking that I had several
Really and truly I am glad to hear that said =
Farmer Oak smiling one of his long special smiles and
blushing with gladness He held out his hand to take
hers which when she had eased her side by pressing
it there was prettily extended upon her bosom to still
her loud-beating heart Directly he seized it she put
it behind her so that it slipped through his fingers like
an eel 
I have a nice snug little farm said Gabriel with
half a degree less assurance than when he had seized
her hand
Yes  you have
A man has advanced me money to begin with but
still it

will soon be paid off and though I am only an
every-day sort of man I have got on a little since I was
a boy Gabriel uttered a little in a tone to-show
her that it was the complacent form of a great deal
He continued   When we be married I am quite sure
I can work twice as hard as I do now
 He went forward and stretched out his arm again
Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which
stood a low stunted holly bush now laden with red
berries Seeing his advance take the form of an attitude
threatening a possible enclosure if not compression of
her person she edged off round the bush
 Why Farmer Oak she said over the top looking
at him with rounded eyes I never said I was going to
marry you
 Well -- that is a tale   said Oak  with dismay  To
run after anybody like this and then say you dont
want him  
What I meant to tell you was only this she said
eagerly and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the
position she had made for herself -- that nobody has
got me yet as a sweetheart instead of my having a
dozen as my aunt said I hate to be thought mens
property in that way though possibly I shall be had
some day Why if Id wanted you I shouldnt have
run after you like this  twould havebeen the forwardest
thing  But there was no harm in hurrying to correct
a piece of false news that had been told you
Oh no -- no harm at all But there is such a thing
as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls+
ively and Oak added with a more appreciative sense
of all the circumstances --  Well I am not quite certain
it was no harm
Indeed I hadnt time to think before starting
whether I wanted to marry or not for youd have been
gone over the hill
 Come said Gabriel freshening again  think a
minute or two Ill wait a while Miss Everdene Will
you marry me Do Bathsheba I love you far more
than common
Ill try to think she observed rather more timor+
ously  if I can think out of doors my mind spreads
away so
But you can give a guess
P 79
Then give me time Bathsheba looked thought+
fully into the distance away from the direction in which
Gabriel stood
I can make you happy said he to the back of her
head across the bush You shallo have as piano in a
year or two -- -farmers wives are getting to have pianos
now --  and Ill practise up the flute right well to play
with you in the evenings
 Yes  I should like that
And have one of those little ten-pound gigs for
market -- and nice flowers and birds -- cocks and hens
I mean because they be useful continued Gabriel
feeling balanced between poetry and practicality
I should like it very much
And a frame for cucumbers -- like a gentlman and
lady
Yes
And when the wedding was over wed have it put
in the newspaper list of marriages
 Dearly I should like that  
And the babies in the births -- every man jack of
em And at home by the fire whenever you look up
there I shall be -- and whenever I look up there will
be you
Wait wait and dont be improper 
Her countenance fell and she was silent awhile
He regarded the red berries between them over and
over again to such an extent that holly seemed in
his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
marriage Bathsheba decisively turned to him
No tis no use she said I dont want to marry
you
