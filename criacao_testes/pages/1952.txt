aspiration quite clearly
It doesnt always occur though for example you will hear little
aspiration when a fricative like
ul
s
precedes the stop in the
same syllable as in spot scot  The aspiration is a distinguishing
feature between white spot and the rather unlikely Whites pot
It tends to increase as the emphasis on the syllable increases
and this in an example of a prosodic feature influencing segmental
characteristics  Finally at the end of the segment
the aspiration em if any em will turn to voicing

What has been described applies to
ul
all
unvoiced stops
What distinguishes one from another
The tiny fricative burst will be different because the noise is produced
at different places in the vocal tract em at the lips for
ul
p
tongue and front of palate for
ul
t
and tongue and back of palate for
ul
k
The most important difference however is the formant motion illuminated
by the last vestiges of voicing at closure and by both aspiration and the
onset of voicing at opening
Each stop has target formant values which although
they cannot be heard during the stopped portion for there is no
sound there do affect the transitions in and out
An added complexity is that the target positions themselves vary to some
extent depending on the adjacent segments
If the stop is heavily aspirated the vocal posture will have almost
attained that for the following vowel before voicing begins but
the formant transitions will be perceived because they affect
the sound quality of aspiration
pp
The voiced stops
ul
b d
and
ul
g
are quite similar to their unvoiced analogues
ul
p t
and
ul
k
What distinguishes them from each other are the formant transitions to
target positions heard during closure and opening
They are distinguished from their unvoiced counterparts by the fact
that more voicing is present  it lingers on longer at closure
and begins earlier on opening  Thus little or no aspiration appears
during the opening phase  If an unvoiced stop is uttered in a context
where aspiration is suppressed as in spot it is almost identical to the
corresponding voiced stop sbot  Luckily no words in English require
us to make a distinction in such contexts
Voicing sometimes pervades the entire stopped portion of a voiced stop
especially when it is surrounded by other voiced segments
When saying a word like baby slowly you can choose whether or not to
prolong voicing throughout the second
ul
b
If you do creating what is
called a voice bar in spectrograms
the sound escapes through the cheeks for
the lips are closed em try doing it for a very long time and your cheeks
will fill up with air
This severely attenuates high-frequency components and can
be simulated with a weak first formant at a low resonant frequency
