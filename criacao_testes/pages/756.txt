Him too It was the mud Please don’t call me that

Why not Grenn sounded honestly puzzled It’s a good name and you came by it fairly

Pyp always teased Grenn about being thick as a castle wall so Sam explained patiently It’s just a different way of calling me a coward he said standing on his left leg and wriggling back into his muddy boot They’re mocking me the same way they mock Bedwyck by calling him ‘Giant’

He’s not a giant though said Grenn and Paul was never small Well maybe when he was a babe at the breast but not after You did slay the Other though so it’s not the same

I just… I never… I was scared

No more than me It’s only Pyp who says I’m too dumb to be frightened I get as frightened as anyone Grenn bent to scoop up a split log and tossed it into the fire I used to be scared of Jon whenever I had to fight him He was so quick and he fought like he meant to kill me The green damp wood sat in the flames smoking before it took fire I never said though Sometimes I think everyone is just pretending to be brave and none of us really are Maybe pretending is how you get brave I don’t know Let them call you Slayer who cares

You never liked Ser Alliser to call you Aurochs

He was saying I was big and stupid Grenn scratched at his beard If Pyp wanted to call me Aurochs though he could Or you or Jon An aurochs is a fierce strong beast so that’s not so bad and I am big and getting bigger Wouldn’t you rather be Sam the Slayer than Ser Piggy

Why can’t I just be Samwell Tarly He sat down heavily on a wet log that Grenn had yet to split It was the dragonglass that slew it Not me the dragonglass

He had told them He had told them all Some of them didn’t believe him he knew Dirk had shown Sam his dirk and said I got iron what do I want with glass Black Bernarr and the three Garths made it plain that they doubted his whole story and Rolley of Sisterton came right out and said More like you stabbed some rustling bushes and it turned out to be Small Paul taking a shit so you came up with a lie

But Dywen listened and Dolorous Edd and they made Sam and Grenn tell the Lord Commander Mormont frowned all through the tale and asked pointed questions but he was too cautious a man to shun any possible advantage He asked Sam for all the dragonglass in his pack though that was little enough Whenever Sam thought of the cache Jon had found buried beneath the Fist it made him want to cry There’d been dagger blades and spearheads and two or three hundred arrowheads at least Jon had made daggers for himself Sam and Lord Commander Mormont and he’d given Sam a spearhead an old broken horn and some arrowheads Grenn had taken a handful of arrowheads as well but that was all

So now all they had was Mormont’s dagger and the one Sam had given Grenn plus nineteen arrows and a tall hardwood spear with a black dragonglass head The sentries passed the spear along from watch to watch while Mormont had divided the arrows among his best bowmen Muttering Bill Garth Greyfeather Ronnel Harclay Sweet Donnel Hill and Alan of Rosby had three apiece and Ulmer had four But even if they made every shaft tell they’d soon be down to fire arrows like all the rest They had loosed hundreds of fire arrows on the Fist yet still the wights kept coming

It will not be enough Sam thought Craster’s sloping palisades of mud and melting snow would hardly slow the wights who’d climbed the much steeper slopes of the Fist to swarm over the ringwall And instead of three hundred brothers drawn up in disciplined ranks to meet them the wights would find forty-one ragged survivors nine too badly hurt to fight Forty-four had come straggling into Craster’s out of the storm out of the sixty-odd who’d cut their way free of the Fist but three of those had died of their wounds and Bannen would soon make four

Do you think the wights are gone Sam asked Grenn Why don’t they come finish us

They only come when it’s cold

Yes said Sam but is it the cold that brings the wights or the wights that bring the cold

Who cares Grenn’s axe sent wood chips flying They come together that’s what matters Hey now that we know that dragonglass kills them maybe they won’t come at all Maybe they’re frightened of us now

Sam wished he could believe that but it seemed to him that when you were dead fear had no more meaning than pain or love or duty He wrapped his hands around his legs sweating under his layers of wool and leather and fur The dragonglass dagger had melted the pale thing in the woods true… but Grenn was talking like it would do the same to the wights We don’t know that he thought We don’t know anything really I wish Jon was here He liked Grenn but he couldn’t talk to him the same way Jon wouldn’t call me Slayer I know And I could talk to him about Gilly’s baby Jon had ridden off with Qhorin Halfhand though and they’d had no word of him since He had a dragonglass dagger too but did he think to use it Is he lying dead and frozen in some ravine… or worse is he dead and walking

He could not understand why the gods would want to take Jon Snow and Bannen and leave him craven and clumsy as he was He should have died on the Fist where he’d pissed himself three times and lost his sword besides And he would have died in the woods if Small Paul had not come along to carry him I wish it was all a dream Then I could wake up How flne that would be to wake back on the Fist of the First Men with all his brothers still around him even Jon and Ghost Or even better to wake in Castle Black behind the Wall and go to the common room for a bowl of Three-Finger Hobb’s thick cream of wheat with a big spoon of butter melting in the middle and a dollop of honey besides Just the thought of it made his empty stomach rumble

Snow

Sam glanced up at the sound Lord Commander Mormont’s raven was circling the fire beating the air with wide black wings

Snow the bird cawed Snow snow

Wherever the raven went Mormont soon followed The Lord Commander emerged from beneath the trees mounted on his garron between old Dywen and the fox-faced ranger Ronnel Harclay who’d been raised to Thoren Smallwood’s place The spearmen at the gate shouted a challenge and the Old Bear returned a gruff Who in seven hells do you think goes there Did the Others take your eyes He rode between the gateposts one bearing a ram’s skull and the other the skull of a bear then reined up raised a fist and whistled The raven came flapping down at his call

My lord Sam heard Ronnel Harclay say we have only twenty-two mounts and I doubt half will reach the Wall

I know that Mormont grumbled We must go all the same Craster’s made that plain He glanced to the west where a bank of dark clouds hid the sun The gods gave us a respite but for how long Mormont swung down from the saddle jolting his raven back into the air He saw Sam then and bellowed Tarly

Me Sam got awkwardly to his feet

Me The raven landed on the old man’s head Me
