sons and his sons sons even four generations

The Book of Psalms


11 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful

12 But his delight is in the law of the LORD and in his law doth he
meditate day and night

13 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not
wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper

14 The ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away

15 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners
in the congregation of the righteous

16 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the
ungodly shall perish



21 Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing

22 The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel
together against the LORD and against his anointed saying

23 Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from
us

24 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the LORD shall have
them in derision

25 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his
sore displeasure

26 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion

27 I will declare the decree the LORD hath said unto me Thou art my
Son this day have I begotten thee

28 Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession

29 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potters vessel

210 Be wise now therefore O ye kings be instructed ye judges of
the earth

211 Serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling

212 Kiss the Son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when
his wrath is kindled but a little Blessed are all they that put their
trust in him



31 Lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that
rise up against me

32 Many there be which say of my soul There is no help for him in
God

Selah

33 But thou O LORD art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up
of mine head

34 I cried unto the LORD with my voice and he heard me out of his
holy hill Selah

35 I laid me down and slept I awaked for the LORD sustained me

36 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set
themselves against me round about

37 Arise O LORD save me O my God for thou hast smitten all mine
enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the
ungodly

38 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD thy blessing is upon thy
people

Selah



41 Hear me when I call O God of my righteousness thou hast enlarged
