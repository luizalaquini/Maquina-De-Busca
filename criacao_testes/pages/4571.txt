On a rock above them the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury

The bird hates you Jon Snow said Ygritte And well he might He was a man before you killed him

I did not know said Jon truthfully trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass You told me Mance would take me

And he will Ygritte said

Mance is not here said Rattleshirt Ragwyle gut him

The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said If the crow would join the free folk let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him

I’ll do whatever you ask The words came hard but Jon said them

Rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed Then kill the Halfhand bastard

As if he could said Qhorin Turn Snow and die

And then Qhorin’s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon’s hand and sent him staggering backward You must not balk whatever is asked of you He shifted to a two-hand grip quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease Back and forth they went black cloaks swirling the youth’s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin’s left-hand cuts The Halfhand’s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once raining down from one side and then the other driving him where he would keeping him off balance Already he could feel his arms growing numb

Even when Ghost’s teeth closed savagely around the ranger’s calf somehow Qhorin kept his feet But in that instant as he twisted the opening was there Jon planted and pivoted The ranger was leaning away and for an instant it seemed that Jon’s slash had not touched him Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man’s throat bright as a ruby necklace and the blood gushed out of him and Qhorin Halfhand fell

Ghost’s muzzle was dripping red but only the point of the bastard blade was stained the last half inch Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him The light was already fading in Qhorin’s eyes    sharp he said lifting his maimed fingers Then his hand fell and he was gone

He knew he thought numbly He knew what they would ask of me He thought of Samwell Tarly then of Grenn and Dolorous Edd of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black Had he lost them all as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb Who was he now What was he

Get him up Rough hands dragged him to his feet Jon did not resist Do you have a name

Ygritte answered for him His name is Jon Snow He is Eddard Stark’s blood of Winterfell

Ragwyle laughed Who would have thought it Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling’s byblow

Gut him That was Rattleshirt still ahorse The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm screeching

He yielded Ygritte reminded them

Aye and slew his brother said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm

Rattleshirt rode closer bones clattering The wolf did his work for him It were foully done The Halfhand’s death was mine

We all saw how eager you were to take it mocked Ragwyle

He is a warg said the Lord of Bones and a crow I like him not

A warg he may be Ygritte said but that has never frightened us Others shouted agreement Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt’s stare was malignant but he yielded grudgingly These are a free folk indeed thought Jon

They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he’d fallen on a pyre made of pine needles brush and broken branches Some of the wood was still green and it burned slow and smoky sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky Afterward Rattleshirt claimed some charred bones while the others threw dice for the ranger’s gear Ygritte won his cloak

Will we return by the Skirling Pass Jon asked her He did not know if he could face those heights again or if his garron could survive a second crossing

No she said There’s nothing behind us The look she gave him was sad By now Mance is well down the Milkwater marching on your Wall





BRAN

The ashes fell like a soft grey snow

He padded over dry needles and brown leaves to the edge of the wood where the pines grew thin Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat so strong he began to slaver

Yet as one smell drew them onward others warned them back He sniffed at the drifting smoke Men many men many horses and fire fire fire No smell was more dangerous not even the hard cold smell of iron the stuff of man-claws and hardskin The smoke and ash clouded his eyes and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame He bared his teeth but then the snake was gone Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars

All through the night the fires crackled and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror Howls shuddered through the night the howls of the man-pack wails of fear and wild shouts laughter and screams No beast was as noisy as man He pricked up his ears and listened and his brother growled at every sound They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes and embers through the sky In time the flames began to dwindle and then they were gone The sun rose grey and smoky that morning

Only then did he leave the trees stalking slow across the fields His brother ran with him drawn to the smell of blood and death They padded silent through the dens the men had built of wood and grass and mud Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed others stood as they had before Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near The wild dogs slunk away before them

Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell His brother circled round him then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse until his brother rolled on his back in submission tail tucked low One more bite at his upturned throat then he fed and let his brother feed and licked the blood off his black fur

The dark place was pulling at him by then the house of whispers where all men were blind He could feel its cold fingers on him The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose He struggled against the pull He did not like the darkness He was wolf He was hunter and stalker and slayer and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods running free beneath a starry sky He sat on his haunches raised his head and howled I will not go he cried I am wolf I will not go Yet even so the darkness thickened until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears so he could not see or smell or hear or run and the grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black   

Bran a voice was whispering softly Bran come back Come back now Bran Bran   

He closed his third eye and opened the other two the old two the blind two In the dark place all men were blind But someone was holding him He could feel arms around him the warmth of a body snuggled close He could hear Hodor singing Hodor hodor hodor quietly to himself

Bran It was Meera’s voice You were thrashing making terrible noises What did you see

Winterfell His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth One day when I come back I won’t know how to talk anymore It was Winterfell It was all on fire There were horse smells and steel and blood They killed everyone Meera

He felt her hand on his face stroking back his hair You’re all sweaty she said Do you need a drink

A drink he agreed She held a skin to his lips and Bran swallowed so fast the water ran out of the corner of his mouth He was always weak and thirsty when he came back And hungry too He remembered the dying horse the taste of blood in his mouth the smell of burnt flesh in the morning air How long

Three days said Jojen The boy had come up softfoot or perhaps he had been there all along in this blind black world Bran could not have said We were afraid for you

I was with Summer Bran said

Too long You’ll starve yourself Meera dribbled a little water down your throat and we smeared honey on your mouth but it is not enough

I ate said Bran We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him The cat had been tan-and-brown only half the size of the direwolves but fierce He remembered the musky smell of him and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak

The wolf ate Jojen said Not you Take care Bran Remember who you are

He remembered who he was all too well Bran the boy Bran the broken Better Bran the beastling Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams his wolf dreams Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened He could reach Summer whenever he wanted and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon Though maybe he had only dreamed that He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to pull him back now Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position I have to tell Osha what I saw Is she here Where did she go

The wildling woman herself gave answer Nowhere m’lord I’ve had my fill o’ blundering in the black He heard the scrape of a heel on stone turned his head toward the sound but saw nothing He thought he could smell her but he wasn’t sure All of them stank alike and he did not have Summer’s nose to tell one from the other Last night I pissed on a king’s foot Osha went on Might be it was morning who can say I was sleeping but now I’m not They all slept a lot not only Bran There was nothing else to do Sleep and eat and sleep again and sometimes talk a little    but not too much and only in whispers just to be safe Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all but there was no way to quiet Rickon or to stop Hodor from muttering Hodor hodor hodor endlessly to himself

Osha Bran said I saw Winterfell burning Off to his left he could hear the soft sound of Rickon’s breathing
