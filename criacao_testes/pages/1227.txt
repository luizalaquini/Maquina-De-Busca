She thought of him again the next morning when lack of sleep made her yawn Weasel Weese purred next time I see that mouth droop open I’ll pull out your tongue and feed it to my bitch He twisted her ear between his fingers to make certain she’d heard and told her to get back to those steps he wanted them clean down to the third landing by nightfall

As she worked Arya thought about the people she wanted dead She pretended she could see their faces on the steps and scrubbed harder to wipe them away The Starks were at war with the Lannisters and she was a Stark so she should kill as many Lannisters as she could that was what you did in wars But she didn’t think she should trust Jaqen I should kill them myself Whenever her father had condemned a man to death he did the deed himself with Ice his greatsword If you would take a man’s life you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words she’d heard him tell Robb and Jon once

The next day she avoided Jaqen H’ghar and the day after that It was not hard She was very small and Harrenhal was very large full of places where a mouse could hide

And then Ser Gregor returned earlier than expected driving a herd of goats this time in place of a herd of prisoners She heard he’d lost four men in one of Lord Beric’s night raids but those Arya hated returned unscathed and took up residence on the second floor of the Wailing Tower Weese saw that they were well supplied with drink They always have a good thirst that lot he grumbled Weasel go up and ask if they’ve got any clothes that need mending I’ll have the women see to it

Arya ran up her well-scrubbed steps No one paid her any mind when she entered Chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand telling one of his funny stories She dared not interrupt unless she wanted a bloody lip

After the Hand’s tourney it were before the war come Chiswyck was saying We were on our ways back west seven of us with Ser Gregor Raff was with me and young Joss Stilwood he’d squired for Ser in the lists Well we come on this pisswater river running high on account there’d been rains No way to ford but there’s an alehouse near so there we repair Ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall and you should see the man’s pig eyes shine at the sight o’ silver So he’s fetching us ale him and his daughter and poor thin stuff it is no more’n brown piss which don’t make me any happier nor Ser neither And all the time this brewer’s saying how glad he is to have us custom being slow on account o’ them rains The fool won’t shut his yap not him though Ser is saying not a word just brooding on the Knight o’ Pansies and that bugger’s trick he played You can see how tight his mouth sits so me and the other lads we know better’n to say a squeak to him but this brewer he’s got to talk he even asks how m’lord fared in the jousting Ser just gave him this look Chiswyck cackled quaffed his ale and wiped the foam away with the back of his hand Meanwhile this daughter of his has been fetching and pouring a fat little thing eighteen or so—

Thirteen more like Raff the Sweetling drawled

Well be that as it may she’s not much to look at but Eggon’s been drinking and gets to touching her and might be I did a little touching meself and Raff’s telling young Stilwood that he ought t’ drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man giving the lad courage as it were Finally Joss reaches up under her skirt and she shrieks and drops her flagon and goes running off to the kitchen Well it would have ended right there only what does the old fool do but he goes to Ser and asks him to make us leave the girl alone him being an anointed knight and all such

Ser Gregor he wasn’t paying no mind to none of our fun but now he looks you know how he does and he commands that the girl be brought before him Now the old man has to drag her out of the kitchen and no one to blame but hisself Ser looks her over and says ‘So this is the whore you’re so concerned for’ and this besotted old fool says ‘My Layna’s no whore ser’ right to Gregor’s face Ser he never blinks just says ‘She is now’ tosses the old man another silver rips the dress off the wench and takes her right there on the table in front of her da her flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises The look on the old man’s face I laughed so hard ale was coming out me nose Then this boy hears the noise the son I figure and comes rushing up from the cellar so Raff has to stick a dirk in his belly By then Ser’s done so he goes back to his drinking and we all have a turn Tobbot you know how he is he flops her over and goes in the back way The girl was done fighting by the time I had her maybe she’d decided she liked it after all though to tell the truth I wouldn’t have minded a little wiggling And now here’s the best bit… when it’s all done Ser tells the old man that he wants his change The girl wasn’t worth a silver he says… and damned if that old man didn’t fetch a fistful of coppers beg m’lord’s pardon and thank him for the custom

The men all roared none louder than Chiswyck himself who laughed so hard at his own story that snot dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard Arya stood in the shadows of the stairwell and watched him She crept back down to the cellars without saying a word When Weese found that she hadn’t asked about the clothes he yanked down her breeches and caned her until blood ran down her thighs but Arya closed her eyes and thought of all the sayings Syrio had taught her so she scarcely felt it

Two nights later he sent her to the Barracks Hall to serve at table She was carrying a flagon of wine and pouring when she glimpsed Jaqen H’ghar at his trencher across the aisle Chewing her lip Arya glanced around warily to make certain Weese was not in sight Fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself

She took a step and another and with each she felt less a mouse She worked her way down the bench filling wine cups Rorge sat to Jaqen’s right deep drunk but he took no note of her Arya leaned close and whispered Chiswyck right in Jaqen’s ear The Lorathi gave no sign that he had heard

When her flagon was empty Arya hurried down to the cellars to refill it from the cask and quickly returned to her pouring No one had died of thirst while she was gone nor even noted her brief absence

Nothing happened the next day nor the day after but on the third day Arya went to the kitchens with Weese to fetch their dinner One of the Mountain’s men fell off a wallwalk last night and broke his fool neck she heard Weese tell a cook

Drunk the woman asked

No more’n usual Some are saying it was Harren’s ghost flung him down He snorted to show what he thought of such notions

It wasn’t Harren Arya wanted to say it was me She had killed Chiswyck with a whisper and she would kill two more before she was through I’m the ghost in Harrenhal she thought And that night there was one less name to hate





CATELYN

The meeting place was a grassy sward dotted with pale grey mushrooms and the raw stumps of felled trees

We are the first my lady Hallis Mollen said as they reined up amidst the stumps alone between the armies The direwolf banner of House Stark flapped and fluttered atop the lance he bore Catelyn could not see the sea from here but she could feel how close it was The smell of salt was heavy on the wind gusting from the east

Stannis Baratheon’s foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults Catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood and whether Ned had rested here when he led his host south to lift the last siege of Storm’s End He had won a great victory that day all the greater for being bloodless

Gods grant that I shall do the same Catelyn prayed Her own liege men thought she was mad even to come This is no fight of ours my lady Ser Wendel Manderly had said I know the king would not wish his mother to put herself at risk

We are all at risk she told him perhaps too sharply Do you think I wish to be here ser I belong at Riverrun with my dying father at Winterfell with my sons Robb sent me south to speak for him and speak for him I shall It would be no easy thing to forge a peace between these brothers Catelyn knew yet for the good of the realm it must be tried

Across rain-sodden flelds and stony ridges she could see the great castle of Storm’s End rearing up against the sky its back to the unseen sea Beneath that mass of pale grey stone the encircling army of Lord Stannis Baratheon looked as small and insignificant as mice with banners

The songs said that Storm’s End had been raised in ancient days by Durran the first Storm King who had won the love of the fair Elenei daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind On the night of their wedding Elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortal’s love and thus doomed herself to a mortal’s death and her grieving parents had unleashed their wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down Durran’s hold His friends and brothers and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea but Elenei sheltered Durran within her arms so he took no harm and when the dawn came at last he declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild

Five more castles he built each larger and stronger than the last only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay driving great walls of water before them His lords pleaded with him to build inland his priests told him he must placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea even his smallfolk begged him to relent Durran would have none of it A seventh castle he raised most massive of all Some said the children of the forest helped him build it shaping the stones with magic others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder No matter how the tale was told the end was the same Though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it the seventh castle stood defiant and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there together until the end of their days

Gods do not forget and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea Yet Storm’s End endured through centuries and tens of centuries a castle like no other Its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high unbroken by arrow slit or postern everywhere rounded curving smooth its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter That wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest and near eighty on the seaward face a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble Within that mighty bulwark the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and wave Of towers there was but one a colossal drum tower windowless where it faced the sea so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord’s dwelling all in one crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm

My lady Hal Mollen called Two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath the castle and were coming toward them at a slow walk That will be King Stannis

No doubt Catelyn watched them come Stannis it must be yet that is not the Baratheon banner It was a bright yellow not the rich gold of Renly’s standards and the device it bore was red though she could not make out its shape

Renly would be last to arrive He had told her as much when she set out He did not propose to mount his horse until he saw his brother well on his way The first to arrive must wait on the other and Renly would do no waiting It is a sort of game kings play she told herself Well she was no king so she need not play it Catelyn was practiced at waiting

As he neared she saw that Stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the shape of flames His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz and a great square-cut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore Otherwise his dress was plain studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet worn boots breeches of brown roughspun The device on his sun-yellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire The crowned stag was there yes… shrunken and enclosed within the heart Even more curious was his standard bearer—a woman garbed all in reds face shadowed within the deep hood of her scarlet cloak A red priestess Catelyn thought wondering The sect was numerous and powerful in the Free Cities and the distant east but there were few in the Seven Kingdoms

Lady Stark Stannis Baratheon said with chill courtesy as he reined up He inclined his head balder than she remembered

Lord Stannis she returned

Beneath the tight-trimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard yet he did not hector her about titles For that she was duly grateful I had not thought to find you at Storm’s End

I had not thought to be here

His deepset eyes regarded her uncomfortably This was not a man made for easy courtesies I am sorry for your lord’s death he said though Eddard Stark was no friend to me

He was never your enemy my lord When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you prisoned in that castle starving it was Eddard Stark who broke the siege

At my brother’s command not for love of me Stannis answered Lord Eddard did his duty I will not deny it Did I ever do less I should have been Robert’s Hand

That was your brother’s will Ned never wanted it

Yet he took it That which should have been mine Still I give you my word you shall have justice for his murder

How they loved to promise heads these men who would be king Your brother promised me the same But if truth be told I would sooner have my daughters back and leave justice to the gods Cersei still holds my Sansa and of Arya there has been no word since the day of Robert’s death

If your children are found when I take the city they shall be sent to you Alive or dead his tone implied

And when shall that be Lord Stannis King’s Landing is close to your Dragonstone but I find you here instead

You are frank Lady Stark Very well I’ll answer you frankly To take the city I need the power of these southron lords I see across the field My brother has them I must needs take them from him

Men give their allegiance where they will my lord These lords swore fealty to Robert and House Baratheon If you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel—

I have no quarrel with Renly should he prove dutiful I am his elder and his king I want only what is mine by rights Renly owes me loyalty and obedience I mean to have it From him and from these other lords Stannis studied her face And what cause brings you to this field my lady Has House Stark cast its lot with my brother is that the way of it

This one will never bend she thought yet she must try nonetheless Too much was at stake My son reigns as King in the North by the will of our lords and people He bends the knee to no man but holds out the hand of friendship to all

Kings have no friends Stannis said bluntly only subjects and enemies
