Only you Ser Alliser Tyrion said This time the laughter round the table had a nervous uncertain quality to it

Thorne’s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together

Why asked Tyrion The crabs are here

The remark brought more guffaws from the others Ser Alliser stood up his mouth a tight line Come and make your japes with steel in your hand

Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand Why I have steel in my hand Ser Alliser although it appears to be a crab fork Shall we duel He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne’s chest with the tiny fork Roars of laughter filled the tower room Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander’s mouth as he began to gasp and choke Even his raven joined in cawing loudly from above the window Duel Duel Duel

Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt

Mormont was still gasping for breath Tyrion pounded him on the back To the victor goes the spoils he called out I claim Thorne’s share of the crabs

Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself You are a wicked man to provoke our Ser Alliser so he scolded

Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine If a man paints a target on his chest he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser

Not so objected the Lord Steward Bowen Marsh a man as round and red as a pomegranate You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains

Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names I’ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well he said Chip the ice off your eyes my good lords Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables not drilling your young warriors

The Watch has no shortage of stableboys Lord Mormont grumbled That seems to be all they send us these days Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers Ser Alliser is an anointed knight one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander He fought bravely at King’s Landing

On the wrong side Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly I ought to know I was there on the battlements beside him Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice Take the black or see our heads on spikes before evenfall No offense intended Tyrion

None taken Ser Jaremy My father is very fond of spiked heads especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion And a face as noble as yours well no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King’s Gate I think you would have looked very striking up there

Thank you Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile

Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true Tyrion You do mock us and our noble purpose here

Tyrion shrugged We all need to be mocked from time to time Lord Mormont lest we start to take ourselves too seriously More wine please He held out his cup

As Rykker filled it for him Bowen Marsh said You have a great thirst for a small man

Oh I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table He spoke softly yet the high officers of the Night’s Watch all fell quiet the better to hear what the ancient had to say I think he is a giant come among us here at the end of the world

Tyrion answered gently I’ve been called many things my lord but giant is seldom one of them

Nonetheless Maester Aemon said as his clouded milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion’s face I think it is true

For once Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words He could only bow his head politely and say You are too kind Maester Aemon

The blind man smiled He was a tiny thing wrinkled and hairless shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester’s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat I have been called many things my lord he said but kind is seldom one of them This time Tyrion himself led the laughter

Much later when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes The kingsroad can be perilous this far north the Lord Commander told him as they drank

I have Jyck and Morrec Tyrion said and Yoren is riding south again

Yoren is only one man The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument Three men should be sufficient

If you insist my lord Tyrion said You might send young Snow He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers
