It is particularly important with speech however because an unexpected
or unwanted
prompt is quite distracting and it is not so easy to ignore it as it is
with a visual display
Furthermore speech messages usually take longer to present
than displayed ones so that the user is distracted for more time
rh Information units
Lengthy computer voice responses are inappropriate for conveying information
because attention wanders if one is not actively involved in the conversation
A sequential exchange of terse messages each designed to dispense one
small unit of information forces the user to take a meaningful part in the
dialogue
It has other advantages too allowing a higher degree of input-dependent
branching and permitting rapid recovery from errors

The following example from the Acidosis program an audio response system
designed to help physicians to diagnose acidosis is a good example
of what

to do

The use of extraneous noises for example a chime heralds an error message
and a beep dah beep-beep requests data input in the form
digitpointdigitdigit
was thought necessary in the Acidosis program to keep the user awake
and help him with the format of the interaction
Rather than a long monologue like this
it seems much better to design a sequential interchange of terse messages
so that the caller can be guided into a state where he can rectify his error
For example
LB
nf
ne11
nr x0 wCOMPUTER
nr x1 wCALLER
CALLERhnx0u-nx1u 600
COMPUTER Entry out of range
CALLERhnx0u-nx1u 600  persists
COMPUTER The minimum acceptable pH value is 66
CALLERhnx0u-nx1u 903
COMPUTER The maximum acceptable pH value is 80

This dialogue allows a rapid exit from the error situation in the likely
event that the entry has simply been mis-typed
If the error persists the caller is given just one piece of information
at a time and forced to continue to play an active role in the interaction
rh Input timeouts
In general input timeouts are dangerous because they introduce apparent
acausality in the system seen by the user
A case has been reported where a user became highly agitated and refused
to go near the terminal again after her first timed-out prompt
She had been quietly thinking what to do and the terminal suddenly
interjecting and making its
own suggestions was just too much for her Gaines and Facey 1975

However voice response systems lack the satisfying visual feedback
of end-of-line on termination of an entry
Hence a timed-out reminder is appropriate if a delay occurs after some
characters have been entered
This requires the operating system to support a character-by-character mode
of input rather than the usual line-by-line mode
rh Repeat requests
Any voice response system must support a universal repeat last utterance
command because old output does not remain visible
A fairly sophisticated facility is desirable as repeat requests are
very frequent in practice
They may be due to a simple inability to understand a response
to forgetting what was said or to distraction of attention em which is
especially common with office terminals
pp
In the telephone enquiry service two distinct commands were employed
one to repeat the last utterance in case of misrecognition
and the other to summarize the current state of the interaction
in case of distraction
For the former it is essential to avoid simply regenerating an utterance
identical with the last
Some variation of intonation and rhythm is needed to prevent an annoying
stereotyped response
A second consecutive repeat request should trigger a paraphrased reply
An error recovery sequence could be used which presented the misunderstood
information in a different way with more interaction but experience
indicates that this is of minor importance especially if information units
are kept small anyway
To summarize the current state of the interaction in response to the second
type of repeat command necessitates the system maintaining a model of
the user
