 Well Ill say this for Pennyways added Coggan
that whenever he do really make up his mind to do a
noble thing in the shape of a good action as I could
see by his face he did to-night afore sitting down hes
generally able to carry it out Yes Im proud to say
neighbours that hes stole nothing at all
Well -- tis an honest deed and we thank ye for it
Pennyways said Joseph to which opinion the remainder
of the company subscribed unanimously
  At this time of departure when nothing more was
visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still
chink of light between the shutters a passionate scene
was in eourse of enactment there
Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone Her
cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
the very seriousness of her position  but her eye was
bright with the excitement of a triumph -- though it was
a triumph which had rather been contemplated than
desired
She was standing behind a low arm-chair from which
she had just risen and he was kneeling in it -- inclining
himself over its back towards her and holding her hand
in both his own His body moved restlessly and it was
with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness
This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from
a man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component
was in its distressing incongruity a pain to her which
quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the
proof that she was idolized
 I will try to love you she was saying in a trembling
voice quite unlike her usual self-confidence  And if I
can believe in any way that I shall make you a good
wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you But Mr
Boldwood hesitation on so high a matter is honourable
in any woman and I dont want to give a solemn
promise to-night I would rather ask you to wait a few
weeks till I can see my situation better
But you have every reason to believe that then --  -- 
I have every reason to hope that at the end of the
five or

six weeks between this time and harvest that
you say you are going to be away from home I shall be
able to promise to be your wife she said firmly But
remember this distinctly I dont promise yet
It is enough I dont ask more I can wait on
those dear words And now Miss Everdene good+
night
 Good-night she said graciously -- almost tenderly
and Boldwood withdrew with a serene smile
Bathsheba knew more of him now  he had entirely
bared his heart before her even until he had almost
worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without
the feathers that make it grand She had been awe+
struck at her past temerity and was struggling to make
amends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved
the penalty she was schooling herself to pay To have
brought all this about her ears was terrible but after a
while the situation was not without a fearful joy The
facility with which even the most timid woman some+
times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is
amalgamated with a little triumph is marvellous

THE SAME NIGHT -- THE FIR PLANTATION
AMONG the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had
voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the
services of a bailiff was the particular one of looking
round the homestead before going to bed to see that
all was right and safe for the night Gabriel had almost
constantly preceded her in this tour every evening
watching her affairs as carefully as any specially appointed
officer of surveillance could have done but this tender
devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistress
and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly
received Women are never tired of bewailing mans
fickleness in love but they only seem to snub his con+
stancy
As watching is best done invisibly she usually carried
a dark lantern in her hand and every now and then
turned on the light to examine nooks and corners with
the coolness of a metropolitan policeman This cool+
ness may have owed its existence not so much to her
fearlessness of expected danger as to her freedom from
the suspicion of any her worst anticipated discovery
being that a horse might not be well bedded the fowls
not all in or a door not closed
This night the buildings were inspected as usual
and she went round to the farm paddock Here the
only sounds disturbing the stillness were steady munch+
ings of many mouths and stentorian breathings from all
but invisible noses ending in snores and puffs like the
blowing of bellows slowly Then the munching would
recommence when the lively imagination might assist
the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils shaped
as caverns and very clammy and humid on their sur+
faces not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got
used to them the mouths beneath having a great
partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathshebas
apparel which came within
