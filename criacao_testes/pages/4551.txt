That night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to Winterfell The hall rang with music and laughter though the cold winds were rising outside At first it was all wine and roast meat and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time    until he noticed that the room was growing darker The music did not seem so jolly then he heard discords and strange silences and notes that hung in the air bleeding Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead

King Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly and Lord Eddard was headless beside him Corpses lined the benches below grey-brown flesh sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast worms crawling in and out of the holes that were their eyes He knew them every one Jory Cassel and Fat Tom Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse and all the others who had ridden south to King’s Landing never to return Mikken and Chayle sat together one dripping blood and the other water Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table The miller’s wife was there as well and Farlen even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved Bran’s life

But there were others with faces he had never known in life faces he had seen only in stone The slim sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna Her brother Brandon stood beside her and their father Lord Rickard just behind Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows pale shades with long grim faces The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife And then the tall doors opened with a crash and a freezing gale blew down the hall and Robb came walking out of the night Grey Wind stalked beside eyes burning and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds

Theon woke with a scream startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room When his guards burst in with drawn swords he ordered them to bring him the maester By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy a cup of wine had steadied Theon’s hands and he was feeling ashamed of his panic A dream he muttered that was all it was It meant nothing

Nothing Luwin agreed solemnly He left a sleeping draught but Theon poured it down the privy shaft the moment he was gone Luwin was a man as well as a maester and the man had no love for him He wants me to sleep yes    to sleep and never wake He’d like that as much as Asha would

He sent for Kyra kicked shut the door climbed on top of her and fucked the wench with a fury he’d never known was in him By the time he finished she was sobbing her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks Theon shoved her from the bed and threw her a blanket Get out

Yet even then he could not sleep

Come dawn he dressed and went outside to walk along the outer walls A brisk autumn wind was swirling through the battlements It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes He watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees On his left he could see tower tops above the inner wall their roofs gilded by the rising sun The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green Ned Stark’s tree he thought and Stark’s wood Stark’s castle Stark’s sword Stark’s gods This is their place not mine I am a Greyjoy of Pyke born to paint a kraken on my shield and sail the great salt sea I should have gone with Asha

On their iron spikes atop the gatehouse the heads waited

Theon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on his cloak with small ghostly hands The miller’s boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon alike in size and coloring and once Reek had flayed the skin from their faces and dipped their heads in tar it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh People were such fools If we’d said they were rams’ heads they would have seen horns





SANSA

They had been singing in the sept all morning since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses the clank of steel and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music In the sept they sing for the Mother’s mercy but on the walls it’s the Warrior they pray to and all in silence She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god But if there is only one whose prayers will be heard

Ser Meryn Trant held the blood bay for Joffrey to mount Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate with matching golden lions on their heads The pale sunlight flashed off the golds and reds every time Joff moved Bright shining and empty Sansa thought

The Imp was mounted on a red stallion armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in his father’s clothes But there was nothing childish about the battle-axe slung below his shield Ser Mandon Moore rode at his side white steel icy bright When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way Lady Sansa he called from the saddle surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor’s

She has my lord but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off I mean to visit the sept as well to pray

I won’t ask for whom His mouth twisted oddly if that was a smile it was the queerest she had ever seen This day may change all For you as well as for House Lannister I ought to have sent you off with Tommen now that I think on it Still you should be safe enough in Maegor’s so long as—

Sansa The boyish shout rang across the yard Joffrey had seen her Sansa here

He calls me as if he were calling a dog she thought

His Grace has need of you Tyrion Lannister observed We’ll talk again after the battle if the gods permit

Sansa threaded her way through a file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned her closer It will be battle soon everyone says so

May the gods have mercy on us all

My uncle’s the one who will need mercy but I won’t give him any Joffrey drew his sword The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart set between a lion’s jaws Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade My new blade Hearteater

He’d owned a sword named Lion’s Tooth once Sansa remembered Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river I hope Stannis does the same with this one It is beautifully wrought Your Grace

Bless my steel with a kiss He extended the blade down to her Go on kiss it

He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy Sansa touched her lips to the metal thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey The gesture seemed to please him though He sheathed the blade with a flourish You’ll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle’s blood

Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle Ser Meryn Ser Mandon and Ser Osmund Kettleblack Will you lead your knights into battle Sansa asked hoping

I would but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river I’ll command the Three Whores though I’m going to see to the traitors myself The prospect made Joff smile His plump pink lips always made him look pouty Sansa had liked that once but now it made her sick

They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest she said recklessly Though he’s older than Your Grace to be sure A man grown

That made him frown I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle I’ll gut him with Hearteater you’ll see He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left the gold cloaks following four abreast The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear The guards saw them off with shouts and cheers When the last was gone a sudden stillness settled over the yard like the hush before a storm

Through the quiet the singing pulled at her Sansa turned toward the sept Two stableboys followed and one of the guards whose watch was ended Others fell in behind them

Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded nor so brightly lit great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows and candles burned on every side their little flames twinkling like stars The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s swam in light but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face    for what was Stannis Baratheon if not the Stranger come to judge them Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn lighting a candle at each altar and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washerwoman and a boy no older than Rickon dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight’s son The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus the boy’s small and soft but it was good to have someone to hold on to The air was hot and heavy smelling of incense and sweat crystal-kissed and candle-bright it made her dizzy to breathe it

She knew the hymn her mother had taught it to her once a long time ago in Winterfell She joined her voice to theirs

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

Across the city thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill and they would be singing too their voices swelling out over the city across the river and up into the sky Surely the gods must hear us she thought

Sansa knew most of the hymns and followed along on those she did not know as best she could She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives with serving girls and soldiers cooks and falconers knights and knaves squires and spit boys and nursing mothers She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without sang with all the city She sang for mercy for the living and the dead alike for Bran and Rickon and Robb for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow away off on the Wall She sang for her mother and her father for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully for her friend Jeyne Poole for old drunken King Robert for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today and for the children and the wives who would mourn them and finally toward the end she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound He is no true knight but he saved me all the same she told the Mother Save him if you can and gentle the rage inside him

But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king Sansa got to her feet The aisles were jammed with people She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword and shield the Warrior to give him courage the Father to defend him in his need Let his sword break and his shield shatter Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors let his courage fail him and every man desert him

A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements but otherwise the castle seemed empty Sansa stopped and listened Away off she could hear the sounds of battle The singing almost drowned them out but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear the deep moan of warhorns the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones the splashes and splinterings the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts    and beneath it all the cries of dying men

It was another sort of song a terrible song Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe At the foot of the drawbridge she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge but Lollys clung to her maid sobbing I don’t want to I don’t want to I don’t want to

The battle is begun Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice

I don’t want to I don’t want to

There was no way Sansa could avoid them She greeted them courteously May I be of help
