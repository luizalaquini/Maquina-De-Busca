M-my lord—

Inside

Red-faced Sam pushed through the deerhides back into the gloom of the hall Mormont followed How great a fool are you the old man said within his voice choked and angry Even if Craster gave us the child he’d be dead before we reached the Wall We need a newborn babe to care for near as much as we need more snow Do you have milk to feed him in those big teats of yours Or did you mean to take the mother too

She wants to come Sam said She begged me…

Mormont raised a hand I will hear no more of this Tarly You’ve been told and told to stay well away from Craster’s wives

She’s his daughter Sam said feebly

Go see to Bannen Now Before you make me wroth

Yes my lord Sam hurried off quivering

But when he reached the fire it was only to find Giant pulling a fur cloak up over Bannen’s head He said he was cold the small man said I hope he’s gone someplace warm I do

His wound… said Sam

Bugger his wound Dirk prodded the corpse with his foot His foot was hurt I knew a man back in my village lost a foot He lived to nine-and-forty

The cold said Sam He was never warm

He was never fed said Dirk Not proper That bastard Craster starved him dead

Sam looked around anxiously but Craster had not returned to the hall If he had things might have grown ugly The wildling hated bastards though the rangers said he was baseborn himself fathered on a wildling woman by some long-dead crow

Craster’s got his own to feed said Giant All these women He’s given us what he can

Don’t you bloody believe it The day we leave he’ll tap a keg o’ mead and sit down to feast on ham and honey And laugh at us out starving in the snow He’s a bloody wildling is all he is There’s none o’ them friends of the Watch He kicked at Bannen’s corpse Ask him if you don’t believe me

They burned the ranger’s corpse at sunset in the fire that Grenn had been feeding earlier that day Tim Stone and Garth of Oldtown carried out the naked corpse and swung him twice between them before heaving him into the flames The surviving brothers divided up his clothes his weapons his armor and everything else he owned At Castle Black the Night’s Watch buried its dead with all due ceremony They were not at Castle Black though And bones do not come back as wights

His name was Bannen Lord Commander Mormont said as the flames took him He was a brave man a good ranger He came to us from… where did he come from

Down White Harbor way someone called out

Mormont nodded He came to us from White Harbor and never failed in his duty He kept his vows as best he could rode far fought fiercely We shall never see his like again

And now his watch is ended the black brothers said in solemn chant

And now his watch is ended Mormont echoed

Ended cried his raven Ended

Sam was red-eyed and sick from the smoke When he looked at the fire he thought he saw Bannen sitting up his hands coiling into fists as if to fight off the flames that were consuming him but it was only for an instant before the swirling smoke hid all The worst thing was the smell though If it had been a foul unpleasant smell he might have stood it but his burning brother smelled so much like roast pork that Sam’s mouth began to water and that was so horrible that as soon as the bird squawked Ended he ran behind the hall to throw up in the ditch

He was there on his knees in the mud when Dolorous Edd came up Digging for worms Sam Or are you just sick

Sick said Sam weakly wiping his mouth with the back of his hand The smell…

Never knew Bannen could smell so good Edd’s tone was as morose as ever I had half a mind to carve a slice off him If we had some applesauce I might have done it Pork’s always best with applesauce I find Edd undid his laces and pulled out his cock You best not die Sam or I fear I might succumb There’s bound to be more crackling on you than Bannen ever had and I never could resist a bit of crackling He sighed as his piss arced out yellow and steaming We ride at first light did you hear Sun or snow the Old Bear tells me
