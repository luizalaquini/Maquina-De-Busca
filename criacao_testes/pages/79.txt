She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath Doreah built a fire outside the tent while Irri and Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub—another bride gift—from the packhorses and carried water from the pool When the bath was steaming Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her

Have you ever seen a dragon she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea Perhaps some were still living there in realms strange and wild

Dragons are gone Khaleesi Irri said

Dead agreed Jhiqui Long and long ago

Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago during the reign of Aegon III who was called the Dragonbane That did not seem so long ago to Dany Everywhere she said disappointed Even in the east Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back but Dany had always heard that the east was different It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti that spellsingers warlocks and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night Why shouldn’t there be dragons too

No dragon Irri said Brave men kill them for dragon terrible evil beasts It is known

It is known agreed Jhiqui

A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father’s khalasar Doreah was older almost twenty Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys

Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head curious The moon

He told me the moon was an egg Khaleesi the Lysene girl said Once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat A thousand thousand dragons poured forth and drank the fire of the sun That is why dragons breathe flame One day the other moon will kiss the sun too and then it will crack and the dragons will return

The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed You are foolish strawhead slave Irri said Moon is no egg Moon is god woman wife of sun It is known

It is known Jhiqui agreed

Dany’s skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon While Doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver she thought about the moon and eggs and dragons

Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down Doreah stay and eat with me Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away The Lysene girl had hair the color of honey and eyes like the summer sky

She lowered those eyes when they were alone You honor me Khaleesi she said but it was no honor only service Long after the moon had risen they sat together talking

That night when Khal Drogo came Dany was waiting for him He stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground This night we must go outside my lord she told him for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life must be done beneath the open sky

Khal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight the bells in his hair tinkling softly A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass and it was there that Dany drew him down When he tried to turn her over she put a hand on his chest No she said This night I would look on your face

There is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him heard the soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told her to do It was nothing to her Was she not khaleesi His were the only eyes that mattered and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver and when the moment of his pleasure came Khal Drogo called out her name

They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany’s stomach with her fingers and said Khaleesi you are with child

I know Dany told her

It was her fourteenth name day





BRAN

In the yard below Rickon ran with the wolves

Bran watched from his window seat Wherever the boy went Grey Wind was there first loping ahead to cut him off until Rickon saw him screamed in delight and went pelting off in another direction Shaggydog ran at his heels spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close His fur had darkened until he was all black and his eyes were green fire Bran’s Summer came last He was silver and smoke with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see Smaller than Grey Wind and more wary Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter He could hear his brother’s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs

His eyes stung He wanted to be down there laughing and running Angry at the thought Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall His eighth name day had come and gone He was almost a man grown now too old to cry
