Joff’s only a boy

A boy who wants to be part of this battle and for once he’s showing some sense I don’t intend to put him in the thick of the fighting but he needs to be seen Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother’s skirts

He’s thirteen Tyrion

Remember Jaime at thirteen If you want the boy to be his father’s son let him play the part Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy and he’ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him at all times If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling I’ll have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once

He had thought that might reassure her but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes Will the city fall

No But if it does pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father to march to our relief

You’ve lied to me before Tyrion

Always with good reason sweet sister I want amity between us as much as you do I’ve decided to release Lord Gyles He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture You can have Ser Boros Blount back as well

The queen’s mouth tightened Ser Boros can rot at Rosby she said but Tommen—

—stays where he is He’s safer under Lord Jacelyn’s protection than he would ever have been with Lord Gyles

Serving men cleared away the swan hardly touched Cersei beckoned for the sweet I hope you like blackberry tarts

I love all sorts of tarts

Oh I’ve known that a long while Do you know why Varys is so dangerous

Are we playing at riddles now No

He doesn’t have a cock

Neither do you And don’t you just hate that Cersei

Perhaps I’m dangerous too You on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man That worm between your legs does half your thinking

Tyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers He did not like his sister’s smile Yes and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave

Are you unwell brother She leaned forward giving him a good look at the top of her breasts Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered

Flustered Tyrion glanced at the door He thought he’d heard something outside He was beginning to regret coming here alone You’ve never shown much interest in my cock before

It’s not your cock that interests me so much as what you stick it in I don’t depend on the eunuch for everything as you do I have my own ways of finding out things… especially things that people don’t want me to know

What are you trying to say

Only this—I have your little whore

Tyrion reached for his wine cup buying a moment to gather his thoughts I thought men were more to your taste

You’re such a droll little fellow Tell me have you married this one yet When he gave her no answer she laughed and said Father will be ever so relieved

His belly felt as if it were full of eels How had she found Shae Had Varys betrayed him Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed

A Lannister always pays his debts she said You’ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King’s Landing You sold Myrcella stole Tommen and now you plot to have Joff killed You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen
