He’s a king now too Cley confided He says Queen Cersei bedded her brother so Joffrey is a bastard

Joffrey the Illborn one of the Cerwyn knights growled Small wonder he’s faithless with the Kingslayer for a father

Aye said another the gods hate incest Look how they brought down the Targaryens

For a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe A giant hand was crushing his chest He felt as though he was falling and clutched desperately at Dancer’s reins

His terror must have shown on his face Bran Cley Cerwyn said Are you unwell It’s only another king

Robb will beat him too He turned Dancer’s head toward the stables oblivious to the puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave him His blood was roaring in his ears and had he not been strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen

That night Bran prayed to his father’s gods for dreamless sleep If the gods heard they mocked his hopes for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream

Fly or die cried the three-eyed crow as it pecked at him He wept and pleaded but the crow had no pity It put out his left eye and then his right and when he was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull He screamed until he was certain his lungs must burst The pain was an axe splitting his head apart but when the crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain Bran could see again What he saw made him gasp in fear He was clinging to a tower miles high and his fingers were slipping nails scrabbling at the stone his legs dragging him down stupid useless dead legs Help me he cried A golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up The things I do for love he murmured softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air





TYRION

I do not sleep as I did when I was younger Grand Maester Pycelle told him by way of apology for the dawn meeting I would sooner be up though the world be dark than lie restless abed fretting on tasks undone he said—though his heavy-lidded eyes made him look half-asleep as he said it

In the airy chambers beneath the rookery his girl served them boiled eggs stewed plums and porridge while Pycelle served the pontifications In these sad times when so many hunger I think it only fitting to keep my table spare

Commendable Tyrion admitted breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly of the Grand Maester’s bald spotted head I take a different view If there is food I eat it in case there is none on the morrow He smiled Tell me are your ravens early risers as well

Pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest To be sure Shall I send for quill and ink after we have eaten

No need Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends Send your girl away so we can talk

Leave us child Pycelle commanded The serving girl hurried from the room These letters now…

For the eyes of Doran Martell Prince of Dorne Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite It wanted salt One letter in two copies Send your swiftest birds The matter is of great import

I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast

Dispatch them now Stewed plums will keep The realm may not Lord Renly is leading his host up the roseroad and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone

Pycelle blinked If my lord prefers—

He does

I am here to serve The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly It was a heavy thing a dozen maester’s collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals

Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums—overcooked and watery to his taste—before the sound of wings prompted him to rise He spied the raven dark in the dawn sky and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room

The maester’s medicines made an impressive display dozens of pots sealed with wax hundreds of stoppered vials as many milkglass bottles countless jars of dried herbs each container neatly labeled in Pycelle’s precise hand An orderly mind Tyrion reflected and indeed once you puzzled out the arrangement it was easy to see that every potion had its place And such interesting things He noted sweetsleep and nightshade milk of the poppy the tears of Lys powdered greycap wolfsbane and demon’s dance basilisk venom blindeye widow’s blood…

Standing on his toes and straining upward he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf When he read the label he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve

He was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping down the stairs It is done my lord The old man seated himself A matter like this… best done promptly indeed indeed… of great import you say
