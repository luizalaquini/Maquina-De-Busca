Dutifully the fat boy plucked his final arrow from the earth notched it to his longbow drew and released He did it quickly without squinting along the shaft painstakingly as he had the first two times The arrow struck the charcoal outline low in the chest and hung quivering I hit him Ser Piggy sounded shocked Grenn did you see Edd look I hit him

Put it between his ribs I’d say said Grenn

Did I kill him the fat boy wanted to know

Tollett shrugged Might have punctured a lung if he had a lung Most trees don’t as a rule He took the bow from Sam’s hand I’ve seen worse shots though Aye and made a few

Ser Piggy was beaming To look at him you’d think he’d actually done something But when he saw Chett and the dogs his smile curled up and died squeaking

You hit a tree Chett said Let’s see how you shoot when it’s Mance Rayder’s lads They won’t stand there with their arms out and their leaves rustling oh no They’ll come right at you screaming in your face and I bet you’ll piss those breeches One o’ them will plant his axe right between those little pig eyes The last thing you’ll hear will be the thunk it makes when it bites into your skull

The fat boy was shaking Dolorous Edd put a hand on his shoulder Brother he said solemnly just because it happened that way for you doesn’t mean Samwell will suffer the same

What are you talking about Tollett

The axe that split your skull Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate them

The big lout Grenn laughed and even Samwell Tarly managed a weak little smile Chett kicked the nearest dog yanked on their leashes and started up the hill Smile all you want Ser Piggy We’ll see who laughs tonight He only wished he had time to kill Tollett as well Gloomy horsefaced fool that’s what he is

The climb was steep even on this side of the Fist which had the gentlest slope Partway up the dogs started barking and pulling at him figuring that they’d get fed soon He gave them a taste of his boot instead and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that snapped at him Once they were tied up he went to report The prints were there like Giant said but the dogs wouldn’t track he told Mormont in front of his big black tent Down by the river like that could be old prints

A pity Lord Commander Mormont had a bald head and a great shaggy grey beard and sounded as tired as he looked We might all have been better for a bit of fresh meat The raven on his shoulder bobbed its head and echoed Meat Meat Meat

We could cook the bloody dogs Chett thought but he kept his mouth shut until the Old Bear sent him on his way And that’s the last time I’ll need to bow my head to that one he thought to himself with satisfaction It seemed to him that it was growing even colder which he would have swom Wasn’t possible The dogs huddled together miserably in the hard frozen mud and Chett was half tempted to crawl in with them Instead he wrapped a black wool scarf round the lower part of his face leaving a slit for his mouth between the winds It was warmer if he kept moving he found so he made a slow circuit of the perimeter with a wad of sourleaf sharing a chew or two with the black brothers on guard and hearing what they had to say None of the men on the day watch were part of his scheme even so he figured it was good to have some sense of what they were thinking

Mostly what they were thinking was that it was bloody cold

The wind was rising as the shadows lengthened It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall I hate that sound little Giant said It sounds like a babe in the brush wailing away for milk

When he finished the circuit and returned to the dogs he found Lark waiting for him The officers are in the Old Bear’s tent again talking something fierce

That’s what they do said Chett They’re highborn all but Blane they get drunk on words instead of wine

Lark sidled closer Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird he warned glancing about to make certain no one was close Now he’s asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing

It’s a raven said Chett It eats corpses

Lark grinned His might be

Or yours It seemed to Chett that they needed the big man more than they needed Lark Stop fretting about Small Paul You do your part he’ll do his

Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid himself of the Sisterman and sat down to edge his sword It was bloody hard work with his gloves on but he wasn’t about to take them off Cold as it was any fool that touched steel with a bare hand was going to lose a patch of skin

The dogs whimpered when the sun went down He gave them water and curses Half a night more and you can find your own feast By then he could smell supper

Dywen was holding forth at the cookfire as Chett got his heel of hardbread and a bowl of bean and bacon soup from Hake the cook The wood’s too silent the old forester was saying No frogs near that river no owls in the dark I never heard no deader wood than this

Them teeth of yours sound pretty dead said Hake

Dywen clacked his wooden teeth No wolves neither There was before but no more Where’d they go you figure

Someplace warm said Chett

Of the dozen odd brothers who sat by the fire four were his He gave each one a hard squinty look as he ate to see if any showed signs of breaking Dirk seemed calm enough sitting silent and sharpening his blade the way he did every night And Sweet Donnel Hill was all easy japes He had white teeth and fat red lips and yellow locks that he wore in an artful tumble about his shoulders and he claimed to be the bastard of some Lannister Maybe he was at that Chett had no use for pretty boys nor for bastards neither but Sweet Donnel seemed like to hold his own

He was less certain about the forester the brothers called Sawwood more for his snoring than for anything to do with trees Just now he looked so restless he might never snore again And Maslyn was worse Chett could see sweat trickling down his face despite the frigid wind The beads of moisture sparkled in the firelight like so many little wet jewels Maslyn wasn’t eating neither only staring at his soup as if the smell of it was about to make him sick I’ll need to watch that one Chett thought

Assemble The shout came suddenly from a dozen throats and quickly spread to every part of the hilltop camp Men of the Night’s Watch Assemble at the central fire

Frowning Chett finished his soup and followed the rest

The Old Bear stood before the fire with Smallwood Locke Wythers and Blane ranged behind him in a row Mormont wore a cloak of thick black fur and his raven perched upon his shoulder preening its black feathers This can’t be good Chett squeezed between Brown Bernarr and some Shadow Tower men When everyone was gathered save for the watchers in the woods and the guards on the ringwall Mormont cleared his throat and spat The spittle was frozen before it hit the ground Brothers he said men of the Night’s Watch

Men his raven screamed Men Men

The wildlings are on the march following the course of the Milkwater down out of the mountains Thoren believes their van will be upon us ten days hence Their most seasoned raiders will be with Harma Dogshead in that van The rest will likely form a rearguard or ride in close company with Mance Rayder himself Elsewhere their fighters will be spread thin along the line of march They have oxen mules horses… But few enough Most will be afoot and ill-armed and untrained Such weapons as they carry are more like to be stone and bone than steel They are burdened with women children herds of sheep and goats and all their worldly goods besides In short though they are numerous they are vulnerable… And they do not know that we are here Or so we must pray

They know thought Chett You bloody old pus bag they know certain as sunrise Qhorin Halfhand hasn’t come back has he Nor Jarman Buckwell If any of them got caught you know damned well the wildlings will have wrung a song or two out of them by now

Smallwood stepped forward Mance Rayder means to break the Wall and bring red war to the Seven Kingdoms Well that’s a game two can play On the morrow we’ll bring the war to him

We ride at dawn with all our strength the Old Bear said as a murmur went through the assembly We will ride north and loop around to the west Harma’s van will be well past the Fist by the time we turn The foothills of the Frostfangs are full of narrow winding valleys made for ambush Their line of march will stretch for many miles We shall fall on them in several places at once and make them swear we were three thousand not three hundred

We’ll hit hard and be away before their horsemen can form up to face us Thoren Smallwood said If they pursue we’ll lead them a merry chase then wheel and hit again farther down the column We’ll burn their wagons scatter their herds and slay as many as we can Mance Rayder himself if we find him If they break and return to their hovels we’ve won If not we’ll harry them all the way to the Wall and see to it that they leave a trail of corpses to mark their progress

There are thousands someone called from behind Chett

We’ll die That was Maslyn’s voice green with fear

Die screamed Mormont’s raven flapping its black wings Die die die

Many of us the Old Bear said Mayhaps even all of us But as another Lord Commander said a thousand years ago that is why they dress us in black Remember your words brothers For we are the swords in the darkness the watchers on the walls…

The fire that burns against the cold Ser Mallador Locke drew his longsword

The light that brings the dawn others answered and more swords were pulled from scabbards

Then all of them were drawing and it was near three hundred upraised swords and as many voices crying The horn that wakes the sleepers The shield that guards the realms of men Chett had no choice but to join his voice to the others The air was misty with their breath and firelight glinted off the steel He was pleased to see Lark and Softfoot and Sweet Donnel Hill joining in as if they were as big fools as the rest That was good No sense to draw attention when their hour was so close

When the shouting died away once more he heard the sound of the wind picking at the ringwall The flames swirled and shivered as if they too were cold and in the sudden quiet the Old Bear’s raven cawed loudly and once again said Die

Clever bird thought Chett as the officers dismissed them warning everyone to get a good meal and a long rest tonight Chett crawled under his furs near the dogs his head full of things that could go wrong What if that bloody oath gave one of his a change of heart Or Small Paul forgot and tried to kill Mormont during the second watch in place of the third Or Maslyn lost his courage or someone turned informer or…

He found himself listening to the night The wind did sound like a wailing child and from time to time he could hear men’s voices a horse’s whinny a log spitting in the fire But nothing else So quiet

He could see Bessa’s face floating before him It wasn’t the knife I wanted to put in you he wanted to tell her I picked you flowers wild roses and tansy and goldencups it took me all morning His heart was thumping like a drum so loud he feared it might wake the camp Ice caked his beard all around his mouth Where did that come from with Bessa Whenever he’d thought of her before it had only been to remember the way she’d looked dying What was wrong with him He could hardly breathe Had he gone to sleep He got to his knees and something wet and cold touched his nose Chett looked up

Snow was falling
