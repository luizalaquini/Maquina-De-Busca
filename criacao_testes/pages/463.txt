Unthinking Davos raised his maimed hand to the pouch at his throat and felt the fingerbones within Luck

The king saw the motion Are they still there Onion Knight You have not lost them

No

Why do you keep them I have often wondered

They remind me of what I was Where I came from They remind me of your justice my liege

It was justice Stannis said A good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad act the good Each should have its own reward You were a hero and a smuggler He glanced behind at Lord Florent and the others rainbow knights and turncloaks who were following at a distance These pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that Good men and true will fight for Joffrey wrongly believing him the true king A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark But these lords who flocked to my brother’s banners knew him for a usurper They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory and I have marked them for what they are Pardoned them yes Forgiven But not forgotten He fell silent for a moment brooding on his plans for justice And then abruptly he said What do the smallfolk say of Renly’s death

They grieve Your brother was well loved

Fools love a fool grumbled Stannis but I grieve for him as well For the boy he was not the man he grew to be He was silent for a time and then he said How did the commons take the news of Cersei’s incest

While we were among them they shouted for King Stannis I cannot speak for what they said once we had sailed

So you do not think they believed

When I was smuggling I learned that some men believe everything and some nothing We met both sorts And there is another tale being spread as well—

Yes Stannis bit off the word Selyse has given me horns and tied a fool’s bells to the end of each My daughter fathered by a halfwit jester A tale as vile as it is absurd Renly threw it in my teeth when we met to parley You would need to be as mad as Patchface to believe such a thing

That may be so my liege… but whether they believe the story or no they delight to tell it In many places it had come before them poisoning the well for their own true tale

Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine but I offer them pure cold water and they squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes Stannis ground his teeth If someone said I had magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert likely they would believe that as well

You cannot stop them talking my liege Davos said but when you take your vengeance on your brothers’ true killers the realm will know such tales for lies

Stannis only seemed to half hear him I have no doubt that Cersei had a hand in Robert’s death I will have justice for him Aye and for Ned Stark and Jon Arryn as well

And for Renly The words were out before Davos could stop to consider them

For a long time the king did not speak Then very softly he said I dream of it sometimes Of Renly’s dying A green tent candles a woman screaming And blood Stannis looked down at his hands I was still abed when he died Your Devan will tell you He tried to wake me Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting fretting I should have been ahorse armored I knew Renly would attack at break of day Devan says I thrashed and cried out but what does it matter It was a dream I was in my tent when Renly died and when I woke my hands were clean

Ser Davos Seaworth could feel his phantom fingertips start to itch Something is wrong here the onetime smuggler thought Yet he nodded and said I see

Renly offered me a peach At our parley Mocked me defied me threatened me and offered me a peach I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own Was that his purpose to make me show fear Or was it one of his pointless jests When he spoke of how sweet the peach was did his words have some hidden meaning The king gave a shake of his head like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck Only Renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit He brought his doom on himself with his treason but I did love him Davos I know that now I swear I will go to my grave thinking of my brother’s peach

By then they were in amongst the camp riding past the ordered rows of tents the blowing banners and the stacks of shields and spears The stink of horse dung was heavy in the air mingled with the woodsmoke and the smell of cooking meat Stannis reined up long enough to bark a brusque dismissal to Lord Florent and the others commanding them to attend him in his pavilion one hour hence for a council of war They bowed their heads and dispersed while Davos and Melisandre rode to the king’s pavilion

The tent had to be large since it was there his lords bannermen came to council Yet there was nothing grand about it It was a soldier’s tent of heavy canvas dyed the dark yellow that sometimes passed for gold Only the royal banner that streamed atop the center pole marked it as a king’s That and the guards without queen’s men leaning on tall spears with the badge of the fiery heart sewn over their own

Grooms came up to help them dismount One of the guards relieved Melisandre of her cumbersome standard driving the staff deep into the soft ground Devan stood to one side of the door waiting to lift the flap for the king An older squire waited beside him Stannis took off his crown and handed it to Devan Cold water cups for two Davos attend me My lady I shall send for you when I require you

As the king commands Melisandre bowed

After the brightness of the morning the interior of the pavilion seemed cool and dim Stannis seated himself on a plain wooden camp stool and waved Davos to another One day I may make you a lord smuggler If only to irk Celtigar and Florent You will not thank me though It will mean you must suffer through these councils and feign interest in the braying of mules

Why do you have them if they serve no purpose

The mules love the sound of their own braying why else And I need them to haul my cart Oh to be sure once in a great while some useful notion is put forth But not today I think—ah here’s your son with our water
