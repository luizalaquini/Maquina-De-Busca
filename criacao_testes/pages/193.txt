Grim and grimmer thought Catelyn It was worse than she’d imagined You mean to meet him here she asked

If he comes so far but no one thinks he will Robb said I’ve sent word to Howland Reed Father’s old friend at Greywater Watch If the Lannisters come up the Neck the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that and Roose Bolton agrees He’ll stay close to the Trident they believe taking the castles of the river lords one by one until Riverrun stands alone We need to march south to meet him

The very idea of it chilled Catelyn to the bone What chance would a fifteen-year-old boy have against seasoned battle commanders like Jaime and Tywin Lannister Is that wise You are strongly placed here It’s said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own

Yes but our food and supplies are running low and this is not land we can live off easily We’ve been waiting for Lord Manderly but now that his sons have joined us we need to march

She was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with her son’s voice she realized Over the years she had hosted many of them at Winterfell and been welcomed with Ned to their own hearths and tables She knew what sorts of men they were each one She wondered if Robb did

And yet there was sense in what they said This host her son had assembled was not a standing army such as the Free Cities were accustomed to maintain nor a force of guardsmen paid in coin Most of them were smallfolk crofters fieldhands fishermen sheepherders the sons of innkeeps and traders and tanners leavened with a smattering of sellswords and freeriders hungry for plunder When their lords called they came… but not forever Marching is all very well she said to her son but where and to what purpose What do you mean to do

Robb hesitated The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him he said but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we’d be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer He ran his fingers through his shaggy mane of auburn hair looking unhappy Though by the time we reach Riverrun… I’m not certain…

Be certain Catelyn told her son or go home and take up that wooden sword again You cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark Make no mistake Robb—these are your bannermen not your friends You named yourself battle commander Command

Her son looked at her startled as if he could not credit what he was hearing As you say Mother

I’ll ask you again What do you mean to do

Robb drew a map across the table a ragged piece of old leather covered with lines of faded paint One end curled up from being rolled he weighed it down with his dagger Both plans have virtues but… look if we try to swing around Lord Tywin’s host we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer and if we attack him… by all reports he has more men than I do and a lot more armored horse The Greatjon says that won’t matter if we catch him with his breeches down but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won’t be so easily surprised

Good she said She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice as he sat there puzzling over the map Tell me more

I’d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin archers mostly and march the rest down the causeway he said but once we’re below the Neck I’d split our host in two The foot can continue down the kingsroad while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins He pointed When Lord Tywin gets word that we’ve come south he’ll march north to engage our main host leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun Robb sat back not quite daring to smile but pleased with himself and hungry for her praise

Catelyn frowned down at the map You’d put a river between the two parts of your army

And between Jaime and Lord Tywin he said eagerly The smile came at last There’s no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford where Robert won his crown Not until the Twins all the way up here and Lord Frey controls that bridge He’s your father’s bannerman isn’t that so

The Late Lord Frey Catelyn thought He is she admitted but my father has never trusted him Nor should you

I won’t Robb promised What do you think

She was impressed despite herself He looks like a Tully she thought yet he’s still his father’s son and Ned taught him well Which force would you command

The horse he answered at once Again like his father Ned would always take the more dangerous task himself

And the other

The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin I thought I’d give him the honor

It was his first misstep but how to make him see it without wounding his fledgling confidence Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known

Robb grinned Grey Wind ate two of his fingers and he laughed about it So you agree then

Your father is not fearless Catelyn pointed out He is brave but that is very different

Her son considered that for a moment The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell he said thoughtfully Well them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat So I don’t want someone fearless do I

No You want cold cunning I should think not courage

Roose Bolton Robb said at once That man scares me
