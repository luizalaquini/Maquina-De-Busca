620 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets
and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet
and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down
flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight
before him and they took the city

621 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and
woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the
sword

622 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country Go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman
and all that she hath as ye sware unto her

623 And the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab
and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she
had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the
camp of Israel

624 And they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only
the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they
put into the treasury of the house of the LORD

625 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive and her fathers
household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto
this day because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out
Jericho

626 And Joshua adjured them at that time saying Cursed be the man
before the LORD that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho he
shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest
son shall he set up the gates of it

627 So the LORD was with Joshua and his fame was noised throughout
all the country

71 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
thing for Achan the son of Carmi the son of Zabdi the son of
Zerah of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the
anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel

72 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which is beside Bethaven
on the east of Bethel and spake unto them saying Go up and view the
country

And the men went up and viewed Ai

73 And they returned to Joshua and said unto him Let not all the
people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
Ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but
few

74 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men
and they fled before the men of Ai

75 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they
chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim and smote them in
the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became
as water

76 And Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face
before the ark of the LORD until the eventide he and the elders of
Israel and put dust upon their heads

77 And Joshua said Alas O LORD God wherefore hast thou at all
brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the
Amorites to destroy us would to God we had been content and dwelt
on the other side Jordan  78 O LORD what shall I say when Israel
turneth their backs before their enemies  79 For the Canaanites and
all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us
round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name  710 And the LORD said unto Joshua Get thee up
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face  711 Israel hath sinned and
they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them for
they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and
dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff

712 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they
were accursed neither will I be with you any more except ye destroy
the accursed from among you

713 Up sanctify the people and say Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow for thus saith the LORD God of Israel There is an accursed
thing in the midst of thee O Israel thou canst not stand before
thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you

714 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall
come according to the families thereof and the family which the LORD
shall take shall come by households and the household which the LORD
shall take shall come man by man

715 And it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing
shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the LORD and because he hath wrought
folly in Israel

716 So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by
