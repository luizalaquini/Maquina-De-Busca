DAENERYS

The drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets but they could not keep out disappointment Dany climbed inside wearily glad for the refuge from the sea of Qartheen eyes Make way Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback snapping his whip make way make way for the Mother of Dragons

Reclining on cool satin cushions Xaro Xhoan Daxos poured ruby-red wine into matched goblets of jade and gold his hands sure and steady despite the sway of the palanquin I see a deep sadness written upon your face my light of love He offered her a goblet Could it be the sadness of a lost dream

A dream delayed no more Dany’s tight silver collar was chafing against her throat She unfastened it and flung it aside The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro swore would ward her against all poisons The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water They never saw me for a queen she thought bitterly I was only an afternoon’s amusement a horse girl with a curious pet

Rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a hand for the wine Wincing she shifted him to her other shoulder where he could claw her gown instead of her skin She was garbed after the Qartheen fashion Xaro had warned her that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki so she had taken care to go before them in flowing green samite with one breast bared silvered sandals on her feet with a belt of black-and-white pearls about her waist For all the help they offered I could have gone naked Perhaps I should have She drank deep

Descendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth the Pureborn commanded the Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas Daenerys Targaryen had wanted that fleet or part of it and some of their soldiers as well She made the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List sent the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones

The Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth’s vanished glory The chairs were immense fantastically carved bright with goldwork and studded with amber onyx lapis and jade each one different from all the others and each striving to be the most fabulous Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-weary that they might have been asleep They listened but they did not hear or care she thought They are Milk Men indeed They never meant to help me They came because they were curious They came because they were bored and the dragon on my shoulder interested them more than I did

Tell me the words of the Pureborn prompted Xaro Xhoan Daxos Tell me what they said to sadden the queen of my heart

They said no The wine tasted of pomegranates and hot summer days They said it with great courtesy to be sure but under all the lovely words it was still no

Did you flatter them

Shamelessly

Did you weep

The blood of the dragon does not weep she said testily

Xaro sighed You ought to have wept The Qartheen wept often and easily it was considered a mark of the civilized man The men we bought what did they say

Mathos said nothing Wendello praised the way I spoke The Exquisite refused me with the rest but he wept afterward

Alas that Qartheen should be so faithless Xaro was not himself of the Pureborn but he had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer Weep weep for the treachery of men

Dany would sooner have wept for her gold The bribes she’d tendered to Mathos Mallarawan Wendello Qar Deeth and Egon Emeros the Exquisite might have bought her a ship or hired a score of sellswords Suppose I sent Ser Jorah to demand the return of my gifts she asked

Suppose a Sorrowful Man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept said Xaro The Sorrowful Men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins so named because they always whispered I am so sorry to their victims before they killed them The Qartheen were nothing if not polite It is wisely said that it is easier to milk the Stone Cow of Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn

Dany did not know where Faros was but it seemed to her that Qarth was full of stone cows The merchant princes grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas were divided into three jealous factions the Ancient Guild of Spicers the Tourmaline Brotherhood and the Thirteen to which Xaro belonged Each vied with the others for dominance and all three contended endlessly with the Pureborn And brooding over all were the warlocks with their blue lips and dread powers seldom seen but much feared

She would have been lost without Xaro The gold that she had squandered to open the doors of the Hall of a Thousand Thrones was largely a product of the merchant’s generosity and quick wits As the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east ever more seekers had come to learn if the tale was true—and Xaro Xhoan Daxos saw to it that the great and the humble alike offered some token to the Mother of Dragons

The trickle he started soon swelled to a flood Trader captains brought lace from Myr chests of saffron from Yi Ti amber and dragonglass out of Asshai Merchants offered bags of coin silversmiths rings and chains Pipers piped for her tumblers tumbled and jugglers juggled while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed A pair of Jogos Nhai presented her with one of their striped zorses black and white and fierce A widow brought the dried corpse of her husband covered with a crust of silvered leaves such remnants were believed to have great power especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer as this one had And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a three-headed dragon the coils were yellow gold the wings silver the heads carved from jade ivory and onyx

The crown was the only offering she’d kept The rest she sold to gather the wealth she had wasted on the Pureborn Xaro would have sold the crown too—the Thirteen would see that she had a much finer one he swore—but Dany forbade it Viserys sold my mother’s crown and men called him a beggar I shall keep this one so men will call me a queen And so she did though the weight of it made her neck ache

Yet even crowned I am a beggar still Dany thought I have become the most splendid beggar in the world but a beggar all the same She hated it as her brother must have All those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the Usurper’s knives pleading for help from archons and princes and magisters buying our food with flattery He must have known how they mocked him Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter In the end it had driven him mad It will do the same to me if I let it Part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro and make the dead city bloom No that is defeat I have something Viserys never had I have the dragons The dragons are all the difference

She stroked Rhaegal The green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard Outside the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed all its myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea Make way you Milk Men make way for the Mother of Dragons Jhogo cried and the Qartheen moved aside though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice Through the swaying draperies Dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion From time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given him Aggo guarded on her other side while Rakharo rode behind the procession watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger Ser Jorah she had left behind today to guard her other dragons the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start He distrusts everyone she reflected and perhaps for good reason

As Dany lifted her goblet to drink Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back hissing Your dragon has a good nose Xaro wiped his lips The wine is ordinary It is said that across the Jade Sea they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines taste like vinegar Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it you and I

The Arbor makes the best wine in the world Dany declared Lord Redwyne had fought for her father against the Usurper she remembered one of the few to remain true to the last Will he fight for me as well There was no way to be certain after so many years Come with me to the Arbor Xaro and you’ll have the finest vintages you ever tasted But we’ll need to go in a warship not a pleasure barge

I have no warships War is bad for trade Many times I have told you Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of peace

Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of gold she thought and gold will buy me all the ships and swords I need I have not asked you to take up a sword only to lend me your ships

He smiled modestly Of trading ships I have a few that is so Who can say how many One may be sinking even now in some stormy corner of the Summer Sea On the morrow another will fall afoul of corsairs The next day one of my captains may look at the wealth in his hold and think All this should belong to me Such are the perils of trade Why the longer we talk the fewer ships I am likely to have I grow poorer by the instant

Give me ships and I will make you rich again

Marry me bright light and sail the ship of my heart I cannot sleep at night for thinking of your beauty

Dany smiled Xaro’s flowery protestations of passion amused her but his manner was at odds with his words While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare breast when he’d helped her into the palanquin Xaro hardly deigned to notice it even in these close confines And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk You speak sweetly Xaro but under your words I hear another no

This Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard I cannot bear the thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin The jewels in Xaro’s nose gave him the aspect of some strange glittery bird His long elegant fingers waved dismissal Let this be your kingdom most exquisite of queens and let me be your king I will give you a throne of gold if you like When Qarth begins to pall we can journey round Yi Ti and search for the dreaming city of the poets to sip the wine of wisdom from a dead man’s skull

I mean to sail to Westeros and drink the wine of vengeance from the skull of the Usurper She scratched Rhaegal under one eye and his jade-green wings unfolded for a moment stirring the still air in the palanquin

A single perfect tear ran down the cheek of Xaro Xhoan Daxos Will nothing turn you from this madness

Nothing she said wishing she was as certain as she sounded If each of the Thirteen would lend me ten ships—

You would have one hundred thirty ships and no crew to sail them The justice of your cause means naught to the common men of Qarth Why should my sailors care who sits upon the throne of some kingdom at the edge of the world

I will pay them to care

With what coin sweet star of my heaven

With the gold the seekers bring

That you may do Xaro acknowledged but so much caring will cost dear You will need to pay them far more than I do and all of Qarth laughs at my ruinous generosity

If the Thirteen will not aid me perhaps I should ask the Guild of Spicers or the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Xaro gave a languid shrug They will give you nothing but flattery and lies The Spicers are dissemblers and braggarts and the Brotherhood is full of pirates

Then I must heed Pyat Pree and go to the warlocks

The merchant prince sat up sharply Pyat Pree has blue lips and it is truly said that blue lips speak only lies Heed the wisdom of one who loves you Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows They will give you naught They have naught to give

I would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend Xaro Xhoan Daxos would give me what I ask

I have given you my home and heart do they mean nothing to you I have given you perfume and pomegranates tumbling monkeys and spitting snakes scrolls from lost Valyria an idol’s head and a serpent’s foot I have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold and a matched set of bullocks to bear it one white as ivory and one black as jet with horns inlaid with jewels

Yes Dany said But it was ships and soldiers I wanted

Did I not give you an army sweetest of women A thousand knights each in shining armor
