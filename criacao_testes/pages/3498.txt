Robb Sansa said

The word of your lord father’s treason will no doubt reach them soon Better that it should come from you You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king

Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking But he never… I don’t… Your Grace I wouldn’t know what to say…

The queen patted her hand We will tell you what to write child The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king’s peace

It will go hard for them if they don’t said Grand Maester Pycelle By the love you bear them you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom

Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully the queen said You must tell her that you are well and in our care that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want Bid them to come to King’s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne If they do that… why then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood and when you come into the flower of your womanhood you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor before the eyes of gods and men

…wed the king… The words made her breath come faster yet still Sansa hesitated Perhaps… if I might see my father talk to him about…

Treason Lord Varys hinted

You disappoint me Sansa the queen said with eyes gone hard as stones We’ve told you of your father’s crimes If you are truly as loyal as you say why should you want to see him

I… I only meant… Sansa felt her eyes grow wet He’s not… please he hasn’t been… hurt or… or…

Lord Eddard has not been harmed the queen said

But… what’s to become of him

That is a matter for the king to decide Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously

The king Sansa blinked back her tears Joffrey was the king now she thought Her gallant prince would never hurt her father no matter what he might have done If she went to him and pleaded for mercy she was certain he’d listen He had to listen he loved her even the queen said so Joff would need to punish Father the lords would expect it but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell or exile him to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea It would only have to be for a few years By then she and Joffrey would be married Once she was queen she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant him a pardon

Only… if Mother or Robb did anything treasonous called the banners or refused to swear fealty or anything it would all go wrong Her Joffrey was good and kind she knew it in her heart but a king had to be stern with rebels She had to make them understand she had to

I’ll… I’ll write the letters Sansa told them

With a smile as warm as the sunrise Cersei Lannister leaned close and kissed her gently on the cheek I knew you would Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage and good sense you’ve shown here today

In the end she wrote four letters To her mother the Lady Catelyn Stark and to her brothers at Winterfell and to her aunt and her grandfather as well Lady Lysa Arryn of the Eyrie and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun By the time she had done her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink Varys had her father’s seal She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle poured it carefully and watched as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark

Jeyne Poole and all her things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned Sansa to the high tower of Maegor’s Holdfast No more weeping she thought gratefully Yet somehow it seemed colder with Jeyne gone even after she’d built a fire She pulled a chair close to the hearth took down one of her favorite books and lost herself in the stories of Florian and Jonquil of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight of valiant Prince Aemon and his doomed love for his brother’s queen

It was not until later that night as she was drifting off to sleep that Sansa realized she had forgotten to ask about her sister





JON

Othor announced Ser Jaremy Rykker beyond a doubt And this one was Jafer Flowers He turned the corpse over with his foot and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue blue eyes They were Ben Stark’s men both of them

My uncle’s men Jon thought numbly He remembered how he’d pleaded to ride with them Gods I was such a green boy If he had taken me it might be me lying here…

Jafer’s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost’s jaws His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon’s tower His left hand still at the end of his arm was as black as his cloak

Gods have mercy the Old Bear muttered He swung down from his garron handing his reins to Jon The morning was unnaturally warm beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander’s broad forehead like dew on a melon His horse was nervous rolling her eyes backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow Jon led her off a few paces fighting to keep her from bolting The horses did not like the feel of this place For that matter neither did Jon

The dogs liked it least of all Ghost had led the party here the pack of hounds had been useless When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand they had gone wild yowling and barking fighting to get away Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs

It is only a wood Jon told himself and they’re only dead men He had seen dead men before…

Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again He was wandering the empty castle searching for his father descending into the crypts Only this time the dream had gone further than before In the dark he’d heard the scrape of stone on stone When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening one after the other As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves Jon had woken in pitch-dark his heart hammering Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face he could not shake his deep sense of terror He dared not go back to sleep Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked restless until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast It was only a dream I am a brother of the Night’s Watch now not a frightened boy

Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees half-hidden behind the horses His round fat face was the color of curdled milk So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either I can’t look he whispered miserably

You have to look Jon told him keeping his voice low so the others would not hear Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes didn’t he What good are eyes if they’re shut

Yes but… I’m such a coward Jon

Jon put a hand on Sam’s shoulder We have a dozen rangers with us and the dogs even Ghost No one will hurt you Sam Go ahead and look The first look is the hardest

Sam gave a tremulous nod working up his courage with a visible effort Slowly he swiveled his head His eyes widened but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away

Ser Jaremy the Old Bear asked gruffly Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall Where are the others

Ser Jaremy shook his head Would that I knew

Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall yet your rangers heard nothing saw nothing Is this what the Night’s Watch has fallen to Do we still sweep these woods

Yes my lord but—

Do we still mount watches

We do but—

This man wears a hunting horn Mormont pointed at Othor Must I suppose that he died without sounding it Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind

Ser Jaremy bristled his face taut with anger No horn was blown my lord or my rangers would have heard it I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like… and since Benjen was lost we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before by your own command

The Old Bear grunted Yes Well Be that as it may He made an impatient gesture Tell me how they died

Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp The hair came out between his fingers brittle as straw The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand A great gash in the side of the corpse’s neck opened like a mouth crusted with dried blood Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck This was done with an axe

Aye muttered Dywen the old forester Belike the axe that Othor carried m’lord

Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body Othor had been a big ugly man and he made a big ugly corpse No axe was in evidence Jon remembered Othor he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out His singing days were done His flesh was blanched white as milk everywhere but his hands His hands were black like Jafer’s Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash breast and groin and throat Yet his eyes were still open They stared up at the sky blue as sapphires

Ser Jaremy stood The wildlings have axes too

Mormont rounded on him So you believe this is Mance Rayder’s work This close to the Wall

Who else my lord
