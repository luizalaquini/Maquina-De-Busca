Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage had been housed behind the royal sept in the long slate-roofed keep that had been called the Maidenvault since King Baelor the Blessed had confined his sisters therein so the sight of them might not tempt him into carnal thoughts Outside its tall carved doors stood two guards in gilded halfhelms and green cloaks edged in gold satin the golden rose of Highgarden sewn on their breasts Both were seven-footers wide of shoulder and narrow of waist magnificently muscled When Sansa got close enough to see their faces she could not tell one from the other They had the same strong jaws the same deep blue eyes the same thick red mustaches Who are they she asked Ser Loras her discomfit forgotten for a moment

My grandmother’s personal guard he told her Their mother named them Erryk and Arryk but Grandmother can’t tell them apart so she calls them Left and Right

Left and Right opened the doors and Margaery Tyrell herself emerged and swept down the short flight of steps to greet them Lady Sansa she called I’m so pleased you came Be welcome

Sansa knelt at the feet of her future queen You do me great honor Your Grace

Won’t you call me Margaery Please rise Loras help the Lady Sansa to her feet Might I call you Sansa

If it please you Ser Loras helped her up

Margaery dismissed him with a sisterly kiss and took Sansa by the hand Come my grandmother awaits and she is not the most patient of ladies

A fire was crackling in the hearth and sweet-swelling rushes had been scattered on the floor Around the long trestle table a dozen women were seated

Sansa recognized only Lord Tyrell’s tall dignified wife Lady Alerie whose long silvery braid was bound with jeweled rings Margaery performed the other introductions There were three Tyrell cousins Megga and Alla and Elinor all close to Sansa’s age Buxom Lady Janna was Lord Tyrell’s sister and wed to one of the green-apple Fossoways dainty bright-eyed Lady Leonette was a Fossoway as well and wed to Ser Garlan Septa Nysterica had a homely pox-scarred face but seemed jolly Pale elegant Lady Graceford was with child and Lady Bulwer was a child no more than eight And Merry was what she was to call boisterous plump Meredyth Crane but most definitely not Lady Merryweather a sultry black-eyed Myrish beauty

Last of all Margaery brought her before the wizened white-haired doll of a woman at the head of the table I am honored to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna widow to the late Luthor Tyrell Lord of Highgarden whose memory is a comfort to us all

The old woman smelled of rosewater Why she’s just the littlest bit of a thing There was nothing the least bit thorny about her Kiss me child Lady Olenna said tugging at Sansa’s wrist with a soft spotted hand It is so kind of you to sup with me and my foolish flock of hens

Dutifully Sansa kissed the old woman on the cheek It is kind of you to have me my lady

I knew your grandfather Lord Rickard though not well

He died before I was born

I am aware of that child It’s said that your Tully grandfather is dying too Lord Hoster surely they told you An old man though not so old as me Still night falls for all of us in the end and too soon for some You would know that more than most poor child You’ve had your share of grief I know We are sorry for your losses

Sansa glanced at Margaery I was saddened when I heard of Lord Renly’s death Your Grace He was very gallant

You are kind to say so answered Margaery

Her grandmother snorted Gallant yes and charming and very clean He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he knew how to bathe and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be king The Baratheons have always had some queer notions to be sure It comes from their Targaryen blood I should think She sniffed They tried to marry me to a Targaryen once but I soon put an end to that

Renly was brave and gentle Grandmother said Margaery Father liked him as well and so did Loras

Loras is young Lady Olenna said crisply and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your father would that I’d been born a peasant woman with a big wooden spoon I might have been able to beat some sense into his fat head

Mother Lady Alerie scolded

Hush Alerie don’t take that tone with me And don’t call me Mother If I’d given birth to you I’m sure I’d remember I’m only to blame for your husband the lord oaf of Highgarden

Grandmother Margaery said mind your words or what will Sansa think of us 

She might think we have some wits about us One of us at any rate The old woman turned back to Sansa It’s treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother how can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair Tut-tut says my son don’t you want your sweetling to be queen You Starks were kings once the Arryns and the Lannisters as well and even the Baratheons through the female line but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until Aegon the Dragon came along and cooked the rightful King of the Reach on the Field of Fire If truth be told even our claim to Highgarden is a bit dodgy just as those dreadful Florents are always whining ‘What does it matter’ you ask and of course it doesn’t except to oafs like my son The thought that one day he may see his grandson with his arse on the Iron Throne makes Mace puff up like… now what do you call it Margaery you’re clever be a dear and tell your poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke it

They call them puff fish Grandmother

Of course they do Summer Islanders have no imagination My son ought to take the puff fish for his sigil if truth be told He could put a crown on it the way the Baratheons do their stag mayhap that would make him happy We should have stayed well out of all this bloody foolishness if you ask me but once the cow’s been milked there’s no squirting the cream back up her udder After Lord Puff Fish put that crown on Renly’s head we were into the pudding up to our knees so here we are to see things through And what do you say to that Sansa

Sansa’s mouth opened and closed She felt very like a puff fish herself The Tyrells can trace their descent back to Garth Greenhand was the best she could manage at short notice
