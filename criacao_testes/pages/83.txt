My uncle is not dead Robb Stark said loudly anger in his tones He rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword Do you hear me My uncle is not dead His voice rang against the stone walls and Bran was suddenly afraid

Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb unimpressed Whatever you say m’lord he said He sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth

The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat There’s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark He’ll find his way back

Well said Yoren maybe he will and maybe he won’t Good men have gone into those woods before and never come out

All Bran could think of was Old Nan’s story of the Others and the last hero hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds He was afraid for a moment until he remembered how that story ended The children will help him he blurted the children of the forest

Theon Greyjoy sniggered and Maester Luwin said Bran the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years All that is left of them are the faces in the trees

Down here might be that’s true Maester Yoren said but up past the Wall who’s to say Up there a man can’t always tell what’s alive and what’s dead

That night after the plates had been cleared Robb carried Bran up to bed himself Grey Wind led the way and Summer came close behind His brother was strong for his age and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags but the stairs were steep and dark and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top

He put Bran into bed covered him with blankets and blew out the candle For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark Bran wanted to talk to him but he did not know what to say We’ll find a horse for you I promise Robb whispered at last

Are they ever coming back Bran asked him

Yes Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord Mother will be home soon Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes Wouldn’t that surprise her to see you ahorse Even in the dark room Bran could feel his brother’s smile And afterward we’ll ride north to see the Wall We won’t even tell Jon we’re coming we’ll just be there one day you and me It will be an adventure

An adventure Bran repeated wistfully He heard his brother sob The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb’s face so he reached out and found his hand Their fingers twined together





EDDARD

Lord Arryn’s death was a great sadness for all of us my lord Grand Maester Pycelle said I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing Do be seated Would you care for refreshments Some dates perhaps I have some very fine persimmons as well Wine no longer agrees with my digestion I fear but I can offer you a cup of iced milk sweetened with honey I find it most refreshing in this heat

There was no denying the heat Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest Thick moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water where the only breath of wind was to be found That would be most kind Ned said seating himself

Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar Iced milk for the King’s Hand and myself if you would be so kind child Well sweetened

As the girl went to fetch their drinks the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest It is not so yet ofttimes it feels that way does it not On days like this I envy you northerners your summer snows The heavy jeweled chain around the old man’s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat To be sure King Maekar’s summer was hotter than this one and near as long There were fools even in the Citadel who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last the summer that never ends but in the seventh year it broke suddenly and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter Still the heat was fierce while it lasted Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods I remember the smells of those nights my lord—perfume and sweat melons ripe to bursting peaches and pomegranates nightshade and moonbloom I was a young man then still forging my chain The heat did not exhaust me as it does now Pycelle’s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep My pardons Lord Eddard You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born Forgive an old man his wanderings if you would Minds are like swords I do fear The old ones go to rust Ah and here is our milk The serving girl placed the tray between them and Pycelle gave her a smile Sweet child He lifted a cup tasted nodded Thank you You may go

When the girl had taken her leave Pycelle peered at Ned through pale rheumy eyes Now where were we Oh yes You asked about Lord Arryn…

I did Ned sipped politely at the iced milk It was pleasantly cold but oversweet to his taste

If truth be told the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time Pycelle said We had sat together on council many a year he and I and the signs were there to read but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm and more besides His son was ever sickly and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight It was enough to weary even a strong man and the Lord Jon was not young Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired Or so I thought at the time Yet now I am less certain He gave a ponderous shake of his head

What can you tell me of his final illness

The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow He came to me one day asking after a certain book as hale and healthy as ever though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply The next morning he was twisted over in pain too sick to rise from bed Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach The weather had been hot and the Hand often iced his wine which can upset the digestion When Lord Jon continued to weaken I went to him myself but the gods did not grant me the power to save him

I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away

The Grand Maester’s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier I did and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that Maybe I was wrong but at the time I thought it best Maester Colemon is like a son to me and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities but he is young and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice and I feared he might kill him

Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours
