By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood Cersei demanded Who do you think you are

The Hand of the King Ned told her with icy courtesy Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king’s peace and enforce the king’s justice

You were the Hand Cersei began but now—

Silence the king roared You asked him a question and he answered it Cersei subsided cold with anger and Robert turned back to Ned Keep the king’s peace you say Is this how you keep my peace Ned Seven men are dead…

Eight the queen corrected Tregar died this morning of the blow Lord Stark gave him

Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets the king said I will not have it Ned

Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp—

I said I will not have it To hell with her reasons You will command her to release the dwarf at once and you will make your peace with Jaime

Three of my men were butchered before my eyes because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me Am I to forget that

My brother was not the cause of this quarrel Cersei told the king Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel His men attacked Jaime and his guards even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad

You know me better than that Robert Ned said Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me He was there

I’ve talked to Littlefinger Robert said He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse

Some whorehouse Damn your eyes Robert I went there to have a look at your daughter Her mother has named her Barra She looks like that first girl you fathered when we were boys together in the Vale He watched the queen as he spoke her face was a mask still and pale betraying nothing

Robert flushed Barra he grumbled Is that supposed to please me Damn the girl I thought she had more sense

She cannot be more than fifteen and a whore and you thought she had sense Ned said incredulous His leg was beginning to pain him sorely It was hard to keep his temper The fool child is in love with you Robert

The king glanced at Cersei This is no fit subject for the queen’s ears

Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say Ned replied I am told the Kingslayer has fled the city Give me leave to bring him back to justice

The king swirled the wine in his cup brooding He took a swallow No he said I want no more of this Jaime slew three of your men and you five of his Now it ends

Is that your notion of justice Ned flared If so I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand

The queen looked to her husband If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to you—

Do you take me for Aerys Robert interrupted

I took you for a king Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers by all the laws of marriage and the bonds we share The Starks have driven off the one and seized the other This man dishonors you with every breath he takes and yet you stand there meekly asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine

Robert’s face was dark with anger How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue woman

Cersei’s face was a study in contempt What a jape the gods have made of us two she said By all rights you ought to be in skirts and me in mail

Purple with rage the king lashed out a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head She stumbled against the table and fell hard yet Cersei Lannister did not cry out Her slender fingers brushed her cheek where the pale smooth skin was already reddening On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face I shall wear this as a badge of honor she announced

Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again Robert vowed He shouted for a guard Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room tall and somber in his white armor The queen is tired See her to her bedchamber The knight helped Cersei to her feet and led her out without a word

Robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup You see what she does to me Ned The king seated himself cradling his wine cup My loving wife The mother of my children The rage was gone from him now in his eyes Ned saw something sad and scared I should not have hit her That was not… that was not kingly He stared down at his hands as if he did not quite know what they were I was always strong… no one could stand before me no one How do you fight someone if you can’t hit them Confused the king shook his head Rhaegar… Rhaegar won damn him I killed him Ned I drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart and he died at my feet They made up songs about it Yet somehow he still won He has Lyanna now and I have her The king drained his cup
