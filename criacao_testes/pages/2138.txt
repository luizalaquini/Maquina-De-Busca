The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain After the bright moonlight its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave Straight up here the ranger said in a quiet voice We want to get above them He peeled off his gloves tucked them through his belt tied one end of his rope around his waist the other end around Jon Follow me when the rope grows taut The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once moving upward with fingers and feet faster than Jon would have believed The long rope unwound slowly Jon watched him closely making note of how he went and where he found each handhold and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled he took off his own gloves and followed much more slowly

Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on but as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again This time there was no convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether so he took out his felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps Soft as the sounds were they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow certain that the wildlings must hear them too When the spike was secure Stonesnake secured the rope to it and Jon started after him Suck on the mountain’s teat he reminded himself Don’t look down Keep your weight above your feet Don’t look down Look at the rock in front of you There’s a good handhold yes Don’t look down I can catch a breath on that ledge there all I need to do is reach it Never look down

Once his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest but the gods were good and he did not fall He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his fingers but he dared not don his gloves gloves would slip no matter how tight they seemed cloth and fur moving between skin and stone and up here that could kill him His burned hand was stiffening up on him and soon it began to ache Then he ripped open his thumbnail somehow and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand He hoped he still had all his fingers by the end of the climb

Up they went and up and up black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire They were close now though Jon could sense it Even so he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him all unknowing but of his brother at Winterfell Bran used to love to climb I wish I had a tenth part of his courage

The wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up He had donned his gloves again so Jon did the same The ranger moved his head to the left and the two of them crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff

The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the wind That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of them creeping along on their bellies until they were looking down on the men they must kill

One was asleep curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins Jon could see nothing of him but his hair bright red in the firelight The second sat close to the flames feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone The third watched the pass though there was little to see only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the snowy shoulders of the mountains It was the watcher who wore the horn

Three For a moment Jon was uncertain There was only supposed to be two One was asleep though And whether there was two or three or twenty he still must do what he had come to do Stonesnake touched his arm pointed at the wildling with the horn Jon nodded toward the one by the fire It felt queer picking a man to kill Half the days of his life had been spent with sword and shield training for this moment Did Robb feel this way before his first battle he wondered but there was no time to ponder the question Stonesnake moved as fast as his namesake leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles Jon slid Longclaw from its sheath and followed

It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade He got it to his lips but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword Jon’s man leapt to his feet thrusting at his face with a burning brand He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back Out of the corner of his eye he saw the sleeper stirring and knew he must finish his man quick When the brand swung again he bulled into it swinging the bastard sword with both hands The Valyrian steel sheared through leather fur wool and flesh but when the wildling fell he twisted ripping the sword from Jon’s grasp On the ground the sleeper sat up beneath his furs Jon slid his dirk free grabbing the man by the hair and jamming the point of the knife up under his chin as he reached for his—no her—

His hand froze A girl

A watcher said Stonesnake A wildling Finish her

Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her One thrust and it’s done he told himself He was so close he could smell onion on her breath She is no older than I am Something about her made him think of Arya though they looked nothing at all alike Will you yield he asked giving the dirk a half turn And if she doesn’t

I yield Her words steamed in the cold air

You’re our captive then He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat

Qhorin said nothing of taking captives said Stonesnake

He never said not to Jon let go his grip on the girl’s hair and she scuttled backward away from them

She’s a spearwife Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her sleeping furs She was reaching for that when you grabbed her Give her half a chance and she’ll bury it between your eyes

I won’t give her half a chance Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl’s reach Do you have a name

Ygritte Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody She stared at the wetness

Sheathing his dirk he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he’d killed You are my captive Ygritte

I gave you my name

I’m Jon Snow

She flinched An evil name

A bastard name he said My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell

The girl watched him warily but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle It’s the captive supposed to tell things remember The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire Not that she will I’ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they’d answer a question When the end of the branch was blazing merrily he took two steps and flung it out over the pass It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight

You ought to burn them you killed said Ygritte

Need a bigger fire for that and big fires burn bright Stonesnake turned his eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light Are there more wildlings close by is that it

Burn them the girl repeated stubbornly or it might be you’ll need them swords again

Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands Maybe we should do as she says

There are other ways Stonesnake knelt beside the man he’d slain stripped him of cloak and boots and belt and vest then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it to the edge He grunted as he tossed it over A moment later they heard a wet heavy smack well below them By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging it by the arms Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of the night

Ygritte watched and said nothing She was older than he’d thought at first Jon realized maybe as old as twenty but short for her age bandy-legged with a round face small hands and a pug nose Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions She looked plump as she crouched there but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya

Were you sent to watch for us Jon asked her

You and others

Stonesnake warmed his hands over the fire What waits beyond the pass

The free folk

How many

Hundreds and thousands More than you ever saw crow She smiled Her teeth were crooked but very white

She doesn’t know how many Why come here

Ygritte fell silent

What’s in the Frostfangs that your king could want You can’t stay here there’s no food

She turned her face away from him

Do you mean to march on the Wall When

She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him

Do you know anything of my uncle Benjen Stark

Ygritte ignored him Stonesnake laughed If she spits out her tongue don’t say I didn’t warn you

A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock Shadowcat Jon knew at once As he rose he heard another closer at hand He pulled his sword and turned listening

They won’t trouble us Ygritte said It’s the dead they’ve come for Cats can smell blood six miles off They’ll stay near the bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ meat and cracked the bones for the marrow

Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks It gave him an uneasy feeling The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was but he dared not sleep He had taken a captive and it was on him to guard her Were they your kin he asked her quietly The two we killed

No more than you are

Me He frowned What do you mean
