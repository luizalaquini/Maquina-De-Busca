Tyrion grinned It’s on all our banners

She ignored the jest If it was Father who’d been taken captive Jaime would not be sitting by idly I promise you

Jaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun and the Others take their chances He never did have any patience no more than you sweet sister Not all of us can be as bold as Jaime but there are other ways to win wars Harrenhal is strong and well situated

And King’s Landing is not as we both know perfectly well While Father plays lion and fawn with the Stark boy Renly marches up the roseroad He could be at our gates any day now

The city will not fall in a day From Harrenhal it is a straight swift march down the kingsroad Renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before Father takes him in the rear His host will be the hammer the city walls the anvil it makes a lovely picture

Cersei’s green eyes bored into him wary yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding her And if Robb Stark marches

Harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose Bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolf’s horse Stark cannot march on King’s Landing without taking Harrenhal first and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do that Tyrion tried his most winning smile Meanwhile Father lives off the fat of the riverlands while our uncle Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock

Cersei regarded him suspiciously How could you know all this Did Father tell you his intentions when he sent you here

No I glanced at a map

Her look turned to disdain You’ve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque head of yours haven’t you Imp

Tyrion tsked Sweet sister I ask you if we weren’t winning would the Starks have sued for peace He drew out the letter that Ser Cleos Frey had brought The Young Wolf has sent us terms you see Unacceptable terms to be sure but still a beginning Would you care to see them

Yes That fast she was all queen again How do you come to have them They should have come to me

What else is a Hand for if not to hand you things Tyrion handed her the letter His cheek still throbbed where Cersei’s hand had left its mark Let her flay half my face it will be a small price to pay for her consent to the Dornish marriage He would have that now he could sense it

And certain knowledge of an informer too… well that was the plum in his pudding





BRAN

Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair Over his heart was his wolf’s-head brooch of silver and polished jet He would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on his breast but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding

The low stone steps balked Dancer only for a moment When Bran urged her on she took them easily Beyond the wide oak-and-iron doors eight long rows of trestle tables filled Winterfell’s Great Hall four on each side of the center aisle Men crowded shoulder to shoulder on the benches Stark they called as Bran trotted past rising to their feet Winterfell Winterfell

He was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted for—it was the harvest they cheered it was Robb and his victories it was his lord father and his grandfather and all the Starks going back eight thousand years Still it made him swell with pride For so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken Yet when he reached the dais with every eye upon him Osha and Hodor undid his straps and buckles lifted him off Dancer’s back and carried him to the high seat of his fathers

Ser Rodrik was seated to Bran’s left his daughter Beth beside him Rickon was to his right his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle He had refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone The last girl to try had been bitten for her efforts I wanted to ride too he said as Hodor led Dancer away I ride better than you

You don’t so hush up he told his brother Ser Rodrik bellowed for quiet Bran raised his voice He bid them welcome in the name of his brother the King in the North and asked them to thank the gods old and new for Robb’s victories and the bounty of the harvest May there be a hundred more he finished raising his father’s silver goblet

A hundred more Pewter tankards clay cups and iron-banded drinking horns clashed together Bran’s wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves but stronger than he was used to He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest as he swallowed By the time he set down the goblet his head was swimming

You did well Bran Ser Rodrik told him Lord Eddard would have been most proud Down the table Maester Luwin nodded his agreement as the servers began to carry in the food

Such food Bran had never seen course after course after course so much that he could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish There were great joints of aurochs roasted with leeks venison pies chunky with carrots bacon and mushrooms mutton chops sauced in honey and cloves savory duck peppered boar goose skewers of pigeon and capon beef-and-barley stew cold fruit soup Lord Wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from White Harbor packed in salt and seaweed whitefish and winkles crabs and mussels clams herring cod salmon lobster and lampreys There was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits there were turnips and pease and beets beans and squash and huge red onions there were baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine Wheels of white cheese were set at every table above and below the salt and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn ale were passed up and down the tables

Lord Wyman’s musicians played bravely and well but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter the clash of cup and plate and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps The singer sang good songs Iron Lances and The Burning of the Ships and The Bear and the Maiden Fair but only Hodor seemed to be listening He stood beside the piper hopping from one foot to the other

The noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar a great heady stew of sound Ser Rodrik talked with Maester Luwin above Beth’s curly head while Rickon screamed happily at the Walders Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table but the maester reminded him that they would soon be kin Robb was to marry one of their aunts and Arya one of their uncles She never will Bran said not Arya but Maester Luwin was unyielding so there they were beside Rickon
