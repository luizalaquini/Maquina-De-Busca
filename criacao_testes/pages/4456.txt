Fighting giants Osha claimed there were still giants beyond the Wall One day maybe I’ll even see one   

Fighting men She belted herself with a length of rope Black crows oft as not Killed me one too she said shaking out her hair It had grown since she’d come to Winterfell well down past her ears She looked softer than the woman who had once tried to rob and kill him in the wolfswood Heard some yattering in the kitchen today about you and them Freys

Who What did they say

She gave him a sour grin That it’s a fool boy who mocks a giant and a mad world when a cripple has to defend him

Hodor never knew they were mocking him Bran said Anyhow he never fights He remembered once when he was little going to the market square with his mother and Septa Mordane They brought Hodor to carry for them but he had wandered away and when they found him some boys had him backed into an alley poking him with sticks Hodor he kept shouting cringing and covering himself but he had never raised a hand against his tormentors Septon Chayle says he has a gentle spirit

Aye she said and hands strong enough to twist a man’s head off his shoulders if he takes a mind to All the same he better watch his back around that Walder Him and you both The big one they call little it comes to me he’s well named Big outside little inside and mean down to the bones

He’d never dare hurt me He’s scared of Summer no matter what he says

Then might be he’s not so stupid as he seems Osha was always wary around the direwolves The day she was taken Summer and Grey Wind between them had torn three wildlings to bloody pieces Or might be he is And that tastes of trouble too She tied up her hair You have more of them wolf dreams

No He did not like to talk about the dreams

A prince should lie better than that Osha laughed Well your dreams are your business Mine’s in the kitchens and I’d best be getting back before Gage starts to shouting and waving that big wooden spoon of his By your leave my prince

She should never have talked about the wolf dreams Bran thought as Hodor carried him up the steps to his bedchamber He fought against sleep as long as he could but in the end it took him as it always did On this night he dreamed of the weirwood It was looking at him with its deep red eyes calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth and from its pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice as sharp as swords

The blast of horns woke him Bran pushed himself onto his side grateful for the reprieve He heard horses and boisterous shouting More guests have come and half-drunk by the noise of them Grasping his bars he pulled himself from the bed and over to the window seat On their banner was a giant in shattered chains that told him that these were Umber men down from the northlands beyond the Last River

The next day two of them came together to audience the Greatjon’s uncles blustery men in the winter of their days with beards as white as the bearskin cloaks they wore A crow had once taken Mors for dead and pecked out his eye so he wore a chunk of dragonglass in its stead As Old Nan told the tale he’d grabbed the crow in his fist and bitten its head off so they named him Crowfood She would never tell Bran why his gaunt brother Hother was called Whoresbane

No sooner had they been seated than Mors asked for leave to wed Lady Hornwood The Greatjon’s the Young Wolf’s strong right hand all know that to be true Who better to protect the widow’s lands than an Umber and what Umber better than me

Lady Donella is still grieving Maester Luwin said

I have a cure for grief under my furs Mors laughed Ser Rodrik thanked him courteously and promised to bring the matter before the lady and the king

Hother wanted ships There’s wildlings stealing down from the north more than I’ve ever seen before They cross the Bay of Seals in little boats and wash up on our shores The crows in Eastwatch are too few to stop them and they go to ground quick as weasels It’s longships we need aye and strong men to sail them The Greatjon took too many Half our harvest is gone to seed for want of arms to swing the scythes

Ser Rodrik pulled at his whiskers You have forests of tall pine and old oak Lord Manderly has shipwrights and sailors in plenty Together you ought to be able to float enough longships to guard both your coasts

Manderly Mors Umber snorted That great waddling sack of suet His own people mock him as Lord Lamprey I’ve heard The man can scarce walk If you stuck a sword in his belly ten thousand eels would wriggle out

He is fat Ser Rodrik admitted but he is not stupid You will work with him or the king will know the reason why And to Bran’s astonishment the truculent Umbers agreed to do as he commanded though not without grumbling

While they were sitting at audience the Glover men arrived from Deepwood Motte and a large party of Tallharts from Torrhen’s Square Galbart and Robett Glover had left Deepwood in the hands of Robett’s wife but it was their steward who came to Winterfell My lady begs that you excuse her absence Her babes are still too young for such a journey and she was loath to leave them Bran soon realized that it was the steward not Lady Glover who truly ruled at Deepwood Motte The man allowed that he was at present setting aside only a tenth of his harvest A hedge wizard had told him there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in he claimed Maester Luwin had a number of choice things to say about hedge wizards Ser Rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth and questioned the steward closely about Lord Hornwood’s bastard the boy Larence Snow In the north all highborn bastards took the surname Snow This lad was near twelve and the steward praised his wits and courage

Your notion about the bastard may have merit Bran Maester Luwin said after One day you will be a good lord for Winterfell I think

No I won’t Bran knew he would never be a lord no more than he could be a knight Robb’s to marry some Frey girl you told me so yourself and the Walders say the same He’ll have sons and they’ll be the lords of Winterfell after him not me

It may be so Bran Ser Rodrik said but I was wed three times and my wives gave me daughters Now only Beth remains to me My brother Martyn fathered four strong sons yet only Jory lived to be a man When he was slain Martyn’s line died with him When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain

Leobald Tallhart had his turn the following day He spoke of weather portents and the slack wits of smallfolk and told how his nephew itched for battle Benfred has raised his own company of lances Boys none older than nineteen years but every one thinks he’s another young wolf When I told them they were only young rabbits they laughed at me Now they call themselves the Wild Hares and gallop about the country with rabbitskins tied to the ends of their lances singing songs of chivalry

Bran thought that sounded grand He remembered Benfred Tallhart a big bluff loud boy who had often visited Winterfell with his father Ser Helman and had been friendly with Robb and with Theon Greyjoy But Ser Rodrik was clearly displeased by what he heard If the king were in need of more men he would send for them he said Instruct your nephew that he is to remain at Torrhen’s Square as his lord father commanded

I will ser said Leobald and only then raised the matter of Lady Hornwood Poor thing with no husband to defend her lands nor son to inherit His own lady wife was a Hornwood sister to the late Lord Halys doubtless they recalled An empty hall is a sad one I had a thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as her own Beren is near ten a likely lad and her own nephew He would cheer her I am certain and perhaps he would even take the name Hornwood   

If he were named heir suggested Maester Luwin

   so the House might continue finished Leobald

Bran knew what to say Thank you for the notion my lord he blurted out before Ser Rodrik could speak We will bring the matter to my brother Robb Oh and Lady Hornwood

Leobald seemed surprised that he had spoken I’m grateful my prince he said but Bran saw pity in his pale blue eyes mingled perhaps with a little gladness that the cripple was after all not his son For a moment he hated the man

Maester Luwin liked him better though Beren Tallhart may well be our best answer he told them when Leobald had gone By blood he is half Hornwood If he takes his uncle’s name   

   he will still be a boy said Ser Rodrik and hard-pressed to hold his lands against the likes of Mors Umber or this bastard of Roose Bolton’s We must think on this carefully Robb should have our best counsel before he makes his decision

It may come down to practicalities said Maester Luwin Which lord he most needs to court The riverlands are part of his realm he may wish to cement the alliance by wedding Lady Hornwood to one of the lords of the Trident A Blackwood perhaps or a Frey—

Lady Hornwood can have one of our Freys said Bran She can have both of them if she likes

You are not kind my prince Ser Rodrik chided gently

Neither are the Walders Scowling Bran stared down at the table and said nothing

In the days that followed ravens arrived from other lordly houses bearing regrets The bastard of the Dreadfort would not be joining them the Mormonts and Karstarks had all gone south with Robb Lord Locke was too old to dare the journey Lady Flint was heavy with child there was sickness at Widow’s Watch Finally all of the principal vassals of House Stark had been heard from save for Howland Reed the crannogman who had not set foot outside his swamps for many a year and the Cerwyns whose castle lay a half day’s ride from Winterfell Lord Cerwyn was a captive of the Lannisters but his son a lad of fourteen arrived one bright blustery morning at the head of two dozen lances Bran was riding Dancer around the yard when they came through the gate He trotted over to greet them Cley Cerwyn had always been a friend to Bran and his brothers

Good morrow Bran Cley called out cheerfully Or must I call you Prince Bran now

Only if you want

Cley laughed Why not Everyone else is a king or prince these days Did Stannis write Winterfell as well

Stannis I don’t know

He’s a king now too Cley confided He says Queen Cersei bedded her brother so Joffrey is a bastard

Joffrey the Illborn one of the Cerwyn knights growled Small wonder he’s faithless with the Kingslayer for a father

Aye said another the gods hate incest Look how they brought down the Targaryens

For a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe A giant hand was crushing his chest He felt as though he was falling and clutched desperately at Dancer’s reins

His terror must have shown on his face Bran Cley Cerwyn said Are you unwell It’s only another king

Robb will beat him too He turned Dancer’s head toward the stables oblivious to the puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave him His blood was roaring in his ears and had he not been strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen

That night Bran prayed to his father’s gods for dreamless sleep If the gods heard they mocked his hopes for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream

Fly or die cried the three-eyed crow as it pecked at him He wept and pleaded but the crow had no pity It put out his left eye and then his right and when he was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull He screamed until he was certain his lungs must burst The pain was an axe splitting his head apart but when the crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain Bran could see again What he saw made him gasp in fear He was clinging to a tower miles high and his fingers were slipping nails scrabbling at the stone his legs dragging him down stupid useless dead legs Help me he cried A golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up The things I do for love he murmured softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air
