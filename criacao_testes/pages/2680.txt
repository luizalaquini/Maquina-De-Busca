1523 And all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people
passed over the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron and
all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness

1524 And lo Zadok also and all the Levites were with him bearing
the ark of the covenant of God and they set down the ark of God and
Abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the
city

1525 And the king said unto Zadok Carry back the ark of God into the
city if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD he will bring me
again and shew me both it and his habitation 1526 But if he thus
say I have no delight in thee behold here am I let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him

1527 The king said also unto Zadok the priest Art not thou a seer
return into the city in peace and your two sons with you Ahimaaz thy
son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar

1528 See I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there
come word from you to certify me

1529 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
Jerusalem and they tarried there

1530 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet and wept as he
went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the
people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up
weeping as they went up

1531 And one told David saying Ahithophel is among the conspirators
with Absalom And David said O LORD I pray thee turn the counsel of
Ahithophel into foolishness

1532 And it came to pass that when David was come to the top of the
mount where he worshipped God behold Hushai the Archite came to
meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head 1533 Unto whom
David said If thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden
unto me 1534 But if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom I
will be thy servant O king as I have been thy fathers servant
hitherto so will I now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of Ahithophel

1535 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
priests  therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt
hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar
the priests

1536 Behold they have there with them their two sons Ahimaaz
Zadoks son and Jonathan Abiathars son and by them ye shall send
unto me every thing that ye can hear

1537 So Hushai Davids friend came into the city and Absalom came
into Jerusalem

161 And when David was a little past the top of the hill behold
Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses
saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred
bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of
wine

162 And the king said unto Ziba What meanest thou by these And Ziba
said The asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as
be faint in the wilderness may drink

163 And the king said And where is thy masters son And Ziba said
unto the king Behold he abideth at Jerusalem for he said To day
shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father

164 Then said the king to Ziba Behold thine are all that pertained
unto Mephibosheth And Ziba said I humbly beseech thee that I may
find grace in thy sight my lord O king

165 And when king David came to Bahurim behold thence came out a
man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei the son
of Gera he came forth and cursed still as he came

166 And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of king
David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
hand and on his left

167 And thus said Shimei when he cursed Come out come out thou
bloody man and thou man of Belial 168 The LORD hath returned upon
thee all the blood of the house of Saul in whose stead thou hast
reigned and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
Absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because
thou art a bloody man

169 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king Why should
this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over I pray thee and
take off his head

1610 And the king said What have I to do with you ye sons of
Zeruiah  so let him curse because the LORD hath said unto him Curse
David Who shall then say Wherefore hast thou done so  1611 And
David said to Abishai and to all his servants Behold my son which
came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this
Benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the LORD hath
