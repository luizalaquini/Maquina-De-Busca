Davos stood frowning My lord what did you do

Not treason Never treason I love His Grace as much as any man My own niece is his queen and I remained loyal to him when wiser men fled I am his Hand the Hand of the King how can I be a traitor I only meant to save our lives and… honor… yes He licked his lips I penned a letter Salladhor Saan swore that he had a man who could get it to King’s Landing to Lord Tywin His lordship is a… a man of reason and my terms… the terms were fair… more than fair

What terms were these my lord

It is filthy here Lord Alester said suddenly And that odor… what is that odor

The pail said Davos gesturing We have no privy here What terms

His lordship stared at the pail in horror That Lord Stannis give up his claim to the Iron Throne and retract all he said of Joffrey’s bastardy on the condition that he be accepted back into the king’s peace and confirmed as Lord of Dragonstone and Storm’s End I vowed to do the same for the return of Brightwater Keep and all our lands I thought… Lord Tywin would see the sense in my proposal He still has the Starks to deal with and the ironmen as well I offered to seal the bargain by wedding Shireen to Joffrey’s brother Tommen He shook his head The terms… they are as good as we are ever like to get Even you can see that surely

Yes said Davos even me Unless Stannis should father a son such a marriage would mean that Dragonstone and Storm’s End would one day pass to Tommen which would doubtless please Lord Tywin Meanwhile the Lannisters would have Shireen as hostage to make certain Stannis raised no new rebellions And what did His Grace say when you proposed these terms to him

He is always with the red woman and… he is not in his right mind I fear This talk of a stone dragon… madness I tell you sheer madness Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire from the nine mages from the alchemists Did we learn nothing from Summerhall No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons I told Axell as much My way was better Surer And Stannis gave me his seal he gave me leave to rule The Hand speaks with the king’s voice

Not in this Davos was no courtier and he did not even try to blunt his words It is not in Stannis to yield so long as he knows his claim is just No more than he can unsay his words against Joffrey when he believes them true As for the marriage Tommen was born of the same incest as Joffrey and His Grace would sooner see Shireen dead than wed to such

A vein throbbed in Florent’s forehead He has no choice

You are wrong my lord He can choose to die a king

And us with him Is that what you desire Onion Knight

No But I am the king’s man and I will make no peace without his leave

Lord Alester stared at him helplessly for a long moment and then began to weep





Jon


The last night fell black and moonless but for once the sky was clear I am going up the hill to look for Ghost he told the Thenns at the cave mouth and they grunted and let him pass

So many stars he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in Winterfell he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each he could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith he was old friends with the Ice Dragon the Shadowcat the Moonmaid and the Sword of the Morning All those he shared with Ygritte but not some of the others We look up at the same stars and see such different things The King’s Crown was the Cradle to hear her tell it the Stallion was the Horned Lord the red wanderer that septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the Thief And when the Thief was in the Moonmaid that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman Ygritte insisted Like the night you stole me The Thief was bright that night

I never meant to steal you he said I never knew you were a girl until my knife was at your throat

If you kill a man and never mean t’ he’s just as dead Ygritte said stubbornly Jon had never met anyone so stubborn except maybe for his little sister Arya Is she still my sister he wondered Was she ever He had never truly been a Stark only Lord Eddard’s motherless bastard with no more place at Winterfell than Theon Greyjoy And even that he’d lost When a man of the Night’s Watch said his words he put aside his old family and joined a new one but Jon Snow had lost those brothers too

He found Ghost atop the hill as he thought he might The white wolf never howled yet something drew him to the heights all the same and he would squat there on his hindquarters hot breath rising in a white mist as his red eyes drank the stars

Do you have names for them as well Jon asked as he went to one knee beside the direwolf and scratched the thick white fur on his neck The Hare The Doe The She-Wolf Ghost licked his face his rough wet tongue rasping against the scabs where the eagle’s talons had ripped Jon’s cheek The bird marked both of us he thought Ghost he said quietly on the morrow we go over There’s no steps here no cage-and-crane no way for me to get you to the other side We have to part Do you understand

In the dark the direwolf’s red eyes looked black He nuzzled at Jon’s neck silent as ever his breath a hot mist The wildlings called Jon Snow a warg but if so he was a poor one He did not know how to put on a wolf skin the way Orell had with his eagle before he’d died Once Jon had dreamed that he was Ghost looking down upon the valley of the Milkwater where Mance Rayder had gathered his people and that dream had turned out to be true But he was not dreaming now and that left him only words

You cannot come with me Jon said cupping the wolf’s head in his hands and looking deep into those eyes You have to go to Castle Black Do you understand Castle Black Can you find it The way home Just follow the ice east and east into the sun and you’ll find it They will know you at Castle Black and maybe your coming will warn them He had thought of writing out a warning for Ghost to carry but he had no ink no parchment not even a writing quill and the risk of discovery was too great I will meet you again at Castle Black but you have to get there by yourself We must each hunt alone for a time Alone

The direwolf twisted free of Jon’s grasp his ears pricked up And suddenly he was bounding away He loped through a tangle of brush leapt a deadfall and raced down the hillside a pale streak among the trees Off to Castle Black Jon wondered Or off after a hare He wished he knew He feared he might prove just as poor a warg as a sworn brother and a spy

A wind sighed through the trees rich with the smell of pine needles tugging at his faded blacks Jon could see the Wall looming high and dark to the south a great shadow blocking out the stars The rough hilly ground made him think they must be somewhere between the Shadow Tower and Castle Black and likely closer to the former For days they had been wending their way south between deep lakes that stretched like long thin fingers along the floors of narrow valleys while flint ridges and pine-clad hills jostled against one another to either side Such ground made for slow riding but offered easy concealment for those wishing to approach the Wall unseen
