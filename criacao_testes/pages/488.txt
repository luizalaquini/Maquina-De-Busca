The key to the cell hung from a hook on the wall above the table Rorge took it down and opened the door The first man through was the lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat Well done he said I am Robett Glover

My lord Jaqen gave him a bow

Once freed the captives stripped the dead guards of their weapons and darted up the steps with steel in hand Their fellows crowded after them bare-handed They went swiftly and with scarcely a word None of them seemed quite so badly wounded as they had when Vargo Hoat had marched them through the gates of Harrenhal This of the soup that was clever the man Glover was saying I did not expect that Was it Lord Hoat’s idea

Rorge began to laugh He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole where his nose had been Biter sat on top of one of the dead men holding a limp hand as he gnawed at the fingers Bones cracked between his teeth

Who are you men A crease appeared between Robett Glover’s brows You were not with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton’s encampment Are you of the Brave Companions

Rorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand We are now

This man has the honor to be Jaqen H’ghar once of the Free City of Lorath This man’s discourteous companions are named Rorge and Biter A lord will know which is Biter He waved a hand toward Arya And here—

I’m Weasel she blurted before he could tell who she really was She did not want her name said here where Rorge might hear and Biter and all these others she did not know

She saw Glover dismiss her Very well he said Let’s make an end to this bloody business

When they climbed back up the winding stair they found the door guards lying in pools of their own blood Northmen were running across the ward Arya heard shouts The door of Barracks Hall burst open and a wounded man staggered out screaming Three others ran after him and silenced him with spear and sword There was fighting around the gatehouse as well Rorge and Biter rushed off with Glover but Jaqen H’ghar knelt beside Arya A girl does not understand

Yes I do she said though she didn’t not truly

The Lorathi must have seen it on her face A goat has no loyalty Soon a wolf banner is raised here I think But first a man would hear a certain name unsaid

I take back the name Arya chewed her lip Do I still have a third death

A girl is greedy Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed her his bloody fingers Here is three and there is four and eight more lie dead below The debt is paid

The debt is paid Arya agreed reluctantly She felt a little sad Now she was just a mouse again

A god has his due And now a man must die A strange smile touched the lips of Jaqen H’ghar

Die she said confused What did he mean But I unsaid the name You don’t need to die now

I do My time is done Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin and where it went he changed His cheeks grew fuller his eyes closer his nose hooked a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before And when he shook his head his long straight hair half red and half white dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls

Arya’s mouth hung open Who are you she whispered too astonished to be afraid How did you do that Was it hard

He grinned revealing a shiny gold tooth No harder than taking a new name if you know the way

Show me she blurted I want to do it too

If you would learn you must come with me

Arya grew hesitant Where

Far and away across the narrow sea

I can’t I have to go home To Winterfell

Then we must part he said for I have duties too He lifted her hand and pressed a small coin into her palm Here

What is it
