thee  1461 But he held his peace and answered nothing Again the
high priest asked him and said unto him Art thou the Christ the Son
of the Blessed  1462 And Jesus said I am and ye shall see the Son
of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of
heaven

1463 Then the high priest rent his clothes and saith What need we
any further witnesses  1464 Ye have heard the blasphemy what think
ye And they all condemned him to be guilty of death

1465 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to
buffet him and to say unto him Prophesy and the servants did strike
him with the palms of their hands

1466 And as Peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the
maids of the high priest 1467 And when she saw Peter warming
himself she looked upon him and said And thou also wast with Jesus
of Nazareth

1468 But he denied saying I know not neither understand I what
thou sayest And he went out into the porch and the cock crew

1469 And a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood
by This is one of them

1470 And he denied it again And a little after they that stood by
said again to Peter Surely thou art one of them for thou art a
Galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto

1471 But he began to curse and to swear saying I know not this man
of whom ye speak

1472 And the second time the cock crew And Peter called to mind the
word that Jesus said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou shalt
deny me thrice And when he thought thereon he wept

151 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and
bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him to Pilate

152 And Pilate asked him Art thou the King of the Jews And he
answering said unto them Thou sayest it

153 And the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered
nothing

154 And Pilate asked him again saying Answerest thou nothing
behold how many things they witness against thee

155 But Jesus yet answered nothing so that Pilate marvelled

156 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever
they desired

157 And there was one named Barabbas which lay bound with them that
had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the
insurrection

158 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
had ever done unto them

159 But Pilate answered them saying Will ye that I release unto you
the King of the Jews  1510 For he knew that the chief priests had
delivered him for envy

1511 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather
release Barabbas unto them

1512 And Pilate answered and said again unto them What will ye then
that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews  1513 And
they cried out again Crucify him

1514 Then Pilate said unto them Why what evil hath he done And
they cried out the more exceedingly Crucify him

1515 And so Pilate willing to content the people released Barabbas
unto them and delivered Jesus when he had scourged him to be
crucified

1516 And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium
and they call together the whole band

1517 And they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns
and put it about his head 1518 And began to salute him Hail King
of the Jews  1519 And they smote him on the head with a reed and
did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him

1520 And when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him
and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him

1521 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by coming out
of the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross

1522 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha which is being
interpreted The place of a skull

1523 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he
received it not

1524 And when they had crucified him they parted his garments
