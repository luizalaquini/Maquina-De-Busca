Finally an interrupt-driven speech synthesizer handler removes
events from the list as they become due and uses them to control
the hardware synthesizer
pp
By adopting the synthesis list as a uniform data structure for
holding utterances at every stage of processing the problems of storage
allocation and garbage collection are minimized
Each list element has a forward pointer and five data words the first
indicating what type of element it is
Lexical items which may appear in the input are
LB
NI
end of utterance    
NI
intonation indicator 1 
NI
rhythm indicator  
NI
word boundary   
NI
syllable boundary 
NI
phoneme segment
c
ul
ar b ng c

NI
explicit duration or pitch information
LE
Several of these have to do with prosodic features em a prime
advantage of the structure is that it does not create an artificial
division between segmentals and prosody
Syllable boundaries and duration and pitch information are optional
They will normally be computed by ISP but the user can override them in the
input in a natural way
The actual characters which identify lexical items are not fixed
but are taken from the rule table
pp
As synthesis
proceeds new elements are chained in to the synthesis list
For segmental purposes three types of event are defined em
target events increment events and aspiration events
With each event is associated a time at which the event becomes due
For a target event a parameter number target parameter value
and time-increment are specified
When it becomes due motion of the parameter towards the
target is begun  If no other event for that parameter intervenes
the target value will be reached after the given time-increment
However another target event for the parameter may change its motion
before the target has been attained
Increment events contain a parameter number a parameter increment
and a time-increment  The fixed increment is added to the parameter value
throughout the time specified  This provides an easy way to make a
fricative burst during the opening phase of a stop consonant
Aspiration events switch the mode of excitation from voicing to aspiration
for a given period of time  Thus the aspirated part of unvoiced stops
can be accomodated in a natural manner by changing the mode of excitation
for the duration of the aspiration
