They shared the same sleeping skins every night and he went to sleep with her head against his chest and her red hair tickling his chin The smell of her had become a part of him Her crooked teeth the feel of her breast when he cupped it in his hand the taste of her mouth    they were his joy and his despair Many a night he lay with Ygritte warm beside him wondering if his lord father had felt this confused about his mother whoever she had been Ygritte set the trap and Mance Rayder pushed me into it

Every day he spent among the wildlings made what he had to do that much harder He was going to have to find some way to betray these men and when he did they would die He did not want their friendship any more than he wanted Ygritte’s love And yet    the Thenns spoke the Old Tongue and seldom talked to Jon at all but it was different with Jarl’s raiders the men who’d climbed the Wall Jon was coming to know them despite himself gaunt quiet Errok and gregarious Grigg the Goat the boys Quort and Bodger Hempen Dan the ropemaker The worst of the lot was Del a horsefaced youth near Jon’s own age who would talk dreamily of this wildling girl he meant to steal She’s lucky like your Ygritte She’s kissed by fire

Jon had to bite his tongue He didn’t want to know about Del’s girl or Bodger’s mother the place by the sea that Henk the Helm came from how Grigg yearned to visit the green men on the Isle of Faces or the time a moose had chased Toefinger up a tree He didn’t want to hear about the boil on Big Boil’s arse how much ale Stone Thumbs could drink or how Quort’s little brother had begged him not to go with Jarl Quort could not have been older than fourteen though he’d already stolen himself a wife and had a child on the way Might be he’ll be born in some castle the boy boasted Born in a castle like a lord He was very taken with the castles they’d seen by which he meant watchtowers

Jon wondered where Ghost was now Had he gone to Castle Black or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods He had no sense of the direwolf not even in his dreams It made him feel as if part of himself had been cut off Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him he felt alone He did not want to die alone

By that afternoon the trees had begun to thin and they marched east over gently rolling plains Grass rose waist high around them and stands of wild wheat swayed gently when the wind came gusting but for the most part the day was warm and bright Toward sunset however clouds began to threaten in the west They soon engulfed the orange sun and Lenn foretold a bad storm coming His mother was a woods witch so all the raiders agreed he had a gift for foretelling the weather There’s a village close Grigg the Goat told the Magnar Two miles three We could shelter there Styr agreed at once

It was well past dark and the storm was raging by the time they reached the place The village sat beside a lake and had been so long abandoned that most of the houses had collapsed Even the small timber inn that must once have been a welcome sight for travelers stood half-fallen and roofless We will find scant shelter here Jon thought gloomily Whenever the lightning flashed he could see a stone roundtower rising from an island out in the lake but without boats they had no way to reach it

Errok and Del had crept ahead to scout the ruins but Del was back almost at once Styr halted the column and sent a dozen of his Thenns trotting forward spears in hand By then Jon had seen it too the glimmer of a fire reddening the chimney of the inn We are not alone Dread coiled inside him like a snake He heard a horse neigh and then shouts Ride with them eat with them fight with them Qhorin had said

But the fighting was done There’s only one of them Errok said when he came back An old man with a horse

The Magnar shouted commands in the Old Tongue and a score of his Thenns spread out to establish a perimeter around the village whilst others went prowling through the houses to make certain no one else was hiding amongst the weeds and tumbled stones The rest crowded into the roofless inn jostling each other to get closer to the hearth The broken branches the old man had been burning seemed to generate more smoke than heat but any warmth was welcome on such a wild rainy night Two of the Thenns had thrown the man to the ground and were going through his things Another held his horse while three more looted his saddlebags

Jon walked away A rotten apple squished beneath his heel Styr will kill him The Magnar had said as much at Greyguard any kneelers they met were to be put to death at once to make certain they could not raise the alarm Ride with them eat with them fight with them Did that mean he must stand mute and helpless while they slit an old man’s throat

Near the edge of the village Jon came face-to-face with one of the guards Styr had posted The Thenn growled something in the Old Tongue and pointed his spear back toward the inn Get back where you belong Jon guessed But where is that

He walked towards the water and discovered an almost dry spot beneath the leaning daub-and-wattle wall of a tumbledown cottage that had mostly tumbled down That was where Ygritte found him sitting staring off across the rain-whipped lake I know this place he told her when she sat beside him That tower    look at the top of it the next time the lightning flashes and tell me what you see

Aye if you like she said and then Some o’ the Thenns are saying they heard noises out there Shouting they say

Thunder

They say shouting Might be it’s ghosts

The holdfast did have a grim haunted look standing there black against the storm on its rocky island with the rain lashing at the lake all around it We could go out and take a look he suggested I doubt we could get much wetter than we are

Swimming In the storm She laughed at the notion Is this a trick t’ get the clothes off me Jon Snow

Do I need a trick for that now he teased Or is that you can’t swim a stroke Jon was a strong swimmer himself having learned the art as a boy in Winterfell’s great moat

Ygritte punched his arm You know nothing Jon Snow I’m half a fish I’ll have you know

Half fish half goat half horse    there’s too many halves to you Ygritte He shook his head We wouldn’t need to swim if this is the place I think We could walk

She pulled back and gave him a look Walk on water What southron sorcery is that

No sorc— he began as a huge bolt of lightning stabbed down from the sky and touched the surface of the lake For half a heartbeat the world was noonday bright The clap of thunder was so loud that Ygritte gasped and covered her ears

Did you look Jon asked as the sound rolled away and the night turned black again Did you see

Yellow she said Is that what you meant Some o’ them standing stones on top were yellow

We call them merlons They were painted gold a long time ago This is Queenscrown

Across the lake the tower was black again a dim shape dimly seen A queen lived there asked Ygritte

A queen stayed there for a night Old Nan had told him the story but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of it Alysanne the wife of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator He’s called the Old King because he reigned so long but he was young when he first came to the Iron Throne In those days it was his wont to travel all over the realm When he came to Winterfell he brought his queen six dragons and half his court The king had matters to discuss with his Warden of the North and Alysanne grew bored so she mounted her dragon Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall This village was one of the places where she stopped Afterward the smallfolk painted the top of their holdfast to look like the golden crown she’d worn when she spent the night among them

I have never seen a dragon

No one has The last dragons died a hundred years ago or more But this was before that

Queen Alysanne you say

Good Queen Alysanne they called her later One of the castles on the Wall was named for her as well Queensgate Before her visit they called it Snowgate

If she was so good she should have torn that Wall down

No he thought The Wall protects the realm From the Others    and from you and your kind as well sweetling I had another friend who dreamed of dragons A dwarf He told me—

JON SNOW One of the Thenns loomed above them frowning Magnar wants Jon thought it might have been the same man who’d found him outside the cave the night before they climbed the Wall but he could not be sure He got to his feet Ygritte came with him which always made Styr frown but whenever he tried to dismiss her she would remind him that she was a free woman not a kneeler She came and went as she pleased

They found the Magnar standing beneath the tree that grew through the floor of the common room His captive knelt before the hearth encircled by wooden spears and bronze swords He watched Jon approach but did not speak The rain was running down the walls and pattering against the last few leaves that still clung to the tree while smoke swirled thick from the fire

He must die Styr the Magnar said Do it crow

The old man said no word He only looked at Jon standing amongst the wildlings Amidst the rain and smoke lit only by the fire he could not have seen that Jon was all in black but for his sheepskin cloak Or could he

Jon drew Longclaw from its sheath Rain washed the steel and the firelight traced a sullen orange line along the edge Such a small fire to cost a man his life He remembered what Qhorin Halfhand had said when they spied the fire in the Skirling Pass Fire is life up here he told them but it can be death as well That was high in the Frostfangs though in the lawless wild beyond the Wall This was the Gift protected by the Night’s Watch and the power of Winterfell A man should have been free to build a fire here without dying for it

Why do you hesitate Styr said Kill him and be done

Even then the captive did not speak Mercy he might have said or You have taken my horse my coin my food let me keep my life or No please I have done you no harm He might have said a thousand things or wept or called upon his gods No words would save him now though Perhaps he knew that So he held his tongue and looked at Jon in accusation and appeal

You must not balk whatever is asked of you Ride with them eat with them fight with them    But this old man had offered no resistance He had been unlucky that was all Who he was where he came from where he meant to go on his sorry sway-backed horse    none of it mattered

He is an old man Jon told himself Fifty maybe even sixty He lived a longer life than most The Thenns will kill him anyway nothing I can say or do will save him Longclaw seemed heavier than lead in his hand too heavy to lift The man kept staring at him with eyes as big and black as wells I will fall into those eyes and drown The Magnar was looking at him too and he could almost taste the mistrust The man is dead What matter if it is my hand that slays him One cut would do it quick and clean Longclaw was forged of Valyrian steel Like Ice Jon remembered another killing the deserter on his knees his head rolling the brightness of blood on snow    his father’s sword his father’s words his father’s face   

Do it Jon Snow Ygritte urged You must T’ prove you are no crow but one o’ the free folk

An old man sitting by a fire

Orell was sitting by a fire too You killed him quick enough The look she gave him then was hard You meant t’ kill me too till you saw I was a woman And I was asleep

That was different You were soldiers    sentries

Aye and you crows didn’t want t’ be seen No more’n we do now It’s just the same Kill him

He turned his back on the man No

The Magnar moved closer tall cold and dangerous I say yes I command here

You command Thenns Jon told him not free folk
