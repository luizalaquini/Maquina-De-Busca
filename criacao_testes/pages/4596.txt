Good said Tyrion because as it happens I still have need of you What do you know of Ser Mandon Moore

Bronn laughed I know he’s bloody well drowned

I owe him a great debt but how to pay it He touched his face feeling the scar I know precious little of the man if truth be told

He had eyes like a fish and he wore a white cloak What else do you need to know

Everything said Tyrion for a start What he wanted was proof that Ser Mandon had been Cersei’s but he dare not say so aloud In the Red Keep a man did best to hold his tongue There were rats in the walls and little birds who talked too much and spiders Help me up he said struggling with the bedclothes It’s time I paid a call on my father and past time I let myself be seen again

Such a pretty sight mocked Bronn

What’s half a nose on a face like mine But speaking of pretty is Margaery Tyrell in King’s Landing yet

No She’s coming though and the city’s mad with love for her The Tyrells have been carting food up from Highgarden and giving it away in her name Hundreds of wayns each day There’s thousands of Tyrell men swaggering about with little golden roses sewn on their doublets and not a one is buying his own wine Wife widow or whore the women are all giving up their virtue to every peach-fuzz boy with a gold rose on his teat

They spit on me and buy drinks for the Tyrells Tyrion slid from the bed to the floor His legs turned wobbly beneath him the room spun and he had to grasp Bronn’s arm to keep from pitching headlong into the rushes Pod he shouted Podrick Payne Where in the seven hells are you Pain gnawed at him like a toothless dog Tyrion hated weakness especially his own It shamed him and shame made him angry Pod get in here

The boy came running When he saw Tyrion standing and clutching Bronn’s arm he gaped at them My lord You stood Is that    do you    do you need wine Dreamwine Should I get the maester He said you must stay Abed I mean

I have stayed abed too long Bring me some clean garb

Garb

How the boy could be so clearheaded and resourceful in battle and so confused at all other times Tyrion could never comprehend Clothing he repeated Tunic doublet breeches hose For me To dress in So I can leave this bloody cell

It took all three of them to clothe him Hideous though his face might be the worst of his wounds was the one at the juncture of shoulder and arm where his own mail had been driven back into his armpit by an arrow Pus and blood still seeped from the discolored flesh whenever Maester Frenken changed his dressing and any movement sent a stab of agony through him

In the end Tyrion settled for a pair of breeches and an oversized bed robe that hung loosely about his shoulders Bronn yanked his boots onto his feet while Pod went in search of a stick for him to lean on He drank a cup of dreamwine to fortify himself The wine was sweetened with honey with just enough of the poppy to make his wounds bearable for a time

Even so he was dizzy by the time he turned the latch and the descent down the twisting stone steps made his legs tremble He walked with the stick in one hand and the other on Pod’s shoulder A serving girl was coming up as they were going down She stared at them with wide white eyes as if she were looking at a ghost The dwarf has risen from the dead Tyrion thought And look he’s uglier than ever run tell your friends

Maegor’s Holdfast was the strongest place in the Red Keep a castle within the castle surrounded by a deep dry moat lined with spikes The drawbridge was up for the night when they reached the door Ser Meryn Trant stood before it in his pale armor and white cloak Lower the bridge Tyrion commanded him

The queen’s orders are to raise the bridge at night Ser Meryn had always been Cersei’s creature

The queen’s asleep and I have business with my father

There was magic in the name of Lord Tywin Lannister Grumbling Ser Meryn Trant gave the command and the drawbridge was lowered A second Kingsguard knight stood sentry across the moat Ser Osmund Kettleblack managed a smile when he saw Tyrion waddling toward him Feeling stronger m’lord

Much When’s the next battle I can scarcely wait

When Pod and he reached the serpentine steps however Tyrion could only gape at them in dismay I will never climb those by myself he confessed to himself Swallowing his dignity he asked Bronn to carry him hoping against hope that at this hour there would be no one to see and smile no one to tell the tale of the dwarf being carried up the steps like a babe in arms

The outer ward was crowded with tents and pavilions dozens of them Tyrell men Podrick Payne explained as they threaded their way through a maze of silk and canvas Lord Rowan’s too and Lord Redwyne’s There wasn’t room enough for all In the castle I mean Some took rooms Rooms in the city In inns and all They’re here for the wedding The king’s wedding King Joffrey’s Will you be strong enough to attend my lord

Ravening weasels could not keep me away There was this to be said for weddings over battles at least it was less likely that someone would cut off your nose

Lights still burned dimly behind shuttered windows in the Tower of the Hand The men on the door wore the crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms of his father’s household guard Tyrion knew them both and they admitted him on sight    though neither could bear to look long at his face he noted

Within they came upon Ser Addam Marbrand descending the turnpike stair in the ornate black breastplate and cloth-of-gold cloak of an officer in the City Watch My lord he said how good to see you on your feet I’d heard—

—rumors of a small grave being dug Me too Under the circumstances it seemed best to get up I hear you’re commander of the City Watch Shall I offer congratulations or condolences

Both I fear Ser Addam smiled Death and desertion have left me with some forty-four hundred Only the gods and Littlefinger know how we are to go on paying wages for so many but your sister forbids me to dismiss any

Still anxious Cersei The battle’s done the gold cloaks won’t help you now Do you come from my father he asked

Aye I fear I did not leave him in the best of moods Lord Tywin feels forty-four hundred guardsmen more than sufficient to find one lost squire but your cousin Tyrek remains missing

Tyrek was the son of his late Uncle Tygett a boy of thirteen He had vanished in the riot not long after wedding the Lady Ermesande a suckling babe who happened to be the last surviving heir of House Hayford And likely the first bride in the history of the Seven Kingdoms to be widowed before she was weaned I couldn’t find him either confessed Tyrion

He’s feeding worms said Bronn with his usual tact Ironhand looked for him and the eunuch rattled a nice fat purse They had no more luck than we did Give it up ser

Ser Addam gazed at the sellsword with distaste Lord Tywin is stubborn where his blood is concerned He will have the lad alive or dead and I mean to oblige him He looked back to Tyrion You will find your father in his solar

My solar thought Tyrion I believe I know the way

The way was up more steps but this time he climbed under his own power with one hand on Pod’s shoulder Bronn opened the door for him Lord Tywin Lannister was seated beneath the window writing by the glow of an oil lamp He raised his eyes at the sound of the latch Tyrion Calmly he laid his quill aside

I’m pleased you remember me my lord Tyrion released his grip on Pod leaned his weight on the stick and waddled closer Something is wrong he knew at once

Ser Bronn Lord Tywin said Podrick Perhaps you had best wait without until we are done

The look Bronn gave the Hand was little less than insolent nonetheless he bowed and withdrew with Pod on his heels The heavy door swung shut behind them and Tyrion Lannister was alone with his father Even with the windows of the solar shuttered against the night the chill in the room was palpable What sort of lies has Cersei been telling him

The Lord of Casterly Rock was as lean as a man twenty years younger even handsome in his austere way Stiff blond whiskers covered his cheeks framing a stern face a bald head a hard mouth About his throat he wore a chain of golden hands the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next That’s a handsome chain Tyrion said Though it looked better on me

Lord Tywin ignored the sally You had best be seated Is it wise for you to be out of your sickbed

I am sick of my sickbed Tyrion knew how much his father despised weakness He claimed the nearest chair Such pleasant chambers you have Would you believe it while I was dying someone moved me to a dark little cell in Maegor’s

The Red Keep is overcrowded with wedding guests Once they depart we will find you more suitable accommodations

I rather liked these accommodations Have you set a date for this great wedding

Joffrey and Margaery shall marry on the first day of the new year which as it happens is also the first day of the new century The ceremony will herald the dawn of a new era

A new Lannister era thought Tyrion Oh bother I fear I’ve made other plans for that day

Did you come here just to complain of your bedchamber and make your lame japes I have important letters to finish

Important letters To be sure

Some battles are won with swords and spears others with quills and ravens Spare me these coy reproaches Tyrion I visited your sickbed as often as Maester Ballabar would allow it when you seemed like to die He steepled his fingers under his chin Why did you dismiss Ballabar

Tyrion shrugged Maester Frenken is not so determined to keep me insensate

Ballabar came to the city in Lord Redwyne’s retinue A gifted healer it’s said It was kind of Cersei to ask him to look after you She feared for your life
