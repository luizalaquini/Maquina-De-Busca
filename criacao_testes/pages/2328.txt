Bran The question confused her Before he fell you mean She had to try and think back It was all so long ago Bran was a sweet boy Everyone loved him He and Tommen fought with wooden swords I remember but just for play

Tyrion lapsed back into moody silence Sansa heard the distant clank of chains from outside the portcullis was being drawn up A moment later there was a shout and their litter swayed into motion Deprived of the passing scenery she chose to stare at her folded hands uncomfortably aware of her husband’s mismatched eyes Why is he looking at me that way

You loved your brothers much as I love Jaime

Is this some Lannister trap to make me speak treason My brothers were traitors and they’ve gone to traitors’ graves It is treason to love a traitor

Her little husband snorted Robb rose in arms against his rightful king By law that made him a traitor The others died too young to know what treason was He rubbed his nose Sansa do you know what happened to Bran at Winterfell

Bran fell He was always climbing things and finally he fell We always feared he would And Theon Greyjoy killed him but that was later

Theon Greyjoy Tyrion sighed Your lady mother once accused me    well I will not burden you with the ugly details She accused me falsely I never harmed your brother Bran And I mean no harm to you

What does he want me to say That is good to know my lord He wanted something from her but Sansa did not know what it was He looks like a starving child but I have no food to give him Why won’t he leave me be

Tyrion rubbed at his scarred scabby nose yet again an ugly habit that drew the eye to his ugly face You have never asked me how Robb died or your lady mother

I    would sooner not know It would give me bad dreams

Then I will say no more

That    that’s kind of you

Oh yes said Tyrion I am the very soul of kindness And I know about bad dreams





TYRION

The new crown that his father had given the Faith stood twice as tall as the one the mob had smashed a glory of crystal and spun gold Rainbow light flashed and shimmered every time the High Septon moved his head but Tyrion had to wonder how the man could bear the weight And even he had to concede that Joffrey and Margaery made a regal couple as they stood side-by-side between the towering gilded statues of the Father and the Mother

The bride was lovely in ivory silk and Myrish lace her skirts decorated with floral patterns picked out in seed pearls As Renly’s widow she might have worn the Baratheon colors gold and black yet she came to them a Tyrell in a maiden’s cloak made of a hundred cloth-of-gold roses sewn to green velvet He wondered if she really was a maiden Not that Joffrey is like to know the difference

The king looked near as splendid as his bride in his doublet of dusky rose beneath a cloak of deep crimson velvet blazoned with his stag and lion The crown rested easily on his curls gold on gold I saved that bloody crown for him Tyrion shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other He could not stand still Too much wine He should have thought to relieve himself before they set out from the Red Keep The sleepless night he’d spent with Shae was making itself felt too but most of all he wanted to strangle his bloody royal nephew

I am no stranger to Valyrian steel the boy had boasted The septons were always going on about how the Father Above judges us all If the Father would be so good as to topple over and crush Joff like a dung beetle I might even believe it

He ought to have seen it long ago Jaime would never send another man to do his killing and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to her but Joff arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that he was   

He remembered a cold morning when he’d climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell’s library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves Send a dog to kill a wolf he said Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark however the Hound would have gone to Cersei Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders merchants and camp followers who’d attached themselves to the king’s party as they made their way north Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince’s favor and a little coin Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran’s throat Joff’s most like No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning

The prince’s own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade Tyrion seemed to recall At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that Instead he went poking among his father’s weapons Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity and would have given his son any dagger he wanted    but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers a huge wheelhouse and a baggage train No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king’s weapons went with him in case he should desire any of them

The blade Joff chose was nice and plain No goldwork no jewels in the hilt no silver inlay on the blade King Robert never wore it had likely forgotten he owned it Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp    sharp enough to slice through skin flesh and muscle in one quick stroke I am no stranger to Valyrian steel But he had been hadn’t he Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger’s knife

The why of it still eluded him Simple cruelty perhaps His nephew had that in abundance It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he’d drunk piss in his breeches or both He squirmed uncomfortably He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast The boy knows I know now My big mouth will be the death of me I swear it

The seven vows were made the seven blessings invoked and the seven promises exchanged When the wedding song had been sung and the challenge had gone unanswered it was time for the exchange of cloaks Tyrion shifted his weight from one stunted leg to the other trying to see between his father and his uncle Kevan If the gods are just Joff will make a hash of this He made certain not to look at Sansa lest his bitterness show in his eyes You might have knelt damn you Would it have been so bloody hard to bend those stiff Stark knees of yours and let me keep a little dignity

Mace Tyrell removed his daughter’s maiden cloak tenderly while Joffrey accepted the folded bride’s cloak from his brother Tommen and shook it out with a flourish The boy king was as tall at thirteen as his bride was at sixteen he would not require a fool’s back to climb upon He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten it at her throat And that easily she passed from her father’s protection to her husband’s But who will protect her from Joff Tyrion glanced at the Knight of Flowers standing with the other Kingsguard You had best keep your sword well honed Ser Loras

With this kiss I pledge my love Joffrey declared in ringing tones When Margaery echoed the words he pulled her close and kissed her long and deep Rainbow lights danced once more about the High Septon’s crown as he solemnly declared Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister and Margaery of House Tyrell to be one flesh one heart one soul

Good that’s done with Now let’s get back to the bloody castle so I can have a piss

Ser Loras and Ser Meryn led the procession from the sept in their white scale armor and snowy cloaks Then came Prince Tommen scattering rose petals from a basket before the king and queen After the royal couple followed Queen Cersei and Lord Tyrell then the bride’s mother arm-in-arm with Lord Tywin The Queen of Thorns tottered after them with one hand on Ser Kevan Lannister’s arm and the other on her cane her twin guardsmen close behind her in case she fell Next came Ser Garlan Tyrell and his lady wife and finally it was their turn

My lady Tyrion offered Sansa his arm She took it dutifully but he could feel her stiffness as they walked up the aisle together She never once looked down at him

He heard them cheering outside even before he reached the doors The mob loved Margaery so much they were even willing to love Joffrey again She had belonged to Renly the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them And the bounty of Highgarden had come with her flowing up the roseroad from the south The fools didn’t seem to remember that it had been Mace Tyrell who closed the roseroad to begin with and made the bloody famine

They stepped out into the crisp autumn air I feared we’d never escape Tyrion quipped

Sansa had no choice but to look at him then I    yes my lord As you say She looked sad It was such a beautiful ceremony though

As ours was not It was long I’ll say that much I need to return to the castle for a good piss Tyrion rubbed the stump of his nose Would that I’d contrived some mission to take me out of the city Littlefinger was the clever one

Joffrey and Margaery stood surrounded by Kingsguard atop the steps that fronted on the broad marble plaza Ser Addam and his gold cloaks held back the crowd while the statue of King Baelor the Blessed gazed down on them benevolently Tyrion had no choice but to queue up with the rest to offer congratulations He kissed Margaery’s fingers and wished her every happiness Thankfully there were others behind them waiting their turn so they did not need to linger long

Their litter had been sitting in the sun and it was very warm inside the curtains As they lurched into motion Tyrion reclined on an elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands She is just as comely as the Tyrell girl Her hair was a rich autumn auburn her eyes a deep Tully blue Grief had given her a haunted vulnerable look if anything it had only made her more beautiful He wanted to reach her to break through the armor of her courtesy Was that what made him speak Or just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder

I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again we might journey to Casterly Rock Far from Joffrey and my sister The more he thought about what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings the more it troubled him There was a message there oh yes It would please me to show you the Golden Gallery and the Lion’s Mouth and the Hall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys You can hear thunder from below where the sea comes in   

She raised her head slowly He knew what she was seeing the swollen brutish brow the raw stump of his nose his crooked pink scar and mismatched eyes Her own eyes were big and blue and empty I shall go wherever my lord husband wishes

I had hoped it might please you my lady

It will please me to please my lord

His mouth tightened What a pathetic little man you are Did you think babbling about the Lion’s Mouth would make her smile When have you ever made a woman smile but with gold No it was a foolish notion Only a Lannister can love the Rock

Yes my lord As you wish

Tyrion could hear the commons shouting out King Joffrey’s name In three years that cruel boy will be a man ruling in his own right    and every dwarf with half his wits will be a long way from King’s Landing Oldtown perhaps Or even the Free Cities He had always had a yen to see the Titan of Braavos Perhaps that would please Sansa Gently he spoke of Braavos and met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall he had walked once in the north It made him weary Then and now

They passed the rest of the journey in silence After a while Tyrion found himself hoping that Sansa would say something anything the merest word but she never spoke When the litter halted in the castle yard he let one of the grooms help her down We will be expected at the feast an hour hence my lady I will join you shortly He walked off stiff-legged Across the yard he could hear Margaery’s breathless laugh as Joffrey swept her from the saddle The boy will be as tall and strong as Jaime one day he thought and I’ll still be a dwarf beneath his feet And one day he’s like to make me even shorter   

He found a privy and sighed gratefully as he relieved himself of the morning’s wine There were times when a piss felt near as good as a woman and this was one He wished he could relieve himself of his doubts and guilts half as easily

Podrick Payne was waiting outside his chambers I laid out your new doublet Not here On your bed In the bedchamber

Yes that’s where we keep the bed Sansa would be in there dressing for the feast Shae as well Wine Pod

Tyrion drank it in his window seat brooding over the chaos of the kitchens below The sun had not yet touched the top of the castle wall but he could smell breads baking and meats roasting The guests would soon be pouring into the throne room full of anticipation this would be an evening of song and splendor designed not only to unite Highgarden and Casterly Rock but to trumpet their power and wealth as a lesson to any who might still think to oppose Joffrey’s rule

But who would be mad enough to contest Joffrey’s rule now after what had befallen Stannis Baratheon and Robb Stark There was still fighting in the riverlands but everywhere the coils were tightening Ser Gregor Clegane had crossed the Trident and seized the ruby ford then captured Harrenhal almost effortlessly Seagard had yielded to Black Walder Frey Lord Randyll Tarly held Maidenpool Duskendale and the kingsroad In the west Ser Daven Lannister had linked up with Ser Forley Prester at the Golden Tooth for a march on Riverrun Ser Ryman Frey was leading two thousand spears down from the Twins to join them And Paxter Redwyne claimed his fleet would soon set sail from the Arbor to begin the long voyage around Dorne and through the Stepstones Stannis’s Lyseni pirates would be outnumbered ten to one The struggle that the maesters were calling the War of the Five Kings was all but at an end Mace Tyrell had been heard complaining that Lord Tywin had left no victories for him
