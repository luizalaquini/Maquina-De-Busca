its body to face the other way Reversals of this kind
strange deformities tremendous paralyses are often seen
to be inflicted by trade upon edifices -- either individual
or in the aggregate as streets and towns -- which were
originally planned for pleasure alone
  Lively voices were heard this morning in the upper
rooms the main staircase to which was of hard oak the
balusters heavy as bed-posts being turned and moulded
in the quaint
P 122
fashion of their century the handrail as
stout as a parapet-top and the stairs themselves con+
tinually twisting round like a person trying to look over
his shoulder Going up the floors above were found
to have a very irregular surface rising to ridges sinking
into valley and being just then uncarpeted the face
of the boards was seen to be eaten into innumerable
the opening and shutting of every door a tremble
followed every bustling movement and a creak accom+
panied a walker about the house like a spirit wherever+
he went
  In the room from which the conversation proceeded
Bathsheba and her servant-companion Liddy Small+
bury were to be discovered sitting upon the floor and
sorting a complication of papers books bottles and
rubbish spread out thereon -- remnants from the house+
hold stores of the late occupier Liddy the maltsters
great-granddaughter was about Bathshebas equal in
age and her face was a prominent advertisement of the
features might have lacked in form was amply made up
for by perfection  of hue which at this winter-time was
the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity
and like the presentations of those great colourists it
was a face which kept well back from the boundary
between comeliness and the ideal Though elastic in
nature she was less daring than Bathsheba and occa+
sionally showed some earnestness which consisted half
of genuine feeling and half of mannerliness superadded
by way of duty
  Through a partly-opened door the noise of a scrubbing+
brush led up to the charwoman Maryann Money a person
who for a face had a circular disc furrowed less by age
than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects To
think of her was to get good-humoured to speak of
her was to raise the image of a dried Normandy
pippin
  Stop your scrubbing a moment said Bathsheba
through the door to her I hear something
  Maryann suspended the brush
P 123
  The tramp of a horse was apparent approaching the
front of the building The paces slackened turned in
at the wicket and what was most unusual came up
the mossy path close to the door The door was
tapped with the end of a crop or stick
  What impertinence said Liddy in a low voice
To ride up the footpath like that Why didnt he
stop at the gate Lord tis a gentleman I see the
top of his hat
  Be quiet said Bathsheba
  The further expression of Liddys concern was con+
tinued by aspect instead of narrative
  Why doesnt Mrs Coggan go to the door Bath+
sheba continued
  Rat-tat-tat-tat resounded more decisively from Bath+
shebas oak
  Maryann you go said she fluttering under the
onset ot a crowd of romantic possibilities
  O maam -- see heres a mess
  The argument was unanswerable after a glance at
Maryann
  Liddy -- you must said Bathsheba
  Liddy held up her hands and arms coated with dust
from the rubbish they were sorting and looked implor+
ingly at her mistress
  There -- -Mrs Coggan is going said Bathsheba
exhaling her relief in the form of a long breath which
had lain in her bosom a minute or more
  The door opened and a deep voice said --
  Is Miss Everdene at home
  Ill see sir said Mrs Coggan and in a minute
appeared in the room
  Dear what a thirtover place this world is con+
tinued Mrs Coggan a wholesome-looking lady who
had a voice for each class of remark according to the
emotion involved who could toss a pancake or twirl
a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics and
who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag+
ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour I
am never up to my elbows Miss in making a pudding
but one of two things do happen -- either my nose must
needs begin

tickling and I cant live without scratching
  A womans dress being a part of her countenance
and any disorder in the one being of the same nature
with a malformation or wound in the other Bathsheba
said at once --
  I cant see him in this state Whatever shall I do
  Not-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury
