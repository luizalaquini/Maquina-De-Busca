Tyrion was disgusted Bind him and take him away he commanded Throw him down in one of the black cells

They dragged him out the splintered door Lannister he moaned all I’ve done has been for Lannister…

When he was gone Tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few more small jars from his shelves The ravens muttered above his head as he worked a strangely peaceful noise He would need to find someone to tend the birds until the Citadel sent a man to replace Pycelle

He was the one I’d hoped to trust Varys and Littlefinger were no more loyal he suspected… only more subtle and thus more dangerous Perhaps his father’s way would have been best summon Ilyn Payne mount three heads above the gates and have done And wouldn’t that be a pretty sight he thought





ARYA

Fear cuts deeper than swords Arya would tell herself but that did not make the fear go away It was as much a part of her days as stale bread and the blisters on her toes after a long day of walking the hard rutted road

She had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid but she learned better in that storehouse beside the Gods Eye Eight days she had lingered there before the Mountain gave the command to march and every day she had seen someone die

The Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning The village folk would never look at him Maybe they thought that if they did not notice him he would not notice them… but he saw them anyway and picked whom he liked There was no place to hide no tricks to play no way to be safe

One girl shared a soldier’s bed three nights running the Mountain picked her on the fourth day and the soldier said nothing

A smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son off serving in the gold cloaks at King’s Landing A king’s man he is he would say a good king’s man like me all for Joffrey He said it so often the other captives began to call him All-for-Joffrey whenever the guards weren’t listening All-for-Joffrey was picked on the fifth day

A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they’d promise not to hurt her daughter The Mountain heard her out the next morning he picked her daughter to be certain she’d held nothing back

The ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives so they could see the fate of rebels and traitors A man the others called the Tickler asked the questions His face was so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers before she had seen him at his work Tickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them He was the man she’d tried to bite who’d called her a fierce little thing and smashed her head with a mailed fist Sometimes he helped the Tickler Sometimes others did that Ser Gregor Clegane himself would stand motionless watching and listening until the victim died

The questions were always the same Was there gold hidden in the village Silver gems Was there more food Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion Which of the village folk had aided him When he rode off where did he go How many men were with them How many knights how many bowmen how many men-at-arms How were they armed How many were horsed How many were wounded What other enemy had they seen How many When What banners did they fly Where did they go Was there gold hidden in the village Silver gems Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion How many men were with him By the third day Arya could have asked the questions herself

They found a little gold a little silver a great sack of copper pennies and a dented goblet set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to blows over They learned that Lord Beric had ten starvelings with him or else a hundred mounted knights that he had ridden west or north or south that he had crossed the lake in a boat that he was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux No one ever survived the Tickler’s questioning no man no woman no child The strongest lasted past evenfall Their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the wolves

By the time they marched Arya knew she was no water dancer Syrio Forel would never have let them knock him down and take his sword away nor stood by when they killed Lommy Greenhands Syrio would never have sat silent in that storehouse nor shuffled along meekly among the other captives The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks but Arya felt more a lamb surrounded by a herd of other sheep She hated the villagers for their sheepishness almost as much as she hated herself

The Lannisters had taken everything father friends home hope courage One had taken Needle while another had broken her wooden stick sword over his knee They had even taken her stupid secret The storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water in some corner when no one was looking but it was different on the road She held it as long as she could but finally she had to squat by a bush and skin down her breeches in front of all of them It was that or wet herself Hot Pie gaped at her with big moon eyes but no one else even troubled to look Girl sheep or boy sheep Ser Gregor and his men did not seem to care

Their captors permitted no chatter A broken lip taught Arya to hold her tongue Others never learned at all One boy of three would not stop calling for his father so they smashed his face in with a spiked mace Then the boy’s mother started screaming and Raff the Sweetling killed her as well

Arya watched them die and did nothing What good did it do you to be brave One of the women picked for questioning had tried to be brave but she had died screaming like all the rest There were no brave people on that march only scared and hungry ones Most were women and children The few men were very old or very young the rest had been chained to that gibbet and left for the wolves and the crows Gendry was only spared because he’d admitted to forging the horned helm himself smiths even apprentice smiths were too valuable to kill

They were being taken to serve Lord Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal the Mountain told them You’re traitors and rebels so thank your gods that Lord Tywin’s giving you this chance It’s more than you’d get from the outlaws Obey serve and live

It’s not just it’s not she heard one wizened old woman complain to another when they had bedded down for the night We never did no treason the others come in and took what they wanted same as this bunch

Lord Beric did us no hurt though her friend whispered And that red priest with him he paid for all they took

Paid He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper I ask you Will it give me eggs She looked about to see that no guards were near and spat three times There’s for the Tullys and there’s for the Lannisters and there’s for the Starks

It’s a sin and a shame an old man hissed When the old king was still alive he’d not have stood for this

King Robert Arya asked forgetting herself

King Aerys gods grace him the old man said too loudly A guard came sauntering over to shut them up The old man lost both his teeth and there was no more talk that night
