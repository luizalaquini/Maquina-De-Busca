Jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant

74 And when they came to Jesus they besought him instantly saying
That he was worthy for whom he should do this 75 For he loveth our
nation and he hath built us a synagogue

76 Then Jesus went with them And when he was now not far from the
house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him Lord
trouble not thyself for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter
under my roof 77 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come
unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed

78 For I also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers
and I say unto one Go and he goeth and to another Come and he
cometh and to my servant Do this and he doeth it

79 When Jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him
about and said unto the people that followed him I say unto you I
have not found so great faith no not in Israel

710 And they that were sent returning to the house found the
servant whole that had been sick

711 And it came to pass the day after that he went into a city
called Nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people

712 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was
a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a
widow and much people of the city was with her

713 And when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said
unto her Weep not

714 And he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood
still

And he said Young man I say unto thee Arise

715 And he that was dead sat up and began to speak And he delivered
him to his mother

716 And there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying
That a great prophet is risen up among us and That God hath visited
his people

717 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea and
throughout all the region round about

718 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things

719 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
Jesus saying Art thou he that should come or look we for another
720 When the men were come unto him they said John Baptist hath
sent us unto thee saying Art thou he that should come or look we
for another  721 And in that same hour he cured many of their
infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were
blind he gave sight

722 Then Jesus answering said unto them Go your way and tell John
what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame
walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to
the poor the gospel is preached

723 And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me

724 And when the messengers of John were departed he began to speak
unto the people concerning John What went ye out into the wilderness
for to see  A reed shaken with the wind  725 But what went ye out
for to see A man clothed in soft raiment  Behold they which are
gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts

726 But what went ye out for to see A prophet Yea I say unto you
and much more than a prophet

727 This is he of whom it is written Behold I send my messenger
before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee

728 For I say unto you Among those that are born of women there is
not a greater prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in
the kingdom of God is greater than he

729 And all the people that heard him and the publicans justified
God being baptized with the baptism of John

730 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
themselves being not baptized of him

731 And the Lord said Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation and to what are they like  732 They are like unto
children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and
saying We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have
mourned to you and ye have not wept

733 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
and ye say He hath a devil

734 The Son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say Behold a
gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
735 But wisdom is justified of all her children
