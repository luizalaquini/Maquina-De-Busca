312 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God
and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my
God and the name of the city of my God which is new Jerusalem which
cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my
new name

313 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches

314 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write These
things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of
the creation of God 315 I know thy works that thou art neither cold
nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot

316 So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
will spue thee out of my mouth

317 Because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and
have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and
miserable and poor and blind and naked 318 I counsel thee to buy
of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white
raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
thou mayest see

319 As many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
and repent

320 Behold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice
and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and
he with me

321 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne
even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in his throne

322 He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches

41 After this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and
the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with
me which said Come up hither and I will shew thee things which must
be hereafter

42 And immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set
in heaven and one sat on the throne

43 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like
unto an emerald

44 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon
the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white
raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold

45 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne
which are the seven Spirits of God

46 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal
and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four
beasts full of eyes before and behind

47 And the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a
calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast
was like a flying eagle

48 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they
were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying
Holy holy holy LORD God Almighty which was and is and is to
come

49 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever 410 The four and
twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship
him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the
throne saying 411 Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and
honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy
pleasure they are and were created

51 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals

52 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Who is
worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof  53 And no
man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open
the book neither to look thereon

54 And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to
read the book neither to look thereon

55 And one of the elders saith unto me Weep not behold the Lion of
the tribe of Juda the Root of David hath prevailed to open the book
and to loose the seven seals thereof

56 And I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four
beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a Lamb as it had been
slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits
of God sent forth into all the earth
