stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the
Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed
clean over Jordan

41 And it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over
Jordan that the LORD spake unto Joshua saying 42 Take you twelve
men out of the people out of every tribe a man 43 And command ye
them saying Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan out of the
place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall
carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where
ye shall lodge this night

44 Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the
children of Israel out of every tribe a man 45 And Joshua said unto
them Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of
Jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel 46
That this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their
fathers in time to come saying What mean ye by these stones  47
Then ye shall answer them That the waters of Jordan were cut off
before the ark of the covenant of the LORD when it passed over
Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off and these stones shall be
for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever

48 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up
twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan as the LORD spake unto
Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of
Israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they
lodged and laid them down there

49 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan in the
place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant
stood and they are there unto this day

410 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan
until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak
unto the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the
people hasted and passed over

411 And it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over
that the ark of the LORD passed over and the priests in the presence
of the people

412 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and half the
tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the children of Israel as
Moses spake unto them 413 About forty thousand prepared for war
passed over before the LORD unto battle to the plains of Jericho

414 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel
and they feared him as they feared Moses all the days of his life

415 And the LORD spake unto Joshua saying 416 Command the priests
that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of Jordan

417 Joshua therefore commanded the priests saying Come ye up out of
Jordan

418 And it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan and the
soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the
waters of Jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his
banks as they did before

419 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
first month and encamped in Gilgal in the east border of Jericho

420 And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan did
Joshua pitch in Gilgal

421 And he spake unto the children of Israel saying When your
children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying What mean
these stones  422 Then ye shall let your children know saying
Israel came over this Jordan on dry land

423 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
you until ye were passed over as the LORD your God did to the Red
sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over 424
That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that
it is mighty that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever

51 And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites which
were on the side of Jordan westward and all the kings of the
Canaanites which were by the sea heard that the LORD had dried up
the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were
passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them
any more because of the children of Israel

52 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua Make thee sharp knives
and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time

53 And Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of
Israel at the hill of the foreskins

54 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise All the people
that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of war died
in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt

55 Now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the
people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth
out of Egypt them they had not circumcised
