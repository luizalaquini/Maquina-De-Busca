ways and to cleave unto him 1123 Then will the LORD drive out all
these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations
and mightier than yourselves

1124 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
yours from the wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river
Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be

1125 There shall no man be able to stand before you for the LORD
your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the
land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you

1126 Behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse 1127
A blessing if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I
command you this day 1128 And a curse if ye will not obey the
commandments of the LORD your God but turn aside out of the way which
I command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not
known

1129 And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou
shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim and the curse upon mount
Ebal

1130 Are they not on the other side Jordan by the way where the sun
goeth down in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the
champaign over against Gilgal beside the plains of Moreh  1131 For
ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD
your God giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein

1132 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which
I set before you this day

121 These are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to
do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to
possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth

122 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations
which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and
upon the hills and under every green tree 123 And ye shall
overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves
with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and
destroy the names of them out of that place

124 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God

125 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall
ye seek and thither thou shalt come 126 And thither ye shall bring
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave
offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings
and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks 127 And there ye
shall eat before the LORD your God and ye shall rejoice in all that
ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the LORD thy
God hath blessed thee

128 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day
every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes

129 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance
which the LORD your God giveth you

1210 But when ye go over Jordan and dwell in the land which the LORD
your God giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all
your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety 1211 Then there
shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his
name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that I command you
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave
offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the
LORD 1212 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God ye and
your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your
maidservants and the Levite that is within your gates forasmuch as
he hath no part nor inheritance with you

1213 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
every place that thou seest 1214 But in the place which the LORD
shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt
offerings and there thou shalt do all that I command thee

1215 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the
LORD thy God which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may
eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart

1216 Only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth
as water

1217 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or
of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill
offerings or heave offering of thine hand 1218 But thou must eat
them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and
thy maidservant and the Levite that is within thy gates and thou
shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine
hands unto

1219 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
thou livest upon the earth
