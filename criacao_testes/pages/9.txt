Go to her Ned urged Take the children Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter That boy of hers needs other children about him and Lysa should not be alone in her grief

Would that I could Catelyn said The letter had other tidings The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out

It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words but when the understanding came the darkness left his eyes Robert is coming here When she nodded a smile broke across his face

Catelyn wished she could share his joy But she had heard the talk in the yards a direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat Dread coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who put no faith in signs I knew that would please you she said We should send word to your brother on the Wall

Yes of course he agreed Ben will want to be here I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird Ned rose and pulled her to her feet Damnation how many years has it been And he gives us no more notice than this How many in his party did the message say

I should think a hundred knights at the least with all their retainers and half again as many freeriders Cersei and the children travel with them

Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes he said It is just as well That will give us more time to prepare

The queen’s brothers are also in the party she told him

Ned grimaced at that There was small love between him and the queen’s family Catelyn knew The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert’s cause when victory was all but certain and he had never forgiven them Well if the price for Robert’s company is an infestation of Lannisters so be it It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court

Where the king goes the realm follows she said

It will be good to see the children The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman’s teat the last time I saw him He must be what five by now

Prince Tommen is seven she told him The same age as Bran Please Ned guard your tongue The Lannister woman is our queen and her pride is said to grow with every passing year

Ned squeezed her hand There must be a feast of course with singers and Robert will want to hunt I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back Gods how are we going to feed them all On his way already you said Damn the man Damn his royal hide





DAENERYS

Her brother held the gown up for her inspection This is beauty Touch it Go on Caress the fabric

Dany touched it The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft It frightened her She pulled her hand away Is it really mine

A gift from the Magister Illyrio Viserys said smiling Her brother was in a high mood tonight The color will bring out the violet in your eyes And you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts Illyrio has promised Tonight you must look like a princess

A princess Dany thought She had forgotten what that was like Perhaps she had never really known Why does he give us so much she asked What does he want from us For nigh on half a year they had lived in the magister’s house eating his food pampered by his servants Dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of Pentos

Illyrio is no fool Viserys said He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne

Dany said nothing Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities it was said and even beyond in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea It was also said that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully sell for the right price Dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream His anger was a terrible thing when roused Viserys called it waking the dragon

Her brother hung the gown beside the door Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables Khal Drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount He studied her critically You still slouch Straighten yourself He pushed back her shoulders with his hands Let them see that you have a woman’s shape now His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple You will not fail me tonight If you do it will go hard for you You don’t want to wake the dragon do you His fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic Do you he repeated

No Dany said meekly

Her brother smiled Good He touched her hair almost with affection When they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight

When he was gone Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate For a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo’s manse

Somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli the land of the Andals In the Free Cities they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms Her brother had a simpler name Our land he called it The words were like a prayer with him If he said them enough the gods were sure to hear Ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever You do not steal from the dragon oh no The dragon remembers
