Is the doublet new

It is You’re most observant

Plum and yellow Are those the colors of your House

No But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out or so I’ve found

That’s a handsome knife as well

Is it There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes He drew the knife and glanced at it casually as if he had never seen it before Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt A trifle plain though It’s yours if you would like it

Mine Tyrion gave him a long look No I think not Never mine He knows the insolent wretch He knows and he knows that I know and he thinks that I cannot touch him

If ever truly a man had armored himself in gold it was Petyr Baelish not Jaime Lannister Jaime’s famous armor was but gilded steel but Littlefinger ah    Tyrion had learned a few things about sweet Petyr to his growing disquiet

Ten years ago Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king’s other collectors King Robert had been a prodigious spender A man like Petyr Baelish who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third was invaluable to his Hand Littlefinger’s rise had been arrow-swift Within three years of his coming to court he was master of coin and a member of the small council and today the crown’s revenues were ten times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor    though the crown’s debts had grown vast as well A master juggler was Petyr Baelish

Oh he was clever He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault no He paid the king’s debts in promises and put the king’s gold to work He bought wagons shops ships houses He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys stored it moved it dyed it sold it The golden dragons bred and multiplied and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings

And in the process he moved his own men into place The Keepers of the Keys were his all four The King’s Counter and the King’s Scales were men he’d named The officers in charge of all three mints Harbormasters tax farmers customs sergeants wool factors toll collectors pursers wine factors nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger They were men of middling birth by and large merchants’ sons lesser lordlings sometimes even foreigners but judging from their results far more able than their highborn predecessors

No one had ever thought to question the appointments and why should they Littlefinger was no threat to anyone A clever smiling genial man everyone’s friend always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required and yet of such undistinguished birth one step up from a hedge knight he was not a man to fear He had no banners to call no army of retainers no great stronghold no holdings to speak of no prospects of a great marriage

But do I dare touch him Tyrion wondered Even if he is a traitor He was not at all certain he could least of all now while the war raged Given time he could replace Littlefinger’s men with his own in key positions but   

A shout rang up from the yard Ah His Grace has killed a hare Lord Baelish observed

No doubt a slow one Tyrion said My lord you were fostered at Riverrun I’ve heard it said that you grew close to the Tullys

You might say so The girls especially

How close

I had their maidenhoods Is that close enough

The lie—Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie—was delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied About her defloration and the dagger as well The longer he lived the more Tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true Lord Hoster’s daughters do not love me he confessed I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make Yet coming from you the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears

That would depend on the words If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother waste someone else’s time Joffrey will never surrender his plaything and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl

I mean to have Arya as well I have men searching

Searching is not finding

I’ll keep that in mind my lord In any case it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway For her I have a sweeter offer

Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn true    but also more fearful and I understand she hates you

She believes she has good reason When I was her guest in the Eyrie she insisted that I’d murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials He leaned forward If I gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer she might think more kindly of me

That made Littlefinger sit up True killer I confess you make me curious Who do you propose

It was Tyrion’s turn to smile Gifts I give my friends freely Lysa Arryn would need to understand that

Is it her friendship you require or her swords

Both

Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard Lysa has woes of her own Clansmen raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon in greater numbers than ever before    and better armed

Distressing said Tyrion Lannister who had armed them I could help her with that A word from me   

And what would this word cost her

I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king to swear fealty and to—

—make war on the Starks and Tullys Littlefinger shook his head There’s the roach in your pudding Lannister Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun

Nor would I ask it We have no lack of enemies I’ll use her power to oppose Lord Renly or Lord Stannis should he stir from Dragonstone In return I will give her justice for Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East as his father was before him I want to see him fly a boy’s voice whispered faintly in memory And to seal the bargain I will give her my niece

He had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish’s grey-green eyes Myrcella

When she comes of age she can wed little Lord Robert Until such time she’ll be Lady Lysa’s ward at the Eyrie

And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy When Tyrion shrugged Littlefinger burst into laughter I thought not You’re a dangerous little man Lannister Yes I could sing this song to Lysa Again the sly smile the mischief in his glance If I cared to

Tyrion nodded waiting knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence

So Lord Petyr continued after a pause utterly unabashed what’s in your pot for me

Harrenhal

It was interesting to watch his face Lord Petyr’s father had been the smallest of small lords his grandfather a landless hedge knight by birth he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms its lands broad and rich and fertile its great castle as formidable as any in the realm    and so large as to dwarf Riverrun where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to Lord Hoster’s daughter

Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat’s eyes I have him he knew Harrenhal is cursed Lord Petyr said after a moment trying to sound bored

Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself You’ll have no lack of coin I mean to make you liege lord of the Trident These river lords have proven they cannot be trusted Let them do you fealty for their lands

Even the Tullys

If there are any Tullys left when we are done

Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb He was trying to watch for bees but the honey was so sweet Harrenhal and all its lands and incomes he mused With a stroke you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm Not that I’m ungrateful my lord but—why

You served my sister well in the matter of the succession

As did Janos Slynt On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed—only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use

Tyrion laughed You have me my lord What can I say I need you to deliver the Lady Lysa I did not need Janos Slynt He gave a crooked shrug I’d sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne What could be plainer
