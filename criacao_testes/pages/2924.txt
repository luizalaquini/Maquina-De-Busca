119145 I cried with my whole heart hear me O LORD I will keep thy
statutes

119146 I cried unto thee save me and I shall keep thy testimonies

119147 I prevented the dawning of the morning and cried I hoped in
thy word

119148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches that I might meditate in
thy word

119149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness O LORD
quicken me according to thy judgment

119150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief they are far from
thy law

119151 Thou art near O LORD and all thy commandments are truth

119152 Concerning thy testimonies I have known of old that thou hast
founded them for ever

119153 Consider mine affliction and deliver me for I do not forget
thy law

119154 Plead my cause and deliver me quicken me according to thy
word

119155 Salvation is far from the wicked for they seek not thy
statutes

119156 Great are thy tender mercies O LORD quicken me according to
thy judgments

119157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies yet do I not decline
from thy testimonies

119158 I beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they kept
not thy word

119159 Consider how I love thy precepts quicken me O LORD
according to thy lovingkindness

119160 Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy
righteous judgments endureth for ever

119161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart
standeth in awe of thy word

119162 I rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil

119163 I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I love

119164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
judgments

119165 Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall
offend them

119166 LORD I have hoped for thy salvation and done thy
commandments

119167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies and I love them
exceedingly

119168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies for all my ways
are before thee

119169 Let my cry come near before thee O LORD give me
understanding according to thy word

119170 Let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to
thy word

119171 My lips shall utter praise when thou hast taught me thy
statutes

119172 My tongue shall speak of thy word for all thy commandments
are righteousness

119173 Let thine hand help me for I have chosen thy precepts

119174 I have longed for thy salvation O LORD and thy law is my
delight

119175 Let my soul live and it shall praise thee and let thy
judgments help me

119176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servant for I
do not forget thy commandments



1201 In my distress I cried unto the LORD and he heard me

1202 Deliver my soul O LORD from lying lips and from a deceitful
tongue

1203 What shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee
