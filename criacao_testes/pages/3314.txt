a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them 1110 Let their eyes be
darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway

1111 I say then Have they stumbled that they should fall God
forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy

1112 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their
fulness  1113 For I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office 1114 If by any means
I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save
some of them

1115 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world
what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead  1116
For if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root
be holy so are the branches

1117 And if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a
wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest
of the root and fatness of the olive tree 1118 Boast not against the
branches But if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root
thee

1119 Thou wilt say then The branches were broken off that I might
be graffed in

1120 Well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou
standest by faith Be not highminded but fear 1121 For if God
spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not
thee

1122 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which
fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his
goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off

1123 And they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be
graffed in for God is able to graff them in again

1124 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree
how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed
into their own olive tree  1125 For I would not brethren that ye
should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own
conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in

1126 And so all Israel shall be saved as it is written There shall
come out of Sion the Deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from
Jacob 1127 For this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away
their sins

1128 As concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but
as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes

1129 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance

1130 For as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now
obtained mercy through their unbelief 1131 Even so have these also
now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy

1132 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have
mercy upon all

1133 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God  how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding
out  1134 For who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been
his counsellor  1135 Or who hath first given to him and it shall be
recompensed unto him again  1136 For of him and through him and to
him are all things to whom be glory for ever Amen

121 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God
which is your reasonable service

122 And be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and
acceptable and perfect will of God

123 For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is
among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think
but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith

124 For as we have many members in one body and all members have not
the same office 125 So we being many are one body in Christ and
every one members one of another

126 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion
of faith 127 Or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that
teacheth on teaching 128 Or he that exhorteth on exhortation he
that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with
diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness

129 Let love be without dissimulation Abhor that which is evil
cleave to that which is good

1210 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in
