1828 And there was no deliverer because it was far from Zidon and
they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth
by Bethrehob And they built a city and dwelt therein

1829 And they called the name of the city Dan after the name of Dan
their father who was born unto Israel howbeit the name of the city
was Laish at the first

1830 And the children of Dan set up the graven image and Jonathan
the son of Gershom the son of Manasseh he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land

1831 And they set them up Micahs graven image which he made all
the time that the house of God was in Shiloh

191 And it came to pass in those days when there was no king in
Israel that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of
mount Ephraim who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah

192 And his concubine played the whore against him and went away
from him unto her fathers house to Bethlehemjudah and was there four
whole months

193 And her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto
her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple
of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the
father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him

194 And his father in law the damsels father retained him and he
abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged
there

195 And it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in
the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father said
unto his son in law Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and
afterward go your way

196 And they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together
for the damsels father had said unto the man Be content I pray
thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry

197 And when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him
therefore he lodged there again

198 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and
the damsels father said Comfort thine heart I pray thee And they
tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them

199 And when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and
his servant his father in law the damsels father said unto him
Behold now the day draweth toward evening I pray you tarry all
night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart
may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou
mayest go home

1910 But the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and
departed and came over against Jebus which is Jerusalem and there
were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him

1911 And when they were by Jebus the day was far spent and the
servant said unto his master Come I pray thee and let us turn in
into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it

1912 And his master said unto him We will not turn aside hither into
the city of a stranger that is not of the children of Israel we will
pass over to Gibeah

1913 And he said unto his servant Come and let us draw near to one
of these places to lodge all night in Gibeah or in Ramah

1914 And they passed on and went their way and the sun went down
upon them when they were by Gibeah which belongeth to Benjamin

1915 And they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in Gibeah
and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for
there was no man that took them into his house to lodging

1916 And behold there came an old man from his work out of the
field at even which was also of mount Ephraim and he sojourned in
Gibeah but the men of the place were Benjamites

1917 And when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city and the old man said Whither goest thou and
whence comest thou  1918 And he said unto him We are passing from
Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim from thence am I and
I went to Bethlehemjudah but I am now going to the house of the LORD
and there is no man that receiveth me to house

1919 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there
is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young
man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing

1920 And the old man said Peace be with thee howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street

1921 So he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the
asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink

1922 Now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of
