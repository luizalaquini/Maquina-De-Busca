921 And Joram said Make ready And his chariot was made ready And
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out each in his
chariot and they went out against Jehu and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite

922 And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu that he said Is it
peace Jehu And he answered What peace so long as the whoredoms of
thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many  923 And Joram
turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah There is treachery O
Ahaziah

924 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram
between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk
down in his chariot

925 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain Take up and cast him in
the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite for remember how
that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father the LORD
laid this burden upon him 926 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood
of Naboth and the blood of his sons saith the LORD and I will
requite thee in this plat saith the LORD Now therefore take and cast
him into the plat of ground according to the word of the LORD

927 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this he fled by the way
of the garden house And Jehu followed after him and said Smite him
also in the chariot And they did so at the going up to Gur which is
by Ibleam

And he fled to Megiddo and died there

928 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and
buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David

929 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
to reign over Judah

930 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she
painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window

931 And as Jehu entered in at the gate she said Had Zimri peace
who slew his master  932 And he lifted up his face to the window
and said Who is on my side  who And there looked out to him two or
three eunuchs

933 And he said Throw her down So they threw her down and some of
her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode
her under foot

934 And when he was come in he did eat and drink and said Go see
now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter

935 And they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the
skull and the feet and the palms of her hands

936 Wherefore they came again and told him And he said This is the
word of the LORD which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite
saying In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel
937 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of Jezreel so that they shall not say This is
Jezebel

101 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria And Jehu wrote letters and
sent to Samaria unto the rulers of Jezreel to the elders and to
them that brought up Ahabs children saying 102 Now as soon as this
letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and
there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and
armour 103 Look even out the best and meetest of your masters sons
and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house

104 But they were exceedingly afraid and said Behold two kings
stood not before him how then shall we stand  105 And he that was
over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and
the bringers up of the children sent to Jehu saying We are thy
servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any
king do thou that which is good in thine eyes

106 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying If ye be
mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the
men your masters sons and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this
time Now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great
men of the city which brought them up

107 And it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took
the kings sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in
baskets and sent him them to Jezreel

108 And there came a messenger and told him saying They have
brought the heads of the kings sons And he said Lay ye them in two
heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning

109 And it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood
and said to all the people Ye be righteous behold I conspired
against my master and slew him but who slew all these  1010 Know
now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the
LORD which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab for the LORD
hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah

1011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel
and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he
