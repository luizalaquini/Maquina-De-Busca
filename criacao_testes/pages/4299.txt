If a finite stretch of a speech waveform is isolated and Fourier transformed
without regard to pitch of the speech then the periodicity assumption will
be grossly violated  Figure 47 illustrates that the effect is the same
as
multiplying the signal by a rectangular
ul
window function
which is 0 except during the period to be analysed where it is 1
FC Figure 47
The windowed sequence will almost certainly have discontinuities at its edges
and these will affect the resulting spectrum  The effect can be analysed
quite easily but we will not do so here  It is enough to say that the
high frequencies associated with the edges of the window cause considerable
distortion of the spectrum  The effect can be alleviated by
using a smoother window than a rectangular one
and several have been investigated extensively  The commonly-used windows of
Bartlett Blackman and Hamming are illustrated in Figure 48

Because the DFT produces the same number of frequency samples equally spaced
as there were points in the time waveform there is a tradeoff between
frequency resolution and time resolution for a given sampling rate
For example a 256-point transform with a sample rate of 8 kHz gives the 256
equally-spaced frequency components between 0 and 8 kHz that are shown in Table

with 8 kHz sampling

The top half of the frequency spectrum is of no interest because
it contains the complex conjugates of the bottom half in reverse order
corresponding to frequencies greater than half the sampling frequency
Thus for a 30 Hz resolution in the frequency domain
256 time samples or a 32 msec stretch of speech needs to be transformed
A common technique is to take overlapping periods in the time domain to
give a new frequency spectrum every 16 msec  From the acoustic point
of view this is a reasonable rate to re-compute the spectrum for as noted
above when discussing channel vocoders the rate of change in the spectrum
is limited by the speed that the speaker can move his vocal organs and
anything between 10 and 25 msec is a reasonable figure for transmitting
or storing the spectrum

The DFT is a complex transform and speech is a real signal  It is possible
to do two DFTs at once by putting one time waveform into the real parts
of the input and another into the imaginary parts  This destroys the DFT
symmetry property for it only holds for real inputs  But given the DFT
of a complex sequence formed in this way it is easy to separate out the
DFTs of the two real time sequences  If the two time sequences are
xn and yn then the transform of the complex sequence

It follows that the complex conjugate of the aliased parts of the spectrum
in the upper frequency region are

GN-r sup   =  sum from n=0 to N-1 xnW sup -N-rn

and this is the same as
