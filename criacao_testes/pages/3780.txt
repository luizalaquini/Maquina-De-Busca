Robb considered that a moment Did you know what Lord Rickard intended Did you see the knives drawn Did you hear the shouts the screams the cries for mercy

Aye I did but I took no part I was only the watcher I swear it…

Lord Umber said Robb this one was only the watcher Hang him last so he may watch the others die Mother Uncle with me if you please He turned away as the Greatjon’s men closed upon the prisoners and drove them from the hall at spearpoint Outside the thunder crashed and boomed so loud it sounded as if the castle were coming down about their ears Is this the sound of a kingdom falling Catelyn wondered

It was dark within the audience chamber but at least the sound of the thunder was muffled by another thickness of wall A servant entered with an oil lamp to light the fire but Robb sent him away and kept the lamp There were tables and chairs but only Edmure sat and he rose again when he realized that the others had remainded standing Robb took off his crown and placed it on the table before him

The Blackfish shut the door The Karstarks are gone

All Was it anger or despair that thickened Robb’s voice like that Even Catelyn was not certain

All the fighting men Ser Brynden replied A few camp followers and serving men were left with their wounded We questioned as many as we needed to be certain of the truth They started leaving at nightfall stealing off in ones and twos at first and then in larger groups The wounded men and servants were told to keep the campfires lit so no one would know they’d gone but once the rains began it didn’t matter

Will they re-form away from Riverrun asked Robb

No They’ve scattered hunting Lord Karstark has sworn to give the hand of his maiden daughter to any man highborn or low who brings him the head of the Kingslayer

Gods be good Catelyn felt ill again

Near three hundred riders and twice as many mounts melted away in the night Robb rubbed his temples where the crown had left its mark in the soft skin above his ears All the mounted strength of Karhold lost

Lost by me By me may the gods forgive me Catelyn did not need to be a soldier to grasp the trap Robb was in For the moment he held the riverlands but his kingdom was surrounded by enemies to every side but east where Lysa sat aloof on her mountaintop Even the Trident was scarce secure so long as the Lord of the Crossing withheld his allegiance And now to lose the Karstarks as well…

No word of this must leave Riverrun her brother Edmure said Lord Tywin would… the Lannisters pay their debts they are always saying that Mother have mercy when he hears

Sansa Catelyn’s nails dug into the soft flesh of her palms so hard did she close her hand

Robb gave Edmure a look that chilled Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer Uncle

We need speak no falsehood Only say nothing Bury the boys and hold our tongues till the war’s done Willem was son to Ser Kevan Lannister and Lord Tywin’s nephew Tion was Lady Genna’s and a Frey We must keep the news from the Twins as well until…

Until we can bring the murdered dead back to life said Brynden Blackfish sharply The truth escaped with the Karstarks Edmure It is too late for such games

I owe their fathers truth said Robb And justice I owe them that as well He gazed at his crown the dark gleam of bronze the circle of iron swords Lord Rickard defied me Betrayed me I have no choice but to condemn him Gods know what the Karstark foot with Roose Bolton will do when they hear I’ve executed their liege for a traitor Bolton must be warned

Lord Karstark’s heir was at Harrenhal as well Ser Brynden reminded him The eldest son the one the Lannisters took captive on the Green Fork

Harrion His name is Harrion Robb laughed bitterly A king had best know the names of his enemies don’t you think

The Blackfish looked at him shrewdly You know that for a certainty That this will make young Karstark your enemy

What else would he be I am about to kill his father he’s not like to thank me

He might There are sons who hate their fathers and in a stroke you will make him Lord of Karhold

Robb shook his head Even if Harrion were that sort he could never openly forgive his father’s killer His own men would turn on him These are northmen Uncle The north remembers

Pardon him then urged Edmure Tully

Robb stared at him in frank disbelief

Under that gaze Edmure’s face reddened Spare his life I mean I don’t like the taste of it any more than you sire He slew my men as well Poor Delp had only just recovered from the wound Ser Jaime gave him Karstark must be punished certainly Keep him in chains say

A hostage said Catelyn It might be best…

Yes a hostage Her brother seized on her musing as agreement Tell the son that so long as he remains loyal his father will not be harmed Otherwise… we have no hope of the Freys now not if I offered to marry all Lord Walder’s daughters and carry his litter besides If we should lose the Karstarks as well what hope is there

What hope… Robb let out a breath pushed his hair back from his eyes and said We’ve had naught from Ser Rodrik in the north no response from Walder Frey to our new offer only silence from the Eyrie He appealed to his mother Will your sister never answer us How many times must I write her I will not believe that none of the birds have reached her

Her son wanted comfort Catelyn realized he wanted to hear that it would be all right But her king needed truth The birds have reached her Though she may tell you they did not if it ever comes to that Expect no help from that quarter Robb

Lysa was never brave When we were girls together she would run and hide whenever she’d done something wrong Perhaps she thought our lord father would forget to be wroth with her if he could not find her It is no different now She ran from King’s Landing for fear to the safest place she knows and she sits on her mountain hoping everyone will forget her

The knights of the Vale could make all the difference in this war said Robb but if she will not fight so be it I’ve asked only that she open the Bloody Gate for us and provide ships at Gulltown to take us north The high road would be hard but not so hard as fighting our way up the Neck If I could land at White Harbor I could flank Moat Cailin and drive the ironmen from the north in half a year

It will not happen sire said the Blackfish Cat is right Lady Lysa is too fearful to admit an army to the Vale Any army The Bloody Gate will remain closed

The Others can take her then Robb cursed in a fury of despair Bloody Rickard Karstark as well And Theon Greyjoy Walder Frey Tywin Lannister and all the rest of them Gods be good why would any man ever want to be king When everyone was shouting King in the North King in the North I told myself… swore to myself… that I would be a good king as honorable as Father strong just loyal to my friends and brave when I faced my enemies… now I can’t even tell one from the other How did it all get so confused Lord Rickard’s fought at my side in half a dozen battles His sons died for me in the Whispering Wood Tion Frey and Willem Lannister were my enemies Yet now I have to kill my dead friends’ father for their sakes He looked at them all Will the Lannisters thank me for Lord Rickard’s head Will the Freys

No said Brynden Blackfish blunt as ever

All the more reason to spare Lord Rickard’s life and keep him hostage Edmure urged

Robb reached down with both hands lifted the heavy bronze-and-iron crown and set it back atop his head and suddenly he was a king again Lord Rickard dies

But why said Edmure You said yourself—

I know what I said Uncle It does not change what I must do The swords in his crown stood stark and black against his brow In battle I might have slain Tion and Willem myself but this was no battle They were asleep in their beds naked and unarmed in a cell where I put them Rickard Karstark killed more than a Frey and a Lannister He killed my honor I shall deal with him at dawn

When day broke grey and chilly the storm had diminished to a steady soaking rain yet even so the godswood was crowded River lords and northmen highborn and low knights and sellswords and stableboys they stood amongst the trees to see the end of the night’s dark dance Edmure had given commands and a headsman’s block had been set up before the heart tree Rain and leaves fell all around them as the Greatjon’s men led Lord Rickard Karstark through the press hands still bound His men already hung from Riverrun’s high walls slumping at the end of long ropes as the rain washed down their darkening faces

Long Lew waited beside the block but Robb took the poleaxe from his hand and ordered him to step aside This is my work he said He dies at my word He must die by my hand

Lord Rickard Karstark dipped his head stiffly For that much I thank you But for naught else He had dressed for death in a long black wool surcoat emblazoned with the white sunburst of his House The blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours boy You would do well to remember that I was named for your grandfather I raised my banners against King Aerys for your father and against King Joffrey for you At Oxcross and the Whispering Wood and in the Battle of the Camps I rode beside you and I stood with Lord Eddard on the Trident We are kin Stark and Karstark

This kinship did not stop you from betraying me Robb said And it will not save you now Kneel my lord

Lord Rickard had spoken truly Catelyn knew The Karstarks traced their descent to Karlon Stark a younger son of Winterfell who had put down a rebel lord a thousand years ago and been granted lands for his valor The castle he built had been named Karl’s Hold but that soon became Karhold and over the centuries the Karhold Starks had become Karstarks

Old gods or new it makes no matter Lord Rickard told her son no man is so accursed as the kinslayer

Kneel traitor Robb said again Or must I have them force your head onto the block

Lord Karstark knelt The gods shall judge you as you have judged me He laid his head upon the block

Rickard Karstark Lord of Karhold Robb lifted the heavy axe with both hands Here in sight of gods and men I judge you guilty of murder and high treason In mine own name I condemn you With mine own hand I take your life Would you speak a final word

Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine
