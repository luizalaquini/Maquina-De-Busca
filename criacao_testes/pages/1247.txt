Rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios Khaleesi better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows who dare not show their face beneath the sun It is known

It is known Aggo agreed

Xaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions When Dany climbed back into the palanquin beside him he said Your savages are wiser than they know Such truths as the Asshai’i hoard are not like to make you smile Then he pressed another cup of wine on her and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse

In the quiet of her chambers Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk Her dragons were hungry so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier They are growing she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the blackened flesh They must weigh twice what they had in Vaes Tolorro Even so it would be years before they were large enough to take to war And they must be trained as well or they will lay my kingdom waste For all her Targaryen blood Dany had not the least idea of how to train a dragon

Ser Jorah Mormont came to her as the sun was going down The Pureborn refused you

As you said they would Come sit give me your counsel Dany drew him down to the cushions beside her and Jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine

You will get no help in this city Khaleesi Ser Jorah took an onion between thumb and forefinger Each day I am more convinced of that than the day before The Pureborn see no farther than the walls of Qarth and Xaro…

He asked me to marry him again

Yes and I know why When the knight frowned his heavy black brows joined together above his deep-set eyes

He dreams of me day and night She laughed

Forgive me my queen but it is your dragons he dreams of

Xaro assures me that in Qarth man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed The dragons are mine She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her

He tells it true as far as it goes but there’s one thing he failed to mention The Qartheen have a curious wedding custom my queen On the day of their union a wife may ask a token of love from her husband Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods he must grant And he may ask the same of her One thing only may be asked but whatever is named may not be denied

One thing she repeated And it may not be denied

With one dragon Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city but one ship will further our cause but little

Dany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men We passed through the bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones she told Ser Jorah Quaithe was there She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder and what the woman in the red mask had told her

I would be glad to leave this city if truth be told the knight said when she was done But not for Asshai

Where then

East he said

I am half a world away from my kingdom even here If I go any farther east I may never find my way home to Westeros

If you go west you risk your life

House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities she reminded him Truer friends than Xaro or the Pureborn

If you mean Illyrio Mopatis I wonder For sufficient gold Illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would a slave

My brother and I were guests in Illyrio’s manse for half a year If he meant to sell us he could have done it then

He did sell you Ser Jorah said To Khal Drogo

Dany flushed He had the truth of it but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it Illyrio protected us from the Usurper’s knives and he believed in my brother’s cause

Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio Gluttons are greedy men as a rule and magisters are devious Illyrio Mopatis is both What do you truly know of him

I know that he gave me my dragon eggs

He snorted If he’d known they were like to hatch he’d would have sat on them himself

That made her smile despite herself Oh I have no doubt of that ser I know Illyrio better than you think I was a child when I left his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars but I was neither deaf nor blind And I am no child now

Even if Illyrio is the friend you think him the knight said stubbornly he is not powerful enough to enthrone you by himself no more than he could your brother

He is rich she said Not so rich as Xaro perhaps but rich enough to hire ships for me and men as well

Sellswords have their uses Ser Jorah admitted but you will not win your father’s throne with sweepings from the Free Cities Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil

I am their rightful queen Dany protested

You are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the Common Tongue The lords of Westeros do not know you and have every reason to fear and mistrust you You must win them over before you sail A few at least

And how am I to do that if I go east as you counsel

He ate an olive and spit out the pit into his palm I do not know Your Grace he admitted but I do know that the longer you remain in one place the easier it will be for your enemies to find you The name Targaryen still frightens them so much so that they sent a man to murder you when they heard you were with child What will they do when they learn of your dragons

Drogon was curled up beneath her arm as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun Rhaegal and Viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat buffeting each other with their wings as smoke hissed from their nostrils My furious children she thought They must not come to harm The comet led me to Qarth for a reason I had hoped to find my army here but it seems that will not be What else remains I ask myself I am afraid she realized but I must be brave Come the morrow you must go to Pyat Pree





TYRION

The girl never wept Young as she was Myrcella Baratheon was a princess born And a Lannister despite her name Tyrion reminded himself as much Jaime’s blood as Cersei’s

To be sure her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on the deck of the Seaswift but the girl knew the proper words to say and she said them with courage and dignity When the time came to part it was Prince Tommen who cried and Myrcella who gave him comfort

Tyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of King Robert’s Hammer a great war galley of four hundred oars Rob’s Hammer as her oarsmen called her would form the main strength of Myrcella’s escort Lionstar Bold Wind and Lady Lyanna would sail with her as well

It made Tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already inadequate fleet depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with Lord Stannis to Dragonstone and never returned but Cersei would hear of nothing less Perhaps she was wise If the girl was captured before she reached Sunspear the Dornish alliance would fall to pieces So far Doran Martell had done no more than call his banners Once Myrcella was safe in Braavos he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes where the threat might make some of the Marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give Stannis pause about marching north It was purely a feint however The Martells would not commit to actual battle unless Dorne itself was attacked and Stannis was not so great a fool Though some of his bannermen may be Tyrion reflected I should think on that

He cleared his throat You know your orders Captain

I do my lord We are to follow the coast staying always in sight of land until we reach Crackclaw Point From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos On no account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone

And if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless

If a single ship we are to run them off or destroy them If there are more the Bold Wind will cleave to the Seaswift to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle

Tyrion nodded If the worst happened the little Seaswift ought to be able to outrun pursuit A small ship with big sails she was faster than any warship afloat or so her captain had claimed Once Myrcella reached Braavos she ought to be safe He was sending Ser Arys Oakheart as her sworn shield and had engaged the Braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to Sunspear Even Lord Stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most powerful of the Free Cities Traveling from King’s Landing to Dorne by way of Braavos was scarcely the most direct of routes but it was the safest… or so he hoped
