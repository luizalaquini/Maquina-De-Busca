seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in
which men would play a part -- vistas of probable
triumphs -- the smiles being of a phase suggesting that
hearts were imagined as lost and won Still this was
but conjecture and the whole series of actions was so
idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention
had any part in them at all
The waggoners steps were heard returning She
put the glass in the paper and the whole again into its
place
When the waggon had passed on Gabriel withdrew
from his point of espial and descending into the road
followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way
beyond the bottom of the hill where the object of his
contemplation now halted for the payment of toll About
twenty steps still remained between him and the gate
when he heard a dispute lt was a difference con+
cerning twopence between the persons with the waggon
and the man at the toll-bar
 Misesss niece is upon the top of the things and
she says thats enough that Ive offered ye you great
miser and she wont pay any more These were the
waggoners words
Very well  then misesss niece cant pass said the
turnpike-keeper closing the gate
Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants
and fell into a reverie There was something in the
tone of twopence remarkably insignificant Threepence
had a definite value as money -- it was an appreciable
infringement on a days wages and as such a higgling
matter  but twopence --  --  Here he said stepping
forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper  let
the young woman pass He looked up at her then
she heard his words and looked down
Gabriels features adhered throughout their form so
exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St
John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot as represented
in a window of the church he attended that not a single
lineament could be selected and called worthy either of
distinction or notoriety The redjacketed and dark+

haired maiden seemed to think so too for she carelessly
glanced over him and told her man to drive on She
might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute
scale but she did not speak them more probably she
felt none for in gaining her a passage he had lost her
her point and we know how women take a favour of
that kind
The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle
 Thats a handsome maid  he said to Oak
 But she has her faults said Gabriel
 True farmer 
And the greatest of them is -- well what it is
always
 Beating people down  ay tis so
O no
 What then  
Gabriel perhaps a little piqued by the comely
travellers indifference glanced back to where he had
witnessed her performance over the hedge and said
 Vanity

NIGHT -- THE FLOCK -- AN INIERIOR -- ANOTHER INTERIOR
IT was nearly midnight on the eve of St Thomass the
shortest day in the year A desolating wind wandered
from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched
the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of
a few days earlier
  Norcombe Hill -- not far from lonely Toller-Down
 -- was one of the spots which suggest to a passer-by
that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the
indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth
It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil -- an
ordinary specimen of those smoothly-outlined protuber+
ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
some great day of confusion when far grander heights
and dizzy granite precipices topple down
The hill was covered on its northern side by an
ancient and decaying plantation of beeches whose
upper verge formed a line over the crest fringing its
arched curve against the sky like a mane To-night
these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest
blasts which smote the wood and floundered through
it with a sound as of grumbling or gushed over its
crowning boughs in a weakened moan The dry leaves
in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes
a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few and
sending them spinning across the grass A group or
two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
had remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs
which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks
with smart taps
Betwenne this half-wooded half naked hill and the
vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly com+
manded was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade
 -- the sounds from which suggested that what it con+
cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here

The thin grasses more or less coating the hill were
