A direwolf Jon said His name is Ghost He stared up at the little man his disappointment suddenly forgotten What are you doing up there Why aren’t you at the feast

Too hot too noisy and I’d drunk too much wine the dwarf told him I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother Might I have a closer look at your wolf

Jon hesitated then nodded slowly Can you climb down or shall I bring a ladder

Oh bleed that the little man said He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air Jon gasped then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball landed lightly on his hands then vaulted backward onto his legs

Ghost backed away from him uncertainly

The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed I believe I’ve frightened your wolf My apologies

He’s not scared Jon said He knelt and called out Ghost come here Come on That’s it

The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister and when the dwarf reached out to pet him he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl Shy isn’t he Lannister observed

Sit Ghost Jon commanded That’s it Keep still He looked up at the dwarf You can touch him now He won’t move until I tell him to I’ve been training him

I see Lannister said He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost’s ears and said Nice wolf

If I wasn’t here he’d tear out your throat Jon said It wasn’t actually true yet but it would be

In that case you had best stay close the dwarf said He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes I am Tyrion Lannister

I know Jon said He rose Standing he was taller than the dwarf It made him feel strange

You’re Ned Stark’s bastard aren’t you

Jon felt a coldness pass right through him He pressed his lips together and said nothing

Did I offend you Lannister said Sorry Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head He grinned You are the bastard though

Lord Eddard Stark is my father Jon admitted stiffly

Lannister studied his face Yes he said I can see it You have more of the north in you than your brothers

Half brothers Jon corrected He was pleased by the dwarf’s comment but he tried not to let it show

Let me give you some counsel bastard Lannister said Never forget what you are for surely the world will not Make it your strength Then it can never be your weakness Armor yourself in it and it will never be used to hurt you

Jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel What do you know about being a bastard

All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes

You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister

Am I the dwarf replied sardonic Do tell my lord father My mother died birthing me and he’s never been sure

I don’t even know who my mother was Jon said

Some woman no doubt Most of them are He favored Jon with a rueful grin Remember this boy All dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards need be dwarfs And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast whistling a tune When he opened the door the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king





CATELYN

Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest She seldom had to light a fire The castle had been built over natural hot springs and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body driving the chill from the stone halls filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth keeping the earth from freezing Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards That was a little thing in summer in winter it was the difference between life and death

Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming and her walls warm to the touch The warmth reminded her of Riverrun of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure but Ned could never abide the heat The Starks were made for the cold he would tell her and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place

So when they had finished Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed as he had a thousand times before He crossed the room pulled back the heavy tapestries and threw open the high narrow windows one by one letting the night air into the chamber

The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark naked and empty-handed Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun fifteen long years gone Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking It was a good ache She could feel his seed within her She prayed that it might quicken there It had been three years since Rickon She was not too old She could give him another son

I will refuse him Ned said as he turned back to her His eyes were haunted his voice thick with doubt

Catelyn sat up in the bed You cannot You must not

My duties are here in the north I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand

He will not understand that He is a king now and kings are not like other men If you refuse to serve him he will wonder why and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him Can’t you see the danger that would put us in

Ned shook his head refusing to believe Robert would never harm me or any of mine We were closer than brothers He loves me If I refuse him he will roar and curse and bluster and in a week we will laugh about it together I know the man

You knew the man she said The king is a stranger to you Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow the broken antler lodged deep in her throat She had to make him see Pride is everything to a king my lord Robert came all this way to see you to bring you these great honors you cannot throw them back in his face

Honors Ned laughed bitterly

In his eyes yes she said

And in yours

And in mine she blazed angry now Why couldn’t he see He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter what else would you call that Sansa might someday be queen Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne What is so wrong with that

Gods Catelyn Sansa is only eleven Ned said And Joffrey… Joffrey is…

She finished for him …crown prince and heir to the Iron Throne And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon

That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth Brandon Yes Brandon would know what to do He always did It was all meant for Brandon You Winterfell everything He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens I never asked for this cup to pass to me

Perhaps not Catelyn said but Brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not

Ned turned away from her back to the night He stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall

Catelyn softened then to see his pain Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son

She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected Ned turned frowning What is it
