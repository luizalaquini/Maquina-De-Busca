229 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain
and passed over Jordan and went through all Bithron and they came to
Mahanaim

230 And Joab returned from following Abner and when he had gathered
all the people together there lacked of Davids servants nineteen men
and Asahel

231 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin and of Abners
men so that three hundred and threescore men died

232 And they took up Asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his
father which was in Bethlehem And Joab and his men went all night
and they came to Hebron at break of day

31 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
David but David waxed stronger and stronger and the house of Saul
waxed weaker and weaker

32 And unto David were sons born in Hebron and his firstborn was
Amnon of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess 33 And his second Chileab of
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite and the third Absalom the
son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur 34 And the
fourth Adonijah the son of Haggith and the fifth Shephatiah the son
of Abital 35 And the sixth Ithream by Eglah Davids wife These
were born to David in Hebron

36 And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul
and the house of David that Abner made himself strong for the house
of Saul

37 And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of
Aiah and Ishbosheth said to Abner Wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my fathers concubine  38 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of
Ishbosheth and said Am I a dogs head which against Judah do shew
kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father to his brethren
and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of
David that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this
woman  39 So do God to Abner and more also except as the LORD
hath sworn to David even so I do to him 310 To translate the
kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over
Israel and over Judah from Dan even to Beersheba

311 And he could not answer Abner a word again because he feared
him

312 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf saying Whose
is the land saying also Make thy league with me and behold my
hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto thee

313 And he said Well I will make a league with thee but one thing
I require of thee that is Thou shalt not see my face except thou
first bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face

314 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Sauls son saying
Deliver me my wife Michal which I espoused to me for an hundred
foreskins of the Philistines

315 And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from
Phaltiel the son of Laish

316 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
Bahurim

Then said Abner unto him Go return And he returned

317 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel saying Ye
sought for David in times past to be king over you 318 Now then do
it for the LORD hath spoken of David saying By the hand of my
servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the
Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies

319 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin and Abner went also
to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to
Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin

320 So Abner came to David to Hebron and twenty men with him And
David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast

321 And Abner said unto David I will arise and go and will gather
all Israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with
thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth
And David sent Abner away and he went in peace

322 And behold the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
troop and brought in a great spoil with them but Abner was not with
David in Hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace

323 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come they told
Joab saying Abner the son of Ner came to the king and he hath sent
him away and he is gone in peace

324 Then Joab came to the king and said What hast thou done
behold Abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away
and he is quite gone  325 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner that he
came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and
to know all that thou doest

326 And when Joab was come out from David he sent messengers after
