it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the
city to mourn and to bury him

1330 And he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over
him saying Alas my brother  1331 And it came to pass after he
had buried him that he spake to his sons saying When I am dead
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried lay my
bones beside his bones 1332 For the saying which he cried by the
word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the
houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria shall
surely come to pass

1333 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places
whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests
of the high places

1334 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam even to
cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth

141 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick

142 And Jeroboam said to his wife Arise I pray thee and disguise
thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam and get
thee to Shiloh behold there is Ahijah the prophet which told me
that I should be king over this people

143 And take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of
honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the
child

144 And Jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to Shiloh and
came to the house of Ahijah But Ahijah could not see for his eyes
were set by reason of his age

145 And the LORD said unto Ahijah Behold the wife of Jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and
thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in
that she shall feign herself to be another woman

146 And it was so when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she
came in at the door that he said Come in thou wife of Jeroboam why
feignest thou thyself to be another for I am sent to thee with heavy
tidings

147 Go tell Jeroboam Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Forasmuch
as I exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my
people Israel 148 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David
and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant David who
kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do
that only which was right in mine eyes 149 But hast done evil above
all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other
gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me
behind thy back 1410 Therefore behold I will bring evil upon the
house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel and will
take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam as a man taketh away
dung till it be all gone

1411 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the
LORD hath spoken it

1412 Arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy
feet enter into the city the child shall die

1413 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of
Jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some
good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam

1414 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel who
shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day but what even now

1415 For the LORD shall smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the
water and he shall root up Israel out of this good land which he
gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river
because they have made their groves provoking the LORD to anger

1416 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam who
did sin and who made Israel to sin

1417 And Jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah and
when she came to the threshold of the door the child died 1418 And
they buried him and all Israel mourned for him according to the word
of the LORD which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
prophet

1419 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam how he warred and how he
reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel

1420 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years
and he slept with his fathers and Nadab his son reigned in his stead

1421 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah Rehoboam was
forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned
seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD did choose out
of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there And his mothers
name was Naamah an Ammonitess
