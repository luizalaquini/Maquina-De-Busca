The Old Bear sighed You are not the only one touched by this war Like as not my sister is marching in your brother’s host her and those daughters of hers dressed in men’s mail Maege is a hoary old snark stubborn short-tempered and willful Truth be told I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters Frowning Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched Or perhaps it does Be that as it may I’d still grieve if she were slain yet you don’t see me running off I said the words just as you did My place is here… where is yours boy

I have no place Jon wanted to say I’m a bastard I have no rights no name no mother and now not even a father The words would not come I don’t know

I do said Lord Commander Mormont The cold winds are rising Snow Beyond the Wall the shadows lengthen Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk streaming south and east toward the sea and mammoths as well He says one of his men discovered huge misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new secret stronghold he’s found to what end the gods only know Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we’ve lost this past year

Ben Jen the raven squawked bobbing its head bits of egg dribbling from its beak Ben Jen Ben Jen

No Jon said There had been others Too many

Do you think your brother’s war is more important than ours the old man barked

Jon chewed his lip The raven flapped its wings at him War war war war it sang

It’s not Mormont told him Gods save us boy you’re not blind and you’re not stupid When dead men come hunting in the night do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne

No Jon had not thought of it that way

Your lord father sent you to us Jon Why who can say

Why Why Why the raven called

All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks The First Men built the Wall and it’s said they remember things otherwise forgotten And that beast of yours… he led us to the wights warned you of the dead man on the steps Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I’m not Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger I think you were meant to be here and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall

His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon’s back Beyond the Wall

You heard me I mean to find Ben Stark alive or dead He chewed and swallowed I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds We must know what is happening This time the Night’s Watch will ride in force against the King-beyond-the-Wall the Others and anything else that may be out there I mean to command them myself He pointed his dagger at Jon’s chest By custom the Lord Commander’s steward is his squire as well… but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you’ve run off again So I will have an answer from you Lord Snow and I will have it now Are you a brother of the Night’s Watch… or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war

Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath Forgive me Father Robb Arya Bran… forgive me I cannot help you He has the truth of it This is my place I am… yours my lord Your man I swear it I will not run again

The Old Bear snorted Good Now go put on your sword





CATELYN

It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun crossing the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes

Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their oars Theon Greyjoy was with him Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark

Catelyn took a place toward the stern They shot down the Tumblestone letting the strong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn’s face From the sandstone walls of the castle soldiers and servants shouted down her name and Robb’s and Winterfell From every rampart waved the banner of House Tully a leaping trout silver against a rippling blue-and-red field It was a stirring sight yet it did not lift her heart She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again Oh Ned…

Below the Wheel Tower they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water The men put their backs into it The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward It rose slowly as they approached and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days

They passed beneath the arch and under the walls moving from sunlight to shadow and back into sunlight Boats large and small were tied up all around them secured to iron rings set in the stone Her father’s guards waited on the water stair with her brother Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood a hard pike of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders It had been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister camp

Bring them in Ser Edmure commanded Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks When Grey Wind bounded out one of them dropped his pole and lurched back stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river The others laughed and the man got a sheepish look on his face Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots

Edmure came down the steps to embrace her Sweet sister he murmured hoarsely He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles but he was not smiling now He looked worn and tired battered by battle and haggard from strain His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound Catelyn hugged him fiercely

Your grief is mine Cat he said when they broke apart When we heard about Lord Eddard… the Lannisters will pay I swear it you will have your vengeance
