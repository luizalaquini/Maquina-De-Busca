2142 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them
thus were all these cities

2143 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein

2144 And the LORD gave them rest round about according to all that
he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their
enemies before them the LORD delivered all their enemies into their
hand

2145 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
spoken unto the house of Israel all came to pass

221 Then Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half
tribe of Manasseh 222 And said unto them Ye have kept all that
Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you and have obeyed my voice
in all that I commanded you 223 Ye have not left your brethren these
many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment
of the LORD your God

224 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren as
he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your
tents and unto the land of your possession which Moses the servant
of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan

225 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which
Moses the servant of the LORD charged you to love the LORD your God
and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to
cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all
your soul

226 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto
their tents

227 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
possession in Bashan but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua
among their brethren on this side Jordan westward And when Joshua
sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them 228 And
he spake unto them saying Return with much riches unto your tents
and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass
and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your
enemies with your brethren

229 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the children of Israel
out of Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan to go unto the country
of Gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were
possessed according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses

2210 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan that are in the
land of Canaan the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan a great altar
to see to

2211 And the children of Israel heard say Behold the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have
built an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of
Jordan at the passage of the children of Israel

2212 And when the children of Israel heard of it the whole
congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at
Shiloh to go up to war against them

2213 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben and
to the children of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh into the
land of Gilead Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest 2214 And with
him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the
tribes of Israel and each one was an head of the house of their
fathers among the thousands of Israel

2215 And they came unto the children of Reuben and to the children
of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh unto the land of Gilead
and they spake with them saying 2216 Thus saith the whole
congregation of the LORD What trespass is this that ye have committed
against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the
LORD in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this
day against the LORD  2217 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for
us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was
a plague in the congregation of the LORD 2218 But that ye must turn
away this day from following the LORD and it will be seeing ye rebel
to day against the LORD that to morrow he will be wroth with the
whole congregation of Israel

2219 Notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD wherein the
LORDs tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel
not against the LORD nor rebel against us in building you an altar
beside the altar of the LORD our God

2220 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel and that man
perished not alone in his iniquity

2221 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
tribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands
of Israel 2222 The LORD God of gods the LORD God of gods he
knoweth and Israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in
transgression against the LORD save us not this day 2223 That we
have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD or if to offer
