1120 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom which
bare him Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith

1121 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore
concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore
daughters  1122 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the
chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him
king

1123 And he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children
throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin unto every fenced
city and he gave them victual in abundance And he desired many
wives

121 And it came to pass when Rehoboam had established the kingdom
and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the LORD and all
Israel with him

122 And it came to pass that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem because they had
transgressed against the LORD 123 With twelve hundred chariots and
threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that
came with him out of Egypt the Lubims the Sukkiims and the
Ethiopians

124 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah and came
to Jerusalem

125 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam and to the princes of
Judah that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak
and said unto them Thus saith the LORD Ye have forsaken me and
therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak

126 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves
and they said The LORD is righteous

127 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves the word of
the LORD came to Shemaiah saying They have humbled themselves
therefore I will not destroy them but I will grant them some
deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by
the hand of Shishak

128 Nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my
service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries

129 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away
the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the
kings house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold
which Solomon had made

1210 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass and
committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the
entrance of the kings house

1211 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD the guard
came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber

1212 And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from
him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in Judah
things went well

1213 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned
for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city which the LORD had
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there And his
mothers name was Naamah an Ammonitess

1214 And he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the
LORD

1215 Now the acts of Rehoboam first and last are they not written
in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer concerning
genealogies And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
continually

1216 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city
of David and Abijah his son reigned in his stead

131 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign
over Judah

132 He reigned three years in Jerusalem His mothers name also was
Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah And there was war between
Abijah and Jeroboam

133 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
war even four hundred thousand chosen men Jeroboam also set the
battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men
being mighty men of valour

134 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim which is in mount
Ephraim and said Hear me thou Jeroboam and all Israel 135 Ought
ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over
Israel to David for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of
salt  136 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the
son of David is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord

137 And there are gathered unto him vain men the children of Belial
and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon
