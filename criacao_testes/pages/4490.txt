Did he tell you to fuck her too Look at him Not quite so tall his features not so fine and his hair is sand instead of spun gold yet still    even a poor copy of Jaime is sweeter than an empty bed I suppose No I thought not

I never meant    I only did as I was bid I   

   hated every instant of it is that what you would have me believe A high place at court knighthood my sister’s legs opening for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible for you Tyrion pushed himself to his feet Wait here His Grace will want to hear this

The defiance went from Lancel all at once The young knight fell to his knees a frightened boy Mercy my lord I beg you

Save it for Joffrey He likes a good beg

My lord it was your sister’s bidding the queen as you said but His Grace    he’d never understand   

Would you have me keep the truth from the king

For my father’s sake I’ll leave the city it will be as if it never happened I swear I will end it   

It was hard not to laugh I think not

Now the lad looked lost My lord

You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Very well obey her Stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her as often as she requires it No one need ever know    so long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing Where she goes who she sees what they talk of what plans she is hatching All And you will be the one to tell me won’t you

Yes my lord Lancel spoke without a moment’s hesitation Tyrion liked that I will I swear it As you command

Rise Tyrion filled the second cup and pressed it on him Drink to our understanding I promise there are no boars in the castle that I know of Lancel lifted the cup and drank albeit stiffly Smile cousin My sister is a beautiful woman and it’s all for the good of the realm You could do well out of this Knighthood is nothing If you’re clever you’ll have a lordship from me before you’re done Tyrion swirled the wine in his cup We want Cersei to have every faith in you Go back and tell her I beg her forgiveness Tell her that you frightened me that I want no conflict between us that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent

But    her demands   

Oh I’ll give her Pycelle

You will Lancel seemed astonished

Tyrion smiled I’ll release him on the morrow I could swear that I hadn’t harmed a hair on his head but it wouldn’t be strictly true In any case he’s well enough though I won’t vouch for his vigor The black cells are not a healthy place for a man his age Cersei can keep him as a pet or send him to the Wall I don’t care which but I won’t have him on the council

And Ser Jacelyn

Tell my sister you believe you can win him away from me given time That ought to content her for a while

As you say Lancel finished his wine

One last thing With King Robert dead it would be most embarrassing should his grieving widow suddenly grow great with child

My lord I    we    the queen has commanded me not to    His ears had turned Lannister crimson I spill my seed on her belly my lord

A lovely belly I have no doubt Moisten it as often as you wish    but see that your dew falls nowhere else I want no more nephews is that clear

Ser Lancel made a stiff bow and took his leave

Tyrion allowed himself a moment to feel sorry for the boy Another fool and a weakling as well but he does not deserve what Cersei and I are doing to him It was a kindness that his uncle Kevan had two other sons this one was unlikely to live out the year Cersei would have him killed out of hand if she learned he was betraying her and if by some grace of the gods she did not Lancel would never survive the day Jaime Lannister returned to King’s Landing The only question would be whether Jaime cut him down in a jealous rage or Cersei murdered him first to keep Jaime from finding out Tyrion’s silver was on Cersei

A restlessness was on him and Tyrion knew full well he would not get back to sleep tonight Not here in any case He found Podrick Payne asleep in a chair outside the door of the solar and shook him by the shoulder Summon Bronn and then run down to the stables and have two horses saddled

The squire’s eyes were cloudy with sleep Horses

Those big brown animals that love apples I’m sure you’ve seen them Four legs and a tail But Bronn first

The sellsword was not long in appearing Who pissed in your soup he demanded

Cersei as ever You’d think I’d be used to the taste by now but never mind My gentle sister seems to have mistaken me for Ned Stark

I hear he was taller

Not after Joff took off his head You ought to have dressed more warmly the night is chill

Are we going somewhere

Are all sellswords as clever as you

The city streets were dangerous but with Bronn beside him Tyrion felt safe enough The guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall and they rode down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon’s High Hill and thence onto Pigrun Alley past rows of shuttered windows and tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street they almost kissed The moon seemed to follow them as they went playing peek-and-sneak among the chimneys They encountered no one but a lone old crone carrying a dead cat by the tail She gave them a fearful look as if she were afraid they might try to steal her dinner and slunk off into the shadows without a word

Tyrion reflected on the men who had been Hand before him who had proved no match for his sister’s wiles How could they be Men like that    too honest to live too noble to shit Cersei devours such fools every morning when she breaks her fast The only way to defeat my sister is to play her own game and that was something the Lords Stark and Arryn would never do Small wonder that both of them were dead while Tyrion Lannister had never felt more alive His stunted legs might make him a comic grotesque at a harvest ball but this dance he knew

Despite the hour the brothel was crowded Chataya greeted them pleasantly and escorted them to the common room Bronn went upstairs with a dark-eyed girl from Dorne but Alayaya was busy entertaining She will be so pleased to know you’ve come said Chataya I will see that the turret room is made ready for you Will my lord take a cup of wine while he waits

I will he said

The wine was poor stuff compared to the vintages from the Arbor the house normally served You must forgive us my lord Chataya said I cannot find good wine at any price of late

You are not alone in that I fear

Chataya commiserated with him a moment then excused herself and glided off A handsome woman Tyrion reflected as he watched her go He had seldom seen such elegance and dignity in a whore Though to be sure she saw herself more as a kind of priestess Perhaps that is the secret It is not what we do so much as why we do it Somehow that thought comforted him

A few of the other patrons were giving him sideways looks The last time he ventured out a man had spit on him    well had tried to Instead he’d spit on Bronn and in future would do his spitting without teeth

Is milord feeling unloved Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear I have a cure for that

Smiling Tyrion shook his head You are too beautiful for words sweetling but I’ve grown fond of Alayaya’s remedy

You’ve never tried mine Milord never chooses anyone but ’Yaya She’s good but I’m better don’t you want to see

Next time perhaps Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful She was pug-nosed and bouncy with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse

Giggling she put her hand between his thighs and squeezed him through his breeches I don’t think he wants to wait till next time she announced He wants to come out and count all my freckles I think

Dancy Alayaya stood in the doorway dark and cool in gauzy green silk His lordship is come to visit me

Tyrion gently disentangled himself from the other girl and stood Dancy did not seem to mind Next time she reminded him She put a finger in her mouth and sucked it

As the black-skinned girl led him up the stairs she said Poor Dancy She has a fortnight to get my lord to choose her Elsewise she loses her black pearls to Marei
