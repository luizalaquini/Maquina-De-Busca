Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right she felt her throat tighten He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened and she had not dared to speak to him At first she thought she hated him for what they’d done to Lady but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry she told herself that it had not been Joffrey’s doing not truly The queen had done it she was the one to hate her and Arya Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya

She could not hate Joffrey tonight He was too beautiful to hate He wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion’s heads and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires His hair was as bright as the metal Sansa looked at him and trembled afraid that he might ignore her or worse turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table

Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs and said Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty sweet lady

He was too kind she demurred trying to remain modest and calm though her heart was singing Ser Loras is a true knight Do you think he will win tomorrow my lord

No Joffrey said My dog will do for him or perhaps my uncle Jaime And in a few years when I am old enough to enter the lists I shall do for them all He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine and poured her a cup She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa’s cup as well so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word

The servants kept the cups filled all night yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine She needed no wine She was drunk on the magic of the night giddy with glamour swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know Singers sat before the king’s pavilion filling the dusk with music A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air The king’s own fool the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy danced about on stilts all in motley making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him when he sang his little song about the High Septon she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself

And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy He talked to Sansa all night showering her with compliments making her laugh sharing little bits of court gossip explaining Moon Boy’s japes Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane seated to her left

All the while the courses came and went A thick soup of barley and venison Salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums sprinkled with crushed nuts Snails in honey and garlic Sansa had never eaten snails before Joffrey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell and fed her the first sweet morsel himself Then came trout fresh from the river baked in clay her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within And when the meat course was brought out he served her himself slicing a queen’s portion from the joint smiling as he laid it on her plate She could see from the way he moved that his right arm was still troubling him yet he uttered not a word of complaint

Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes as much as she loved them She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout

King Robert had grown louder with each course From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery but they were too far away for her to make out his words

Now everybody heard him No he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet red of face reeling He had a goblet of wine in one hand and he was drunk as a man could be You do not tell me what to do woman he screamed at Queen Cersei I am king here do you understand I rule here and if I say that I will fight tomorrow I will fight

Everyone was staring Sansa saw Ser Barristan and the king’s brother Renly and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair but no one made a move to interfere The queen’s face was a mask so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow She rose from the table gathered her skirts around her and stormed off in silence servants trailing behind

Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king’s shoulder but the king shoved him away hard Lannister stumbled and fell The king guffawed The great knight I can still knock you in the dirt Remember that Kingslayer He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet splashing wine all over his satin tunic Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me

Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off As you say Your Grace His voice was stiff

Lord Renly came forward smiling You’ve spilled your wine Robert Let me bring you a fresh goblet

Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm It grows late the prince said He had a queer look on his face as if he were not seeing her at all Do you need an escort back to the castle

No Sansa began She looked for Septa Mordane and was startled to find her with her head on the table snoring soft and ladylike snores I mean to say… yes thank you that would be most kind I am tired and the way is so dark I should be glad for some protection

Joffrey called out Dog

Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night so quickly did he appear He had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog’s head sewn on the front The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red Yes Your Grace he said

Take my betrothed back to the castle and see that no harm befalls her the prince told him brusquely And without even a word of farewell Joffrey strode off leaving her there

Sansa could feel the Hound watching her Did you think Joff was going to take you himself He laughed He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit Small chance of that He pulled her unresisting to her feet Come you’re not the only one needs sleep I’ve drunk too much and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow He laughed again

Suddenly terrified Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane’s shoulder hoping to wake her but she only snored the louder King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty The feast was over and the beautiful dream had ended with it

The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way Sansa followed close beside him The ground was rocky and uneven the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her She kept her eyes lowered watching where she placed her feet They walked among the pavilions each with its banner and its armor hung outside the silence weighing heavier with every step Sansa could not bear the sight of him he frightened her so yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy A true lady would not notice his face she told herself You rode gallantly today Ser Sandor she made herself say

Sandor Clegane snarled at her Spare me your empty little compliments girl… and your ser’s I am no knight I spit on them and their vows My brother is a knight Did you see him ride today

Yes Sansa whispered trembling He was…

Gallant the Hound finished

He was mocking her she realized No one could withstand him she managed at last proud of herself It was no lie
