1135 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
shall be unclean whether it be oven or ranges for pots they shall
be broken down for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you

1136 Nevertheless a fountain or pit wherein there is plenty of
water shall be clean but that which toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean

1137 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
is to be sown it shall be clean

1138 But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their
carcase fall thereon it shall be unclean unto you

1139 And if any beast of which ye may eat die he that toucheth the
carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even

1140 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes
and be unclean until the even he also that beareth the carcase of it
shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even

1141 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
an abomination it shall not be eaten

1142 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly and whatsoever goeth upon all
four or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that
creep upon the earth them ye shall not eat for they are an
abomination

1143 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
that creepeth neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them
that ye should be defiled thereby

1144 For I am the LORD your God ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves and ye shall be holy for I am holy neither shall ye
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth

1145 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt
to be your God ye shall therefore be holy for I am holy

1146 This is the law of the beasts and of the fowl and of every
living creature that moveth in the waters and of every creature that
creepeth upon the earth 1147 To make a difference between the
unclean and the clean and between the beast that may be eaten and the
beast that may not be eaten

121 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 122 Speak unto the
children of Israel saying If a woman have conceived seed and born a
man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days
of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean

123 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
circumcised

124 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three
and thirty days she shall touch no hallowed thing nor come into the
sanctuary until the days of her purifying be fulfilled

125 But if she bear a maid child then she shall be unclean two
weeks as in her separation and she shall continue in the blood of
her purifying threescore and six days

126 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or
for a daughter she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest
127 Who shall offer it before the LORD and make an atonement for
her and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood This is
the law for her that hath born a male or a female

128 And if she be not able to bring a lamb then she shall bring two
turtles or two young pigeons the one for the burnt offering and the
other for a sin offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
her and she shall be clean

131 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron saying 132 When a man
shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising a scab or bright spot
and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy then he
shall be brought unto Aaron the priest or unto one of his sons the
priests 133 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of
the flesh and when the hair in the plague is turned white and the
plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh it is a plague
of leprosy and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him
unclean

134 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh and in
sight be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof be not turned
white then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven
days 135 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day and
behold if the plague in his sight be at a stay and the plague spread
not in the skin then the priest shall shut him up seven days more
136 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and
behold if the plague be somewhat dark and the plague spread not in
the skin the priest shall pronounce him clean it is but a scab and
he shall wash his clothes and be clean

137 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing he shall be seen of
