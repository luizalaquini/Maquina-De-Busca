drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock

217 And the shepherds came and drove them away but Moses stood up
and helped them and watered their flock

218 And when they came to Reuel their father he said How is it that
ye are come so soon to day  219 And they said An Egyptian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for
us and watered the flock

220 And he said unto his daughters And where is he why is it that
ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread

221 And Moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave Moses
Zipporah his daughter

222 And she bare him a son and he called his name Gershom for he
said I have been a stranger in a strange land

223 And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt
died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and
they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage

224 And God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob

225 And God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect
unto them

31 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law the priest
of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and
came to the mountain of God even to Horeb

32 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned
with fire and the bush was not consumed

33 And Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight
why the bush is not burnt

34 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see God called unto
him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses And he said
Here am I

35 And he said Draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy
feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground

36 Moreover he said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob And Moses hid his face for he
was afraid to look upon God

37 And the LORD said I have surely seen the affliction of my people
which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their
taskmasters for I know their sorrows 38 And I am come down to
deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up
out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing
with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the
Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and
the Jebusites

39 Now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel is come
unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians
oppress them

310 Come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou
mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt

311 And Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh
and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt
312 And he said Certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a
token unto thee that I have sent thee When thou hast brought forth
the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain

313 And Moses said unto God Behold when I come unto the children of
Israel and shall say unto them The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you and they shall say to me What is his name what shall I say
unto them  314 And God said unto Moses I AM THAT I AM and he said
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I AM hath sent me
unto you

315 And God said moreover unto Moses Thus shalt thou say unto the
children of Israel the LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you this is
my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations

316 Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them
The LORD God of your fathers the God of Abraham of Isaac and of
Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen
that which is done to you in Egypt 317 And I have said I will bring
you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the
Hivites and the Jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey

318 And they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou
and the elders of Israel unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say
unto him The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us
go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we
may sacrifice to the LORD our God

319 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go no not
