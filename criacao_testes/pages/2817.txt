and with the other hand held a weapon

418 For the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and
so builded And he that sounded the trumpet was by me

419 And I said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of
the people The work is great and large and we are separated upon the
wall one far from another

420 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort
ye thither unto us our God shall fight for us

421 So we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from
the rising of the morning till the stars appeared

422 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people Let every one
with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be
a guard to us and labour on the day

423 So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of
the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving
that every one put them off for washing

51 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
their brethren the Jews

52 For there were that said We our sons and our daughters are
many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live

53 Some also there were that said We have mortgaged our lands
vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth

54 There were also that said We have borrowed money for the kings
tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards

55 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as
their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto
bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other
men have our lands and vineyards

56 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words

57 Then I consulted with myself and I rebuked the nobles and the
rulers and said unto them Ye exact usury every one of his brother
And I set a great assembly against them

58 And I said unto them We after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the Jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even
sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us Then held they
their peace and found nothing to answer

59 Also I said It is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies  510 I likewise and my brethren and my servants might
exact of them money and corn I pray you let us leave off this usury

511 Restore I pray you to them even this day their lands their
vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part
of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of
them

512 Then said they We will restore them and will require nothing of
them so will we do as thou sayest Then I called the priests and
took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise

513 Also I shook my lap and said So God shake out every man from
his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even
thus be he shaken out and emptied And all the congregation said
Amen and praised the LORD And the people did according to this
promise

514 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
in the land of Judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king that is twelve years I and my
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor

515 But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty
shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people
but so did not I because of the fear of God

516 Yea also I continued in the work of this wall neither bought we
any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work

517 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that
are about us

518 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not I the bread
of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people

519 Think upon me my God for good according to all that I have
done for this people

61 Now it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the
Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I had builded the
wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time
