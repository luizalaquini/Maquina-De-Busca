3110 Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above
rubies

3111 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he
shall have no need of spoil

3112 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life

3113 She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her
hands

3114 She is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from
afar

3115 She riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her
household and a portion to her maidens

3116 She considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her
hands she planteth a vineyard

3117 She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms

3118 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth
not out by night

3119 She layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the
distaff

3120 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth
her hands to the needy

3121 She is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her
household are clothed with scarlet

3122 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk
and purple

3123 Her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the
elders of the land

3124 She maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles
unto the merchant

3125 Strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in
time to come

3126 She openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law
of kindness

3127 She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not
the bread of idleness

3128 Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also
and he praiseth her

3129 Many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them
all

3130 Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that
feareth the LORD she shall be praised

3131 Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise
her in the gates




Ecclesiastes

or

The Preacher


11 The words of the Preacher the son of David king in Jerusalem

12 Vanity of vanities saith the Preacher vanity of vanities all is
vanity

13 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun  14 One generation passeth away and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth for ever

15 The sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his
place where he arose

16 The wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north
it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according
to his circuits

17 All the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the
place from whence the rivers come thither they return again

18 All things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not
satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing

19 The thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that
which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing
under the sun
