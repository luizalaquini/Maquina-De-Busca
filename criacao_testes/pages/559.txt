The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger until finally a wisp of smoke appeared Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles As shy as a maid on her wedding night the big ranger said in a soft voice and near as fair Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be

He was not a man you’d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights So far as Jon knew Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding He could not ask Instead he fanned the fire When the blaze was all acrackle he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands and sighed wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter

The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs

At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass But when they’d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers

They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains Each time it seemed a little louder a little closer When night fell the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire’s garron as well as his own and ride east for Mormont with all haste back the way they had come The rest of them would draw off the pursuit Send Jon Ebben had urged He can ride as fast as me

Jon has a different part to play

He is half a boy still

No said Qhorin he is a man of the Night’s Watch

When the moon rose Ebben parted from them Stonesnake went east with him a short way then doubled back to obscure their tracks and the three who remained set off toward the southwest

After that the days and nights blurred one into the other They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons then mounted up again Over bare rock they rode through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks but it was a futile gesture They were watched At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky

They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair not ten yards away The beast was gaunt and half-starved but the sight of it sent Stonesnake’s mare into a panic she reared and ran and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg

Ghost ate well that day and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron’s blood with their oats to give them strength The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon but he forced it down They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode and left the rest for the shadowcats

There was no question of riding double Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell Qhorin refused If any man in the Night’s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot it is you brother You can go over mountains that a horse must go around Make for the Fist Tell Mormont what Jon saw and how Tell him that the old powers are waking that he faces giants and wargs and worse Tell him that the trees have eyes again

He has no chance Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white

After that every night seemed colder than the night before and more lonely Ghost was not always with them but he was never far either Even when they were apart Jon sensed his nearness He was glad for that The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men Qhorin’s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind which blew endlessly through the heights When he slept he did not dream not of wolves nor his brothers nor anything Even dreams cannot live up here he told himself

Is your sword sharp Jon Snow asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire

My sword is Valyrian steel The Old Bear gave it to me

Do you remember the words of your vow

Yes They were not words a man was like to forget Once said they could never be unsaid They changed your life forever

Say them again with me Jon Snow

If you like Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness Night gathers and now my watch begins It shall not end until my death I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children I shall wear no crowns and win no glory I shall live and die at my post I am the sword in the darkness I am the watcher on the walls I am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers the shield that guards the realms of men I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch for this night and all the nights to come

When they were done there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a distant sigh of wind Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers holding tight to the words in his mind praying that his father’s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came It would not be long now The garrons were near the end of their strength Qhorin’s mount would not last another day Jon suspected

The flames were burning low by then the warmth fading The fire will soon go out Qhorin said but if the Wall should ever fall all the fires will go out

There was nothing Jon could say to that He nodded

We may escape them yet the ranger said Or not

I’m not afraid to die It was only half a lie

It may not be so easy as that Jon
