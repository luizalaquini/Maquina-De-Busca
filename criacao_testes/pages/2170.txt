Ride It was dark beyond the fire and the night was cold Ride where

Back Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time The fire will draw them past I hope Come brother

Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood Even the horses seemed reluctant to leave the fire The sun was long gone and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them He did not know what Qhorin had in mind but perhaps it was a chance He hoped so I do not want to play the oathbreaker even for good reason

They went cautiously moving as silent as man and horse could move retracing their steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains Jon remembered the place They had watered the horses here before the sun went down

The water’s icing up Qhorin observed as he turned aside else we’d ride in the streambed But if we break the ice they are like to see Keep close to the cliffs There’s a crook a half mile on that will hide us He rode into the defile Jon gave one last wistful look to their distant fire and followed

The farther in they went the closer the cliffs pressed to either side They followed the moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source Icicles bearded its stony banks but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust

A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up where a section of the cliff face had fallen but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through Beyond the walls pinched in sharply and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall The air was full of mist like the breath of some vast cold beast The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight Jon looked about in dismay There is no way out He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs but not with the horses He did not think they would last long afoot

Quickly now the Halfhand commanded The big man on the small horse rode over the ice-slick stones right into the curtain of water and vanished When he did not reappear Jon put his heels into his horse and went after His garron did his best to shy away The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon’s breath

Then he was through drenched and shivering but through

The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass but beyond the walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand Jon could feel the spray freezing in his beard Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush shook droplets from his fur sniffed at the darkness suspiciously then lifted a leg against one rocky wall Qhorin had already dismounted Jon did the same You knew this place was here

When I was no older than you I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat through these falls He unsaddled his horse removed her bit and bridle and ran his fingers through her shaggy mane There is a way through the heart of the mountain Come dawn if they have not found us we will press on The first watch is mine brother Qhorin seated himself on the sand his back to a wall no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave Over the rush of falling waters Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword

He took off his wet cloak but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep Jon was grateful for his warmth He wondered if the fire was still burning outside or if it had gone out by now If the Wall should ever fall all the fires will go out The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand but after a time that too faded and went dark

Sleep came at last and with it nightmares He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves It was still dark when Qhorin woke him While the Halfhand slept Jon sat with his back to the cave wall listening to the water and waiting for the dawn

At break of day they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat then saddled their garrons once again and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders During his watch the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark holding the pale flame up before him Jon followed with the horses The stony path twisted and turned first down then up then down more steeply In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through By the time we come out we will have lost them he told himself as they went Not even an eagle can see through solid stone We will have lost them and we will ride hard for the Fist and tell the Old Bear all we know

But when they emerged back into the light long hours later the eagle was waiting for them perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope Ghost went bounding up the rocks after it but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air

Qhorin’s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes Here is as good a place as any to make a stand he declared The mouth of the cave shelters us from above and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain Is your sword sharp Jon Snow

Yes he said

We’ll feed the horses They’ve served us bravely poor beasts

Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers I am the shield that guards the realms of men

A hunting horn echoed through the mountains and a moment later Jon heard the baying of hounds They will be with us soon announced Qhorin Keep your wolf in hand

Ghost to me Jon called The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side tail held stiffly behind him

The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away Their hounds ran before them snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood Ghost bared his teeth his fur bristling Easy Jon murmured Stay Overhead he heard a rustle of wings The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph

The hunters approached warily perhaps fearing arrows Jon counted fourteen with eight dogs Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather On either wing archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows but did not loose The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls One had a chipped stone axe They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids Wildlings did not mine or smelt and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall

Qhorin drew his longsword The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from its sheath Despite the chill in the air sweat stung his eyes

Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted Their leader came on alone riding a beast that seemed more goat than horse from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering both were armored in bones Cow bones sheep bones the bones of goats and aurochs and elk the great bones of the hairy mammoths    and human bones as well

Rattleshirt Qhorin called down icy-polite

To crows I be the Lord o’ Bones The rider’s helm was made from the broken skull of a giant and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather

Qhorin snorted I see no lord Only a dog dressed in chickenbones who rattles when he rides

The wildling hissed in anger and his mount reared He did rattle Jon could hear it the bones were strung together loosely so they clacked and clattered when he moved It’s your bones I’ll be rattling soon Halfhand I’ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your ribs I’ll carve your teeth to cast me runes and eat me oaten porridge from your skull

If you want my bones come get them

That Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand to winkle them out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time But another of his company edged a horse up beside him one of the fighting women called spearwives We are four-and-ten to two crows and eight dogs to your wolf she called Fight or run you are ours

Show them commanded Rattleshirt

The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy Ebben had been bald as an egg so she dangled the head by an ear He died brave she said

But he died said Rattleshirt same like you He freed his battle-axe brandishing it above his head Good steel it was with a wicked gleam to both blades Ebben was never a man to neglect his weapons The other wildlings crowded forward beside him yelling taunts A few chose Jon for their mockery Is that your wolf boy a skinny youth called unlimbering a stone flail He’ll be my cloak before the sun is down On the other side of the line another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast Does the baby want his momma Come have a suck o’ this boy The dogs were barking too

They would shame us into folly Qhorin gave Jon a long look Remember your orders

Belike we need to flush the crows Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor Feather them

No The word burst from Jon’s lips before the bowmen could loose He took two quick steps forward We yield

They warned me bastard blood was craven he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him I see it is so Run to your new masters coward

Face reddening Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm and said The free folk have no need of cravens

He is no craven One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair This is the Bastard o’ Winterfell who spared me Let him live

Jon met Ygritte’s eyes and had no words

Let him die insisted the Lord of Bones The black crow is a tricksy bird I trust him not

On a rock above them the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury

The bird hates you Jon Snow said Ygritte And well he might He was a man before you killed him

I did not know said Jon truthfully trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass You told me Mance would take me

And he will Ygritte said

Mance is not here said Rattleshirt Ragwyle gut him

The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said If the crow would join the free folk let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him

I’ll do whatever you ask The words came hard but Jon said them

Rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed Then kill the Halfhand bastard
