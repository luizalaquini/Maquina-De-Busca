Asha sucked grease from her fingers A lock of black hair fell across her eyes Her men were shouting for bread and bacon They made a deal of noise as few as they were Envy Theon

What else would you call it With thirty men I captured Winterfell in a night You needed a thousand and a moon’s turn to take Deepwood Motte

Well I’m no great warrior like you brother She quaffed half a horn of ale and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand I saw the heads above your gates Tell me true which one gave you the fiercest fight the cripple or the babe

Theon could feel the blood rushing to his face He took no joy from those heads no more than he had in displaying the headless bodies of the children before the castle Old Nan stood with her soft toothless mouth opening and closing soundlessly and Farlen threw himself at Theon snarling like one of his hounds Urzen and Cadwyl had to beat him senseless with the butts of their spears How did I come to this he remembered thinking as he stood over the fly-speckled bodies

Only Maester Luwin had the stomach to come near Stone-faced the small grey man had begged leave to sew the boys’ heads back onto their shoulders so they might be laid in the crypts below with the other Stark dead

No Theon had told him Not the crypts

But why my lord Surely they cannot harm you now It is where they belong All the bones of the Starks—

I said no He needed the heads for the wall but he had burned the headless bodies that very day in all their finery Afterward he had knelt amongst the bones and ashes to retrieve a slag of melted silver and cracked jet all that remained of the wolf’s-head brooch that had once been Bran’s He had it still

I treated Bran and Rickon generously he told his sister They brought their fate on themselves

As do we all little brother

His patience was at an end How do you expect me to hold Winterfell if you bring me only twenty men

Ten Asha corrected The others return with me You wouldn’t want your own sweet sister to brave the dangers of the wood without an escort would you There are direwolves prowling the dark She uncoiled from the great stone seat and rose to her feet Come let us go somewhere we can speak more privily

She was right he knew though it galled him that she would make that decision I should never have come to the hall he realized belatedly I should have summoned her to me

It was too late for that now however Theon had no choice but to lead Asha to Ned Stark’s solar There before the ashes of a dead fire he blurted Dagmer’s lost the fight at Torrhen’s Square—

The old castellan broke his shield wall yes Asha said calmly What did you expect This Ser Rodrik knows the land intimately as the Cleftjaw does not and many of the northmen were mounted The ironborn lack the discipline to stand a charge of armored horse Dagmer lives be grateful for that much He’s leading the survivors back toward the Stony Shore

She knows more than I do Theon realized That only made him angrier The victory has given Leobald Tallhart the courage to come out from behind his walls and join Ser Rodrik And I’ve had reports that Lord Manderly has sent a dozen barges upriver packed with knights warhorses and siege engines The Umbers are gathering beyond the Last River as well I’ll have an army at my gates before the moon turns and you bring me only ten men

I need not have brought you any

I commanded you—

Father commanded me to take Deepwood Motte she snapped He said nothing of me having to rescue my little brother

Bugger Deepwood he said It’s a wooden pisspot on a hill Winterfell is the heart of the land but how am I to hold it without a garrison

You might have thought of that before you took it Oh it was cleverly done I’ll grant you If only you’d had the good sense to raze the castle and carry the two little princelings back to Pyke as hostages you might have won the war in a stroke

You’d like that wouldn’t you To see my prize reduced to ruins and ashes

Your prize will be the doom of you Krakens rise from the sea Theon or did you forget that during your years among the wolves Our strength is in our longships My wooden pisspot sits close enough to the sea for supplies and fresh men to reach me whenever they are needful But Winterfell is hundreds of leagues inland ringed by woods hills and hostile holdfasts and castles And every man in a thousand leagues is your enemy now make no mistake You made certain of that when you mounted those heads on your gatehouse Asha shook her head How could you be such a bloody fool Children   

They defied me he shouted in her face And it was blood for blood besides two sons of Eddard Stark to pay for Rodrik and Maron The words tumbled out heedlessly but Theon knew at once that his father would approve I’ve laid my brothers’ ghosts to rest

Our brothers Asha reminded him with a half smile that suggested she took his talk of vengeance well salted Did you bring their ghosts from Pyke brother And here I thought they haunted only Father

When has a maid ever understood a man’s need for revenge Even if his father did not appreciate the gift of Winterfell he must approve of Theon avenging his brothers

Asha snorted back a laugh This Ser Rodrik may well feel the same manly need did you think of that You are blood of my blood Theon whatever else you may be For the sake of the mother who bore us both return to Deepwood Motte with me Put Winterfell to the torch and fall back while you still can

No Theon adjusted his crown I took this castle and I mean to hold it

His sister looked at him a long time Then hold it you shall she said for the rest of your life She sighed I say it tastes like folly but what would a shy maid know of such things At the door she gave him one last mocking smile You ought to know that’s the ugliest crown I’ve ever laid eyes on Did you make it yourself

She left him fuming and lingered no longer than was needful to feed and water her horses Half the men she’d brought returned with her as threatened riding out the same Hunter’s Gate that Bran and Rickon had used for their escape

Theon watched them go from atop the wall As his sister vanished into the mists of the wolfswood he found himself wondering why he had not listened and gone with her

Gone has she Reek was at his elbow

Theon had not heard him approach nor smelled him either He could not think of anyone he wanted to see less It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing with what he knew I should have had him killed after he did the others he reflected but the notion made him nervous Unlikely as it seemed Reek could read and write and he was possessed of enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they’d done

M’lord prince if you’ll pardon me saying it’s not right for her to abandon you And ten men that won’t be near enough

I am well aware of that Theon said So was Asha

Well might be I could help you said Reek Give me a horse and bag o’ coin and I could find you some good fellows

Theon narrowed his eyes How many

A hundred might be Two hundred Maybe more He smiled his pale eyes glinting I was born up north here I know many a man and many a man knows Reek

Two hundred men were not an army but you didn’t need thousands to hold a castle as strong as Winterfell So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing they might make all the difference Do as you say and you’ll not find me ungrateful You can name your own reward

Well m’lord I haven’t had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay Reek said I’ve had my eye on that Palla and I hear she’s already been had so   

He had gone too far with Reek to turn back now Two hundred men and she’s yours But a man less and you can go back to fucking pigs

Reek was gone before the sun went down carrying a bag of Stark silver and the last of Theon’s hopes Like as not I’ll never see the wretch again he thought bitterly but even so the chance had to be taken

That night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to Winterfell The hall rang with music and laughter though the cold winds were rising outside At first it was all wine and roast meat and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time    until he noticed that the room was growing darker The music did not seem so jolly then he heard discords and strange silences and notes that hung in the air bleeding Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead

King Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly and Lord Eddard was headless beside him Corpses lined the benches below grey-brown flesh sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast worms crawling in and out of the holes that were their eyes He knew them every one Jory Cassel and Fat Tom Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse and all the others who had ridden south to King’s Landing never to return Mikken and Chayle sat together one dripping blood and the other water Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table The miller’s wife was there as well and Farlen even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved Bran’s life

But there were others with faces he had never known in life faces he had seen only in stone The slim sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna Her brother Brandon stood beside her and their father Lord Rickard just behind Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows pale shades with long grim faces The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife And then the tall doors opened with a crash and a freezing gale blew down the hall and Robb came walking out of the night Grey Wind stalked beside eyes burning and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds

Theon woke with a scream startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room When his guards burst in with drawn swords he ordered them to bring him the maester By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy a cup of wine had steadied Theon’s hands and he was feeling ashamed of his panic A dream he muttered that was all it was It meant nothing

Nothing Luwin agreed solemnly He left a sleeping draught but Theon poured it down the privy shaft the moment he was gone Luwin was a man as well as a maester and the man had no love for him He wants me to sleep yes    to sleep and never wake He’d like that as much as Asha would

He sent for Kyra kicked shut the door climbed on top of her and fucked the wench with a fury he’d never known was in him By the time he finished she was sobbing her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks Theon shoved her from the bed and threw her a blanket Get out

Yet even then he could not sleep

Come dawn he dressed and went outside to walk along the outer walls A brisk autumn wind was swirling through the battlements It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes He watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees On his left he could see tower tops above the inner wall their roofs gilded by the rising sun The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green Ned Stark’s tree he thought and Stark’s wood Stark’s castle Stark’s sword Stark’s gods This is their place not mine I am a Greyjoy of Pyke born to paint a kraken on my shield and sail the great salt sea I should have gone with Asha
