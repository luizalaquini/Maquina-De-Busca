One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun When he removed his helm Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard

His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold

At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger He did not kneel with the others He stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence His face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks Though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a woman’s His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a two-handed greatsword too long to be worn at his side

The king is gone hunting but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze Slowly he turned his head Lady growled A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly She stepped backward and bumped into someone

Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile You are shaking girl he said his voice rasping Do I frighten you so much

He did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other Still Sansa wrenched away from him and the Hound laughed and Lady moved between them rumbling a warning Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf They were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter

A wolf a man said and someone else said Seven hells that’s a direwolf and the first man said What’s it doing in camp and the Hound’s rasping voice replied The Starks use them for wet nurses and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed Tears filled her eyes

She heard the queen say Joffrey go to her

And her prince was there

Leave her alone Joffrey said He stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown He gave her his hand drew her to her feet What is it sweet lady Why are you afraid No one will hurt you Put away your swords all of you The wolf is her little pet that’s all He looked at Sandor Clegane And you dog away with you you’re scaring my betrothed

The Hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press Sansa struggled to steady herself She felt like such a fool She was a Stark of Winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen It was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain It was the other one

The two stranger knights exchanged a look Payne chuckled the young man in the green armor

The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady He has a fearsome aspect

As well he should The queen had descended from the wheelhouse The spectators parted to make way for her If the wicked do not fear the Mng’s Justice you have put the wrong man in the office

Sansa finally found her words Then surely you have chosen the right one Your Grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her

Well spoken child said the old man in white As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark I am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting I am Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard He bowed

Sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came back to her The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard she said and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him The honor is mine good knight Even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold

The green knight laughed again Barristan the Old you mean Don’t flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already He smiled at her Now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then I must concede that you are truly our Hand’s daughter

Joffrey stiffened beside her Have a care how you address my betrothed

I can answer Sansa said quickly to quell her prince’s anger She smiled at the green knight Your helmet bears golden antlers my lord The stag is the sigil of the royal House King Robert has two brothers By your extreme youth you can only be Renly Baratheon Lord of Storm’s End and councillor to the king and so I name you

Ser Barristan chuckled By his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so I name him

There was general laughter led by Lord Renly himself The tension of a few moments ago was gone and Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable… until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside and stood before her unsmiling He did not say a word Lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head I am sorry if I offended you Ser Ilyn she said

She waited for an answer but none came As the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him Still silent he turned and walked away

Sansa did not understand She looked at her prince Did I say something wrong Your Grace Why will he not speak to me

Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years Lord Renly commented with a sly smile

Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took Sansa’s hands in his own Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers

He speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned Then she smiled graciously and said Sansa the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella Please give your sweet sister my apologies Joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today

It would be my pleasure Mother Joffrey said very formally He took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and Sansa’s spirits took flight A whole day with her prince She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully He was so gallant she thought The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound why it was almost like the songs like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa from the giants or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys’s honor against evil Ser Morgil’s slanders

The touch of Joffrey’s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster What would you like to do

Be with you Sansa thought but she said Whatever you’d like to do my prince

Jofftey reflected a moment We could go riding

Oh I love riding Sansa said

Joffrey glanced back at Lady who was following at their heels Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say

Sansa hesitated If you like she said uncertainly I suppose I could tie Lady up She did not quite understand though I didn’t know you had a dog…

Joffrey laughed He’s my mother’s dog in truth She has set him to guard me and so he does

You mean the Hound she said She wanted to hit herself for being so slow Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid Is it safe to leave him behind

Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask Have no fear lady I am almost a man grown and I don’t fight with wood like your brothers All I need is this He drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castle-forged and double-edged with a leather grip and a lion’s-head pommel in gold Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and Joffrey looked pleased I call it Lion’s Tooth he said

And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion’s Tooth

It was a glorious day a magical day The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north Prince Joffrey’s mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare It was a day for adventures They explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry Joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady They dined on trout fresh from the river and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before My father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince

My betrothed can drink as much as she wants Joffrey said refilling her cup

They went more slowly after they had eaten Joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine Shouldn’t we be starting back she asked

Soon Joffrey said The battleground is right up ahead where the river bends That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen you know He smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys and my father was king What’s that sound

Sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack I don’t know she said It made her nervous though Joffrey let’s go back

I want to see what it is Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and Sansa had no choice but to follow The noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt

Someone’s there Sansa said anxiously She found herself thinking of Lady wishing the direwolf was with her

You’re safe with me Joffrey drew his Lion’s Tooth from its sheath The sound of steel on leather made her tremble This way he said riding through a stand of trees

Beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights Their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily The boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack The girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy’s blows but not all When she tried to lunge at him he caught her stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers She cried out and lost her weapon

Prince Joffrey laughed The boy looked around wide-eyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass The girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and Sansa was horrified Arya she called out incredulously

Go away Arya shouted back at them angry tears in her eyes What are you doing here Leave us alone

Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again Your sister She nodded blushing Joffrey examined the boy an ungainly lad with a coarse freckled face and thick red hair And who are you boy he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior
