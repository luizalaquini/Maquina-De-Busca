Best hope she doesn’t Jaime blocked his path again Or it’s like to be your corpse we carry out The wench is as strong as Gregor Clegane though not so pretty

This is no concern of yours Ser Loras shoved him aside

Jaime grabbed the boy with his good hand and yanked him around I am the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard you arrogant pup Your commander so long as you wear that white cloak Now sheathe your bloody sword or I’ll take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found

The boy hesitated half a heartbeat long enough for Ser Balon Swann to say Do as the Lord Commander says Loras Some of the gold cloaks drew their steel then and that made some Dreadfort men do the same Splendid thought Jaime no sooner do I climb down off my horse than we have a bloodbath in the yard

Ser Loras Tyrell slammed his sword back into its sheath

That wasn’t so difficult was it

I want her arrested Ser Loras pointed Lady Brienne I charge you with the murder of Lord Renly Baratheon

For what it’s worth said Jaime the wench does have honor More than I have seen from you And it may even be she’s telling it true I’ll grant you she’s not what you’d call clever but even my horse could come up with a better lie if it was a lie she meant to tell As you insist however… Ser Balon escort Lady Brienne to a tower cell and hold her there under guard And find some suitable quarters for Steelshanks and his men until such time as my father can see them

Yes my lord

Brienne’s big blue eyes were full of hurt as Balon Swann and a dozen gold cloaks led her away You ought to be blowing me kisses wench he wanted to tell her Why must they misunderstand every bloody thing he did Aerys It all grows from Aerys Jaime turned his back on the wench and strode across the yard

Another knight in white armor was guarding the doors of the royal sept a tall man with a black beard broad shoulders and a hooked nose When he saw Jaime he gave a sour smile and said And where do you think you’re going

Into the sept Jaime lifted his stump to point That one right there I mean to see the queen

Her Grace is in mourning And why would she be wanting to see the likes of you

Because I’m her lover and the father of her murdered son he wanted to say Who in seven hells are you

A knight of the Kingsguard and you’d best learn some respect cripple or I’ll have that other hand and leave you to suck up your porridge of a morning

I am the queen’s brother ser

The white knight thought that funny Escaped have you And grown a bit as well m’lord

Her other brother dolt And the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Now stand aside or you’ll wish you had

The dolt took a long look this time Is it… Ser Jaime He straightened My pardons milord I did not know you I have the honor to be Ser Osmund Kettleblack

Where’s the honor in that I want some time alone with my sister See that no one else enters the sept ser If we’re disturbed I’ll have your bloody head

Aye ser As you say Ser Osmund opened the door

Cersei was kneeling before the altar of the Mother Joffrey’s bier had been laid out beneath the Stranger who led the newly dead to the other world The smell of incense hung heavy in the air and a hundred candles burned sending up a hundred prayers Joff’s like to need every one of them too

His sister looked over her shoulder Who she said then Jaime She rose her eyes brimming with tears Is it truly you She did not come to him however She has never come to me he thought She has always waited letting me come to her She gives but I must ask You should have come sooner she murmured when he took her in his arms Why couldn’t you have come sooner to keep him safe My boy…

Our boy I came as fast I could He broke from the embrace and stepped back a pace It’s war out there Sister

You look so thin And your hair your golden hair…

The hair will grow back Jaime lifted his stump She needs to see This won’t

Her eyes went wide The Starks…

No This was Vargo Hoat’s work

The name meant nothing to her Who

The Goat of Harrenhal For a little while

Cersei turned to gaze at Joffrey’s bier They had dressed the dead king in gilded armor eerily similar to Jaime’s own The visor of the helm was closed but the candles reflected softly off the gold so the boy shimmered bright and brave in death The candlelight woke fires in the rubies that decorated the bodice of Cersei’s mourning dress as well Her hair fell to her shoulders undressed and unkempt He killed him Jaime Just as he’d warned me One day when I thought myself safe and happy he would turn my joy to ashes in my mouth he said

Tyrion said that Jaime had not wanted to believe it Kinslaying was worse than kingslaying in the eyes of gods and men He knew the boy was mine I loved Tyrion I was good to him Well but for that one time… but the Imp did not know the truth of that Or did he Why would he kill Joff

For a whore She clutched his good hand and held it tight in hers He told me he was going to do it Joff knew As he was dying he pointed at his murderer At our twisted little monster of a brother She kissed Jaime’s fingers You’ll kill him for me won’t you You’ll avenge our son

Jaime pulled away He is still my brother He shoved his stump at her face in case she failed to see it And I am in no fit state to be killing anyone

You have another hand don’t you I am not asking you to best the Hound in battle Tyrion is a dwarf locked in a cell The guards would stand aside for you

The thought turned his stomach I must know more of this Of how it happened

You shall Cersei promised There’s to be a trial When you hear all he did you’ll want him dead as much as I do She touched his face I was lost without you Jaime I was afraid the Starks would send me your head I could not have borne that She kissed him A light kiss the merest brush of her lips on his but he could feel her tremble as he slid his arms around her I am not whole without you

There was no tenderness in the kiss he returned to her only hunger Her mouth opened for his tongue No she said weakly when his lips moved down her neck not here The septons…

The Others can take the septons He kissed her again kissed her silent kissed her until she moaned Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Mother’s altar pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath She pounded on his chest with feeble fists murmuring about the risk the danger about their father about the septons about the wrath of gods He never heard her He undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes When he tore them away he saw that her moon’s blood was on her but it made no difference

Hurry she was whispering now quickly quickly now do it now do me now Jaime Jaime Jaime Her hands helped guide him Yes Cersei said as he thrust my brother sweet brother yes like that yes I have you you’re home now you’re home now you’re home She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair Jaime lost himself in her flesh He could feel Cersei’s heart beating in time with his own and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined

But no sooner were they done than the queen said Let me up If we are discovered like this…

Reluctantly he rolled away and helped her off the altar The pale marble was smeared with blood Jaime wiped it clean with his sleeve then bent to pick up the candles he had knocked over Fortunately they had all gone out when they fell If the sept had caught fire I might never have noticed

This was folly Cersei pulled her gown straight With Father in the castle… Jaime we must be careful

I am sick of being careful The Targaryens wed brother to sister why shouldn’t we do the same Marry me Cersei Stand up before the realm and say it’s me you want We’ll have our own wedding feast and make another son in place of Joffrey

She drew back That’s not funny

Do you hear me chuckling

Did you leave your wits at Riverrun Her voice had an edge to it Tommen’s throne derives from Robert you know that

He’ll have Casterly Rock isn’t that enough Let Father sit the throne All I want is you He made to touch her cheek Old habits die hard and it was his right arm he lifted

Cersei recoiled from his stump Don’t… don’t talk like this You’re scaring me Jaime Don’t be stupid One wrong word and you’ll cost us everything What did they do to you

They cut off my hand
