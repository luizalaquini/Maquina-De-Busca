2723 And he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his
brother Esaus hands so he blessed him

2724 And he said Art thou my very son Esau And he said I am

2725 And he said Bring it near to me and I will eat of my sons
venison that my soul may bless thee And he brought it near to him
and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank

2726 And his father Isaac said unto him Come near now and kiss me
my son

2727 And he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of
his raiment and blessed him and said See the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed 2728 Therefore God
give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and
plenty of corn and wine 2729 Let people serve thee and nations bow
down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow
down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he
that blesseth thee

2730 And it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of
blessing Jacob and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of
Isaac his father that Esau his brother came in from his hunting

2731 And he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his
father and said unto his father Let my father arise and eat of his
sons venison that thy soul may bless me

2732 And Isaac his father said unto him Who art thou And he said I
am thy son thy firstborn Esau

2733 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said Who where is he
that hath taken venison and brought it me and I have eaten of all
before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be
blessed

2734 And when Esau heard the words of his father he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father Bless me
even me also O my father

2735 And he said Thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away
thy blessing

2736 And he said Is not he rightly named Jacob for he hath
supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and
behold now he hath taken away my blessing And he said Hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me  2737 And Isaac answered and said unto
Esau Behold I have made him thy lord and all his brethren have I
given to him for servants and with corn and wine have I sustained
him and what shall I do now unto thee my son  2738 And Esau said
unto his father Hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even
me also O my father And Esau lifted up his voice and wept

2739 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him Behold thy
dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven
from above 2740 And by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve
thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the
dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck

2741 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
father blessed him and Esau said in his heart The days of mourning
for my father are at hand then will I slay my brother Jacob

2742 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah and
she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said unto him Behold
thy brother Esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to
kill thee

2743 Now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to Laban
my brother to Haran 2744 And tarry with him a few days until thy
brothers fury turn away 2745 Until thy brothers anger turn away
from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then I will
send and fetch thee from thence why should I be deprived also of you
both in one day  2746 And Rebekah said to Isaac I am weary of my
life because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a wife of the
daughters of Heth such as these which are of the daughters of the
land what good shall my life do me  281 And Isaac called Jacob and
blessed him and charged him and said unto him Thou shalt not take a
wife of the daughters of Canaan

282 Arise go to Padanaram to the house of Bethuel thy mothers
father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy
mothers brother

283 And God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply
thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people 284 And give thee
the blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which God gave
unto Abraham

285 And Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to Padanaram unto Laban
son of Bethuel the Syrian the brother of Rebekah Jacobs and Esaus
mother

286 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to
Padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him
he gave him a charge saying Thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughers of Canaan 287 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his
mother and was gone to Padanaram 288 And Esau seeing that the
