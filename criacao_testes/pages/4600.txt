Of course they do Summer Islanders have no imagination My son ought to take the puff fish for his sigil if truth be told He could put a crown on it the way the Baratheons do their stag mayhap that would make him happy We should have stayed well out of all this bloody foolishness if you ask me but once the cow’s been milked there’s no squirting the cream back up her udder After Lord Puff Fish put that crown on Renly’s head we were into the pudding up to our knees so here we are to see things through And what do you say to that Sansa

Sansa’s mouth opened and closed She felt very like a puff fish herself The Tyrells can trace their descent back to Garth Greenhand was the best she could manage at short notice

The Queen of Thorns snorted So can the Florents the Rowans the Oakhearts and half the other noble houses of the south Garth liked to plant his seed in fertile ground they say I shouldn’t wonder that more than his hands were green

Sansa Lady Alerie broke in you must be very hungry Shall we have a bite of boar together and some lemon cakes

Lemon cakes are my favorite Sansa admitted

So we have been told declared Lady Olenna who obviously had no intention of being hushed That Varys creature seemed to think we should be grateful for the information I’ve never been quite sure what the point of a eunuch is if truth be told It seems to me they’re only men with the useful bits cut off Alerie will you have them bring the food or do you mean to starve me to death Here Sansa sit here next to me I’m much less boring than these others I hope that you’re fond of fools

Sansa smoothed down her skirts and sat I think    fools my lady You mean    the sort in motley

Feathers in this case What did you imagine I was speaking of My son Or these lovely ladies No don’t blush with your hair it makes you look like a pomegranate All men are fools if truth be told but the ones in motley are more amusing than ones with crowns Margaery child summon Butterbumps let us see if we can’t make Lady Sansa smile The rest of you be seated do I have to tell you everything Sansa must think that my granddaughter is attended by a flock of sheep

Butterbumps arrived before the food dressed in a jester’s suit of green and yellow feathers with a floppy coxcomb An immense round fat man as big as three Moon Boys he came cartwheeling into the hall vaulted onto the table and laid a gigantic egg right in front of Sansa Break it my lady he commanded When she did a dozen yellow chicks escaped and began running in all directions Catch them Butterbumps exclaimed Little Lady Bulwer snagged one and handed it to him whereby he tilted back his head popped it into his huge rubbery mouth and seemed to swallow it whole When he belched tiny yellow feathers flew out his nose Lady Bulwer began to wail in distress but her tears turned into a sudden squeal of delight when the chick came squirming out of the sleeve of her gown and ran down her arm

As the servants brought out a broth of leeks and mushrooms Butterbumps began to juggle and Lady Olenna pushed herself forward to rest her elbows on the table Do you know my son Sansa Lord Puff Fish of Highgarden

A great lord Sansa answered politely

A great oaf said the Queen of Thorns His father was an oaf as well My husband the late Lord Luthor Oh I loved him well enough don’t mistake me A kind man and not unskilled in the bedchamber but an appalling oaf all the same He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him

And now my oaf son is doing the same only he’s riding a lion instead of a palfrey It is easy to mount a lion and not so easy to get off I warned him but he only chuckles Should you ever have a son Sansa beat him frequently so he learns to mind you I only had the one boy and I hardly beat him at all so now he pays more heed to Butterbumps than he does to me A lion is not a lap cat I told him and he gives me a ‘tut-tut-Mother’ There is entirely too much tut-tutting in this realm if you ask me All these kings would do a deal better if they would put down their swords and listen to their mothers

Sansa realized that her mouth was open again She filled it with a spoon of broth while Lady Alerie and the other women were giggling at the spectacle of Butterbumps bouncing oranges off his head his elbows and his ample rump

I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy said Lady Olenna abruptly This Joffrey

Sansa’s fingers tightened round her spoon The truth I can’t Don’t ask it please I can’t I    I    I   

You yes Who would know better The lad seems kingly enough I’ll grant you A bit full of himself but that would be his Lannister blood We have heard some troubling tales however Is there any truth to them Has this boy mistreated you

Sansa glanced about nervously Butterbumps popped a whole orange into his mouth chewed and swallowed slapped his cheek and blew seeds out of his nose The women giggled and laughed Servants were coming and going and the Maidenvault echoed to the clatter of spoons and plates One of the chicks hopped back onto the table and ran through Lady Graceford’s broth No one seemed to be paying them any mind but even so she was frightened

Lady Olenna was growing impatient Why are you gaping at Butterbumps I asked a question I expect an answer Have the Lannisters stolen your tongue child

Ser Dontos had warned her to speak freely only in the godswood Joff    King Joffrey he’s    His Grace is very fair and handsome and    and as brave as a lion

Yes all the Lannisters are lions and when a Tyrell breaks wind it smells just like a rose the old woman snapped But how kind is he How clever Has he a good heart a gentle hand Is he chivalrous as befits a king Will he cherish Margaery and treat her tenderly protect her honor as he would his own

He will Sansa lied He is very    very comely

You said that You know child some say that you are as big a fool as Butterbumps here and I am starting to believe them Comely I have taught my Margaery what comely is worth I hope Somewhat less than a mummer’s fart Aerion Brightfire was comely enough but a monster all the same The question is what is Joffrey She reached to snag a passing servant I am not fond of leeks Take this broth away and bring me some cheese

The cheese will be served after the cakes my lady

The cheese will be served when I want it served and I want it served now The old woman turned back to Sansa Are you frightened child No need for that we’re only women here Tell me the truth no harm will come to you

My father always told the truth Sansa spoke quietly but even so it was hard to get the words out

Lord Eddard yes he had that reputation but they named him traitor and took his head off even so The old woman’s eyes bore into her sharp and bright as the points of swords

Joffrey Sansa said Joffrey did that He promised me he would be merciful and cut my father’s head off He said that was mercy and he took me up on the walls and made me look at it The head He wanted me to weep but    She stopped abruptly and covered her mouth I’ve said too much oh gods be good they’ll know they’ll hear someone will tell on me

Go on It was Margaery who urged Joffrey’s own queen-to-be Sansa did not know how much she had heard

I can’t What if she tells him what if she tells He’ll kill me for certain then or give me to Ser Ilyn I never meant    my father was a traitor my brother as well I have the traitor’s blood please don’t make me say more

Calm yourself child the Queen of Thorns commanded

She’s terrified Grandmother just look at her

The old woman called to Butterbumps Fool Give us a song A long one I should think ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ will do nicely

It will the huge jester replied It will do nicely indeed Shall I sing it standing on my head my lady

Will that make it sound better

No

Stand on your feet then We wouldn’t want your hat to fall off As I recall you never wash your hair

As my lady commands Butterbumps bowed low let loose of an enormous belch then straightened threw out his belly and bellowed A bear there was a bear a BEAR All black and brown and covered with hair   

Lady Olenna squirmed forward Even when I was a girl younger than you it was well known that in the Red Keep the very walls have ears Well they will be the better for a song and meanwhile we girls shall speak freely

But Sansa said Varys    he knows he always   

Sing louder the Queen of Thorns shouted at Butterbumps These old ears are almost deaf you know Are you whispering at me you fat fool I don’t pay you for whispers Sing

   THE BEAR thundered Butterbumps his great deep voice echoing off the rafters OH COME THEY SAID OH COME TO THE FAIR THE FAIR SAID HE BUT I’M A BEAR ALL BLACK AND BROWN AND COVERED WITH HAIR

The wrinkled old lady smiled At Highgarden we have many spiders amongst the flowers So long as they keep to themselves we let them spin their little webs but if they get underfoot we step on them She patted Sansa on the back of the hand Now child the truth What sort of man is this Joffrey who calls himself Baratheon but looks so very Lannister

AND DOWN THE ROAD FROM HERE TO THERE FROM HERE TO THERE THREE BOYS A GOAT AND A DANCING BEAR

Sansa felt as though her heart had lodged in her throat The Queen of Thorns was so close she could smell the old woman’s sour breath Her gaunt thin fingers were pinching her wrist To her other side Margaery was listening as well A shiver went through her A monster she whispered so tremulously she could scarcely hear her own voice Joffrey is a monster He lied about the butcher’s boy and made Father kill my wolf When I displease him he has the Kingsguard beat me He’s evil and cruel my lady it’s so And the queen as well

Lady Olenna Tyrell and her granddaughter exchanged a look Ah said the old woman that’s a pity

Oh gods thought Sansa horrified If Margaery won’t marry him Joff will know that I’m to blame Please she blurted don’t stop the wedding   

Have no fear Lord Puff Fish is determined that Margaery shall be queen And the word of a Tyrell is worth more than all the gold in Casterly Rock At least it was in my day Even so we thank you for the truth child

   DANCED AND SPUN ALL THE WAY TO THE FAIR THE FAIR THE FAIR Butterbumps hopped and roared and stomped his feet

Sansa would you like to visit Highgarden When Margaery Tyrell smiled she looked very like her brother Loras All the autumn flowers are in bloom just now and there are groves and fountains shady courtyards marble colonnades My lord father always keeps singers at court sweeter ones than Butters here and pipers and fiddlers and harpers as well We have the best horses and pleasure boats to sail along the Mander Do you hawk Sansa
