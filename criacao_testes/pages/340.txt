When the skinny man was dead Gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more Arya looked past him and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast firelight shining off mail and blades and she knew that they’d gotten over the wall somewhere or broken through at the postern She jumped down beside Gendry landing the way Syrio had taught her The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying For a moment Arya stood uncertain not knowing which way to go Death was all around her

And then Yoren was there shaking her screaming in her face Boy he yelled the way he always yelled it Get out it’s done we’ve lost Herd up all you can you and him and the others the boys you get them out Now

How Arya said

That trap he screamed Under the barn

Quick as that he was gone off to fight sword in hand Arya grabbed Gendry by the arm He said go she shouted the barn the way out Through the slits of his helm the Bull’s eyes shone with reflected fire He nodded They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf They found Gerren too but he was hurt too bad to move As they were running toward the barn Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos surrounded by smoke and slaughter She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead The girl wouldn’t walk even when slapped Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left Ahead the night was a sullen red The barn’s on fire she thought Flames were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within Hot Pie stepped out of the barn Arry come on Lommy’s gone leave her if she won’t come

Stubbornly Arya dragged all the harder pulling the crying girl along Hot Pie scuttled back inside abandoning them… but Gendry came back the fire shining so bright on his polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange He ran to them and hoisted the crying girl up over his shoulder Run

Rushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace The air was swirling with smoke the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof Their horses and donkeys were kicking and rearing and screaming The poor animals Arya thought Then she saw the wagon and the three men manacled to its bed Biter was flinging himself against the chains blood running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists Rorge screamed curses kicking at the wood Boy called Jaqen H’ghar Sweet boy

The open trap was only a few feet ahead but the fire was spreading fast consuming the old wood and dry straw faster than she would have believed Arya remembered the Hound’s horrible burned face Tunnel’s narrow Gendry shouted How do we get her through

Pull her Arya said Push her

Good boys kind boys called Jaqen H’ghar coughing

Get these fucking chains off Rorge screamed

Gendry ignored them You go first then her then me Hurry it’s a long way

When you split the firewood Arya remembered where did you leave the axe

Out by the haven He spared a glance for the chained men I’d save the donkeys first There’s no time

You take her she yelled You get her out You do it The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn It felt blessedly cool outside but men were dying all around her She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield and she saw them kill him where he stood Smoke was everywhere There was no sign of Yoren but the axe was where Gendry had left it by the woodpile outside the haven As she wrenched it free a mailed hand grabbed her arm Spinning Arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs She never saw his face only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside donkeys and horses and men She chewed her lip and darted through the doors crouched low where the smoke wasn’t quite so thick

A donkey was caught in a ring of fire shrieking in terror and pain She could smell the stench of burning hair The roof was gone up too and things were falling down pieces of flaming wood and bits of straw and hay Arya put a hand over her mouth and nose She couldn’t see the wagon for the smoke but she could still hear Biter screaming She crawled toward the sound

And then a wheel was looming over her The wagon jumped and moved a half foot when Biter threw himself against his chains again Jaqen saw her but it was too hard to breathe let alone talk She threw the axe into the wagon Rorge caught it and lifted it over his head rivers of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face Arya was running coughing She heard the steel crash through the old wood and again again An instant later came a crack as loud as thunder and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters

Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet She got dirt in her mouth but she didn’t care the taste was fine the taste was mud and water and worms and life Under the earth the air was cool and dark Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way and began to crawl A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound like the roar of some monstrous beast and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her smelling of hell Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried For whom she could not say





TYRION

The queen was not disposed to wait on Varys Treason is vile enough she declared furiously but this is barefaced naked villainy and I do not need that mincing eunuch to tell me what must be done with villains

Tyrion took the letters from his sister’s hand and compared them side by side There were two copies the words exactly alike though they had been written by different hands

Maester Frenken received the first missive at Castle Stokeworth Grand Maester Pycelle explained The second copy came through Lord Gyles

Littlefinger fingered his beard If Stannis bothered with them it’s past certain every other lord in the Seven Kingdoms saw a copy as well

I want these letters burned every one Cersei declared No hint of this must reach my son’s ears or my father’s

I imagine Father’s heard rather more than a hint by now Tyrion said dryly Doubtless Stannis sent a bird to Casterly Rock and another to Harrenhal As for burning the letters to what point The song is sung the wine is spilled the wench is pregnant And this is not as dire as it seems in truth
