Brienne shook her head When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid him with false coin…

Oh he knows Lannisters lie remember It makes no matter this girl serves his purpose just as well Who is going to say that she isn’t Arya Stark Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for her sister who has disappeared

Why would you tell me all this if it’s true You are betraying your father’s secrets

The Hand’s secrets he thought I no longer have a father I pay my debts like every good little lion I did promise Lady Stark her daughters… and one of them is still alive My brother may know where she is but if so he isn’t saying Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped him murder Joffrey

The wench’s mouth got stubborn I will not believe that gentle girl a poisoner Lady Catelyn said that she had a loving heart It was your brother There was a trial Ser Loras said

Two trials actually Words and swords both failed him A bloody mess Did you watch from your window

My cell faces the sea I heard the shouting though

Prince Oberyn of Dorne is dead Ser Gregor Clegane lies dying and Tyrion stands condemned before the eyes of gods and men They’re keeping him in a black cell till they kill him

Brienne looked at him You do not believe he did it

Jaime gave her a hard smile See wench We know each other too well Tyrion’s wanted to be me since he took his first step but he’d never follow me in kingslaying Sansa Stark killed Joffrey My brother’s kept silent to protect her He gets these fits of gallantry from time to time The last one cost him a nose This time it will mean his head

No Brienne said It was not my lady’s daughter It could not have been her

There’s the stubborn stupid wench that I remember

She reddened My name is…

Brienne of Tarth Jaime sighed I have a gift for you He reached down under the Lord Commander’s chair and brought it out wrapped in folds of crimson velvet

Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite her reached out a huge freckled hand and flipped back a fold of cloth Rubies glimmered in the light She picked the treasure up gingerly curled her fingers around the leather grip and slowly slid the sword free of its scabbard Blood and black the ripples shone A finger of reflected light ran red along the edge Is this Valyrian steel I have never seen such colors

Nor I There was a time that I would have given my right hand to wield a sword like that Now it appears I have so the blade is wasted on me Take it Before she could think to refuse he went on A sword so fine must bear a name It would please me if you would call this one Oathkeeper One more thing The blade comes with a price

Her face darkened I told you I will never serve…

…such foul creatures as us Yes I recall Hear me out Brienne Both of us swore oaths concerning Sansa Stark Cersei means to see that the girl is found and killed wherever she has gone to ground…

Brienne’s homely face twisted in fury If you believe that I would harm my lady’s daughter for a sword you—

Just listen he snapped angered by her assumption I want you to find Sansa first and get her somewhere safe How else are the two of us going to make good our stupid vows to your precious dead Lady Catelyn

The wench blinked I… I thought…

I know what you thought Suddenly Jaime was sick of the sight of her She bleats like a bloody sheep When Ned Stark died his greatsword was given to the King’s Justice he told her But my father felt that such a fine blade was wasted on a mere headsman He gave Ser Ilyn a new sword and had Ice melted down and reforged There was enough metal for two new blades You’re holding one So you’ll be defending Ned Stark’s daughter with Ned Stark’s own steel if that makes any difference to you

Ser I… I owe you an apolo…

He cut her off Take the bloody sword and go before I change my mind There’s a bay mare in the stables as homely as you are but somewhat better trained Chase after Steelshanks search for Sansa or ride home to your isle of sapphires it’s naught to me I don’t want to look at you anymore

Jaime…

Kingslayer he reminded her Best use that sword to clean the wax out of your ears wench We’re done

Stubbornly she persisted Joffrey was your…

My king Leave it at that

You say Sansa killed him Why protect her

Because Joff was no more to me than a squirt of seed in Cersei’s cunt And because he deserved to die I have made kings and unmade them Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor Jaime smiled thinly Besides kingslayers should band together Are you ever going to go

Her big hand wrapped tight around Oathkeeper I will And I will find the girl and keep her safe For her lady mother’s sake And for yours She bowed stiffly whirled and went

Jaime sat alone at the table while the shadows crept across the room As dusk began to settle he lit a candle and opened the White Book to his own page Quill and ink he found in a drawer Beneath the last line Ser Barristan had entered he wrote in an awkward hand that might have done credit to a six-year-old being taught his first letters by a maester

Defeated in the Whispering Wood by the Young Wolf Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings Held captive at Riverrun and ransomed for a promise unfuffilled Captured again by the Brave Companions and maimed at the word of Vargo Hoat their captain losing his sword hand to the blade of Zollo the Fat Returned safely to King’s Landing by Brienne the Maid of Tarth

When he was done more than three-quarters of his page still remained to be filled between the gold lion on the crimson shield on top and the blank white shield at the bottom Ser Gerold Hightower had begun his history and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it but the rest Jaime Lannister would need to write for himself He could write whatever he chose henceforth

Whatever he chose…





Jon


The wind was blowing wild from the east so strong the heavy cage would rock whenever a gust got it in its teeth It skirled along the Wall shivering off the ice making Jon’s cloak flap against the bars The sky was slate grey the sun no more than a faint patch of brightness behind the clouds Across the killing ground he could see the glimmer of a thousand campfires burning but their lights seemed small and powerless against such gloom and cold

A grim day Jon Snow wrapped gloved hands around the bars and held tight as the wind hammered at the cage once more When he looked straight down past his feet the ground was lost in shadow as if he were being lowered into some bottomless pit Well death is a bottomless pit of sorts he reflected and when this day’s work is done my name will be shadowed forever

Bastard children were born from lust and lies men said their nature was wanton and treacherous Once Jon had meant to prove them wrong to show his lord father that he could be as good and true a son as Robb I made a botch of that Robb had become a hero king if Jon was remembered at all it would be as a turncloak an oathbreaker and a murderer He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see his shame

I should have stayed in that cave with Ygritte If there was a life beyond this one he hoped to tell her that She will claw my face the way the eagle did and curse me for a coward but I’ll tell her all the same He flexed his sword hand as Maester Aemon had taught him The habit had become part of him and he would need his fingers to be limber to have even half a chance of murdering Mance Rayder

They had pulled him out this morning after four days in the ice locked up in a cell five by five by five too low for him to stand too tight for him to stretch out on his back The stewards had long ago discovered that food and meat kept longer in the icy storerooms carved from the base of the Wall… but prisoners did not You will die in here Lord Snow Ser Alliser had said just before he closed the heavy wooden door and Jon had believed it But this morning they had come and pulled him out again and marched him cramped and shivering back to the King’s Tower to stand before jowly Janos Slynt once more

That old maester says I cannot hang you Slynt declared He has written Cotter Pyke and even had the bloody gall to show me the letter He says you are no turncloak

Aemon’s lived too long my lord Ser Alliser assured him His wits have gone dark as his eyes

Aye Slynt said A blind man with a chain about his neck who does he think he is

Aemon Targaryen Jon thought a king’s son and a king’s brother and a king who might have been But he said nothing

Still Slynt said I will not have it said that Janos Slynt hanged a man unjustly I will not I have decided to give you one last chance to prove you are as loyal as you claim Lord Snow One last chance to do your duty yes He stood Mance Rayder wants to parley with us He knows he has no chance now that Janos Slynt has come so he wants to talk this King-beyond-the-Wall But the man is craven and will not come to us No doubt he knows I’d hang him Hang him by his feet from the top of the Wall on a rope two hundred feet long But he will not come He asks that we send an envoy to him

We’re sending you Lord Snow Ser Alliser smiled

Me Jon’s voice was flat Why me
