there they buried the people that lusted

1135 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth
and abode at Hazeroth

121 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
woman whom he had married for he had married an Ethiopian woman

122 And they said Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses hath he
not spoken also by us And the LORD heard it

123 Now the man Moses was very meek above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth  124 And the LORD spake suddenly unto
Moses and unto Aaron and unto Miriam Come out ye three unto the
tabernacle of the congregation And they three came out

125 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in
the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam and they both
came forth

126 And he said Hear now my words If there be a prophet among you
I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak
unto him in a dream

127 My servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house

128 With him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in
dark speeches and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses
129 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them and he
departed

1210 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold
Miriam became leprous white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam
and behold she was leprous

1211 And Aaron said unto Moses Alas my lord I beseech thee lay
not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we
have sinned

1212 Let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed
when he cometh out of his mothers womb

1213 And Moses cried unto the LORD saying Heal her now O God I
beseech thee

1214 And the LORD said unto Moses If her father had but spit in her
face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from
the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again

1215 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people
journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again

1216 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth and pitched in
the wilderness of Paran

131 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 132 Send thou men that
they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of
Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one
a ruler among them

133 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
wilderness of Paran all those men were heads of the children of
Israel

134 And these were their names of the tribe of Reuben Shammua the
son of Zaccur

135 Of the tribe of Simeon Shaphat the son of Hori

136 Of the tribe of Judah Caleb the son of Jephunneh

137 Of the tribe of Issachar Igal the son of Joseph

138 Of the tribe of Ephraim Oshea the son of Nun

139 Of the tribe of Benjamin Palti the son of Raphu

1310 Of the tribe of Zebulun Gaddiel the son of Sodi

1311 Of the tribe of Joseph namely of the tribe of Manasseh Gaddi
the son of Susi

1312 Of the tribe of Dan Ammiel the son of Gemalli

1313 Of the tribe of Asher Sethur the son of Michael

1314 Of the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi the son of Vophsi

1315 Of the tribe of Gad Geuel the son of Machi

1316 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
land

And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua

1317 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto
them Get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain
1318 And see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth
therein whether they be strong or weak few or many 1319 And what
