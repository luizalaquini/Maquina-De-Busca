With the king They have been together most of the night

There was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken him no matter the hour to have him there to give his counsel I should have been told Cressen complained I should have been woken He disentangled his fingers from Shireen’s Pardons my lady but I must speak with your lord father Pylos give me your arm There are too many steps in this castle and it seems to me they add a few every night just to vex me

Shireen and Patchface followed them out but the child soon grew restless with the old man’s creeping pace and dashed ahead the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging madly

Castles are not friendly places for the frail Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table atop the Stone Drum Dragonstone’s central keep so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms To reach him they must cross the gallery pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate Young men climbed steps two at a time for old men with bad hips every one was a torment But Lord Stannis would not think to come to him so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal He had Pylos to help him at the least and for that he was grateful

Shuffling along the gallery they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of the outer bailey the curtain wall and the fishing village beyond In the yard archers were firing at practice butts to the call of Notch draw loose Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing Guardsmen strode the wallwalks peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords Past the sprawl of the camp the anchorage was crowded with ships No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again Lord Stannis’s Fury a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars looked almost small beside some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her

The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight and passed them through Wait here Cressen told Pylos within It’s best I see him alone

It is a long climb Maester

Cressen smiled You think I have forgotten I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by name

Halfway up he regretted his decision He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth descending

Davos was a slight man his low birth written plain upon a common face A well-worn green cloak stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun draped his thin shoulders over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong His small beard was well peppered with grey and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand When he saw Cressen he checked his descent

Ser Davos the maester said When did you return

In the black of morning My favorite time It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand Before Lord Stannis had knighted him he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms

And

The man shook his head It is as you warned him They will not rise Maester Not for him They do not love him

No Cressen thought Nor will they ever He is strong able just… aye just past the point of wisdom… yet it is not enough It has never been enough You spoke to them all

All No Only those that would see me They do not love me either these highborns To them I’ll always be the Onion Knight His left hand closed stubby fingers locking into a fist Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint all but the thumb I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose and the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove The others—well Beric Dondarrion is gone missing some say dead and Lord Caron is with Renly Bryce the Orange of the Rainbow Guard

The Rainbow Guard

Renly’s made his own Kingsguard the onetime smuggler explained but these seven don’t wear white Each one has his own color Loras Tyrell’s their Lord Commander

It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon a splendid new order of knighthood with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it Even as a boy Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics and he had loved his games as well Look at me he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm’s End Look at me I’m a dragon or Look at me I’m a wizard or Look at me look at me I’m the rain god

The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now one-and-twenty and still he played his games Look at me I’m a king Cressen thought sadly Oh Renly Renly dear sweet child do you know what you are doing And would you care if you did Is there anyone who cares for him but me What reasons did the lords give for their refusals he asked Ser Davos

Well as to that some gave me soft words and some blunt some made excuses some promises some only lied He shrugged In the end words are just wind

You could bring him no hope

Only the false sort and I’d not do that Davos said He had the truth from me

Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted after the siege of Storm’s End Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne Even the sea was closed against them watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor Within Storm’s End the horses had long since been eaten the dogs and cats were gone and the garrison was down to roots and rats Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars Cloaked in that darkness Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike His little ship had a black hull black sails black oars and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish Little enough yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm’s End and break the siege

Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath a small keep and a knight’s honors… but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand to pay for all his years of smuggling Davos had submitted on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself he would accept no punishment from lesser hands The lord had used a butcher’s cleaver the better to cut clean and true Afterward Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field—with an onion on its sails The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim

No Cressen thought a man like that would give no false hope nor soften a hard truth Ser Davos truth can be a bitter draught even for a man like Lord Stannis He thinks only of returning to King’s Landing in the fullness of his power to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his Yet now…

If he takes this meager host to King’s Landing it will be only to die He does not have the numbers I told him as much but you know his pride Davos held up his gloved hand My fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense
