That was Arya’s wolf she said Lady never hurt you but you killed her anyway

No your father did Joff said but I killed your father I wish I’d done it myself I killed a man last night who was bigger than your father They came to the gate shouting my name and calling for bread like I was some baker but I taught them better I shot the loudest one right through the throat

And he died With the ugly iron head of the quarrel staring her in the face it was hard to think what else to say

Of course he died he had my quarrel in his throat There was a woman throwing rocks I got her as well but only in the arm Frowning he lowered the crossbow I’d shoot you too but if I do Mother says they’d kill my uncle Jaime Instead you’ll just be punished and we’ll send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesn’t yield Dog hit her

Let me beat her Ser Dontos shoved forward tin armor clattering He was armed with a morningstar whose head was a melon My Florian She could have kissed him blotchy skin and broken veins and all He trotted his broomstick around her shouting Traitor traitor and whacking her over the head with the melon Sansa covered herself with her hands staggering every time the fruit pounded her her hair sticky by the second blow People were laughing The melon flew to pieces Laugh Joffrey she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the front of her blue silk gown Laugh and be satisfied

Joffrey did not so much as snigger Boros Meryn

Ser Meryn Trant seized Dontos by the arm and flung him brusquely away The red-faced fool went sprawling broomstick melon and all Ser Boros seized Sansa

Leave her face Joffrey commanded I like her pretty

Boros slammed a fist into Sansa’s belly driving the air out of her When she doubled over the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword and for one hideous instant she was certain he meant to open her throat As he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs she thought her legs might break from the force of the blow Sansa screamed Tears welled in her eyes It will be over soon She soon lost count of the blows

Enough she heard the Hound rasp

No it isn’t the king replied Boros make her naked

Boros shoved a meaty hand down the front of Sansa’s bodice and gave a hard yank The silk came tearing away baring her to the waist Sansa covered her breasts with her hands She could hear sniggers far off and cruel Beat her bloody Joffrey said we’ll see how her brother fancies—

What is the meaning of this

The Imp’s voice cracked like a whip and suddenly Sansa was free She stumbled to her knees arms crossed over her chest her breath ragged Is this your notion of chivalry Ser Boros Tyrion Lannister demanded angrily His pet sellsword stood with him and one of his wildlings the one with the burned eye What sort of knight beats helpless maids

The sort who serves his king Imp Ser Boros raised his sword and Ser Meryn stepped up beside him his blade scraping clear of its scabbard

Careful with those warned the dwarf’s sellsword You don’t want to get blood all over those pretty white cloaks

Someone give the girl something to cover herself with the Imp said Sandor Clegane unfastened his cloak and tossed it at her Sansa clutched it against her chest fists bunched hard in the white wool The coarse weave was scratchy against her skin but no velvet had ever felt so fine

This girl’s to be your queen the Imp told Joffrey Have you no regard for her honor

I’m punishing her

For what crime She did not fight her brother’s battle

She has the blood of a wolf

And you have the wits of a goose

You can’t talk to me that way The king can do as he likes

Aerys Targaryen did as he liked Has your mother ever told you what happened to him

Ser Boros Blount harrumphed No man threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard

Tyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow I am not threatening the king ser I am educating my nephew Bronn Timett the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth kill him The dwarf smiled Now that was a threat ser See the difference

Ser Boros turned a dark shade of red The queen will hear of this
