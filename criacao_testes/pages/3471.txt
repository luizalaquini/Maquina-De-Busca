Let’s hunt down the hunters then Robb said Side by side they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood Theon dropped back and followed well behind them talking and joking with the guardsmen

It was nice under the trees Bran kept Dancer to a walk holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went He knew this wood but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time The smells filled his nostrils the sharp fresh tang of pine needles the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider

Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind until Bran could no longer hear their voices From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters It grew louder until they reached the stream Tears stung his eyes

Bran Robb asked What’s wrong

Bran shook his head I was just remembering he said Jory brought us here once to fish for trout You and me and Jon Do you remember

I remember Robb said his voice quiet and sad

I didn’t catch anything Bran said but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell Will we ever see Jon again

We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit Robb pointed out Jon will visit too you’ll see

The stream was running high and fast Robb dismounted and led his gelding across the ford In the deepest part of the crossing the water came up to midthigh He tied his horse to a tree on the far side and waded back across for Bran and Dancer The current foamed around rock and root and Bran could feel the spray on his face as Robb led him over It made him smile For a moment he felt strong again and whole He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them right up to the very top with the whole forest spread out beneath him

They were on the far side when they heard the howl a long rising wail that moved through the trees like a cold wind Bran raised his head to listen Summer he said No sooner had he spoken than a second voice joined the first

They’ve made a kill Robb said as he remounted I’d best go and bring them back Wait here Theon and the others should be along shortly

I want to go with you Bran said

I’ll find them faster by myself Robb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees

Once he was gone the woods seemed to close in around Bran The snow was falling more heavily now Where it touched the ground it melted but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white As he waited he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt He could not feel his legs hanging useless in the stirrups but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing and the melting snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin and Joseth and the rest

When he heard the rustle of leaves Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn expecting to see his friends but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers

Good day to you he said nervously One look and Bran knew they were neither foresters nor farmers He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed His surcoat was new dark grey wool with silver buttons and a heavy silver pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders His boots and gloves were lined with fur as well

All alone are you said the biggest of them a bald man with a raw windburnt face Lost in the wolfswood poor lad

I’m not lost Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at him He counted four but when he turned his head he saw two others behind him My brother rode off just a moment ago and my guard will be here shortly

Your guard is it a second man said Grey stubble covered his gaunt face And what would they be guarding my little lord Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak

Pretty said a woman’s voice She scarcely looked like a woman tall and lean with the same hard face as the others her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm The spear she held was eight feet of black oak tipped in rusted steel

Let’s have a look said the big bald man

Bran watched him anxiously The man’s clothes were filthy fallen almost to pieces patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green and faded everywhere to grey but once that cloak might have been black The grey stubbly man wore black rags too he saw with a sudden start Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded the day they had found the wolf pups that man had worn black as well and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night’s Watch No man is more dangerous he remembered Lord Eddard saying The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile or cruel

The pin lad the big man said He held out his hand

We’ll take the horse too said another of them a woman shorter than Robb with a broad fiat face and lank yellow hair Get down and be quick about it A knife slid from her sleeve into her hand its edge jagged as a saw

No Bran blurted I can’t…

The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off You can lordling… and will if you know what’s good for you

Stiv look how he’s strapped on The tall woman pointed with her spear Might be it’s the truth he’s telling

Straps is it Stiv said He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt There’s ways to deal with straps

You some kind of cripple asked the short woman

Bran flared I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and you better let go of my horse or I’ll see you all dead

The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed The boy’s a Stark true enough Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg

Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth suggested the short woman That should shut him up

You’re as stupid as you are ugly Hali said the tall woman The boy’s worth nothing dead but alive… gods be damned think what Mance would give to have Benjen Stark’s own blood to hostage

Mance be damned the big man cursed You want to go back there Osha More fool you Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around his thigh The leather parted with a sigh

The stroke had been quick and careless biting deep Looking down Bran glimpsed pale flesh where the wool of his leggings had parted Then the blood began to flow He watched the red stain spread feeling light-headed curiously apart there had been no pain not even a hint of feeling The big man grunted in surprise

Put down your steel now and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death Robb called out

Bran looked up in desperate hope and there he was The strength of the words were undercut by the way his voice cracked with strain He was mounted the bloody carcass of an elk slung across the back of his horse his sword in a gloved hand

The brother said the man with the grey stubbly face

He’s a fierce one he is mocked the short woman Hali they called her You mean to fight us boy

Don’t be a fool lad You’re one against six The tall woman Osha leveled her spear Off the horse and throw down the sword We’ll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison and you and your brother can be on your way

Robb whistled They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves The undergrowth parted low-hanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from the green Summer sniffed the air and growled

Wolves gasped Hali

Direwolves Bran said Still half-grown they were as large as any wolf he had ever seen but the differences were easy to spot if you knew what to look for Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught him A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body and its snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced There was something gaunt and terrible about them as they stood there amid the gently falling snow Fresh blood spotted Grey Wind’s muzzle

Dogs the big bald man said contemptuously Yet I’m told there’s nothing like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night He made a sharp gesture Take them

Robb shouted Winterfell and kicked his horse The gelding plunged down the bank as the ragged men closed A man with an axe rushed in shouting and heedless Robb’s sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood The man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins and for half a second he had them… and then Grey Wind was on him bearing him down He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout flailing wildly with his knife as his head went under The direwolf plunged in after him and the white water turned red where they had vanished

Robb and Osha matched blows in midstream Her long spear was a steel-headed serpent flashing out at his chest once twice three times but Robb parried every thrust with his longsword turning the point aside On the fourth or fifth thrust the tall woman overextended herself and lost her balance just for a second Robb charged riding her down

A few feet away Summer darted in and snapped at Hali The knife bit at his flank Summer slid away snarling and came rushing in again This time his jaws closed around her calf Holding the knife with both hands the small woman stabbed down but the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming He pulled free for an instant his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh When Hali stumbled and fell he came at her again slamming her backward teeth tearing at her belly

The sixth man ran from the carnage… but not far As he went scrambling up the far side of the bank Grey Wind emerged from the stream dripping wet He shook the water off and bounded after the running man hamstringing him with a single snap of his teeth and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water

And then there was no one left but the big man Stiv He slashed at Bran’s chest strap grabbed his arm and yanked Suddenly Bran was falling He sprawled on the ground his legs tangled under him one foot in the stream He could not feel the cold of the water but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to his throat Back away the man warned or I’ll open the boy’s windpipe I swear it

Robb reined his horse in breathing hard The fury went out of his eyes and his sword arm dropped
