718 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day

719 Cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my
strength faileth

7110 For mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel together

7111 Saying God hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there
is none to deliver him

7112 O God be not far from me O my God make haste for my help

7113 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt

7114 But I will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and
more

7115 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day for I know not the numbers thereof

7116 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD I will make mention
of thy righteousness even of thine only

7117 O God thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have I
declared thy wondrous works

7118 Now also when I am old and greyheaded O God forsake me not
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power
to every one that is to come

7119 Thy righteousness also O God is very high who hast done great
things O God who is like unto thee

7120 Thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt
quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth

7121 Thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side

7122 I will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth O my
God unto thee will I sing with the harp O thou Holy One of Israel

7123 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee and my
soul which thou hast redeemed

7124 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long
for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my
hurt



721 Give the king thy judgments O God and thy righteousness unto
the kings son

722 He shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with
judgment

723 The mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little
hills by righteousness

724 He shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children
of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor

725 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure
throughout all generations

726 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that
water the earth

727 In his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace
so long as the moon endureth

728 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river
unto the ends of the earth

729 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his
enemies shall lick the dust

7210 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the
kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts

7211 Yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall
serve him

7212 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also
and him that hath no helper

7213 He shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of
the needy

7214 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and
precious shall their blood be in his sight

7215 And he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of
Sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall
