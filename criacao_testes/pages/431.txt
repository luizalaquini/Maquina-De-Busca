I do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must said Mormont Wildlings can no more live on snow and stone than we can They will emerge from the heights soon and for a host of any size the only route is along the Milkwater If so we are strongly placed here They cannot hope to slip by us

They may not wish to They are thousands and we will be three hundred when the Halfhand reaches us Ser Mallador accepted a cup from Jon

If it comes to battle we could not hope for better ground than here declared Mormont We’ll strengthen the defenses Pits and spikes caltrops scattered on the slopes every breach mended Jarman I’ll want your sharpest eyes as watchers A ring of them all around us and along the river to warn of any approach Hide them up in trees And we had best start bringing up water too more than we need We’ll dig cisterns It will keep the men occupied and may prove needful later

My rangers— started Thoren Smallwood

Your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us After that we’ll see I will not lose more of my men

Mance Rayder might be massing his host a day’s ride from here and we’d never know Smallwood complained

We know where the wildlings are massing Mormont came back We had it from Craster I mislike the man but I do not think he lied to us in this

As you say Smallwood took a sullen leave The others finished their wine and followed more courteously

Shall I bring you supper my lord Jon asked

Corn the raven cried Mormont did not answer at once When he did he said only Did your wolf find game today

He’s not back yet

We could do with fresh meat Mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful of corn You think I’m wrong to keep the rangers close

That’s not for me to say my lord

It is if you’re asked

If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist I don’t see how they can hope to find my uncle Jon admitted

They can’t The raven pecked at the kernels in the Old Bear’s palm Two hundred men or ten thousand the country is too vast The corn gone Mormont turned his hand over

You would not give up the search

Maester Aemon thinks you clever Mormont moved the raven to his shoulder The bird tilted its head to one side little eyes a-glitter

The answer was there Is it… it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred than for two hundred to find one

The raven gave a cackling scream but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of his beard This many men and horses leave a trail even Aemon could follow On this hill our fires ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the Frostfangs If Ben Stark is alive and free he will come to us I have no doubt

Yes said Jon but… what if…

…he’s dead Mormont asked not unkindly

Jon nodded reluctantly

Dead the raven said Dead Dead

He may come to us anyway the Old Bear said As Othor did and Jafer Flowers I dread that as much as you Jon but we must admit the possibility

Dead his raven cawed ruffling its wings Its voice grew louder and more shrill Dead

Mormont stroked the bird’s black feathers and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his hand I will forsake supper I believe Rest will serve me better Wake me at first light
