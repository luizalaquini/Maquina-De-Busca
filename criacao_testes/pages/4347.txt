The reflection coefficients were spliced during an overlap region of
only 20 msec
More interestingly attempts were made to suppress the plosive bursts
of stop sounds in cases where they were followed by another stop at
the beginning of the next word
This is a common coarticulation occurring for instance in the phrase
stop burst  In running speech the plosion on the
ul
p
of stop is
normally suppressed because it is followed by another stop
This is a particularly striking case because the place of articulation
of the two stops
ul
p
and
ul
b
is the same  complete suppression is not as likely
to happen in stop gap for example although it may occur
Here is an instance of how extra information could improve the
quality of the synthetic transitions considerably
However automatically identifying the place of articulation of stops is
a difficult job of a complexity far above what is appropriate for
simply joining words stored in source-filter form
pp
Another innovation was introduced into the transition between two
vowel sounds when the second word began with an accented syllable
A glottal stop was placed at the juncture
Although the glottal stop was not described in Chapter 2 it is a sound
used in many dialects of English  It frequently occurs
in the utterance uh-uh meaning no  Here it
ul
is
used to separate two vowel sounds but in fact this is not particularly
common in most dialects
One could say the apple the orange the onion with a neutral vowel
in the to rhyme with c
ul
ac
bove and a glottal stop as separator
but it is much more usual to rhyme the with he and introduce a
ul
y
between the words
Similarly even speakers who do not normally pronounce an
ul
r
at the
end of words will introduce one in bigger apple rather than
using a glottal stop
Note that it would be wrong to put an
ul
r
in the apple even
for speakers who usually terminate the and bigger with the same sound
Such effects occur at a high level of processing and are practically
impossible to simulate with word-interpolation rules
Hence the expedient of introducing a glottal stop is a good one although
it is certainly unnatural
sh 72  Concatenating whole or partial syllables
pp
The use of segments larger than a single phoneme or allophone but smaller
than a word as the basic unit for speech synthesis has an interesting
history
It has long been realized that transitions between phonemes are
extremely sensitive and critical components of speech and thus are
essential for successful synthesis
Consider the unvoiced stop sounds
ul
p t
and
ul
k
Their central portion is actually silence  Try saying a word like
butter with a very long
ul
tc
  Hence
in this case it is
ul
only
the transitional information which can distinguish these sounds from
each other
pp
Sound segments which comprise the transition from the centre of one phoneme
to the centre of the next are called
ul
dyads
or
ul
diphones
The possibility of using them as the basic units for concatenation
was first mooted in the mid 1950s
The idea is attractive because there is relatively little spectral
movement in the central so-called steady-state portion of many
