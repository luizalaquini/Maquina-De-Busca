medicines kick in soon My eyes focus on the rose that has
spread its petals overnight filling the steamy air with its
strong perfume I rise and reach for a towel to smother it
when theres a tentative knock and the bathroom door
opens revealing three familiar faces They try to smile at
me but even Venia cant conceal her shock at my ravaged
mutt body Surprise Octavia squeaks and then bursts
into tears Im puzzling over their reappearance when I
realize that this must be it the day of the execution Theyve
come to prep me for the cameras Remake me to Beauty
Base Zero No wonder Octavias crying Its an impossible
task
They can barely touch my patchwork of skin for fear of
hurting me so I rinse and dry off myself I tell them I hardly
notice the pain anymore but Flavius still winces as he
drapes a robe around me In the bedroom I find another
surprise Sitting upright in a chair Polished from her
metallic gold wig to her patent leather high heels gripping a
clipboard Remarkably unchanged except for the vacant
look in her eyes
Effie I say
Hello Katniss She stands and kisses me on the
cheek as if nothing has occurred since our last meeting the
night before the Quarter Quell Well it looks like weve got
another big big big day ahead of us So why dont you
start your prep and Ill just pop over and check on the
arrangements
Okay I say to her back
They say Plutarch and Haymitch had a hard time
keeping her alive comments Venia under her breath She
was imprisoned after your escape so that helps
Its quite a stretch Effie Trinket rebel But I dont want
Coin killing her so I make a mental note to present her that
way if asked I guess its good Plutarch kidnapped you
three after all
Were the only prep team still alive And all the stylists
from the Quarter Quell are dead says Venia She doesnt
say who specifically killed them Im beginning to wonder if
it matters She gingerly takes one of my scarred hands and
holds it out for inspection Now what do you think for the
nails Red or maybe a jet black
Flavius performs some beauty miracle on my hair
managing to even out the front while getting some of the
longer locks to hide the bald spots in the back My face
since it was spared from the flames presents no more than
the usual challenges Once Im in Cinnas Mockingjay suit
the only scars visible are on my neck forearms and hands
Octavia secures my Mockingjay pin over my heart and we
step back to look in the mirror I cant believe how normal
theyve made me look on the outside when inwardly Im
such a wasteland
Theres a tap at the door and Gale steps in Can I
have a minute he asks In the mirror I watch my prep
team Unsure of where to go they bump into one another a
few times and then closet themselves in the bathroom Gale
comes up behind me and we examine each others
reflection Im searching for something to hang on to some
sign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woods
five years ago and became inseparable Im wondering
what would have happened to them if the Hunger Games
had not reaped the girl If she would have fallen in love with
the boy married him even And sometime in the future
when the brothers and sisters had been raised up
escaped with him into the woods and left 12 behind forever
Would they have been happy out in the wild or would the
dark twisted sadness between them have grown up even
without the Capitols help
I brought you this Gale holds up a sheath When I
take it I notice it holds a single ordinary arrow Its
supposed to be symbolic You firing the last shot of the
war
What if I miss I say Does Coin retrieve it and bring
it back to me Or just shoot Snow through the head
herself
You wont miss Gale adjusts the sheath on my
shoulder
We stand there face-to-face not meeting each others
eyes You didnt come see me in the hospital He doesnt
answer so finally I just say it Was it your bomb
I dont know Neither does Beetee he says Does it
matter Youll always be thinking about it
He waits for me to deny it I want to deny it but its true
Even now I can see the flash that ignites her feel the heat of
the flames And I will never be able to separate that
moment from Gale My silence is my answer
That was the one thing I had going for me Taking
care of your family he says Shoot straight okay He
touches my cheek and leaves I want to call him back and
tell him that I was wrong That Ill figure out a way to make
peace with this To remember the circumstances under
which he created the bomb Take into account my own
inexcusable crimes Dig up the truth about who dropped the
parachutes Prove it wasnt the rebels Forgive him But
since I cant Ill just have to deal with the pain
Effie comes in to usher me to some kind of meeting I
collect my bow and at the last minute remember the rose
glistening in its glass of water When I open the door to the
bathroom I find my prep team sitting in a row on the edge
of the tub hunched and defeated I remember Im not the
only one whose world has been stripped away Come on
