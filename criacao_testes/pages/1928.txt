FG Procedure 61  Pascal algorithm for the autocorrelation method
pp
This algorithm is not quite as efficient as it might be for some
multiplications are repeated during the calculation of the
autocorrelation vector  Blankinship 1974 shows how
the number of multiplications can be reduced by about half

pp
If the algorithm is performed in fixed-point arithmetic
as it often is in practice because of speed considerations
some scaling must be done  The maximum and minimum values of
the windowed signal can be determined within the window
calculation loop and one extra pass over the vector will
suffice to scale it to maximum significance
Incidentally if all sample values are the same the procedure
cannot produce a solution because E becomes zero and this
can easily be checked when scaling
pp
The absolute value of the R-vector has no significance and since
R0 is always the greatest element this can be set to the largest
fixed-point number and the other Rs scaled down appropriately
after they have been calculated
These scaling operations are shown as dashed boxes in Figure 65
E decreases monotonically
as the computation proceeds so it is safe to initialize it to R0
without extra scaling  The remainder of the scaling is straightforward
with the linear prediction coefficients a sub k appearing as fractions
rh The covariance method
One of the advantages of linear predictive methods that was
promised earlier was that it allows us to escape from
the problem of windowing  To do this we must abandon the
requirement that the coefficients of the matrix equation have
the symmetry property of autocorrelations  Instead suppose
that the range of n-summation uses a fixed number of
elements say N starting at n=h to estimate the prediction
coefficients between sample number h and sample number h+N
pp
This leads to the matrix equation
