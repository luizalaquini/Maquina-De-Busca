could receive contour 5
He and everyone are antithetical not only does the latter receive
emphasis but the former has its accent restored em for otherwise
it would have been removed because of anaphora with psychologist
Hence it will certainly begin a foot possibly a tonic foot
pp
A factor that does not affect the sample passage is the accentuation
of unusual syllables of similar words to bring out a contrast
For example
LB
NI
he went
ul
outc
side not
ul
inc
side
LE
Although this may seem to be just another facet of antithesis
Vanderslice points out that it is phonetic rather than structural
similarity that is contrasted
LB
NI
I said
ul
dec
plane not
ul
comc
plain
LE
This introduces an interesting interplay between the phonetic and
prosodic levels
pp
Anaphora and antithesis provide an ideal domain for speech synthesis from
concept
Determining them from plain text is a very difficult problem
requiring a great deal of real-world knowledge
The first has received some attention in the field of natural language
understanding
Finding pronoun referents is an important problem for language translation
for their gender is frequently distinguished in say French where it is not
in English
Examples such as
LB
NI
I bought the wine sat on a table and drank it
NI
I bought the wine sat on a table and broke it
LE
have been closely studied Wilks 1975 for if they were to be translated
into French the pronoun it would be rendered differently in each case
c
ul
le
vin
ul
la
table

pp
In spoken language emphasis is used to indicate the referent of a pronoun
when it would not otherwise be obvious
Vanderslice gives the example
LB
NI
Bill saw John across the room and he ran over to him
NI
Bill saw John across the room and
ul
he
ran over to
ul
him
LE
where the emphasis reverses the pronoun referents
so that John did the running
He suggests accenting a personal pronoun whenever the true
antecedent is not the same as the unmarked or default one
Unfortunately he does not elaborate on what is meant by unmarked
Does it mean that the referent cannot be predicted from
knowledge of the words alone em as in the second example above
If so this is a clear candidate for speech synthesis from concept
for the distinction cannot be made from text

English pronunciation is notoriously irregular
A poem by Charivarius the pseudonym of a Dutch high school teacher
and linguist GNTrenite 1870-1946 surveys the problems in an amusing
way and is worth quoting in full
