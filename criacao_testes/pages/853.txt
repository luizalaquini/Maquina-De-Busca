God and who it is that saith to thee Give me to drink thou wouldest
have asked of him and he would have given thee living water

411 The woman saith unto him Sir thou hast nothing to draw with
and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water
412 Art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well
and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle  413
Jesus answered and said unto her Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again 414 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him
shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life

415 The woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that I thirst
not neither come hither to draw

416 Jesus saith unto her Go call thy husband and come hither

417 The woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto
her Thou hast well said I have no husband 418 For thou hast had
five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that
saidst thou truly

419 The woman saith unto him Sir I perceive that thou art a
prophet

420 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship

421 Jesus saith unto her Woman believe me the hour cometh when ye
shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the
Father

422 Ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for
salvation is of the Jews

423 But the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and in truth for the Father seeketh such
to worship him

424 God is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth

425 The woman saith unto him I know that Messias cometh which is
called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things

426 Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he

427 And upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked
with the woman yet no man said What seekest thou or Why talkest
thou with her  428 The woman then left her waterpot and went her
way into the city and saith to the men 429 Come see a man which
told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ  430 Then
they went out of the city and came unto him

431 In the mean while his disciples prayed him saying Master eat

432 But he said unto them I have meat to eat that ye know not of

433 Therefore said the disciples one to another Hath any man brought
him ought to eat  434 Jesus saith unto them My meat is to do the
will of him that sent me and to finish his work

435 Say not ye There are yet four months and then cometh harvest
behold I say unto you Lift up your eyes and look on the fields for
they are white already to harvest

436 And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together

437 And herein is that saying true One soweth and another reapeth

438 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men
laboured and ye are entered into their labours

439 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman which testified He told me all that ever I did

440 So when the Samaritans were come unto him they besought him that
he would tarry with them and he abode there two days

441 And many more believed because of his own word 442 And said
unto the woman Now we believe not because of thy saying for we have
heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the
Saviour of the world

443 Now after two days he departed thence and went into Galilee

444 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his
own country

445 Then when he was come into Galilee the Galilaeans received him
having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast for
they also went unto the feast

446 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee where he made the water
wine And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at
