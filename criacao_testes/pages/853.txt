Dick Follard was deaf as a stone but his nose worked well enough The buns were still warm from the oven when he went digging in the basket and plucked one out He found a crock of butter as well and spread some with his dagger Raisins he announced happily Nuts too His speech was thick but easy enough to understand once you got used to it

You can have mine too said Satin I’m not hungry

Eat Jon told him There’s no knowing when you’ll have another chance He took two buns himself  The nuts were pine nuts and besides the raisins there were bits of dried apple

Will the wildlings come today Lord Snow Owen asked

You’ll know if they do said Jon Listen for the horns

Two Two is for wildlings Owen was tall towheaded and amiable a tireless worker and surprisingly deft when it came to working wood and fixing catapults and the like but as he’d gladly tell you his mother had dropped him on his head when he was a baby and half his wits had leaked out through his ear

You remember where to go Jon asked him

I’m to go to the stairs Donal Noye says I’m to go up to the third landing and shoot my crossbow down at the wildlings if they try to climb over the barrier The third landing one two three His head bobbed up and down If the wildlings attack the king will come and help us won’t he He’s a mighty warrior King Robert He’s sure to come Maester Aemon sent him a bird

There was no use telling him that Robert Baratheon was dead He would forget it as he’d forgotten it before Maester Aemon sent him a bird Jon agreed That seemed to make Owen happy

Maester Aemon had sent a lot of birds… not to one king but to four Wildlings at the gate the message ran The realm in danger Send all the help you can to Castle Black Even as far as Oldtown and the Citadel the ravens flew and to half a hundred mighty lords in their castles The northern lords offered their best hope so to them Aemon had sent two birds To the Umbers and the Boltons to Castle Cerwyn and Torrhen’s Square Karhold and Deepwood Motte to Bear Island Oldcastle Widow’s Watch White Harbor Barrowton and the Rills to the mountain fastnesses of the Liddles the Burleys the Norreys the Harclays and the Wulls the black birds brought their plea Wildlings at the gate The north in danger Come with all your strength

Well ravens might have wings but lords and kings do not If help was coming it would not come today

As morning turned to afternoon the smoke of Mole’s Town blew away and the southern sky was clear again No clouds thought Jon That was good Rain or snow could doom them all

Clydas and Maester Aemon rode the winch cage up to safety at the top of the Wall and most of the Mole’s Town wives as well Men in black cloaks paced restlessly on the tower tops and shouted back and forth across the courtyards Septon Cellador led the men on the barricade in a prayer beseeching the Warrior to give them strength Deaf Dick Follard curled up beneath his cloak and went to sleep Satin walked a hundred leagues in circles round and round the crenellations The Wall wept and the sun crept across a hard blue sky Near evenfall Owen the Oaf returned with a loaf of black bread and a pail of Hobb’s best mutton cooked in a thick broth of ale and onions Even Dick woke up for that They ate every bit of it using chunks of bread to wipe the bottom of the pail By the time they were done the sun was low in the west the shadows sharp and black throughout the castle Light the fire Jon told Satin and fill the kettle with oil

He went downstairs himself to bar the door to try and work some of the stiffness from his leg That was a mistake and Jon soon knew it but he clutched the crutch and saw it through all the same The door to the King’s Tower was oak studded with iron It might delay the Thenns but it would not stop them if they wanted to come in Jon slammed the bar down in its notches paid a visit to the privy—it might well be his last chance—and hobbled back up to the roof grimacing at the pain

The west had gone the color of a blood bruise but the sky above was cobalt blue deepening to purple and the stars were coming out Jon sat between two merlons with only a scarecrow for company and watched the Stallion gallop up the sky Or was it the Horned Lord He wondered where Ghost was now He wondered about Ygritte as well and told himself that way lay madness

They came in the night of course Like thieves Jon thought Like murderers

Satin pissed himself when the horns blew but Jon pretended not to notice Go shake Dick by the shoulder he told the Oldtown boy else he’s liable to sleep through the fight

I’m frightened Satin’s face was a ghastly white

So are they Jon leaned his crutch up against a merlon and took up his longbow bending the smooth thick Dornish yew to slip a bowstring through the notches Don’t waste a quarrel unless you know you have a good clean shot he said when Satin returned from waking Dick We have an ample supply up here but ample doesn’t mean inexhaustible And step behind a merlon to reload don’t try and hide in back of a scarecrow They’re made of straw an arrow will punch through them He did not bother telling Dick Follard anything Dick could read your lips if there was enough light and he gave a damn what you were saying but he knew it all already

The three of them took up positions on three sides of the round tower

Jon hung a quiver from his belt and pulled an arrow The shaft was black the fletching grey As he notched it to his string he remembered something that Theon Greyjoy had once said after a hunt The boar can keep his tusks and the bear his claws he had declared smiling that way he did There’s nothing half so mortal as a grey goose feather

Jon had never been half the hunter that Theon was but he was no stranger to the longbow either There were dark shapes slipping around the armory backs against the stone but he could not see them well enough to waste an arrow He heard distant shouts and saw the archers on the Tower of Guards loosing shafts at the ground That was too far off to concern Jon But when he glimpsed three shadows detach themselves from the old stables fifty yards away he stepped up to the crenel raised his bow and drew They were running so he led them waiting waiting…

The arrow made a soft hiss as it left his string A moment later there was a grunt and suddenly only two shadows were loping across the yard They ran all the faster but Jon had already pulled a second arrow from his quiver This time he hurried the shot too much and missed The wildlings were gone by the time he nocked again He searched for another target and found four rushing around the empty shell of the Lord Commander’s Keep The moonlight glimmered off their spears and axes and the gruesome devices on their round leathern shields skulls and bones serpents bear claws twisted demonic faces Free folk he knew The Thenns carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses but theirs were plain and unadorned These were the lighter wicker shields of raiders

Jon pulled the goose feather back to his ear aimed and loosed the arrow then nocked and drew and loosed again The first shaft pierced the bearclaw shield the second one a throat The wildling screamed as he went down He heard the deep thrum of Deaf Dick’s crossbow to his left and Satin’s a moment later I got one the boy cried hoarsely I got one in the chest

Get another Jon called

He did not have to search for targets now only choose them He dropped a wildling archer as he was fitting an arrow to his string then sent a shaft toward the axeman hacking at the door of Hardin’s Tower That time he missed but the arrow quivering in the oak made the wildling reconsider It was only as he was running off that Jon recognized Big Boil Half a heartbeat later old Mully put an arrow through his leg from the roof of the Flint Barracks and he crawled off bleeding That will stop him bitching about his boil Jon thought

When his quiver was empty he went to get another and moved to a different crenel side by side with Deaf Dick Follard Jon got off three arrows for every bolt Deaf Dick discharged but that was the advantage of the longbow The crossbow penetrated better some insisted but it was slow and cumbersome to reload He could hear the wildlings shouting to each other and somewhere to the west a warhorn blew The world was moonlight and shadow and time became an endless round of notch and draw and loose A wildling arrow ripped through the throat of the straw sentinel beside him but Jon Snow scarcely noticed Give me one clean shot at the Magnar of Thenn he prayed to his father’s gods The Magnar at least was a foe that he could hate Give me Styr
