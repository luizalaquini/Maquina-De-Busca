319 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if I have laid
wait at my neighbours door 3110 Then let my wife grind unto
another and let others bow down upon her

3111 For this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges

3112 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root
out all mine increase

3113 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
maidservant when they contended with me 3114 What then shall I do
when God riseth up and when he visiteth what shall I answer him
3115 Did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one
fashion us in the womb  3116 If I have withheld the poor from their
desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail 3117 Or have
eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof 3118 For from my youth he was brought up with me as with a
father and I have guided her from my mothers womb 3119 If I have
seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering
3120 If his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with
the fleece of my sheep 3121 If I have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless when I saw my help in the gate 3122 Then let mine arm
fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone

3123 For destruction from God was a terror to me and by reason of
his highness I could not endure

3124 If I have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold Thou
art my confidence 3125 If I rejoice because my wealth was great and
because mine hand had gotten much 3126 If I beheld the sun when it
shined or the moon walking in brightness 3127 And my heart hath
been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand 3128 This
also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for I should have
denied the God that is above

3129 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted
up myself when evil found him 3130 Neither have I suffered my mouth
to sin by wishing a curse to his soul

3131 If the men of my tabernacle said not Oh that we had of his
flesh  we cannot be satisfied

3132 The stranger did not lodge in the street but I opened my doors
to the traveller

3133 If I covered my transgressions as Adam by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom 3134 Did I fear a great multitude or did the contempt
of families terrify me that I kept silence and went not out of the
door  3135 Oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the
Almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book

3136 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown
to me

3137 I would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince
would I go near unto him

3138 If my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof
complain 3139 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money or
have caused the owners thereof to lose their life 3140 Let thistles
grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley

The words of Job are ended

321 So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous
in his own eyes

322 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
Buzite of the kindred of Ram against Job was his wrath kindled
because he justified himself rather than God

323 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because
they had found no answer and yet had condemned Job

324 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they were elder
than he

325 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
three men then his wrath was kindled

326 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said I am
young and ye are very old wherefore I was afraid and durst not shew
you mine opinion

327 I said Days should speak and multitude of years should teach
wisdom

328 But there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty
giveth them understanding

329 Great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand
judgment

3210 Therefore I said Hearken to me I also will shew mine opinion

3211 Behold I waited for your words I gave ear to your reasons
whilst ye searched out what to say

3212 Yea I attended unto you and behold there was none of you
