This little whore is a fool truly said Khaznys mo Nakloz Ask her for triple I say She is desperate enough to pay Ask for ten times the price of every slave yes

The tall Grazdan with the spiked beard spoke in the Common Tongue though not so well as the slave girl Your Grace he growled Westeros is being wealthy yes but you are not being queen now Perhaps will never being queen Even Unsullied may be losing battles to savage steel knights of Seven Kingdoms I am reminding the Good Masters of Astapor are not selling flesh for promisings Are you having gold and trading goods sufficient to be paying for all these eunuchs you are wanting

You know the answer to that better than I Good Master Dany replied Your men have gone through my ships and tallied every bead of amber and jar of saffron How much do I have

Sufficient to be buying one of thousands the Good Master said with a contemptuous smile Yet you are paying double you are saying Five centuries then is all you buy

Your pretty crown might buy another century said the fat one in Valyrian Your crown of the three dragons

Dany waited for his words to be translated My crown is not for sale When Viserys sold their mother’s crown the last joy had gone from him leaving only rage Nor will I enslave my people nor sell their goods and horses But my ships you can have The great cog Balerion and the galleys Vhagar and Meraxes She had warned Groleo and the other captains it might come to this though they had protested the necessity of it furiously Three good ships should be worth more than a few paltry eunuchs

The fat Grazdan turned to the others They conferred in low voices once again Two of the thousands the one with the spiked beard said when he turned back It is too much but the Good Masters are being generous and your need is being great

Two thousand would never serve for what she meant to do I must have them all Dany knew what she must do now though the taste of it was so bitter that even the persimmon wine could not cleanse it from her month She had considered long and hard and found no other way It is my only choice Give me all she said and you may have a dragon

There was the sound of indrawn breath from Jhiqui beside her Kraznys smiled at his fellows Did I not tell you Anything she would give us

Whitebeard stared in shocked disbelief His hand trembled where it grasped the staff No He went to one knee before her Your Grace I beg you win your throne with dragons not slaves You must not do this thing—

You must not presume to instruct me Ser Jorah remove Whitebeard from my presence

Mormont seized the old man roughly by an elbow yanked him back to his feet and marched him out onto the terrace

Tell the Good Masters I regret this interruption said Dany to the slave girl Tell them I await their answer

She knew the answer though she could see it in the glitter of their eyes and the smiles they tried so hard to hide Astapor had thousands of eunuchs and even more slave boys waiting to be cut but there were only three living dragons in all the great wide world And the Ghiscari lust for dragons How could they not Five times had Old Ghis contended with Valyria when the world was young and five times gone down to bleak defeat For the Freehold had dragons and the Empire had none

The oldest Grazdan stirred in his seat and his pearls clacked together softly A dragon of our choice he said in a thin hard voice The black one is largest and healthiest

His name is Drogon She nodded

All your goods save your crown and your queenly raiment which we will allow you to keep The three ships And Drogon

Done she said in the Common Tongue

Done the old Grazdan answered in his thick Valyrian

The others echoed that old man of the pearl fringe Done the slave girl translated and done and done eight times done

The Unsullied will learn your savage tongue quick enough added Kraznys mo Nakloz when all the arrangements had been made but until such time you will need a slave to speak to them Take this one as our gift to you a token of a bargain well struck

I shall said Dany

The slave girl rendered his words to her and hers to him If she had feelings about being given for a token she took care not to let them show

Arstan Whitebeard held his tongue as well when Dany swept by him on the terrace He followed her down the steps in silence but she could hear his hardwood staff tap tapping on the red bricks as they went She did not blame him for his fury It was a wretched thing she did The Mother of Dragons has sold her strongest child Even the thought made her ill

Yet down in the Plaza of Pride standing on the hot red bricks between the slavers’ pyramid and the barracks of the eunuchs Dany turned on the old man Whitebeard she said I want your counsel and you should never fear to speak your mind with me    when we are alone But never question me in front of strangers Is that understood

Yes Your Grace he said unhappily

I am not a child she told him I am a queen

Yet even queens can err The Astapori have cheated you Your Grace A dragon is worth more than any army Aegon proved that three hundred years ago upon the Field of Fire

I know what Aegon proved I mean to prove a few things of my own Dany turned away from him to the slave girl standing meekly beside her litter Do you have a name or must you draw a new one every day from some barrel

That is only for Unsullied the girl said Then she realized the question had been asked in High Valyrian Her eyes went wide Oh

Your name is Oh

No Your Grace forgive this one her outburst Your slave’s name is Missandei but   

Missandei is no longer a slave I free you from this instant Come ride with me in the litter I wish to talk Rakharo helped them in and Dany drew the curtains shut against the dust and heat If you stay with me you will serve as one of my handmaids she said as they set off I shall keep you by my side to speak for me as you spoke for Kraznys But you may leave my service whenever you choose if you have father or mother you would sooner return to

This one will stay the girl said This one    I    there is no place for me to go This    I will serve you gladly

I can give you freedom but not safety Dany warned I have a world to cross and wars to fight You may go hungry You may grow sick You may be killed

Valar morghulis said Missandei in High Valyrian

All men must die Dany agreed but not for a long while we may pray She leaned back on the pillows and took the girl’s hand Are these Unsullied truly fearless

Yes Your Grace

You serve me now Is it true they feel no pain

The wine of courage kills such feelings By the time they slay their sucklings they have been drinking it for years

And they are obedient

Obedience is all they know If you told them not to breathe they would find that easier than not to obey

Dany nodded And when I am done with them

Your Grace

When I have won my war and claimed the throne that was my father’s my knights will sheathe their swords and return to their keeps to their wives and children and mothers    to their lives But these eunuchs have no lives What am I to do with eight thousand eunuchs when there are no more battles to be fought

The Unsullied make fine guards and excellent watchmen Your Grace said Missandei And it is never hard to find a buyer for such fine well-blooded troops

Men are not bought and sold in Westeros they tell me

With all respect Your Grace Unsullied are not men

If I did resell them how would I know they could not be used against me Dany asked pointedly Would they do that Fight against me even do me harm

If their master commanded They do not question Your Grace All the questions have been culled from them They obey She looked troubled When you are    when you are done with them    Your Grace might command them to fall upon their swords
