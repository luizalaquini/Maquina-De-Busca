them

1724 And all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him
and were sore afraid

1725 And the men of Israel said Have ye seen this man that is come
up  surely to defy Israel is he come up and it shall be that the
man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and
will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in
Israel

1726 And David spake to the men that stood by him saying What shall
be done to the man that killeth this Philistine and taketh away the
reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that
he should defy the armies of the living God  1727 And the people
answered him after this manner saying So shall it be done to the man
that killeth him

1728 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men
and Eliabs anger was kindled against David and he said Why camest
thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle

1729 And David said What have I now done Is there not a cause
1730 And he turned from him toward another and spake after the same
manner and the people answered him again after the former manner

1731 And when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed
them before Saul and he sent for him

1732 And David said to Saul Let no mans heart fail because of him
thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine

1733 And Saul said to David Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man
of war from his youth

1734 And David said unto Saul Thy servant kept his fathers sheep
and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
1735 And I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of
his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard
and smote him and slew him

1736 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this
uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living God

1737 David said moreover The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of
the hand of this Philistine And Saul said unto David Go and the
LORD be with thee

1738 And Saul armed David with his armour and he put an helmet of
brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail

1739 And David girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to
go for he had not proved it And David said unto Saul I cannot go
with these for I have not proved them And David put them off him

1740 And he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which he
had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near
to the Philistine

1741 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David and the man
that bare the shield went before him

1742 And when the Philistine looked about and saw David he
disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair
countenance

1743 And the Philistine said unto David Am I a dog that thou comest
to me with staves And the Philistine cursed David by his gods

1744 And the Philistine said to David Come to me and I will give
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field

1745 Then said David to the Philistine Thou comest to me with a
sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the
name of the LORD of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou
hast defied

1746 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand and I will
smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the
carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the
air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know
that there is a God in Israel

1747 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
sword and spear for the battle is the LORDs and he will give you
into our hands

1748 And it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and
drew nigh to meet David that David hastened and ran toward the army
to meet the Philistine

1749 And David put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and
slang it and smote the Philistine in his forehead that the stone
sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth
