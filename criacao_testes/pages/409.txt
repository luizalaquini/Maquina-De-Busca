He was making Bran angry I don’t have to tell you my dreams I’m the prince I’m the Stark in Winterfell

Was it Summer

You be quiet

The night of the harvest feast you dreamed you were Summer in the godswood didn’t you

Stop it Bran shouted Summer slid toward the weirwood his white teeth bared

Jojen Reed took no mind When I touched Summer I felt you in him just as you are in him now

You couldn’t have I was in bed I was sleeping

You were in the godswood all in grey

It was only a bad dream…

Jojen stood I felt you I felt you fall Is that what scares you the falling

The falling Bran thought and the golden man the queen’s brother he scares me too but mostly the falling He did not say it though How could he He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin and he could not tell the Reeds either If he didn’t talk about it maybe he would forget He had never wanted to remember It might not even be a true remembering

Do you fall every night Bran Joien asked quietly

A low rumbling growl rose from Summer’s throat and there was no play in it He stalked forward all teeth and hot eyes Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother spear in hand Keep him back Bran

Jojen is making him angry

Meera shook out her net

It’s your anger Bran her brother said Your fear

It isn’t I’m not a wolf Yet he’d howled with them in the night and tasted blood in his wolf dreams

Part of you is Summer and part of Summer is you You know that Bran

Summer rushed forward but Meera blocked him jabbing with the three-pronged spear The wolf twisted aside circling stalking Meera turned to face him Call him back Bran

Summer Bran shouted To me Summer He slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh His hand tingled though his dead leg felt nothing

The direwolf lunged again and again Meera’s spear darted out Summer dodged circled back The bushes rustled and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood teeth bared The scent was strong his brother had smelled his rage Bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck Meera stood beside her brother with wolves to either side Bran call them off

I can’t

Jojen up the tree

There’s no need Today is not the day I die

Do it she screamed and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood using the face for his handholds The direwolves closed Meera abandoned spear and net jumped up and grabbed the branch above her head Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb Summer sat back on his haunches and howled while Shaggydog worried the net shaking it in his teeth

Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone He cupped hands around his mouth Hodor he shouted Hodor Hodor He was badly frightened and somehow ashamed They won’t hurt Hodor he assured his treed friends

A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools but Bran had never been so glad to see him Hodor help me Chase off the wolves Chase them off
