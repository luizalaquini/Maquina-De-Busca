these men that they be not hindered

69 And that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams
and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven wheat salt
wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are
at Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail 610 That
they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven and
pray for the life of the king and of his sons

611 Also I have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word
let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be
hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this

612 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all
kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy
this house of God which is at Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree
let it be done with speed

613 Then Tatnai governor on this side the river Shetharboznai and
their companions according to that which Darius the king had sent so
they did speedily

614 And the elders of the Jews builded and they prospered through
the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo
And they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the
God of Israel and according to the commandment of Cyrus and Darius
and Artaxerxes king of Persia

615 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar
which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king

616 And the children of Israel the priests and the Levites and the
rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this
house of God with joy

617 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering
for all Israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes
of Israel

618 And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in
their courses for the service of God which is at Jerusalem as it is
written in the book of Moses

619 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
fourteenth day of the first month

620 For the priests and the Levites were purified together all of
them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the
captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves

621 And the children of Israel which were come again out of
captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the
filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the LORD God of Israel
did eat 622 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
joy for the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the
king of Assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of
the house of God the God of Israel

71 Now after these things in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia
Ezra the son of Seraiah the son of Azariah the son of Hilkiah 72
The son of Shallum the son of Zadok the son of Ahitub 73 The son
of Amariah the son of Azariah the son of Meraioth 74 The son of
Zerahiah the son of Uzzi the son of Bukki 75 The son of Abishua
the son of Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the chief
priest 76 This Ezra went up from Babylon and he was a ready scribe
in the law of Moses which the LORD God of Israel had given and the
king granted him all his request according to the hand of the LORD
his God upon him

77 And there went up some of the children of Israel and of the
priests and the Levites and the singers and the porters and the
Nethinims unto Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king

78 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the
seventh year of the king

79 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
Babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem
according to the good hand of his God upon him

710 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD and
to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments

711 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
unto Ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the LORD and of his statutes to Israel

712 Artaxerxes king of kings unto Ezra the priest a scribe of the
law of the God of heaven perfect peace and at such a time

713 I make a decree that all they of the people of Israel and of
his priests and Levites in my realm which are minded of their own
freewill to go up to Jerusalem go with thee

714 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven
counsellors to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to
the law of thy God which is in thine hand 715 And to carry the
silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely
offered unto the God of Israel whose habitation is in Jerusalem 716
