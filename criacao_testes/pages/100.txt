Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king’s pavilion The camp was beginning to stir Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper Young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke yawning and stretching to meet the day A serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them M’lords he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant the silver eagle of Seagard Bryce Caron’s field of nightingales a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes brindled boar red ox burning tree white ram triple spiral purple unicorn dancing maiden blackadder twin towers horned owl and last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard shining like the dawn

The king means to fight in the melee today Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn’s shield its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell’s lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle

Yes Ned said grimly Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news Small wonder he had slept so badly

Ser Barristan’s look was troubled They say night’s beauties fade at dawn and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light

They say so Ned agreed but not of Robert Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado but Robert Baratheon would remember and remembering would never back down

The king’s pavilion was close by the water and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps of grey It was all of golden silk the largest and grandest structure in the camp Outside the entrance Robert’s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon

Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep but luck was not with him They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor Your Grace one was saying almost in tears it’s made too small it won’t go He fumbled and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert’s thick neck tumbled to the ground

Seven hells Robert swore Do I have to do it myself Piss on the both of you Pick it up Don’t just stand there gaping Lancel pick it up The lad jumped and the king noticed his company Look at these oafs Ned My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me and they’re worse than useless Can’t even put a man’s armor on him properly Squires they say I say they’re swineherds dressed up in silk

Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty The boys are not at fault he told the king You’re too fat for your armor Robert

Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said darkly Fat Fat is it Is that how you speak to your king He let go his laughter sudden as a storm Ah damn you Ned why are you always right

The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them You Yes both of you You heard the Hand The king is too fat for his armor Go find Ser Aron Santagar Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher Now What are you waiting for

The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent Robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone Then he dropped back into a chair shaking with laughter

Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him Even Eddard Stark managed a smile Always though the graver thoughts crept in He could not help taking note of the two squires handsome boys fair and well made One was Sansa’s age with long golden curls the other perhaps fifteen sandy-haired with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen

Ah I wish I could be there to see Santagar’s face Robert said I hope he’ll have the wit to send them to someone else We ought to keep them running all day

Those boys Ned asked him Lannisters

Robert nodded wiping tears from his eyes Cousins Sons of Lord Tywin’s brother One of the dead ones Or perhaps the live one now that I come to think on it I don’t recall My wife comes from a very large family Ned

A very ambitious family Ned thought He had nothing against the squires but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen’s kin waking and sleeping The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night

The mirth curdled on Robert’s face The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee She’s sulking in the castle now damn her Your sister would never have shamed me like that

You never knew Lyanna as I did Robert Ned told him You saw her beauty but not the iron underneath She would have told you that you have no business in the melee

You too The king frowned You are a sour man Stark Too long in the north all the juices have frozen inside you Well mine are still running He slapped his chest to prove it

You are the king Ned reminded him

I sit on the damn iron seat when I must Does that mean I don’t have the same hungers as other men A bit of wine now and again a girl squealing in bed the feel of a horse between my legs Seven hells Ned I want to hit someone

Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up Your Grace he said it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee It would not be a fair contest Who would dare strike you

Robert seemed honestly taken aback Why all of them damn it If they can And the last man left standing…

…will be you Ned finished He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert but this touched on his pride Ser Barristan is right There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you

The king rose to his feet his face flushed Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win

For a certainty Ned said and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord
