is he clean

1341 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face he is forehead bald yet is he clean

1342 And if there be in the bald head or bald forehead a white
reddish sore it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head or his bald
forehead

1343 Then the priest shall look upon it and behold if the rising
of the sore be white reddish in his bald head or in his bald
forehead as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh 1344 He
is a leprous man he is unclean the priest shall pronounce him
utterly unclean his plague is in his head

1345 And the leper in whom the plague is his clothes shall be rent
and his head bare and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and
shall cry Unclean unclean

1346 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
defiled he is unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp shall
his habitation be

1347 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in whether it be
a woollen garment or a linen garment 1348 Whether it be in the
warp or woof of linen or of woollen whether in a skin or in any
thing made of skin 1349 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in
the garment or in the skin either in the warp or in the woof or in
any thing of skin it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shewed unto
the priest 1350 And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut
up it that hath the plague seven days 1351 And he shall look on the
plague on the seventh day if the plague be spread in the garment
either in the warp or in the woof or in a skin or in any work that
is made of skin the plague is a fretting leprosy it is unclean

1352 He shall therefore burn that garment whether warp or woof in
woollen or in linen or any thing of skin wherein the plague is for
it is a fretting leprosy it shall be burnt in the fire

1353 And if the priest shall look and behold the plague be not
spread in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or in any
thing of skin 1354 Then the priest shall command that they wash the
thing wherein the plague is and he shall shut it up seven days more
1355 And the priest shall look on the plague after that it is
washed and behold if the plague have not changed his colour and
the plague be not spread it is unclean thou shalt burn it in the
fire it is fret inward whether it be bare within or without

1356 And if the priest look and behold the plague be somewhat dark
after the washing of it then he shall rend it out of the garment or
out of the skin or out of the warp or out of the woof 1357 And if
it appear still in the garment either in the warp or in the woof or
in any thing of skin it is a spreading plague thou shalt burn that
wherein the plague is with fire

1358 And the garment either warp or woof or whatsoever thing of
skin it be which thou shalt wash if the plague be departed from
them then it shall be washed the second time and shall be clean

1359 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen
or linen either in the warp or woof or any thing of skins to
pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean

141 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 142 This shall be the law
of the leper in the day of his cleansing He shall be brought unto the
priest 143 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp and the
priest shall look and behold if the plague of leprosy be healed in
the leper 144 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is
to be cleansed two birds alive and clean and cedar wood and scarlet
and hyssop 145 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be
killed in an earthen vessel over running water 146 As for the living
bird he shall take it and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the
hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the
bird that was killed over the running water 147 And he shall
sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times
and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose
into the open field

148 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave
off all his hair and wash himself in water that he may be clean and
after that he shall come into the camp and shall tarry abroad out of
his tent seven days

149 But it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all his
hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows even all his hair he
shall shave off and he shall wash his clothes also he shall wash his
flesh in water and he shall be clean

1410 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
blemish and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish and three
tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering mingled with oil and
one log of oil

1411 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that
is to be made clean and those things before the LORD at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation 1412 And the priest shall take
one he lamb and offer him for a trespass offering and the log of
oil and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD 1413 And he
shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering
and the burnt offering in the holy place for as the sin offering is
