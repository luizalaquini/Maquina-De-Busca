Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding Beside him the direwolf of Stark flapped from a staff borne by young Cley Cerwyn They were alone in the square though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses spearmen to his right and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly Every one of them wants me dead Some were boys he’d drunk with diced with even wenched with but that would not save him if he fell into their hands

Ser Rodrik Theon reined to a halt It grieves me that we must meet as foes

My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you The old knight spat onto the muddy ground Theon Turncloak

I am a Greyjoy of Pyke Theon reminded him The cloak my father swaddled me in bore a kraken not a direwolf

For ten years you have been a ward of Stark

Hostage and prisoner I call it

Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall Instead he raised you among his own sons the sweet boys you have butchered and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead of placing one in your hand

I came out to parley not to suffer your insults Say what you have to say old man What would you have of me

Two things the old man said Winterfell and your life Command your men to open the gates and lay down their arms Those who murdered no children shall be free to walk away but you shall be held for King Robb’s justice May the gods take pity on you when he returns

Robb will never look on Winterfell again Theon promised He will break himself on Moat Cailin as every southron army has done for ten thousand years We hold the north now ser

You hold three castles replied Ser Rodrik and this one I mean to take back Turncloak

Theon ignored that Here are my terms You have until evenfall to disperse Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be confirmed in their rights and properties and suffer no harm Those who defy us will be destroyed

Young Cerwyn was incredulous Are you mad Greyjoy

Ser Rodrik shook his head Only vain lad Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of himself I fear The old man jabbed a finger at him Do not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight his way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you I have near two thousand men with me… and if the tales be true you have no more than fifty

Seventeen in truth Theon made himself smile I have something better than men And he raised a fist over his head the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for

The walls of Winterfell were behind him but Ser Rodrik faced them squarely and could not fail to see Theon watched his face When his chin quivered under those stiff white whiskers he knew just what the old man was seeing He is not surprised he thought with sadness but the fear is there

This is craven Ser Rodrik said To use a child so… this is despicable

Oh I know said Theon It’s a dish I tasted myself or have you forgotten I was ten when I was taken from my father’s house to make certain he would raise no more rebellions

It is not the same

Theon’s face was impassive The noose I wore was not made of hempen rope that’s true enough but I felt it all the same And it chafed Ser Rodrik It chafed me raw He had never quite realized that until now but as the words came spilling out he saw the truth of them

No harm was ever done you

And no harm will be done your Beth so long as you—

Ser Rodrik never gave him the chance to finish Viper the knight declared his face red with rage beneath those white whiskers I gave you the chance to save your men and die with some small shred of honor Turncloak I should have known that was too much to ask of a childkiller His hand went to the hilt of his sword I ought cut you down here and now and put an end to your lies and deceits By the gods I should

Theon did not fear a doddering old man but those watching archers and that line of knights were a different matter If the swords came out his chances of getting back to the castle alive were small to none Forswear your oath and murder me and you will watch your little Beth strangle at the end of a rope

Ser Rodrik’s knuckles had gone white but after a moment he took his hand off the swordhilt Truly I have lived too long

I will not disagree ser Will you accept my terms

I have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark
