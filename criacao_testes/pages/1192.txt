Just so said Pycelle and the king—

—is a boy of thirteen I speak with his voice

So you do Indeed The King’s Own Hand Yet… your most gracious sister our Queen Regent she…

…bears a great weight upon those lovely white shoulders of hers I have no wish to add to her burdens Do you Tyrion cocked his head and gave the Grand Maester an inquiring stare

Pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food Something about Tyrion’s mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm knowing that he made good use of them Ah the old man muttered into his plums Doubtless you have the right of it my lord It is most considerate of you to… spare her this… burden

That’s just the sort of fellow I am Tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge Considerate Cersei is my own sweet sister after all

And a woman to be sure Grand Maester Pycelle said A most uncommon woman and yet… it is no small thing to tend to all the cares of the realm despite the frailty of her sex…

Oh yes she’s a frail dove just ask Eddard Stark I’m pleased you share my concern And I thank you for the hospitality of your table But a long day awaits He swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair Be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne 

As you say my lord

And only me

Ah… to be sure Pycelle’s spotted hand was clutching at his beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope It made Tyrion’s heart glad One he thought

He waddled out into the lower bailey his stunted legs complained of the steps The sun was well up now and the castle was stirring Guardsmen walked the walls and knights and men-at-arms were training with blunted weapons Nearby Bronn sat on the lip of a well A pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them but the sellsword never looked Bronn I despair of you Tyrion gestured at the wenches With sweet sights like that before you all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor

There are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt I want Bronn answered but one day my life may hang on how close I’ve watched your louts He stood Who’s the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield

Some hedge knight Tallad he names himself Why

Bronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes He’s the best of them But watch him he falls into a rhythm delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks He grinned That will be the death of him the day he faces me

He’s pledged to Joffrey he’s not like to face you They set off across the bailey Bronn matching his long stride to Tyrion’s short one These days the sellsword was looking almost respectable His dark hair was washed and brushed he was freshly shaved and he wore the black breastplate of an officer of the City Watch From his shoulders trailed a cloak of Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands Tyrion had made him a gift of it when he named him captain of his personal guard How many supplicants do we have today he inquired

Thirty odd answered Bronn Most with complaints or wanting something as ever Your pet was back

He groaned Lady Tanda

Her page She invites you to sup with her again There’s to be a haunch of venison she says a brace of stuffed geese sauced with mulberries and—

—her daughter Tyrion finished sourly Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep Lady Tanda had been stalking him armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies wild boars and savory cream stews Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for her daughter Lollys a large soft dim-witted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirty-and-three Send her my regrets

No taste for stuffed goose Bronn grinned evilly

Perhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid Or better still send Shagga

Shagga’s more like to eat the maid and marry the goose observed Bronn Anyway Lollys outweighs him

There is that Tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway between two towers Who else wants me

The sellsword grew more serious There’s a moneylender from Braavos holding fancy papers and the like requests to see the king about payment on some loan

As if Joff could count past twenty Send the man to Littlefinger he’ll find a way to put him off Next

A lordling down from the Trident says your father’s men burned his keep raped his wife and killed all his peasants

I believe they call that war Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane’s work or that of Ser Amory Lorch or his father’s other pet hellhound the Qohorik What does he want of Joffrey

New peasants Bronn said He walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense

I’ll make time for him on the morrow Whether truly loyal or merely desperate a compliant river lord might have his uses See that he’s given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal Send him a new pair of boots as well good ones courtesy of King Joffrey A show of generosity never hurt

Bronn gave a curt nod There’s also a great gaggle of bakers butchers and greengrocers clamoring to be heard

I told them last time I have nothing to give them Only a thin trickle of food was coming into King’s Landing most of it earmarked for castle and garrison Prices had risen sickeningly high on greens roots flour and fruit and Tyrion did not want to think about what sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles of the pot-shops down in Flea Bottom Fish he hoped They still had the river and the sea… at least until Lord Stannis sailed

They want protection Last night a baker was roasted in his own oven The mob claimed he charged too much for bread

Did he

He’s not apt to deny it

They didn’t eat him did they

Not that I’ve heard

Next time they will Tyrion said grimly I give them what protection I can The gold cloaks—

They claim there were gold cloaks in the mob Bronn said They’re demanding to speak to the king himself

Fools Tyrion had sent them off with regrets his nephew would send them off with whips and spears He was half-tempted to allow it… but no he dare not Soon or late some enemy would march on King’s Landing and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors within the city walls Tell them King Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them

They want bread not promises

If I give them bread today on the morrow I’ll have twice as many at the gates Who else

A black brother down from the Wall The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar

Tyrion smiled wanly I’m surprised no one ate it I suppose I ought to see him It’s not Yoren perchance

No Some knight Thorne

Ser Alliser Thorne Of all the black brothers he’d met on the Wall Tyrion Lannister had liked Ser Alliser Thorne the least A bitter mean-spirited man with too great a sense of his own worth Come to think on it I don’t believe I care to see Ser Alliser just now Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year and let his hand rot a little more

Bronn snorted laughter and went his way while Tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps As he limped across the outer yard he heard the portcullis rattling up His sister and a large party were waiting by the main gate

Mounted on her white palfrey Cersei towered high above him a goddess in green Brother she called out not warmly The queen had not been pleased by the way he’d dealt with Janos Slynt

Your Grace Tyrion bowed politely You look lovely this morning Her crown was gold her cloak ermine Her retinue sat their mounts behind her Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard wearing white scale and his favorite scowl Ser Balon Swann bow slung from his silver-inlay saddle Lord Gyles Rosby his wheezing cough worse than ever Hallyne the Pyromancer of the Alchemists’ Guild and the queen’s newest favorite their cousin Ser Lancel Lannister her late husband’s squire upjumped to knight at his widow’s insistence Vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort Where are you bound this day sister Tyrion asked

I’m making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires I would not have it thought that all of us are as indifferent to the city’s defense as you seem to be Cersei fixed him with those clear green eyes of hers beautiful even in their contempt I am informed that Renly Baratheon has marched from Highgarden He is making his way up the roseroad with all his strength behind him
