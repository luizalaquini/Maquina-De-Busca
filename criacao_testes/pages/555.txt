They’re fighting Kromm said urgently More men came up hundreds of them and at first they made to join the others But now they’ve fallen on them

Is it Asha Had she come to save him after all

But Kromm gave a shake of his head No These are northmen I tell you With a bloody man on their banner

The flayed man of the Dreadfort Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before his capture Theon recalled It was hard to believe that a vile creature like him could sway the Boltons to change their allegiance but nothing else made sense I’ll see this for myself Theon said

Maester Luwin trailed after him By the time they reached the battlements dead men and dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates He saw no battle lines only a swirling chaos of banners and blades Shouts and screams rang through the cold autumn air Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers but the Dreadfort men were better led and had taken the others unawares Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the houses He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified trumpeting of a maimed horse The inn was burning he saw

Black Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time The sun was low in the west painting the fields and houses all a glowing red A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over the walls and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses Theon watched a wounded man drag himself painfully across the ground smearing his life’s blood in the dirt as he struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square He died before he got there He wore a leather jerkin and conical halfhelm but no badge to tell which side he’d fought on

The crows came in the blue dust with the evening stars The Dothraki believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead Theon said Maester Luwin had told him that a long time ago

Dothraki

The horselords across the narrow sea

Oh Them Black Lorren frowned through his beard Savages believe all manner of foolish things

As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was happening below but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing and the shouts and warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing Finally a column of mounted men rode out of the drifting smoke At their head was a knight in dark armor His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders Outside the main gate he reined up and one of his men shouted for the castle to open

Are you friend or foe Black Lorren bellowed down

Would a foe bring such fine gifts Red Helm waved a hand and three corpses were dumped in front of the gates A torch was waved above the bodies so the defenders upon the walls might see the faces of the dead

The old castellan said Black Lorren

With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay turned away from the battlements and fell to his knees sick

The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor or we would have brought him as well shouted Red Helm

I am saved Theon thought So why did he feel so empty This was victory sweet victory the deliverance he had prayed for He glanced at Maester Luwin To think how close I came to yielding and taking the black…

Open the gates for our friends Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what his dreams might bring

The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard Pale red pennons trailed from the ends of a few lances but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and shields hacked half to splinters How many men did you lose Theon asked Red Helm as he dismounted

Twenty or thirty The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor His helm and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man’s face and shoulders skinless and bloody mouth open in a silent howl of anguish

Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one

Aye but he thought us friends A common mistake When the old fool gave me his hand I took half his arm instead Then I let him see my face The man put both hands to his helm and lifted it off his head holding it in the crook of his arm

Reek Theon said disquieted How did a serving man get such fine armor

The man laughed The wretch is dead He stepped closer The girl’s fault If she had not run so far his horse would not have lamed and we might have been able to flee I gave him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge I was done with her by then and he liked to take his turn while they were still warm I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into his hands—calfskin boots and velvet doublet silver-chased swordbelt even my sable cloak Ride for the Dreadfort I told him bring all the help you can Take my horse he’s swifter and here wear the ring my father gave me so they’ll know you came from me He’d learned better than to question me By the time they put that arrow through his back I’d smeared myself with the girl’s filth and dressed in his rags They might have hanged me anyway but it was the only chance I saw He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth And now my sweet prince there was a woman promised me if I brought two hundred men Well I brought three times as many and no green boys nor fieldhands neither but my father’s own garrison

Theon had given his word This was not the time to flinch Pay him his pound of flesh and deal with him later Harrag he said go to the kennels and bring Palla out for…

Ramsay There was a smile on his plump lips but none in those pale pale eyes Snow my wife called me before she ate her fingers but I say Bolton His smile curdled So you’d offer me a kennel girl for my good service is that the way of it

There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like no more than he liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at him She was what was promised
