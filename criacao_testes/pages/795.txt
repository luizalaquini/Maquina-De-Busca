2729 And when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon
his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before
him and mocked him saying Hail King of the Jews  2730 And they
spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head

2731 And after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from
him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him

2732 And as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name
him they compelled to bear his cross

2733 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha that is to
say a place of a skull 2734 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled
with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink

2735 And they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet They
parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots

2736 And sitting down they watched him there 2737 And set up over
his head his accusation written THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS

2738 Then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right
hand and another on the left

2739 And they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads 2740
And saying Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three
days save thyself If thou be the Son of God come down from the
cross

2741 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes
and elders said 2742 He saved others himself he cannot save If he
be the King of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we
will believe him

2743 He trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him
for he said I am the Son of God

2744 The thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same
in his teeth

2745 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour

2746 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying
Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say My God my God why hast
thou forsaken me  2747 Some of them that stood there when they
heard that said This man calleth for Elias

2748 And straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled
it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink

2749 The rest said Let be let us see whether Elias will come to
save him

2750 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the
ghost

2751 And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent 2752
And the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept
arose 2753 And came out of the graves after his resurrection and
went into the holy city and appeared unto many

2754 Now when the centurion and they that were with him watching
Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they
feared greatly saying Truly this was the Son of God

2755 And many women were there beholding afar off which followed
Jesus from Galilee ministering unto him 2756 Among which was Mary
Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of
Zebedees children

2757 When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea
named Joseph who also himself was Jesus disciple 2758 He went to
Pilate and begged the body of Jesus Then Pilate commanded the body
to be delivered

2759 And when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth 2760 And laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn
out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulchre and departed

2761 And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over
against the sepulchre

2762 Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the
chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate 2763 Saying
Sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive
After three days I will rise again

2764 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and
say unto the people He is risen from the dead so the last error
shall be worse than the first

2765 Pilate said unto them Ye have a watch go your way make it as
sure as ye can

2766 So they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone
