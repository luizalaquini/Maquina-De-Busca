Devan set the tray on the table and filled two clay cups The king sprinkled a pinch of salt in his cup before he drank Davos took his water straight wishing it were wine You were speaking of your council

Let me tell you how it will go Lord Velaryon will urge me to storm the castle walls at first light grapnels and scaling ladders against arrows and boiling oil The young mules will think this a splendid notion Estermont will favor settling down to starve them out as Tyrell and Redwyne once tried with me That might take a year but old mules are patient And Lord Caron and the others who like to kick will want to take up Ser Cortnay’s gauntlet and hazard all upon a single combat Each one imagining he will be my champion and win undying fame The king finished his water What would you have me do smuggler

Davos considered a moment before he answered Strike for King’s Landing at once

The king snorted And leave Storm’s End untaken

Ser Cortnay does not have the power to harm you The Lannisters do A siege would take too long single combat is too chancy and an assault would cost thousands of lives with no certainty of success And there is no need Once you dethrone Joffrey this castle must come to you with all the rest It is said about the camp that Lord Tywin Lannister rushes west to rescue Lannisport from the vengeance of the northmen…

You have a passing clever father Devan the king told the boy standing by his elbow He makes me wish I had more smugglers in my service And fewer lords Though you are wrong in one respect Davos There is a need If I leave Storm’s End untaken in my rear it will be said I was defeated here And that I cannot permit Men do not love me as they loved my brothers They follow me because they fear me… and defeat is death to fear The castle must fall His jaw ground side to side Aye and quickly Doran Martell has called his banners and fortified the mountain passes His Dornishmen are poised to sweep down onto the Marches And Highgarden is far from spent My brother left the greater part of his power at Bitterbridge near sixty thousand foot I sent my wife’s brother Ser Errol with Ser Parmen Crane to take them under my command but they have not returned I fear that Ser Loras Tyrell reached Bitterbridge before my envoys and took that host for his own

All the more reason to take King’s Landing as soon as we may Salladhor Saan told me—

Salladhor Saan thinks only of gold Stannis exploded His head is full of dreams of the treasure he fancies lies under the Red Keep so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan The day I need military counsel from a Lysene brigand is the day I put off my crown and take the black The king made a fist Are you here to serve me smuggler Or to vex me with arguments

I am yours Davos said

Then hear me Ser Cortnay’s lieutenant is cousin to the Fossoways Lord Meadows a green boy of twenty Should some ill chance strike down Penrose command of Storm’s End would pass to this stripling and his cousins believe he would accept my terms and yield up the castle

I remember another stripling who was given command of Storm’s End He could not have been much more than twenty

Lord Meadows is not as stonehead stubborn as I was

Stubborn or craven what does it matter Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to me

So did my brother the day before his death The night is dark and full of terrors Davos

Davos Seaworth felt the small hairs rising on the back of his neck My lord I do not understand you

I do not require your understanding Only your service Ser Cortnay will be dead within the day Melisandre has seen it in the flames of the future His death and the manner of it He will not die in knightly combat needless to say Stannis held out his cup and Devan filled it again from the flagon Her flames do not lie She saw Renly’s doom as well On Dragonstone she saw it and told Selyse Lord Velaryon and your friend Salladhor Saan would have had me sail against Joffrey but Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm’s End I would win the best part of my brother’s power and she was right

B-but Davos stammered Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to the castle He was marching toward King’s Landing before against the Lannisters he would have—

Stannis shifted in his seat frowning Was would have what is that He did what he did He came here with his banners and his peaches to his doom… and it was well for me he did Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King’s Landing Had I met my brother there it might have been me who died in place of him

Or you might have joined your strength to his to bring down the Lannisters Davos protested Why not that If she saw two futures well… both cannot be true

King Stannis pointed a finger There you err Onion Knight Some lights cast more than one shadow Stand before the nightfire and you’ll see for yourself The flames shift and dance never still The shadows grow tall and short and every man casts a dozen Some are fainter than others that’s all Well men cast their shadows across the future as well One shadow or many Melisandre sees them all

You do not love the woman I know that Davos I am not blind My lords mislike her too Estermont thinks the flaming heart ill-chosen and begs to fight beneath the crowned stag as of old Ser Guyard says a woman should not be my standard-bearer Others whisper that she has no place in my war councils that I ought to send her back to Asshai that it is sinful to keep her in my tent of a night Aye they whisper… while she serves

Serves how Davos asked dreading the answer

As needed The king looked at him And you

I… Davos licked his lips I am yours to command What would you have me do

Nothing you have not done before Only land a boat beneath the castle unseen in the black of night Can you do that

Yes Tonight

The king gave a curt nod You will need a small boat Not Black Betha No one must know what you do
