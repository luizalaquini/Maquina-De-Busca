The king was looking for his dog earlier

The dog was drinking It was your night to shield him ser You and my other brothers

Ser Boros turned to Sansa How is it you are not in your chambers at this hour lady

I went to the godswood to pray for the safety of the king The lie sounded better this time almost true

You expect her to sleep with all the noise Clegane said What was the trouble

Fools at the gate Ser Boros admitted Some loose tongues spread tales of the preparations for Tyrek’s wedding feast and these wretches got it in their heads they should be feasted too His Grace led a sortie and sent them scurrying

A brave boy Clegane said mouth twitching

Let us see how brave he is when he faces my brother Sansa thought The Hound escorted her across the drawbridge As they were winding their way up the steps she said Why do you let people call you a dog You won’t let anyone call you a knight

I like dogs better than knights My father’s father was kennelmaster at the Rock One autumn year Lord Tytos came between a lioness and her prey The lioness didn’t give a shit that she was Lannister’s own sigil Bitch tore into my lord’s horse and would have done for my lord too but my grandfather came up with the hounds Three of his dogs died running her off My grandfather lost a leg so Lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse and took his son to squire The three dogs on our banner are the three that died in the yellow of autumn grass A hound will die for you but never lie to you And he’ll look you straight in the face He cupped her under the jaw raising her chin his fingers pinching her painfully And that’s more than little birds can do isn’t it I never got my song

I… I know a song about Florian and Jonquil

Florian and Jonquil A fool and his cunt Spare me But one day I’ll have a song from you whether you will it or no

I will sing it for you gladly

Sandor Clegane snorted Pretty thing and such a bad liar A dog can smell a lie you know Look around you and take a good whiff They’re all liars here… and every one better than you





ARYA

When she climbed all the way up to the highest branch Arya could see chimneys poking through the trees Thatched roofs clustered along the shore of the lake and the small stream that emptied into it and a wooden pier jutted out into the water beside a low long building with a slate roof

She skinnied farther out until the branch began to sag under her weight No boats were tied to the pier but she could see thin tendrils of smoke rising from some of the chimneys and part of a wagon jutting out behind a stable

Someone’s there Arya chewed her lip All the other places they’d come upon had been empty and desolate Farms villages castles septs barns it made no matter If it could burn the Lannisters had burned it if it could die they’d killed it They had even set the woods ablaze where they could though the leaves were still green and wet from recent rains and the fires had not spread They would have burned the lake if they could have Gendry had said and Arya knew he was right On the night of their escape the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake was afire

When they finally summoned the nerve to steal back into the ruins the next night nothing remained but blackened stones the hollow shells of houses and corpses In some places wisps of pale smoke still rose from the ashes Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back and Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill them too but Lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the holdfast They found the gates broken down the walls partly demolished and the inside strewn with the unburied dead One look was enough for Gendry They’re killed every one he said And dogs have been at them too look

Or wolves

Dogs wolves it makes no matter It’s done here

But Arya would not leave until they found Yoren They couldn’t have killed him she told herself he was too hard and tough and a brother of the Night’s Watch besides She said as much to Gendry as they searched among the corpses

The axe blow that had killed him had split his skull apart but the great tangled beard could be no one else’s or the garb patched and unwashed and so faded it was more grey than black Ser Amory Lorch had given no more thought to burying his own dead than to those he had murdered and the corpses of four Lannister men-at-arms were heaped near Yoren’s Arya wondered how many it had taken to bring him down

He was going to take me home she thought as they dug the old man’s hole There were too many dead to bury them all but Yoren at least must have a grave Arya had insisted He was going to bring me safe to Winterfell he promised Part of her wanted to cry The other part wanted to kick him

It was Gendry who thought of the lord’s towerhouse and the three that Yoren had sent to hold it They had come under attack as well but the round tower had only one entry a second-story door reached by a ladder Once that had been pulled inside Ser Amory’s men could not get at them The Lannisters had piled brush around the tower’s base and set it afire but the stone would not burn and Lorch did not have the patience to starve them out Cutjack opened the door at Gendry’s shout and when Kurz said they’d be better pressing on north than going back Arya had clung to the hope that she still might reach Winterfell

Well this village was no Winterfell but those thatched roofs promised warmth and shelter and maybe even food if they were bold enough to risk them Unless it’s Lorch there He had horses he would have traveled faster than us
