1519 So the singers Heman Asaph and Ethan were appointed to sound
with cymbals of brass 1520 And Zechariah and Aziel and
Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and
Benaiah with psalteries on Alamoth 1521 And Mattithiah and
Elipheleh and Mikneiah and Obededom and Jeiel and Azaziah with
harps on the Sheminith to excel

1522 And Chenaniah chief of the Levites was for song he instructed
about the song because he was skilful

1523 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark

1524 And Shebaniah and Jehoshaphat and Nethaneel and Amasai and
Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer the priests did blow with the
trumpets before the ark of God and Obededom and Jehiah were
doorkeepers for the ark

1525 So David and the elders of Israel and the captains over
thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of
the house of Obededom with joy

1526 And it came to pass when God helped the Levites that bare the
ark of the covenant of the LORD that they offered seven bullocks and
seven rams

1527 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the
Levites that bare the ark and the singers and Chenaniah the master
of the song with the singers David also had upon him an ephod of
linen

1528 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and
with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps

1529 And it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
to the city of David that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at
a window saw king David dancing and playing and she despised him in
her heart

161 So they brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the
tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices
and peace offerings before God

162 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the
LORD

163 And he dealt to every one of Israel both man and woman to every
one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine

164 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
ark of the LORD and to record and to thank and praise the LORD God
of Israel 165 Asaph the chief and next to him Zechariah Jeiel and
Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and
Obededom and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps but Asaph made a
sound with cymbals 166 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with
trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God

167 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren

168 Give thanks unto the LORD call upon his name make known his
deeds among the people

169 Sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
works

1610 Glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the LORD

1611 Seek the LORD and his strength seek his face continually

1612 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth 1613 O ye seed of Israel his servant
ye children of Jacob his chosen ones

1614 He is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earth

1615 Be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations 1616 Even of the covenant which
he made with Abraham and of his oath unto Isaac 1617 And hath
confirmed the same to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an
everlasting covenant 1618 Saying Unto thee will I give the land of
Canaan the lot of your inheritance 1619 When ye were but few even
a few and strangers in it

1620 And when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom
to another people 1621 He suffered no man to do them wrong yea he
reproved kings for their sakes 1622 Saying Touch not mine anointed
and do my prophets no harm

1623 Sing unto the LORD all the earth shew forth from day to day
his salvation

1624 Declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among
all nations

1625 For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised he also is to
be feared above all gods
