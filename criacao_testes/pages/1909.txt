This is one of the standard texts on most aspects of digital signal processing
It treats the z-transform digital filters and discrete Fourier transformation
in far more detail than we have been able to here

This is the other standard text on digital signal processing
It covers the same ground as Oppenheim and Schafer 1975 above
but with a slightly faster and consequently more difficult presentation
It also contains major sections on special-purpose hardware for
digital signal processing

Probably the best single reference for digital speech analysis
as it is for the time-domain encoding techniques of the last chapter
Unlike the books cited above it is specifically oriented to speech processing

ds RT Resonance speech synthesizers
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
This chapter considers the design of speech synthesizers which
implement a direct electrical analogue of
the resonance properties of the vocal tract by providing a filter for each
formant whose resonant frequency is to be controlled  Another method is the
channel vocoder with a bank of fixed filters whose gains are varied to match
the spectrum of the speech as described in Chapter 4  This is not generally
used for synthesis from a written representation however because it is hard
to get good quality speech  It
ul
is
used sometimes for low-bandwidth
transmission and storage for
it is fairly easy to analyse natural speech into fixed frequency bands
A second alternative to the resonance synthesizer is the linear predictive
synthesizer which at present is used quite extensively and is likely to become
even more popular  This is covered in the next chapter
Another alternative is the articulatory synthesizer which
attempts to model the vocal tract directly rather than
modelling the acoustic output from it
Although as noted in Chapter 2 articulatory synthesis holds a promise of
high-quality speech em for the coarticulation effects caused by tongue
and jaw inertia can be modelled directly em this has not yet been realized
pp
The source-filter model of speech production indicates that an electrical
analogue of the vocal tract can be obtained by considering the source
excitation and the filter that produces the formant frequencies separately
This approach was pioneered by Fant 1960 and we shall present much of his
work in this chapter

Fant 1960 Acoustic theory of speech production

There has been some discussion over whether the source-filter model really
is a good one and some
synthesizers
explicitly introduce an element of
sub-glottal coupling which simulates the effect of the lung cavity
on the vocal tract transfer function during the periods when the glottis is
open for an example see Rabiner 1968
