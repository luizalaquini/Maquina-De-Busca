  `Hand it over here said the Dodo

  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble saying `We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
speech they all cheered

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
looking as solemn as she could

  The next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise
and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back  However it was over at last and they sat down again
in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more

  `You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice
`and why it is you hate--C and D she added in a whisper half
afraid that it would be offended again

  `Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to
Alice and sighing

  `It IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail `but why do you call it sad  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so
that her idea of the tale was something like this--

                    `Fury said to a
                   mouse That he
                 met in the

                       death


  `You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely
`What are you thinking of

  `I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly  `you had got to
the fifth bend I think

  `I had NOT cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily

  `A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and
looking anxiously about her  `Oh do let me help to undo it

  `I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up
and walking away  `You insult me by talking such nonsense

  `I didnt mean it pleaded poor Alice  `But youre so easily
offended you know

  The Mouse only growled in reply

  `Please come back and finish your story Alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus `Yes please do but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little
quicker
