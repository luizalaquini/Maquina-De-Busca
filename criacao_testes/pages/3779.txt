Lord Tywin was unconcerned Robb Stark will father no children on his fertile Frey you have my word There is a bit of news I have not yet seen fit to share with the council though no doubt the good lords will hear it soon enough The Young Wolf has taken Gawen Westerling’s eldest daughter to wife

For a moment Tyrion could not believe he’d heard his father right He broke his sworn word he said incredulous He threw away the Freys for… Words failed him

A maid of sixteen years named Jeyne said Ser Kevan Lord Gawen once suggested her to me for Willem or Martyn but I had to refuse him Gawen is a good man but his wife is Sybell Spicer He should never have wed her The Westerlings always did have more honor than sense Lady Sybell’s grandfather was a trader in saffron and pepper almost as lowborn as that smuggler Stannis keeps And the grandmother was some woman he’d brought back from the east A frightening old crone supposed to be a priestess Maegi they called her No one could pronounce her real name Half of Lannisport used to go to her for cures and love potions and the like He shrugged She’s long dead to be sure And Jeyne seemed a sweet child I’ll grant you though I only saw her once But with such doubtful blood…

Having once married a whore Tyrion could not entirely share his uncle’s horror at the thought of wedding a girl whose great grandfather sold cloves Even so… A sweet child Ser Kevan had said but many a poison was sweet as well The Westerlings were old blood but they had more pride than power It would not surprise him to learn that Lady Sybell had brought more wealth to the marriage than her highborn husband The Westerling mines had failed years ago their best lands had been sold off or lost and the Crag was more ruin than stronghold A romantic ruin though jutting up so brave above the sea I am surprised Tyrion had to confess I thought Robb Stark had better sense

He is a boy of sixteen said Lord Tywin At that age sense weighs for little against lust and love and honor

He forswore himself shamed an ally betrayed a solemn promise Where is the honor in that

Ser Kevan answered He chose the girl’s honor over his own Once he had deflowered her he had no other course

It would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly said Tyrion bluntly The Westerlings stood to lose everything here their lands their castle their very lives A Lannister always pays his debts

Jeyne Westerling is her mother’s daughter said Lord Tywin and Robb Stark is his father’s son

This Westerling betrayal did not seem to have enraged his father as much as Tyrion would have expected Lord Tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals He had extinguished the proud Reynes of Castamere and the ancient Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall root and branch when he was still half a boy The singers had even made a rather gloomy song of it Some years later when Lord Farman of Faircastle grew truculent Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter But once he’d heard The Rains of Castamere echoing through his hall Lord Farman gave no further trouble And if the song were not enough the shattered castles of the Reynes and Tarbecks still stood as mute testimony to the fate that awaited those who chose to scorn the power of Casterly Rock The Crag is not so far from Tarbeck Hall and Castamere Tyrion pointed out You’d think the Westerlings might have ridden past and seen the lesson there

Mayhaps they have Lord Tywin said They are well aware of Castamere I promise you

Could the Westerlings and Spicers be such great fools as to believe the wolf can defeat the lion

Every once in a very long while Lord Tywin Lannister would actually threaten to smile he never did but the threat alone was terrible to behold The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at them he said and then You will marry Sansa Stark Tyrion And soon





Catelyn


They carried the corpses in upon their shoulders and laid them beneath the dais A silence fell across the torchlit hall and in the quiet Catelyn could hear Grey Wind howling half a castle away He smells the blood she thought through stone walls and wooden doors through night and rain he still knows the scent of death and ruin

She stood at Robb’s left hand beside the high seat and for a moment felt almost as if she were looking down at her own dead at Bran and Rickon These boys had been much older but death had shrunken them Naked and wet they seemed such little things so still it was hard to remember them living

The blond boy had been trying to grow a beard Pale yellow peach fuzz covered his cheeks and jaw above the red ruin the knife had made of his throat His long golden hair was still wet as if he had been pulled from a bath By the look of him he had died peacefully perhaps in sleep but his brown-haired cousin had fought for life His arms bore slashes where he’d tried to block the blades and red still trickled slowly from the stab wounds that covered his chest and belly and back like so many tongueless mouths though the rain had washed him almost clean

Robb had donned his crown before coming to the hall and the bronze shone darkly in the torchlight Shadows hid his eyes as he looked upon the dead Does he see Bran and Rickon as well She might have wept but there were no tears left in her The dead boys were pale from long imprisonment and both had been fair against their smooth white skin the blood was shockingly red unbearable to look upon Will they lay Sansa down naked beneath the Iron Throne after they have killed her Will her skin seem as white her blood as red From outside came the steady wash of rain and the restless howling of a wolf

Her brother Edmure stood to Robb’s right one hand upon the back of his father’s seat his face still puffy from sleep They had woken him as they had her pounding on his door in the black of night to yank him rudely from his dreams Were they good dreams brother Do you dream of sunlight and laughter and a maiden’s kisses I pray you do Her own dreams were dark and laced with terrors

Robb’s captains and lords bannermen stood about the hall some mailed and armed others in various states of dishevelment and undress Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph were among them but Robb had seen fit to spare his queen this ugliness The Crag is not far from Casterly Rock Catelyn recalled Leyne may well have played with these boys when all of them were children

She looked down again upon the corpses of the squires Tion Frey and Willem Lannister and waited for her son to speak

It seemed a very long time before Robb lifted his eyes from the bloody dead Smalljon he said tell your father to bring them in Wordless Smalljon Umber turned to obey his steps echoing in the great stone hall

As the Greatjon marched his prisoners through the doors Catelyn made note of how some other men stepped back to give them room as if treason could somehow be passed by a touch a glance a cough The captors and the captives looked much alike big men every one with thick beards and long hair Two of the Greatjon’s men were wounded and three of their prisoners Only the fact that some had spears and others empty scabbards served to set them apart All were clad in mail hauberks or shirts of sewn rings with heavy boots and thick cloaks some of wool and some of fur The north is hard and cold and has no mercy Ned had told her when she first came to Winterfell a thousand years ago

Five said Robb when the prisoners stood before him wet and silent Is that all of them

There were eight rumbled the Greatjon We killed two taking them and a third is dying now

Robb studied the faces of the captives It required eight of you to kill two unarmed squires

Edmure Tully spoke up They murdered two of my men as well to get into the tower Delp and Elwood

It was no murder ser said Lord Rickard Karstark no more discomfited by the ropes about his wrists than by the blood that trickled down his face Any man who steps between a father and his vengeance asks for death

His words rang against Catelyn’s ears harsh and cruel as the pounding of a war drum Her throat was dry as bone I did this These two boys died so my daughters might live

I saw your sons die that night in the Whispering Wood Robb told Lord Karstark Tion Frey did not kill Torrhen Willem Lannister did not slay Eddard How then can you call this vengeance This was folly and bloody murder Your sons died honorably on a battlefield with swords in their hands

They died said Rickard Karstark yielding no inch of ground The Kingslayer cut them down These two were of his ilk Only blood can pay for blood

The blood of children Robb pointed at the corpses How old were they Twelve thirteen Squires

Squires die in every battle

Die fighting yes Tion Frey and Willem Lannister gave up their swords in the Whispering Wood They were captives locked in a cell asleep unarmed… boys Look at them

Lord Karstark looked instead at Catelyn Tell your mother to look at them he said She slew them as much as L

Catelyn put a hand on the back of Robb’s seat The hall seemed to spin about her She felt as though she might retch

My mother had naught to do with this Robb said angrily This was your work Your murder Your treason

How can it be treason to kill Lannisters when it is not treason to free them asked Karstark harshly Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock In war you kill your enemies Didn’t your father teach you that boy

Boy The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to his knees

Leave him Robb’s voice rang with command Umber stepped back away from the captive

Lord Karstark spit out a broken tooth Yes Lord Umber leave me to the king He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me That’s how he deals with treason our King in the North He smiled a wet red smile or should I call you the King Who Lost the North Your Grace

The Greatjon snatched a spear from the man beside him and jerked it to his shoulder Let me spit him sire Let me open his belly so we can see the color of his guts

The doors of the hall crashed open and the Blackfish entered with water running from his cloak and helm Tully men-at-arms followed him in while outside lightning cracked across the sky and a hard black rain pounded against the stones of Riverrun Ser Brynden removed his helm and went to one knee Your Grace was all he said but the grimness of his tone spoke volumes

I will hear Ser Brynden privily in the audience chamber Robb rose to his feet Greatjon keep Lord Karstark here till I return and hang the other seven

The Greatjon lowered the spear Even the dead ones

Yes I will not have such fouling my lord uncle’s rivers Let them feed the crows

One of the captives dropped to his knees Mercy sire I killed no one I only stood at the door to watch for guards
