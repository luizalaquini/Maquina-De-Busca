Mace Tyrell removed his daughter’s maiden cloak tenderly while Joffrey accepted the folded bride’s cloak from his brother Tommen and shook it out with a flourish The boy king was as tall at thirteen as his bride was at sixteen he would not require a fool’s back to climb upon He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten it at her throat And that easily she passed from her father’s protection to her husband’s But who will protect her from Joff Tyrion glanced at the Knight of Flowers standing with the other Kingsguard You had best keep your sword well honed Ser Loras

With this kiss I pledge my love Joffrey declared in ringing tones When Margaery echoed the words he pulled her close and kissed her long and deep Rainbow lights danced once more about the High Septon’s crown as he solemnly declared Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister and Margaery of House Tyrell to be one flesh one heart one soul

Good that’s done with Now let’s get back to the bloody castle so I can have a piss

Ser Loras and Ser Meryn led the procession from the sept in their white scale armor and snowy cloaks Then came Prince Tommen scattering rose petals from a basket before the king and queen After the royal couple followed Queen Cersei and Lord Tyrell then the bride’s mother arm-in-arm with Lord Tywin The Queen of Thorns tottered after them with one hand on Ser Kevan Lannister’s arm and the other on her cane her twin guardsmen close behind her in case she fell Next came Ser Garlan Tyrell and his lady wife and finally it was their turn

My lady Tyrion offered Sansa his arm She took it dutifully but he could feel her stiffness as they walked up the aisle together She never once looked down at him

He heard them cheering outside even before he reached the doors The mob loved Margaery so much they were even willing to love Joffrey again She had belonged to Renly the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them And the bounty of Highgarden had come with her flowing up the roseroad from the south The fools didn’t seem to remember that it had been Mace Tyrell who closed the roseroad to begin with and made the bloody famine

They stepped out into the crisp autumn air I feared we’d never escape Tyrion quipped

Sansa had no choice but to look at him then I… yes my lord As you say She looked sad It was such a beautiful ceremony though

As ours was not It was long I’ll say that much I need to return to the castle for a good piss Tyrion rubbed the stump of his nose Would that I’d contrived some mission to take me out of the city Littlefinger was the clever one

Joffrey and Margaery stood surrounded by Kingsguard atop the steps that fronted on the broad marble plaza Ser Addam and his gold cloaks held back the crowd while the statue of King Baelor the Blessed gazed down on them benevolently Tyrion had no choice but to queue up with the rest to offer congratulations He kissed Margaery’s fingers and wished her every happiness Thankfully there were others behind them waiting their turn so they did not need to linger long

Their litter had been sitting in the sun and it was very warm inside the curtains As they lurched into motion Tyrion reclined on an elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands She is just as comely as the Tyrell girl Her hair was a rich autumn auburn her eyes a deep Tully blue Grief had given her a haunted vulnerable look if anything it had only made her more beautiful He wanted to reach her to break through the armor of her courtesy Was that what made him speak Or just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder

I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again we might journey to Casterly Rock Far from Joffrey and my sister The more he thought about what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings the more it troubled him There was a message there oh yes It would please me to show you the Golden Gallery and the Lion’s Mouth and the Hall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys You can hear thunder from below where the sea comes in…

She raised her head slowly He knew what she was seeing the swollen brutish brow the raw stump of his nose his crooked pink scar and mismatched eyes Her own eyes were big and blue and empty I shall go wherever my lord husband wishes

I had hoped it might please you my lady

It will please me to please my lord

His mouth tightened What a pathetic little man you are Did you think babbling about the Lion’s Mouth would make her smile When have you ever made a woman smile but with gold No it was a foolish notion Only a Lannister can love the Rock

Yes my lord As you wish

Tyrion could hear the commons shouting out King Joffrey’s name In three years that cruel boy will be a man ruling in his own right… and every dwarf with half his wits will be a long way from King’s Landing Oldtown perhaps Or even the Free Cities He had always had a yen to see the Titan of Braavos Perhaps that would please Sansa Gently he spoke of Braavos and met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall he had walked once in the north It made him weary Then and now

They passed the rest of the journey in silence After a while Tyrion found himself hoping that Sansa would say something anything the merest word but she never spoke When the litter halted in the castle yard he let one of the grooms help her down We will be expected at the feast an hour hence my lady I will join you shortly He walked off stiff-legged Across the yard he could hear Margaery’s breathless laugh as Joffrey swept her from the saddle The boy will be as tall and strong as Jaime one day he thought and I’ll still be a dwarf beneath his feet And one day he’s like to make me even shorter…

He found a privy and sighed gratefully as he relieved himself of the morning’s wine There were times when a piss felt near as good as a woman and this was one He wished he could relieve himself of his doubts and guilts half as easily

Podrick Payne was waiting outside his chambers I laid out your new doublet Not here On your bed In the bedchamber

Yes that’s where we keep the bed Sansa would be in there dressing for the feast Shae as well Wine Pod

Tyrion drank it in his window seat brooding over the chaos of the kitchens below The sun had not yet touched the top of the castle wall but he could smell breads baking and meats roasting The guests would soon be pouring into the throne room full of anticipation this would be an evening of song and splendor designed not only to unite Highgarden and Casterly Rock but to trumpet their power and wealth as a lesson to any who might still think to oppose Joffrey’s rule

But who would be mad enough to contest Joffrey’s rule now after what had befallen Stannis Baratheon and Robb Stark There was still fighting in the riverlands but everywhere the coils were tightening Ser Gregor Clegane had crossed the Trident and seized the ruby ford then captured Harrenhal almost effortlessly Seagard had yielded to Black Walder Frey Lord Randyll Tarly held Maidenpool Duskendale and the kingsroad In the west Ser Daven Lannister had linked up with Ser Forley Prester at the Golden Tooth for a march on Riverrun Ser Ryman Frey was leading two thousand spears down from the Twins to join them And Paxter Redwyne claimed his fleet would soon set sail from the Arbor to begin the long voyage around Dorne and through the Stepstones Stannis’s Lyseni pirates would be outnumbered ten to one The struggle that the maesters were calling the War of the Five Kings was all but at an end Mace Tyrell had been heard complaining that Lord Tywin had left no victories for him

My lord Pod was at his side Will you be changing I laid out the doublet On your bed For the feast

Feast said Tyrion sourly What feast

The wedding feast Pod missed the sarcasm of course King Joffrey and Lady Margaery Queen Margaery I mean

Tyrion resolved to get very very drunk tonight Very well young Podrick let us go make me festive

Shae was helping Sansa with her hair when they entered the bedchamber Joy and grief he thought when he beheld them there together Laughter and tears Sansa wore a gown of silvery satin trimmed in vair with dagged sleeves that almost touched the floor lined in soft purple felt Shae had arranged her hair artfully in a delicate silver net winking with dark purple gemstones Tyrion had never seen her look more lovely yet she wore sorrow on those long satin sleeves Lady Sansa he told her you shall be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight

My lord is too kind

My lady said Shae wistfully Couldn’t I come serve at table I so want to see the pigeons fly out of the pie

Sansa looked at her uncertainly The queen has chosen all the servers

And the hall will be too crowded Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance There will be musicians strolling all through the castle though and tables in the outer ward with food and drink for all He inspected his new doublet crimson velvet with padded shoulders and puffed sleeves slashed to show the black satin underlining A handsome garment All it wants is a handsome man to wear it Come Pod help me into this

He had another cup of wine as he dressed then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk satin and velvet flowing toward the throne room Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches Others were milling in front of the doors enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon Tyrion led Sansa around the yard to perform the necessary courtesies

She is good at this he thought as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan the first time he’d left his sickbed since the battle He looks ghastly Lancel’s hair had turned white and brittle and he was thin as a stick Without his father beside him holding him up he would surely have collapsed Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he’d had the sense to love her He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone

You do look quite exquisite child Lady Olenna Tyrell told Sansa when she tottered up to them in a cloth-of-gold gown that must have weighed more than she did The wind has been at your hair though The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands tucking them back into place and straightening Sansa’s hair net I was very sorry to hear about your losses she said as she tugged and fiddled Your brother was a terrible traitor I know but if we start killing men at weddings they’ll be even more frightened of marriage than they are presently There that’s better Lady Olenna smiled I am pleased to say I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day after next I have had quite enough of this smelly city thank you Perhaps you would like to accompany me for a little visit whilst the men are off having their war I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully and all her lovely ladies Your company would be such sweet solace

You are too kind my lady said Sansa but my place is with my lord husband

Lady Olenna gave Tyrion a wrinkled toothless smile Oh Forgive a silly old woman my lord I did not mean to steal your lovely wife I assumed you would be off leading a Lannister host against some wicked foe

A host of dragons and stags The master of coin must remain at court to see that all the armies are paid for

To be sure Dragons and stags that’s very clever And dwarf’s pennies as well I have heard of these dwarf’s pennies No doubt collecting those is such a dreadful chore

I leave the collecting to others my lady

Oh do you I would have thought you might want to tend to it yourself We can’t have the crown being cheated of its dwarf’s pennies now Can we

Gods forbid Tyrion was beginning to wonder whether Lord Luthor Tyrell had ridden off that cliff intentionally If you will excuse us Lady Olenna it is time we were in our places

Myself as well Seventy-seven courses I daresay Don’t you find that a bit excessive my lord I shan’t eat more than three or four bites myself but you and I are very little aren’t we She patted Sansa’s hair again and said Well off with you child and try to be merrier Now where have my guardsmen gone Left Right where are you Come help me to the dais

Although evenfall was still an hour away the throne room was already a blaze of light with torches burning in every sconce The guests stood along the tables as heralds called out the names and titles of the lords and ladies making their entrance Pages in the royal livery escorted them down the broad central aisle The gallery above was packed with musicians drummers and pipers and fiddlers strings and horns and skins

Tyrion clutched Sansa’s arm and made the walk with a heavy waddling stride He could feel their eyes on him picking at the fresh new scar that had left him even uglier than he had been before Let them look he thought as he hopped up onto his seat Let them stare and whisper until they’ve had their fill I will not hide myself for their sake The Queen of Thorns followed them in shuffling along with tiny little steps Tyrion wondered which of them looked more absurd him with Sansa or the wizened little woman between her seven-foot-tall twin guardsmen

Joffrey and Margaery rode into the throne room on matched white chargers Pages ran before them scattering rose petals under their hooves The king and queen had changed for the feast as well Joffrey wore striped black-and-crimson breeches and a cloth-of-gold doublet with black satin sleeves and onyx studs Margaery had exchanged the demure gown that she had worn in the sept for one much more revealing a confection in pale green samite with a tight-laced bodice that bared her shoulders and the tops of her small breasts Unbound her soft brown hair tumbled over her white shoulders and down her back almost to her waist Around her brows was a slim golden crown Her smile was shy and sweet A lovely girl thought Tyrion and a kinder fate than my nephew deserves

The Kingsguard escorted them onto the dais to the seats of honor beneath the shadow of the Iron Throne draped for the occasion in long silk streamers of Baratheon gold Lannister crimson and Tyrell green Cersei embraced Margaery and kissed her cheeks Lord Tywin did the same and then Lancel and Ser Kevan Joffrey received loving kisses from the bride’s father and his two new brothers Loras and Garlan No one seemed in any great rush to kiss Tyrion When the king and queen had taken their seats the High Septon rose to lead a prayer At least he does not drone as badly as the last one Tyrion consoled himself

He and Sansa had been seated far to the king’s right beside Ser Garlan Tyrell and his wife the Lady Leonette A dozen others sat closer to Joffrey which a pricklier man might have taken for a slight given that he had been the King’s Hand only a short time past Tyrion would have been glad if there had been a hundred

Let the cups be filled Joffrey proclaimed when the gods had been given their due His cupbearer poured a whole flagon of dark Arbor red into the golden wedding chalice that Lord Tyrell had given him that morning The king had to use both hands to lift it To my wife the queen
