The flies circled Khal Drogo slowly their wings buzzing a low thrum at the edge of hearing that filled Dany with dread

The sun was high and pitiless Heat shimmered in waves off the stony outcrops of low hills A thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between Dany’s swollen breasts The only sounds were the steady clop of their horses’ hooves the rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo’s hair and the distant voices behind them

Dany watched the flies

They were as large as bees gross purplish glistening The Dothraki called them bloodflies They lived in marshes and stagnant pools sucked blood from man and horse alike and laid their eggs in the dead and dying Drogo hated them Whenever one came near him his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around it She had never seen him miss He would hold the fly inside his huge fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing Then his fingers would tighten and when he opened his hand again the fly would be only a red smear on his palm

Now one crept across the rump of his stallion and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it away The others flitted about Drogo closer and closer The khal did not react His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills the reins loose in his hands Beneath his painted vest a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his breast The herbwomen had made it for him Mirri Maz Duur’s poultice had itched and burned and he had torn it off six days ago cursing her for a maegi The mud plaster was more soothing and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well He’d been drinking it heavily these past three days when it was not poppy wine it was fermented mare’s milk or pepper beer

Yet he scarcely touched his food and he thrashed and groaned in the night Dany could see how drawn his face had become Rhaego was restless in her belly kicking like a stallion yet even that did not stir Drogo’s interest as it had Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep And now this silence It was making her afraid Since they had mounted up at dawn he had said not a word When she spoke she got no answer but a grunt and not even that much since midday

One of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khal’s shoulder Another circling touched down on his neck and crept up toward his mouth Khal Drogo swayed in the saddle bells ringing as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace

Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer My lord she said softly Drogo My sun-and-stars

He did not seem to hear The bloodfly crawled up under his drooping mustache and settled on his cheek in the crease beside his nose Dany gasped Drogo Clumsily she reached over and touched his arm

Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle tilted slowly and fell heavily from his horse The flies scattered for a heartbeat and then circled back to settle on him where he lay

No Dany said reining up Heedless of her belly for once she scrambled off her silver and ran to him

The grass beneath him was brown and dry Drogo cried out in pain as Dany knelt beside him His breath rattled harshly in his throat and he looked at her without recognition My horse he gasped Dany brushed the flies off his chest smashing one as he would have His skin burned beneath her fingers

The khal’s bloodriders had been following just behind them She heard Haggo shout as they galloped up Cohollo vaulted from his horse Blood of my blood he said as he dropped to his knees The other two kept to their mounts

No Khal Drogo groaned struggling in Dany’s arms Must ride Ride No

He fell from his horse Haggo said staring down His broad face was impassive but his voice was leaden

You must not say that Dany told him We have ridden far enough today We will camp here

Here Haggo looked around them The land was brown and sere inhospitable This is no camping ground

It is not for a woman to bid us halt said Qotho not even a khaleesi

We camp here Dany repeated Haggo tell them Khal Drogo commanded the halt If any ask why say to them that my time is near and I could not continue Cohollo bring up the slaves they must put up the khal’s tent at once Qotho—

You do not command me Khaleesi Qotho said

Find Mirri Maz Duur she told him The godswife would be walking among the other Lamb Men in the long column of slaves Bring her to me with her chest

Qotho glared down at her his eyes hard as flint The maegi He spat This I will not do

You will Dany said or when Drogo wakes he will hear why you defied me

Furious Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger… but Dany knew he would return with Mirri Maz Duur however little he might like it The slaves erected Khal Drogo’s tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun Even so it was stifling under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside Thick patterned carpets had been laid down over the ground and pillows scattered in the corners Eroeh the timid girl Dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the Lamb Men set up a brazier They stretched Drogo out on a woven mat No he muttered in the Common Tongue No no It was all he said all he seemed capable of saying

Doreah unhooked his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings while Jhiqui knelt by his feet to undo the laces of his riding sandals Irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze but Dany forbade it She would not have any see Drogo this way in delirium and weakness When her khas came up she posted them outside at guard Admit no one without my leave she told Jhogo No one

Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay He dies she whispered

Dany slapped her The khal cannot die He is the father of the stallion who mounts the world His hair has never been cut He still wears the bells his father gave him

Khaleesi Jhiqui said he fell from his horse

Trembling her eyes full of sudden tears Dany turned away from them He fell from his horse It was so she had seen it and the bloodriders and no doubt her handmaids and the men of her khas as well And how many more They could not keep it secret and Dany knew what that meant A khal who could not ride could not rule and Drogo had fallen from his horse

We must bathe him she said stubbornly She must not allow herself to despair Irri have the tub brought at once Doreah Eroeh find water cool water he’s so hot He was a fire in human skin

The slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent When Doreah brought the first jar of water Dany wet a length of silk to lay across Drogo’s brow over the burning skin His eyes looked at her but he did not see When his lips opened no words escaped them only a moan Where is Mirri Maz Duur she demanded her patience rubbed raw with fear

Qotho will find her Irri said

Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur sweetening it with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves While the bath was being prepared Dany knelt awkwardly beside her lord husband her belly great with their child within She undid his braid with anxious fingers as she had on the night he’d taken her for the first time beneath the stars His bells she laid aside carefully one by one He would want them again when he was well she told herself

A breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked his head through the silk Khaleesi he said the Andal is come and begs leave to enter

The Andal was what the Dothraki called Ser Jorah Yes she said rising clumsily send him in She trusted the knight He would know what to do if anyone did

Ser Jorah Mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dimness In the fierce heat of the south he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding sandals that laced up to his knee His scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt Under a bleached white vest he was bare-chested skin reddened by the sun Talk goes from mouth to ear all over the khalasar he said It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse

Help him Dany pleaded For the love you say you bear me help him now

The knight knelt beside her He looked at Drogo long and hard and then at Dany Send your maids away

Wordlessly her throat tight with fear Dany made a gesture Irri herded the other girls from the tent

When they were alone Ser Jorah drew his dagger Deftly with a delicacy surprising in such a big man he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue mud from Drogo’s chest The plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the Lamb Men and like those walls it cracked easily Ser Jorah broke the dry mud with his knife pried the chunks from the flesh peeled off the leaves one by one A foul sweet smell rose from the wound so thick it almost choked her The leaves were crusted with blood and pus Drogo’s breast black and glistening with corruption

No Dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks No please gods hear me no

Khal Drogo thrashed fighting some unseen enemy Black blood ran slow and thick from his open wound

Your khal is good as dead Princess

No he can’t die he mustn’t it was only a cut Dany took his large callused hand in her own small ones and held it tight between them I will not let him die…

Ser Jorah gave a bitter laugh Khaleesi or queen that command is beyond your power Save your tears child Weep for him tomorrow or a year from now We do not have time for grief We must go and quickly before he dies

Dany was lost Go Where should we go

Asshai I would say It lies far to the south at the end of the known world yet men say it is a great port We will find a ship to take us back to Pentos It will be a hard journey make no mistake Do you trust your khas Will they come with us

Khal Drogo commanded them to keep me safe Dany replied uncertainly but if he dies… She touched the swell of her belly I don’t understand Why should we flee I am khaleesi I carry Drogo’s heir He will be khal after Drogo…

Ser Jorah frowned Princess hear me The Dothraki will not follow a suckling babe Drogo’s strength was what they bowed to and only that When he is gone Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos will fight for his place and this khalasar will devour itself The winner will want no more rivals The boy will be taken from your breast the moment he is born They will give him to the dogs…

Dany hugged herself But why she cried plaintively Why should they kill a little baby
