Look at me ser

The light hurts my eyes A moment if you would Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood and a shaggy beard covered his face once so like the queen’s Glinting gold in the lamplight the whiskers made him look like some great yellow beast magnificent even in chains His unwashed hair fell to his shoulders in ropes and tangles the clothes were rotting on his body his face was pale and wasted… and even so the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent

I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you

Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect

I can have your head off anytime I want Why would I need to poison you

Death by poison can seem natural Harder to claim that my head simply fell off He squinted up from the floor his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light I’d invite you to sit but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair

I can stand well enough

Can you You look terrible I must say Though perhaps it’s just the light in here He was fettered at wrist and ankle each cuff chained to the others so he could neither stand nor lie comfortably The ankle chains were bolted to the wall Are my bracelets heavy enough for you or did you come to add a few more I’ll rattle them prettily if you like

You brought this on yourself she reminded him We granted you the comfort of a tower cell befitting your birth and station You repaid us by trying to escape

A cell is a cell Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden One day perhaps I’ll show them to you

If he is cowed he hides it well Catelyn thought A man chained hand and foot should keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth ser I did not come here to be threatened

No Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me It’s said that widows grow weary of their empty beds We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed but I suppose I could still service you if that’s what you need Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it

Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as this one If you said that in my son’s hearing he would kill you for it

Only so long as I was wearing these Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her We both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat

My son may be young but if you take him for a fool you are sadly mistaken… and it seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your back

Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well

I grow weary of this ser There are things I must know

Why should I tell you anything

To save your life

You think I fear death That seemed to amuse him

You should Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just

What gods are those Lady Catelyn The trees your husband prayed to How well did they serve him when my sister took his head off Jaime gave a chuckle If there are gods why is the world so full of pain and injustice

Because of men like you

There are no men like me There’s only me

There is nothing here but arrogance and pride and the empty courage of a madman I am wasting my breath with this one If there was ever a spark of honor in him it is long dead If you will not speak with me so be it Drink the wine or piss in it ser it makes no matter to me

Her hand was at the door pull when he said Lady Stark She turned waited Things go to rust in this damp Jaime went on Even a man’s courtesies Stay and you shall have your answers… for a price

He has no shame Captives do not set prices

Oh you’ll find mine modest enough Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies and he cannot even keep them straight One day he says Cersei has been flayed and the next it’s my father Answer my questions and I’ll answer yours

Truthfully

Oh it’s truth you want Be careful my lady Tyrion says that people often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when it’s served up

I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say

As you will then But first if you’d be so kind… the wine My throat is raw

Catelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer Jaime sloshed the wine around his mouth before he swallowed Sour and vile he said but it will do He put his back to the wall drew his knees up to his chest and stared at her Your first question Lady Catelyn

Not knowing how long this game might continue Catelyn wasted no time Are you Joffrey’s father

You would never ask unless you knew the answer

I want it from your own lips

He shrugged Joffrey is mine As are the rest of Cersei’s brood I suppose

You admit to being your sister’s lover

I’ve always loved my sister and you owe me two answers Do all my kin still live

Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross I am told

Jaime was unmoved Uncle Dolt my sister called him it’s Cersei and Tyrion who concern me As well as my lord father

They live all three But not long if the gods are good

Jaime drank some more wine Ask your next

Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie How did my son Bran come to fall

I flung him from a window

The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant If I had a knife I would kill him now she thought until she remembered the girls Her throat constricted as she said You were a knight sworn to defend the weak and innocent

He was weak enough but perhaps not so innocent He was spying on us

Bran would not spy

Then blame those precious gods of yours who brought the boy to our window and gave him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see

Blame the gods she said incredulous Yours was the hand that threw him You meant for him to die
