a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a
mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a
comely person and the LORD is with him

1619 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said Send me
David thy son which is with the sheep

1620 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine
and a kid and sent them by David his son unto Saul

1621 And David came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him
greatly and he became his armourbearer

1622 And Saul sent to Jesse saying Let David I pray thee stand
before me for he hath found favour in my sight

1623 And it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon
Saul that David took an harp and played with his hand so Saul was
refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him

171 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and
were gathered together at Shochoh which belongeth to Judah and
pitched between Shochoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim

172 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and
pitched by the valley of Elah and set the battle in array against the
Philistines

173 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and
Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley
between them

174 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines
named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a span

175 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed
with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand
shekels of brass

176 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass
between his shoulders

177 And the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his
spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a
shield went before him

178 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto
them Why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not I a
Philistine and ye servants to Saul choose you a man for you and let
him come down to me

179 If he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be
your servants but if I prevail against him and kill him then shall
ye be our servants and serve us

1710 And the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day
give me a man that we may fight together

1711 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine
they were dismayed and greatly afraid

1712 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah
whose name was Jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among
men for an old man in the days of Saul

1713 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were
Eliab the firstborn and next unto him Abinadab and the third
Shammah

1714 And David was the youngest and the three eldest followed Saul

1715 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his fathers sheep
at Bethlehem

1716 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening and presented
himself forty days

1717 And Jesse said unto David his son Take now for thy brethren an
ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp
of thy brethren 1718 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of
their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge

1719 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the
valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines

1720 And David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with
a keeper and took and went as Jesse had commanded him and he came
to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted
for the battle

1721 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array army
against army

1722 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren

1723 And as he talked with them behold there came up the champion
the Philistine of Gath Goliath by name out of the armies of the
Philistines and spake according to the same words and David heard
