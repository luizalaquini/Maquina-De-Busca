of the extra keys but this will introduce incompatibility with those
who use unmodified touch-tone phones
More sophisticated terminals are available which extend the keypad em such
as the Displayphone of Northern Telecommunications
However they are designed as a complete communications terminal and
contain their own visual display as well
rh Keying alphabetic data
Figure 102 shows the near-universal scheme for overlaying alphabetic letters
on to the telephone keypad
FC Figure 102
Since more than one symbol occupies each key it is obviously necessary
to have multiple keystrokes per character if the input sequence is to be
decodable as a string of letters
One way of doing this is to depress the appropriate button the number of
times corresponding to the position of the letter on it
For example to enter the letter L the user would key the 5 button
three times in rapid succession
Keying rhythm must be used to distinguish the four entries J J J
J K K J and L unless one of the bottom three buttons is used
as a separator
A different method is to use  0 and  as shift keys to indicate whether
the first second or third letter on a key is intended
Then 5 would represent L
Alternatively the shift could follow the key instead of preceding it
so that 5 represented L
pp
If numeric as well as alphabetic information may be entered a mode-shift
operation is commonly used to switch between numeric and alphabetic modes
pp
The relative merits of these three methods multiple depressions shift
key prefix and shift key suffix have been investigated
experimentally Kramer 1970

Kramer 1970

The results were rather inconclusive
The first method seemed to be slightly inferior in terms of user accuracy
It seemed that preceding rather than following shifts gave higher accuracy
although this is perhaps rather counter-intuitive and may have been
fortuitous
The most useful result from the experiments was that users exhibited
significant learning behaviour and a training period of at least two hours
was recommended
Operators were found able to key at rates of at least three to four
characters per second and faster with practice
pp
If a greater range of characters must be represented then the coding problem
becomes more complex
Figure 103 shows a keypad which can be used for entry of the full 64-character
standard upper-case ASCII alphabet Shew 1975

The system is intended for remote vocabulary updating in a phonetically-based
speech synthesis system
There are three modes of operation  numeric alphabetic and symbolic
These are entered by   and 0 respectively
Two function modes signalled by 0 and  allow some
rudimentary line-editing and monitor facilities to be incorporated
Line-editing commands include character and line delete and two kinds of
read-back commands em one tries to pronounce the words in a line
and the other spells out the characters
The monitor commands allow the user to repeat the effect of the last input line
as though he had entered it again to order the system to read back the
last complete output line and to query time and system status
rh Incomplete keying of alphanumeric data
It is obviously going to be rather difficult for the operator to key
alphanumeric information unambiguously on a 12-key pad
In the description of the telephone enquiry service in Chapter 1
it was mentioned that single-key entry can be useful for alphanumeric data
if the ambiguity can be resolved by the computer
If a multiple-character entry is known to refer to an item on a given
list the characters can be keyed directly according to the coding scheme
of Figure 102
pp
Under most circumstances no ambiguity will arise
For example Table 101 shows the keystrokes that would be entered for the
first 50 5-letter words in an English dictionary
Only two clashes occur em between  adore and afore and
agate and agave
