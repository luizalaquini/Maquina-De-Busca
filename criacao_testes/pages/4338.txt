of the extreme ends of the system
It is not difficult to show that under these
conditions the signal at the lower righthand
terminal of the analysis chain will equal that at the lower lefthand
terminal of the synthesis chain even though they are not connected
provided the upper terminals are connected together as shown by the dashed
line
Of course the reflection coefficients  k sub 1 k sub 2 
k sub p  in the analysis lattice must equal those in the synthesis
lattice and as Figure 613 shows the order is reversed in the synthesis
lattice
Successive analysis and synthesis sections pair off working from
the middle outwards  At each stage the sections cancel each other out
giving a unit transfer function as demonstrated above
rh Estimating reflection coefficients
As stated earlier in this chapter the key problem in linear prediction is to
determine the values of the predictive coefficients em in this case the
reflection coefficients
If this is done correctly we have shown using Procedure 63 that
the the synthesis part of Figure 613 performs the same calculation that
a conventional direct-form linear predictive synthesizer would and hence
the signal that excites it em that is the signal represented by the
dashed line em must be the prediction residual or error signal discussed
earlier  The system is effectively the same as the high-order adaptive
differential pulse code modulation one of Figure 61
pp
One of the most interesting features of the lattice structure for
analysis filters is that calculation of suitable values for the
reflection coefficients can be done locally at each stage of the lattice
For example consider the ith section of the analysis lattice in
Figure 613  It is possible to determine a suitable value of k sub i
simply by performing a calculation on the inputs to the ith
section ie X sup + and X sup - in Figure 612
No longer need the complicated global optimization technique of matrix
inversion be used as in the autocorrelation and covariance methods discussed
earlier
pp
A suitable value for k in the single lattice section of Figure 612 is
LB
EQ
k =  E x sup + n x sup - n-1 over
 E x sup + n sup 2  E x sup - n-1 sup 2   sup 12  
EN
LE
that is the statistical correlation between x sup + n and
x sup - n-1
Here x sup + n and x sup - n represent the input signals to the
upper and lower paths recall that X sup + and X sup -
are their z-transforms
x sup - n-1 is just x sup - n delayed by one time unit that is
the output of the z sup -1 box in the Figure
pp
The criterion of optimality for the autocorrelation and covariance methods
was that the prediction error that is the signal which emerges from
the right-hand end of the upper path of a lattice analysis filter
should be minimized in a mean-square sense
The reflection coefficients obtained from the above formula do not necessarily
satisfy any such global minimization criterion
Nevertheless they do keep the error signal small and have been used with
success in speech analysis systems
pp
It is easy to minimize the output from either the upper or the lower path
of the lattice filter at each stage  For example the z-transform of the
upper output is given by
LB
EQ
Y sup + = X sup + - k z sup -1 X sup - 
EN
LE
or
LB
EQ
y sup + n = x sup + n - k x sup - n-1 
EN
LE
Hence
LB
EQ
Ey sup + n sup 2   =  Ex sup + n sup 2  -
2kEx sup + n x sup - n-1  + k sup 2 E x sup - n-1 sup 2  
EN
LE
where E stands for expected value and this reaches a minimum when the
derivative with respect to k becomes zero
LB
EQ
-2Ex sup + n x sup - n-1  + 2kEx sup - n-1 sup 2  =0 
EN
LE
that is when
LB
EQ
k =  Ex sup + n x sup - n-1  over Ex sup - n-1 sup 2 
  
EN
LE
A similar calculation shows that the output of the lower path is minimized
when
