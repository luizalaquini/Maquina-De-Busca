Archers Jon said when the horns had died away you’ll aim for the giants with that ram every bloody one of you Loose at my command not before THE GIANTS AND THE RAM I want arrows raining on them with every step but we’ll wait till they’re in range Any man who wastes an arrow will need to climb down and fetch it back do you hear me

I do shouted Owen the Oaf I hear you Lord Snow

Jon laughed laughed like a drunk or a madman and his men laughed with him The chariots and the racing horsemen on the flanks were well ahead of the center now he saw The wildlings had not crossed a third of the half mile yet their battle line was dissolving Load the trebuchet with caltrops Jon said Owen Kegs angle the catapults toward the center Scorpions load with fire spears and loose at my command He pointed at the Mole’s Town boys You you and you stand by with torches

The wildling archers shot as they advanced they would dash forward stop loose then run another ten yards There were so many that the air was constantly full of arrows all falling woefully short A waste Jon thought Their want of discipline is showing The smaller horn-and-wood bows of the free folk were outranged by the great yew longbows of the Night’s Watch and the wildlings were trying to shoot at men seven hundred feet above them Let them shoot Jon said Wait Hold Their cloaks were flapping behind them The wind is in our faces it will cost us range Wait Closer closer The skins wailed the drums thundered the wildling arrows fluttered and fell

DRAW Jon lifted his own bow and pulled the arrow to his ear Satin did the same and Grenn Owen the Oaf Spare Boot Black Jack Bulwer Arron and Emrick Zei hoisted her crossbow to her shoulder Jon was watching the ram come on and on the mammoths and giants lumbering forward on either side They were so small he could have crushed them all in one hand it seemed If only my hand was big enough Through the killing ground they came A hundred crows rose from the carcass of the dead mammoth as the wildlings thundered past to either side of them Closer and closer until…

LOOSE

The black arrows hissed downward like snakes on feathered wings Jon did not wait to see where they struck He reached for a second arrow as soon as the first left his bow NOTCH DRAW LOOSE As soon as the arrow flew he found another NOTCH DRAW LOOSE Again and then again Jon shouted for the trebuchet and heard the creak and heavy thud as a hundred spiked steel caltrops went spinning through the air Catapults he called scorpions Bowmen loose at will Wildling arrows were striking the Wall now a hundred feet below them A second giant spun and staggered Notch draw loose A mammoth veered into another beside it spilling giants on the ground Notch draw loose The ram was down and done he saw the giants who’d pushed it dead or dying Fire arrows he shouted I want that ram burning The screams of wounded mammoths and the booming cries of giants mingled with the drums and pipes to make an awful music yet still his archers drew and loosed as if they’d all gone as deaf as dead Dick Follard They might be the dregs of the order but they were men of the Night’s Watch or near enough as made no matter That’s why they shall not pass

One of the mammoths was running berserk smashing wildlings with his trunk and crushing archers underfoot Jon pulled back his bow once more and launched another arrow at the beast’s shaggy back to urge him on To east and west the flanks of the wildling host had reached the Wall unopposed The chariots drew in or turned while the horsemen milled aimlessly beneath the looming cliff of ice At the gate a shout came Spare Boot maybe Mammoth at the gate

Fire Jon barked Grenn Pyp

Grenn thrust his bow aside wrestled a barrel of oil onto its side and rolled it to the edge of the Wall where Pyp hammered out the plug that sealed it stuffed in a twist of cloth and set it alight with a torch They shoved it over together A hundred feet below it struck the Wall and burst filling the air with shattered staves and burning oil Grenn was rolling a second barrel to the precipice by then and Kegs had one as well Pyp lit them both Got him Satin shouted his head sticking out so far that Jon was certain he was about to fall Got him got him GOT him He could hear the roar of fire A flaming giant lurched into view stumbling and rolling on the ground

Then suddenly the mammoths were fleeing running from the smoke and flames and smashing into those behind them in their terror Those went backward too the giants and wildlings behind them scrambling to get out of their way In half a heartbeat the whole center was collapsing The horsemen on the flanks saw themselves being abandoned and decided to fall back as well not one so much as blooded Even the chariots rumbled off having done nothing but look fearsome and make a lot of noise When they break they break hard Jon Snow thought as he watched them reel away The drums had all gone silent How do you like that music Mance How do you like the taste of the Dornishman’s wife Do we have anyone hurt he asked

The bloody buggers got my leg Spare Boot plucked the arrow out and waved it above his head The wooden one

A ragged cheer went up Zei grabbed Owen by the hands spun him around in a circle and gave him a long wet kiss right there for all to see She tried to kiss Jon too but he held her by the shoulder and pushed her gently but firmly away No he said I am done with kissing Suddenly he was too weary to stand and his leg was agony from knee to groin He fumbled for his crutch Pyp help me to the cage Grenn you have the Wall

Me said Grenn Him said Pyp It was hard to tell which of them was more horrified But Grenn stammered b-but what do I do if the wildlings attack again

Stop them Jon told him

As they rode down in the cage Pyp took off his helm and wiped his brow Frozen sweat Is there anything as disgusting as frozen sweat He laughed Gods I don’t think I have ever been so hungry I could eat an aurochs whole I swear it Do you think Hobb will cook up Grenn for us When he saw Jon’s face his smile died What’s wrong Is it your leg

My leg Jon agreed Even the words were an effort

Not the battle though We won the battle

Ask me when I’ve seen the gate Jon said grimly I want a fire a hot meal a warm bed and something to make my leg stop hurting he told himself But first he had to check the tunnel and find what had become of Donal Noye

After the battle with the Thenns it had taken them almost a day to clear the ice and broken beams away from the inner gate Spotted Pate and Kegs and some of the other builders had argued heatedly that they ought just leave the debris there another obstacle for Mance That would have meant abandoning the defense of the tunnel though and Noye was having none of it With men in the murder holes and archers and spears behind each inner grate a few determined brothers could hold off a hundred times as many wildlings and clog the way with corpses He did not mean to give Mance Rayder free passage through the ice So with pick and spade and ropes they had moved the broken steps aside and dug back down to the gate

Jon waited by the cold iron bars while Pyp went to Maester Aemon for the spare key Surprisingly the maester himself returned with him and Clydas with a lantern Come see me when we are done the old man told Jon while Pyp was fumbling with the chains I need to change your dressing and apply a fresh poultice and you will want some more dreamwine for the pain

Jon nodded weakly The door swung open Pyp led them in followed by Clydas and the lantern It was all Jon could do to keep up with Maester Aemon The ice pressed close around them and he could feel the cold seeping into his bones the weight of the Wall above his head It felt like walking down the gullet of an ice dragon The tunnel took a twist and then another Pyp unlocked a second iron gate They walked farther turned again and saw light ahead faint and pale through the ice That’s bad Jon knew at once That’s very bad

Then Pyp said There’s blood on the floor

The last twenty feet of the tunnel was where they’d fought and died The outer door of studded oak had been hacked and broken and finally torn off its hinges and one of the giants had crawled in through the splinters The lantern bathed the grisly scene in a sullen reddish light Pyp turned aside to retch and Jon found himself envying Maester Aemon his blindness

Noye and his men had been waiting within behind a gate of heavy iron bars like the two Pyp had just unlocked The two crossbows had gotten off a dozen quarrels as the giant struggled toward them Then the spearmen must have come to the fore stabbing through the bars Still the giant found the strength to reach through twist the head off Spotted Pate seize the iron gate and wrench the bars apart Links of broken chain lay strewn across the floor One giant All this was the work of one giant

Are they all dead Maester Aemon asked softly

Yes Donal was the last Noye’s sword was sunk deep in the giant’s throat halfway to the hilt The armorer had always seemed such a big man to Jon but locked in the giant’s massive arms he looked almost like a child The giant crushed his spine I don’t know who died first He took the lantern and moved forward for a better look Mag I am the last of the giants He could feel the sadness there but he had no time for sadness It was Mag the Mighty The king of the giants
