149 For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living

1410 But why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at
nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
Christ

1411 For it is written As I live saith the Lord every knee shall
bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God

1412 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God

1413 Let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this
rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
brothers way

1414 I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is
nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean to him it is unclean

1415 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou
not charitably Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died

1416 Let not then your good be evil spoken of 1417 For the kingdom
of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in
the Holy Ghost

1418 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God
and approved of men

1419 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace
and things wherewith one may edify another

1420 For meat destroy not the work of God All things indeed are
pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence

1421 It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any
thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak

1422 Hast thou faith have it to thyself before God Happy is he that
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth

1423 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not
of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin

151 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak and not to please ourselves

152 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
edification

153 For even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written The
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me

154 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
have hope

155 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus 156 That ye
may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ

157 Wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to
the glory of God

158 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
159 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy as it is
written For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles and
sing unto thy name

1510 And again he saith Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people

1511 And again Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles and laud him all
ye people

1512 And again Esaias saith There shall be a root of Jesse and he
that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles
trust

1513 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy
Ghost

1514 And I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also
are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish
one another

1515 Nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you
in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is
given to me of God 1516 That I should be the minister of Jesus
Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God that the
offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by
the Holy Ghost

1517 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
those things which pertain to God
