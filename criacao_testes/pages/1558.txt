never heal They say they say they saySnow has a list
and no one knows who will be next
Poison The perfect weapon for a snake
Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president
are already so low I cant say Finnicks allegations shock
me They seem to have far more effect on the displaced
Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia--even Plutarch
occasionally reacts in surprise maybe wondering how a
specific tidbit passed him by When Finnick finishes they
just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be the
one to say Cut
The crew hurries inside to edit the material and
Plutarch leads Finnick off for a chat probably to see if he
has any more stories Im left with Haymitch in the rubble
wondering if Finnicks fate would have one day been mine
Why not Snow could have gotten a really good price for
the girl on fire
Is that what happened to you I ask Haymitch
No My mother and younger brother My girl They
were all dead two weeks after I was crowned victor
Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field he
answers Snow had no one to use against me
Im surprised he didnt just kill you I say
Oh no I was the example The person to hold up to
the young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres Of what
could happen to a victor who caused problems says
Haymitch But he knew he had no leverage against me
Until Peeta and I came along I say softly I dont even
get a shrug in return
With our job done theres nothing left for Finnick and
me to do but wait We try to fill the dragging minutes in
Special Defense Tie knots Push our lunch around our
bowls Blow things up on the shooting range Because of
the danger of detection no communication comes from the
rescue team At 1500 the designated hour we stand
tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens and
computers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate
the airwaves His usual fidgety distraction is replaced with
a determination I have never seen Most of my interview
doesnt make the cut just enough to show I am alive and
still defiant It is Finnicks salacious and gory account of the
Capitol that takes the day Is Beetees skill improving Or
are his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated to
want to tune Finnick out For the next sixty minutes the
Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon
newscast Finnick and attempts to black it all out But the
rebel techno team manages to override even the latter and
in a real coup keeps control for almost the entire attack on
Snow
Let it go says Beetee throwing up his hands
relinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol He mops
his face with a cloth If theyre not out of there by now
theyre all dead He spins in his chair to see Finnick and
me reacting to his words It was a good plan though Did
Plutarch show it to you
Of course not Beetee takes us to another room and
shows us how the team with the help of rebel insiders will
attempt--has attempted--to free the victors from an
underground prison It seems to have involved knockout
gas distributed by the ventilation system a power failure
the detonation of a bomb in a government building several
miles from the prison and now the disruption of the
broadcast Beetees glad we find the plan hard to follow
because then our enemies will too
Like your electricity trap in the arena I ask
Exactly And see how well that worked out says
Beetee
Wellnot really I think
Finnick and I try to station ourselves in Command
where surely first word of the rescue will come but we are
barred because serious war business is being carried out
We refuse to leave Special Defense and end up waiting in
the hummingbird room for news
Making knots Making knots No word Making knots
Tick-tock This is a clock Do not think of Gale Do not think
of Peeta Making knots We do not want dinner Fingers
raw and bleeding Finnick finally gives up and assumes the
hunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjays
attacked I perfect my miniature noose The words of The
Hanging Tree replay in my head Gale and Peeta Peeta
and Gale
Did you love Annie right away Finnick I ask
No A long time passes before he adds She crept
up on me
I search my heart but at the moment the only person I
can feel creeping up on me is Snow
It must be midnight it must be tomorrow when
Haymitch pushes open the door Theyre back Were
wanted in the hospital My mouth opens with a flood of
questions that he cuts off with Thats all I know
I want to run but Finnicks acting so strange as if hes
lost the ability to move so I take his hand and lead him like
a small child Through Special Defense into the elevator
that goes this way and that and on to the hospital wing The
place is in an uproar with doctors shouting orders and the
wounded being wheeled through the halls in their beds
Were sideswiped by a gurney bearing an
unconscious emaciated young woman with a shaved head
Her flesh shows bruises and oozing scabs Johanna
Mason Who actually knew rebel secrets At least the one
