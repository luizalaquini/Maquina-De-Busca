Jarl was not fooled however He’s lying he told Styr Or else including those they lost on the Fist

Crow the Magnar warned do not take me for Mance Rayder If you lie to me I will have your tongue

I’m no crow and won’t be called a liar Jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand

The Magnar of Thenn studied Jon with his chilly grey eyes We shall learn their numbers soon enough he said after a moment Go I will send for you if I have further questions

Jon bowed his head stiffly and went If all the wildlings were like Styr it would be easier to betray them The Thenns were not like other free folk though The Magnar claimed to be the last of the First Men and ruled with an iron hand His little land of Thenn was a high mountain valley hidden amongst the northernmost peaks of the Frostfangs surrounded by cave dwellers Hornfoot men giants and the cannibal clans of the ice rivers Ygritte said the Thenns were savage fighters and that their Magnar was a god to them Jon could believe that Unlike Jarl and Harma and Rattleshirt Styr commanded absolute obedience from his men and that discipline was no doubt part of why Mance had chosen him to go over the Wall

He walked past the Thenns sitting atop their rounded bronze helms about their cookfires Where did Ygrette get herself to He found her gear and his together but no sign of the girl herself She took a torch and went off that way Grigg the Goat told him pointing toward the back of the cavern

Jon followed his finger and found himself in a dim back room wandering through a maze of columns and stalactites She can’t be here he was thinking when he heard her laugh He turned toward the sound but within ten paces he was in a dead end facing a blank wall of rose and white flowstone Baffled he made his way back the way he’d come and then he saw it a dark hole under an outthrust of wet stone He knelt listened heard the faint sound of water Ygritte

In here her voice came back echoing faintly

Jon had to crawl a dozen paces before the cave opened up around him When he stood again it took his eyes a moment to adjust Ygritte had brought a torch but there was no other light She stood beside a little waterfall that fell from a cleft in the rock down into a wide dark pool The orange and yellow flames shone against the pale green water

What are you doing here he asked her

I heard water I wanted t’see how deep the cave went She pointed with the torch There’s a passage goes down further I followed it a hundred paces before I turned back

A dead end

You know nothing Jon Snow It went on and on and on There are hundreds o’ caves in these hills and down deep they all connect There’s even a way under your Wall Gorne’s Way

Gorne said Jon Gorne was King-beyond-the-Wall

Aye said Ygritte Together with his brother Gendel three thousand years ago They led a host o’ free folk through the caves and the Watch was none the wiser But when they come out the wolves o’ Winterfell fell upon them

There was a battle Jon recalled Gorne slew the King in the North but his son picked up his banner and took the crown from his head and cut down Gorne in turn

And the sound o’ swords woke the crows in their castles and they rode out all in black to take the free folk in the rear

Yes Gendel had the king to the south the Umbers to the east and the Watch to the north of him He died as well

You know nothing Jon Snow Gendel did not die He cut his way free through the crows and led his people back north with the wolves howling at their heels Only Gendel did not know the caves as Gorne had and took a wrong turn She swept the torch back and forth so the shadows jumped and moved Deeper he went and deeper and when he tried t’ turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in stone rather than sky Soon his torches began t’ fail one by one till finally there was naught but dark Gendel’s folk were never seen again but on a still night you can hear their children’s children’s children sobbing under the hills still looking for the way back up Listen Do you hear them

All Jon could hear was the falling water and the faint crackle of flames This way under the Wall was lost as well

Some have searched for it Them that go too deep find Gendel’s children and Gendel’s children are always hungry Smiling she set the torch carefully in a notch of rock and came toward him There’s naught to eat in the dark but flesh she whispered biting at his neck

Jon nuzzled her hair and filled his nose with the smell of her You sound like Old Nan telling Bran a monster story

Ygritte punched his shoulder An old woman am I

You’re older than me

Aye and wiser You know nothing Jon Snow She pushed away from him and shrugged out of her rabbitskin vest

What are you doing

Showing you how old I am She unlaced her doeskin shirt tossed it aside pulled her three woolen undershirts up over her head all at once I want you should see me
