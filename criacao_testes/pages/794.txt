Nothing Bran shook his head I don’t know But he did I reached for him the way I reach for Summer He had been Hodor for half a heartbeat It scared him

Something is happening across the lake said Jojen I thought I saw a man pointing at the tower

I won’t be afraid He was the Prince of Winterfell Eddard Stark’s son almost a man grown and a warg too not some little baby boy like Rickon Summer would not be afraid Most like they’re just some Umbers he said Or they could be Knotts or Norreys or Flints come down from the mountains or even brothers from the Night’s Watch Were they wearing black cloaks Jojen

By night all cloaks are black Your Grace And the flash came and went too fast for me to tell what they were wearing

Meera was wary If they were black brothers they’d be mounted wouldn’t they

Bran had thought of something else It doesn’t matter he said confidently They couldn’t get out to us even if they wanted Not unless they had a boat or knew about the causeway

The causeway Meera mussed Bran’s hair and kissed him on the forehead Our sweet prince He’s right Jojen they won’t know about the causeway Even if they did they could never find the way across at night in the rain

The night will end though If they stay till morning… Jojen left the rest unsaid After a few moments he said They are feeding the fire the first man started Lightning crashed through the sky and light filled the tower and etched them all in shadow Hodor rocked back and forth humming

Bran could feel Summer’s fear in that bright instant He closed two eyes and opened a third and his boy’s skin slipped off him like a cloak as he left the tower behind…

…and found himself out in the rain his belly full of deer cringing in the brush as the sky broke and boomed above him The smell of rotten apples and wet leaves almost drowned the scent of man but it was there He heard the clink and slither of hardskin saw men moving under the trees A man with a stick blundered by a skin pulled up over his head to make him blind and deaf The wolf went wide around him behind a dripping thornbush and beneath the bare branches of an apple tree He could hear them talking and there beneath the scents of rain and leaves and horse came the sharp red stench of fear…





Jon


The ground was littered with pine needles and blown leaves a carpet of green and brown still damp from the recent rains It squished beneath their feet Huge bare oaks tall sentinels and hosts of soldier pines stood all around them On a hill above them was another roundtower ancient and empty thick green moss crawling up its side almost to the summit Who built that all of stone like that Ygritte asked him Some king

No Just the men who used to live here

What happened to them

They died or went away Brandon’s Gift had been farmed for thousands of years but as the Watch dwindled there were fewer hands to plow the fields tend the bees and plant the orchards so the wild had reclaimed many a field and hall In the New Gift there had been villages and holdfasts whose taxes rendered in goods and labor helped feed and clothe the black brothers But those were largely gone as well

They were fools to leave such a castle said Ygritte

It’s only a towerhouse Some little lordling lived there once with his family and a few sworn men When raiders came he would light a beacon from the roof Winterfell has towers three times the size of that

She looked as if she thought he was making that up How could men build so high with no giants to lift the stones

In legend Brandon the Builder had used giants to help raise Winterfell but Jon did not want to confuse the issue Men can build a lot higher than this In Oldtown there’s a tower taller than the Wall He could tell she did not believe him If I could show her Winterfell… give her a flower from the glass gardens feast her in the Great Hall and show her the stone kings on their thrones We could bathe in the hot pools and love beneath the heart tree while the old gods watched over us

The dream was sweet… but Winterfell would never be his to show It belonged to his brother the King in the North He was a Snow not a Stark Bastard oathbreaker and turncloak…

Might be after we could come back here and live in that tower she said Would you want that Jon Snow After

After The word was a spear thrust After the war After the conquest After the wildlings break the Wall…

His lord father had once talked about raising new lords and settling them in the abandoned holdfasts as a shield against wildlings The plan would have required the Watch to yield back a large part of the Gift but his uncle Benjen believed the Lord Commander could be won around so long as the new lordlings paid taxes to Castle Black rather than Winterfell It is a dream for spring though Lord Eddard had said Even the promise of land will not lure men north with a winter coming on

If winter had come and gone more quickly and spring had followed in its turn I might have been chosen to hold one of these towers in my father’s name Lord Eddard was dead however his brother Benjen lost the shield they dreamt together would never be forged This land belongs to the Watch Jon said
