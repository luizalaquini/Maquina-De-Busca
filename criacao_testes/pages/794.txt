2671 And when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him
and said unto them that were there This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth

2672 And again he denied with an oath I do not know the man

2673 And after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to
Peter Surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth
thee

2674 Then began he to curse and to swear saying I know not the man
And immediately the cock crew

2675 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him
Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice And he went out and
wept bitterly

271 When the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of
the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death 272 And
when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to
Pontius Pilate the governor

273 Then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was
condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders 274 Saying I have sinned in
that I have betrayed the innocent blood And they said What is that
to us see thou to that

275 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and
departed and went and hanged himself

276 And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said It is not
lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of
blood

277 And they took counsel and bought with them the potters field
to bury strangers in

278 Wherefore that field was called The field of blood unto this
day

279 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet
saying And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him
that was valued whom they of the children of Israel did value 2710
And gave them for the potters field as the Lord appointed me

2711 And Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him
saying Art thou the King of the Jews And Jesus said unto him Thou
sayest

2712 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he
answered nothing

2713 Then said Pilate unto him Hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee  2714 And he answered him to never a word
insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly

2715 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
people a prisoner whom they would

2716 And they had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas

2717 Therefore when they were gathered together Pilate said unto
them Whom will ye that I release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which
is called Christ  2718 For he knew that for envy they had delivered
him

2719 When he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto
him saying Have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him

2720 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
they should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus

2721 The governor answered and said unto them Whether of the twain
will ye that I release unto you They said Barabbas

2722 Pilate saith unto them What shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ They all say unto him Let him be crucified

2723 And the governor said Why what evil hath he done But they
cried out the more saying Let him be crucified

2724 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a
tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the
multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see
ye to it

2725 Then answered all the people and said His blood be on us and
on our children

2726 Then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged
Jesus he delivered him to be crucified

2727 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers

2728 And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
