When the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last Winterfell seemed deserted and dead Bran looked around at the faces of those who remained women and children and old men… and Hodor The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face Hodor he said sadly

Hodor Bran agreed wondering what it meant





DAENERYS

When he had taken his pleasure Khal Drogo rose from their sleeping mats to tower above her His skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad chest Ink-black hair loose and unbound cascaded over his shoulders and down his back well past his waist His manhood glistened wetly The khal’s mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs

Dany propped herself on an elbow to look up at him so tall and magnificent She loved his hair especially It had never been cut he had never known defeat It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth she said

The earth ends at the black salt sea Drogo answered at once He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin No horse can cross the poison water

In the Free Cities there are ships by the thousand Dany told him as she had told him before Wooden horses with a hundred legs that fly across the sea on wings full of wind

Khal Drogo did not want to hear it We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs He dropped the cloth and began to dress This day I will go to the grass and hunt woman wife he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver gold and bronze

Yes my sun-and-stars Dany said Drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar the great white lion of the plains If they returned triumphant her lord husband’s joy would be fierce and he might be willing to hear her out

Savage beasts he did not fear nor any man who had ever drawn breath but the sea was a different matter To the Dothraki water that a horse could not drink was something foul the heaving grey-green plains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways she had found… but not in this If only she could get him onto a ship…

After the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with their bows Dany summoned her handmaids Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands whereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her They scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk loose and flowing As Doreah combed out her hair she sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont

The knight came at once He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest like a rider Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms My princess How may I serve you

You must talk to my lord husband Dany said Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule and no need to cross the poison water He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea

The knight looked thoughtful The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms he said They are nothing to him If he thinks of them at all no doubt he thinks of islands a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys surrounded by stormy seas The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect

But he must ride west Dany said despairing Please help me make him understand She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either no more than Drogo yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day but he was dead now and his promises had died with him

The Dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons the knight answered Have patience Princess Do not make your brother’s mistake We will go home I promise you

Home The word made her feel sad Ser Jorah had his Bear Island but what was home to her A few tales names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer the fading memory of a red door… was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever When she looked at the crones of the dosh khaleen was she looking at her future

Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face A great caravan arrived during the night Khaleesi Four hundred horses from Pentos by way of Norvos and Qohor under the command of Merchant Captain Byan Votyris Illyrio may have sent a letter Would you care to visit the Western Market

Dany stirred Yes she said I would like that The markets came alive when a caravan had come in You could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time and it would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again as they did in the Free Cities Irri have them prepare a litter

I shall tell your khas Ser Jorah said withdrawing

If Khal Drogo had been with her Dany would have ridden her silver Among the Dothraki mothers stayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth and she did not want to seem weak in her husband’s eyes But with the khal off hunting it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun Ser Jorah saddled up and rode beside her with the four young men of her khas and her handmaids

The day was warm and cloudless the sky a deep blue When the wind blew she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments she went from sunlight to shadow and back again Dany swayed along studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings She wondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers

If I were not the blood of the dragon she thought wistfully this could be my home She was khaleesi she had a strong man and a swift horse handmaids to serve her warriors to keep her safe an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old… and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world That should be enough for any woman… but not for the dragon With Viserys gone Daenerys was the last the very last She was the seed of kings and conquerors and so too the child inside her She must not forget

The Western Market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens of mud-baked brick animal pens whitewashed drinking halls Hummocks rose from the ground like the backs of great subterranean beasts breaking the surface yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below The interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles shaded by awnings of woven grass

A hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany remembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other Ser Jorah had explained The riders let them come and go unmolested so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World and honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt silver and seed The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and selling

Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too with all its queer sights and sounds and smells She often spent her mornings there nibbling tree eggs locust pie and green noodles listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai She enjoyed watching all the people too dark solemn Asshai’i and tall pale Qartheen the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats warrior maids from Bayasabhad Shamyriana and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks even the dour and frightening Shadow Men who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks The Eastern Market was a place of wonder and magic for Dany

But the Western Market smelled of home

As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter she sniffed and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepper scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her face Under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys She saw slaves carrying bolts of intricate Myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors Caravan guards wandered among the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton empty scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts Behind one stall an armorer displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts Next to him was a pretty young woman selling Lannisport goldwork rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions suitable for belting A huge eunuch guarded her stall mute and hairless dressed in sweat-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close Across the aisle a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head

When I was a little girl I loved to play in the bazaar Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls It was so alive there all the people shouting and laughing so many wonderful things to look at… though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything… well except for a sausage now and again or honeyfingers… do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms the kind they bake in Tyrosh

Cakes are they I could not say Princess The knight bowed If you would pardon me for a time I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us

Very well I’ll help you find him

There is no need for you to trouble yourself Ser Jorah glanced away impatiently Enjoy the market I will rejoin you when my business is concluded

Curious Dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs She didn’t see why she should not go with him Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain Whores frequently traveled with the caravans she knew and some men were queerly shy about their couplings She gave a shrug Come she told the others

Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market Oh look she exclaimed to Doreah those are the kind of sausages I meant She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers Delighted with her discovery Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage Her handmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously They taste different than I remember Dany said after her first few bites

In Pentos I make them with pork the old woman said but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea These are made of horsemeat Khaleesi but I spice them the same

Oh Dany felt disappointed but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one and Rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more belching loudly Dany giggled

You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo said Irri It is good to see Khaleesi

Dany smiled shyly It was sweet to laugh She felt half a girl again

They wandered for half the morning She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles and took it for a gift In return she gave the merchant a silver medallion from her belt That was how it was done among the Dothraki A birdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say her name and Dany laughed again yet still refused to take him What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a khalasar She did take a dozen flasks of scented oils the perfumes of her childhood she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big house with the red door once more When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a magician’s booth Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid thinking that now she should find something for Irri and Jhiqui as well

Turning a corner they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized cups of his wares to the passersby Sweet reds he cried in fluent Dothraki I have sweet reds from Lys and Volantis and the Arbor Whites from Lys Tyroshi pear brandy firewine pepperwine the pale green nectars of Myr Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours I have them I have them He was a small man slender and handsome his flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys When Dany paused before his stall he bowed low A taste for the khaleesi I have a sweet red from Dorne my lady it sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak A cask a cup a swallow One taste and you will name your child after me

Dany smiled My son has his name but I will try your summerwine she said in Valyrian Valyrian as they spoke it in the Free Cities The words felt strange on her tongue after so long Just a taste if you would be so kind

The merchant must have taken her for Dothraki with her clothes and her oiled hair and sun-browned skin When she spoke he gaped at her in astonishment My lady you are… Tyroshi Can it be so

My speech may be Tyroshi and my garb Dothraki but I am of Westeros of the Sunset Kingdoms Dany told him

Doreah stepped up beside her You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen Daenerys Stormborn khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms

The wine merchant dropped to his knees Princess he said bowing his head

Rise Dany commanded him I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of

The man bounded to his feet That Dornish swill It is not worthy of a princess I have a dry red from the Arbor crisp and delectable Please let me give you a cask

Khal Drogo’s visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good wine and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him You honor me ser she murmured sweetly
