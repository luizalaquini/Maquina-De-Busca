I am not a child she told him I am a queen

Yet even queens can err The Astapori have cheated you Your Grace A dragon is worth more than any army Aegon proved that three hundred years ago upon the Field of Fire

I know what Aegon proved I mean to prove a few things of my own Dany turned away from him to the slave girl standing meekly beside her litter Do you have a name or must you draw a new one every day from some barrel

That is only for Unsullied the girl said Then she realized the question had been asked in High Valyrian Her eyes went wide Oh

Your name is Oh

No Your Grace forgive this one her outburst Your slave’s name is Missandei but…

Missandei is no longer a slave I free you from this instant Come ride with me in the litter I wish to talk Rakharo helped them in and Dany drew the curtains shut against the dust and heat If you stay with me you will serve as one of my handmaids she said as they set off I shall keep you by my side to speak for me as you spoke for Kraznys But you may leave my service whenever you choose if you have father or mother you would sooner return to

This one will stay the girl said This one… I… there is no place for me to go This… I will serve you gladly

I can give you freedom but not safety Dany warned I have a world to cross and wars to fight You may go hungry You may grow sick You may be killed

Valar morghulis said Missandei in High Valyrian

All men must die Dany agreed but not for a long while we may pray She leaned back on the pillows and took the girl’s hand Are these Unsullied truly fearless

Yes Your Grace

You serve me now Is it true they feel no pain

The wine of courage kills such feelings By the time they slay their sucklings they have been drinking it for years

And they are obedient

Obedience is all they know If you told them not to breathe they would find that easier than not to obey

Dany nodded And when I am done with them

Your Grace

When I have won my war and claimed the throne that was my father’s my knights will sheathe their swords and return to their keeps to their wives and children and mothers… to their lives But these eunuchs have no lives What am I to do with eight thousand eunuchs when there are no more battles to be fought

The Unsullied make flne guards and excellent watchmen Your Grace said Missandei And it is never hard to find a buyer for such fine well-blooded troops

Men are not bought and sold in Westeros they tell me

With all respect Your Grace Unsullied are not men

If I did resell them how would I know they could not be used against me Dany asked pointedly Would they do that Fight against me even do me harm

If their master commanded They do not question Your Grace All the questions have been culled from them They obey She looked troubled When you are… when you are done with them… your Grace might command them to fall upon their swords

And even that they would do

Yes Missandei’s voice had grown soft Your Grace

Dany squeezed her hand You would sooner I did not ask it of them though Why is that Why do you care

This one does not… I… Your Grace…

Tell me

The girl lowered her eyes Three of them were my brothers once Your Grace

Then I hope your brothers are as brave and clever as you Dany leaned back into her pillow and let the litter bear her onward back to Balerion one last time to set her world in order And back to Drogon Her mouth set grimly

It was a long dark windy night that followed Dany fed her dragons as she always did but found she had no appetite herself She cried awhile alone in her cabin then dried her tears long enough for yet another argument with Groleo Magister Illyrio is not here she finally had to tell him and if he was he could not sway me either I need the Unsullied more than I need these ships and I will hear no more about it

The anger burned the grief and fear from her for a few hours at the least Afterward she called her bloodriders to her cabin with Ser Jorah They were the only ones she truly trusted

She meant to sleep afterward to be well rested for the morrow but an hour of restless tossing in the stuffy confines of the cabin soon convinced her that was hopeless Outside her door she found Aggo fitting a new string to his bow by the light of a swinging oil lamp Rakharo sat crosslegged on the deck beside him sharpening his arakh with a whetstone Dany told them both to keep on with what they were doing and went up on deck for a taste of the cool night air The crew left her alone as they went about their business but Ser Jorah soon joined her by the rail He is never far Dany thought He knows my moods too well

Khaleesi You ought to be asleep Tomorrow will be hot and hard I promise you You’ll need your strength

Do you remember Eroeh she asked him

The Lhazareen girl

They were raping her but I stopped them and took her under my protection Only when my sun-and-stars was dead Mago took her back used her again and killed her Aggo said it was her fate

I remember Ser Jorah said

I was alone for a long time Jorah All alone but for my brother I was such a small scared thing Viserys should have protected me but instead he hurt me and scared me worse He shouldn’t have done that He wasn’t just my brother he was my king Why do the gods make kings and queens if not to protect the ones who can’t protect themselves

Some kings make themselves Robert did

He was no true king Dany said scornfully He did no justice Justice… that’s what kings are for

Ser Jorah had no answer He only smiled and touched her hair so lightly It was enough

That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar riding to the Trident But she was mounted on a dragon not a horse When she saw the Usurper’s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming but another part exulted This is how it was meant to be The other was a nightmare and I have only now awakened

She woke suddenly in the darkness of her cabin still flush with triumph Balerion seemed to wake with her and she heard the faint creak of wood water lapping against the hull a footfall on the deck above her head And something else

Someone was in the cabin with her

Irri Jhiqui Where are you Her handmaids did not respond It was too black to see but she could hear them breathing Jorah is that you

They sleep a woman said They all sleep The voice was very close Even dragons must sleep

She is standing over me Who’s there Dany peered into the darkness She thought she could see a shadow the faintest outline of a shape What do you want of me

Remember To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow
