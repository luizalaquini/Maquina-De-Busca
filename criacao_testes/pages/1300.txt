Theon felt as though he were drowning Why am I surprised he thought bleakly His father had forsaken him his uncles his sister even that wretched creature Reek Why should his men prove any more loyal There was nothing to say nothing to do He could only stand there beneath the great grey walls and the hard white sky sword in hand waiting waiting…

Wex was the first to cross the line Three quick steps and he stood at Theon’s side slouching Shamed by the boy Black Lorren followed all scowls Who else he demanded Red Rolfe came forward Kromm Werlag Tymor and his brothers Ulf the Ill Harrag Sheepstealer Four Harlaws and two Botleys Kenned the Whale was the last Seventeen in all

Urzen was among those who did not move and Stygg and every man of the ten that Asha had brought from Deepwood Motte Go then Theon told them Run to my sister She’ll give you all a warm welcome I have no doubt

Stygg had the grace at least to look ashamed The rest moved off without a word Theon turned to the seventeen who remained Back to the walls If the gods should spare us I shall remember every man of you

Black Lorren stayed when the others had gone The castle folk will turn on us soon as the fight begins

I know that What would you have me do

Put them out said Lorren Every one

Theon shook his head Is the noose ready

It is You mean to use it

Do you know a better way

Aye I’ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge and let them come try me One at a time two three it makes no matter None will pass the moat while I still draw breath

He means to die thought Theon It’s not victory he wants it’s an end worthy of a song We’ll use the noose

As you say Lorren replied contempt in his eyes

Wex helped garb him for battle Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt of well-oiled ringmail and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather Once armed and armored Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at his doom The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle It was hard to judge their numbers A thousand at least perhaps twice that many Against seventeen They’d brought catapults and scorpions He saw no siege towers rumbling up the kingsroad but there was timber enough in the wolfswood to build as many as were required

Theon studied their banners through Maester Luwin’s Myrish lens tube The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever he looked and there were Tallhart trees as well and mermen from White Harbor Less common were the sigils of Flint and Karstark Here and there he even saw the bull moose of the Hornwoods But no Glovers Asha saw to them no Boltons from the Dreadfort no Umbers come down from the shadow of the Wall Not that they were needed Soon enough the boy Cley Cerwyn appeared before the gates carrying a peace banner on a tall staff to announce that Ser Rodrik Cassel wished to parley with Theon Turncloak

Turncloak The name was bitter as bile He had gone to Pyke to lead his father’s longships against Lannisport he remembered I shall be out shortly he shouted down Alone

Black Lorren disapproved Only blood can wash out blood he declared Knights may keep their truces with other knights but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing with those they deem outlaw

Theon bristled I am the Prince of Winterfell and heir to the Iron Islands Now go find the girl and do as I told you

Black Lorren gave him a murderous look Aye Prince

He’s turned against me too Theon realized Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones of Winterfell had turned against him If I die I die friendless and abandoned What choice did that leave him but to live

He rode to the gatehouse with his crown on his head A woman was drawing water from the well and Gage the cook stood in the door of the kitchens They hid their hatred behind sullen looks and faces blank as slate yet he could feel it all the same

When the drawbridge was lowered a chill wind sighed across the moat The touch of it made him shiver It is the cold nothing more Theon told himself a shiver not a tremble Even brave men shiver Into the teeth of that wind he rode under the portcullis over the drawbridge The outer gates swung open to let him pass As he emerged beneath the walls he could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been

Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding Beside him the direwolf of Stark flapped from a staff borne by young Cley Cerwyn They were alone in the square though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses spearmen to his right and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly Every one of them wants me dead Some were boys he’d drunk with diced with even wenched with but that would not save him if he fell into their hands

Ser Rodrik Theon reined to a halt It grieves me that we must meet as foes

My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you The old knight spat onto the muddy ground Theon Turncloak

I am a Greyjoy of Pyke Theon reminded him The cloak my father swaddled me in bore a kraken not a direwolf

For ten years you have been a ward of Stark

Hostage and prisoner I call it

Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall Instead he raised you among his own sons the sweet boys you have butchered and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead of placing one in your hand

I came out to parley not to suffer your insults Say what you have to say old man What would you have of me

Two things the old man said Winterfell and your life Command your men to open the gates and lay down their arms Those who murdered no children shall be free to walk away but you shall be held for King Robb’s justice May the gods take pity on you when he returns

Robb will never look on Winterfell again Theon promised He will break himself on Moat Cailin as every southron army has done for ten thousand years We hold the north now ser

You hold three castles replied Ser Rodrik and this one I mean to take back Turncloak

Theon ignored that Here are my terms You have until evenfall to disperse Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be confirmed in their rights and properties and suffer no harm Those who defy us will be destroyed

Young Cerwyn was incredulous Are you mad Greyjoy

Ser Rodrik shook his head Only vain lad Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of himself I fear The old man jabbed a finger at him Do not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight his way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you I have near two thousand men with me… and if the tales be true you have no more than fifty

Seventeen in truth Theon made himself smile I have something better than men And he raised a fist over his head the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for

The walls of Winterfell were behind him but Ser Rodrik faced them squarely and could not fail to see Theon watched his face When his chin quivered under those stiff white whiskers he knew just what the old man was seeing He is not surprised he thought with sadness but the fear is there

This is craven Ser Rodrik said To use a child so… this is despicable

Oh I know said Theon It’s a dish I tasted myself or have you forgotten I was ten when I was taken from my father’s house to make certain he would raise no more rebellions

It is not the same

Theon’s face was impassive The noose I wore was not made of hempen rope that’s true enough but I felt it all the same And it chafed Ser Rodrik It chafed me raw He had never quite realized that until now but as the words came spilling out he saw the truth of them

No harm was ever done you

And no harm will be done your Beth so long as you—

Ser Rodrik never gave him the chance to finish Viper the knight declared his face red with rage beneath those white whiskers I gave you the chance to save your men and die with some small shred of honor Turncloak I should have known that was too much to ask of a childkiller His hand went to the hilt of his sword I ought cut you down here and now and put an end to your lies and deceits By the gods I should

Theon did not fear a doddering old man but those watching archers and that line of knights were a different matter If the swords came out his chances of getting back to the castle alive were small to none Forswear your oath and murder me and you will watch your little Beth strangle at the end of a rope

Ser Rodrik’s knuckles had gone white but after a moment he took his hand off the swordhilt Truly I have lived too long

I will not disagree ser Will you accept my terms

I have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark

And your own House Beth is the last of your blood
