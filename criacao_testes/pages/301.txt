Yoren spat Happens I got thirty

The gold cloak laughed This lot said a big lout with a broken nose Who’s first he shouted showing his steel

Tarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay I am

No I am called Cutjack the plump stonemason pulling his hammer off the leather apron he always wore

Me Kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand

Me and him Koss strung his longbow

All of us said Reysen snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried

Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle saw what was happening and dropped everything but his dagger Is it a fight he asked

I guess said Hot Pie scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw Arya could not believe what she was seeing She hated Hot Pie Why would he risk himself for her

The one with the broken nose still thought it was funny You girls put away them rocks and sticks before you get spanked None of you knows what end of a sword to hold

I do Arya wouldn’t let them die for her like Syrio She wouldn’t Shoving through the hedge with Needle in hand she slid into a water dancer’s stance

Broken Nose guffawed The officer looked her up and down Put the blade away little girl no one wants to hurt you

I’m not a girl she yelled furious What was wrong with them They rode all this way for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her I’m the one you want

He’s the one we want The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull who’d come forward to stand beside her Praed’s cheap steel in his hand

But it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren even for an instant Quick as that the black brother’s sword was pressed to the apple of the officer’s throat Neither’s the one you get less you want me to see if your apple’s ripe yet I got me ten fifteen more brothers in that inn if you still need convincing I was you I’d let loose of that gutcutter spread my cheeks over that fat little horse and gallop on back to the city He spat and poked harder with the point of his sword Now

The officer’s fingers uncurled His sword fell in the dust

We’ll just keep that Yoren said Good steel’s always needed on the Wall

As you say For now Men The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up You’d best scamper up to that Wall of yours in a hurry old man The next time I catch you I believe I’ll have your head to go with the bastard boy’s

Better men than you have tried Yoren slapped the rump of the officer’s horse with the flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad His men followed

When they were out of sight Hot Pie began to whoop but Yoren looked angrier than ever Fool You think he’s done with us Next time he won’t prance up and hand me no damn ribbon Get the rest out o’ them baths we need to be moving Ride all night maybe we can stay ahead o’ them for a bit He scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped Who wants this

Me Hot Pie yelled

Don’t be using it on Arry He handed the boy the sword hilt first and walked over to Arya but it was the Bull he spoke to Queen wants you bad boy

Arya was lost Why should she want him

The Bull scowled at her Why should she want you You’re nothing but a little gutter rat

Well you’re nothing but a bastard boy Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy What’s your true name

Gendry he said like he wasn’t quite sure

Don’t see why no one wants neither o’ you Yoren said but they can’t have you regardless You ride them two coursers First sight of a gold cloak make for the Wall like a dragon’s on your tail The rest o’ us don’t mean spit to them
