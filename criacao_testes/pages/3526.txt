The Others take your pigeon the pushcart man said

The tarts were still warm from the oven The smells were making her mouth water but she did not have three coppers… or one She gave the pushcart man a look remembering what Syrio had told her about seeing He was short with a little round belly and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said You be keepin’ your filthy hands off The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats that they do

Arya glanced warily behind her Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley Their cloaks hung almost to the ground the heavy wool dyed a rich gold their mail and boots and gloves were black One wore a longsword at his hip the other an iron cudgel With a last wistful glance at the tarts Arya edged back from the cart and hurried off The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots Arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head thick as flies The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters their commander raised to a lord with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king’s council

She had also heard other things scary things things that made no sense to her Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly Others insisted that Renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting another that he’d died eating a boar stuffing himself so full that he’d ruptured at the table No the king had died at table others said but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him No it had been the queen who poisoned him No he had died of a pox No he had choked on a fish bone

One thing all the stories agreed on King Robert was dead The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king a tanner’s boy told Arya

All she wanted was to go home but leaving King’s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped Talk of war was on every lip and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on… well her for one She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom on rooftops and in stables wherever she could find a place to lie down and it hadn’t taken her long to learn that the district was well named

Every day since her escape from the Red Keep Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn The Dragon Gate the Lion Gate and the Old Gate were closed and barred The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open but only to those who wanted to enter the city the guards let no one out Those who were allowed to leave left by the King’s Gate or the Iron Gate but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King’s Gate Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages forcing riders to open their saddlebags and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot

Sometimes she thought about swimming the river but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship

Her lord father had taught her never to steal but it was growing harder to remember why If she did not get out soon she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks She hadn’t gone hungry much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick A couple she’d eaten raw before she found Flea Bottom

In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday’s bread and a bowl o’ brown and they’d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you so long as you plucked the feathers yourself Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake but the brown wasn’t so bad It usually had barley in it and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip and sometimes even apple with a film of grease swimming on top Mostly she tried not to think about the meat Once she had gotten a piece of fish

The only thing was the pot-shops were never empty and even as she bolted down her food Arya could feel them watching Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak and she knew what they were thinking With others she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers she didn’t know what they were thinking and that scared her even more A couple times she was followed out into the alleys and chased but so far no one had been able to catch her

The silver bracelet she’d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle along with her bundle of good clothes snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in the leathers on her back her wooden practice sword… and Needle She’d been lying on top of Needle or else it would have been gone too it was worth more than all the rest together Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm to conceal the blade at her hip The wooden sword she carried in her left hand out where everybody could see it to scare off robbers but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn’t have been scared off if she’d had a battle-axe It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread Often as not she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares

Once she was outside the city she would find berries to pick or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south And she could dig for roots in the forest even run down some rabbits In the city the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups she’d heard but she didn’t like to think about that

Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets Arya scrambled through the crowds trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks She had learned to keep to the center of the street Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses but at least you could see them coming If you walked near the buildings people grabbed you In some alleys you couldn’t help but brush against the walls the buildings leaned in so close they almost met

A whooping gang of small children went running past chasing a rolling hoop Arya stared at them with resentment remembering the times she’d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon She wondered how big Rickon had grown and whether Bran was sad She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her little sister and muss her hair Not that it needed mussing She’d seen her reflection in puddles and she didn’t think hair got any more mussed than hers

She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep but she must have talked wrong or something The little ones only looked at her with quick wary eyes and ran away if she came too close Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn’t answer called her names and tried to steal from her Only yesterday a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding

A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom Arya glanced at it thoughtfully but it was well beyond the reach of her stick It made her think of the sea Maybe that was the way out Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures Maybe Arya could do that too She decided to visit the riverfront It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway and she hadn’t checked that one today

The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there She spied another pair of gold cloaks walking side by side through the fish market but they never so much as looked at her Half the stalls were empty and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered Out on the Blackwater three of the king’s war galleys moved in formation gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell Arya watched them for a bit then began to make her way along the river

When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin her heart almost stopped in her chest The sight of Winterfell’s colors brought tears to her eyes Behind them a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings Arya could not read the name painted on the hull the words were strange Myrish Braavosi perhaps even High Valyrian She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve Please she said what ship is this

She’s the Wind Witch out of Myr the man said

She’s still here Arya blurted The longshoreman gave her a queer look shrugged and walked away Arya ran toward the pier The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home… still waiting She’d imagined it had sailed ages ago

Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds his hand on the pommel of his sword Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby she stopped to rub at her eyes Her eyes her eyes her eyes why did…

Look with your eyes she heard Syrio whisper

Arya looked She knew all of her father’s men The three in the grey cloaks were strangers You the one walking rounds called out What do you want here boy The other two looked up from their dice

It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run but she knew that if she did they would be after her at once She made herself walk closer They were looking for a girl but he thought she was a boy She’d be a boy then Want to buy a pigeon She showed him the dead bird

Get out of here the guardsman said

Arya did as he told her She did not have to pretend to be frightened Behind her the men went back to their dice

She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills The Bottom had a stench to it a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner’s sheds mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses Arya wound her way through the maze dully It was not until she caught a whiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone It must have slipped from her belt as she ran or someone had stolen it and she’d never noticed For a moment she wanted to cry again She’d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that plump

Far across the city bells began to ring

Arya glanced up listening wondering what the ringing meant this time

What’s this now a fat man called from the pot-shop

The bells again gods ha’mercy wailed an old woman

A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window Is it the boy king that’s died now she shouted down leaning out over the street Ah that’s a boy for you they never last long As she laughed a naked man slid his arms around her from behind biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift

Stupid slut the fat man shouted up The king’s not dead that’s only summoning bells One tower tolling When the king dies they ring every bell in the city

Here quit your biting or I’ll ring your bells the woman in the window said to the man behind her pushing him off with an elbow So who is it died if not the king

It’s a summoning the fat man repeated

Two boys close to Arya’s age scampered past splashing through a puddle The old woman cursed them but they kept right on going Other people were moving too heading up the hill to see what the noise was about Arya ran after the slower boy Where you going she shouted when she was right behind him What’s happening

He glanced back without slowing The gold cloaks is carryin’ him to the sept

Who she yelled running hard

The Hand They’ll be taking his head off Buu says

A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street The boy leapt over but Arya never saw it She tripped and fell face first scraping her knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth Needle tangled between her legs She sobbed as she struggled to her knees The thumb of her left hand was covered with blood When she sucked on it she saw that half the thumbnail was gone ripped off in her fall Her hands throbbed and her knee was all bloody too

Make way someone shouted from the cross street Make way for my lords of Redwyne It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down four guardsmen on huge horses pounding past at a gallop They wore checked cloaks blue-and-burgundy Behind them two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod Arya had seen them in the bailey a hundred times the Redwyne twins Ser Horas and Ser Hobber homely youths with orange hair and square freckled faces Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber and giggle whenever they caught sight of them They did not look funny now

Everyone was moving in the same direction all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about The bells seemed louder now clanging calling Arya joined the stream of people Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry She bit her lip as she limped along listening to the excited voices around her

—the King’s Hand Lord Stark They’re carrying him up to Baelor’s Sept

I heard he was dead

Soon enough soon enough Here I got me a silver stag says they lop his head off

Past time the traitor The man spat

Arya struggled to find a voice He never— she started but she was only a child and they talked right over her

Fool They ain’t neither going to lop him Since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the Great Sept

Well they don’t mean to anoint him no knight I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert Slit his throat in the woods and when they found him he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace
