He had thought that might reassure her but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes Will the city fall

No But if it does pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father to march to our relief

You’ve lied to me before Tyrion

Always with good reason sweet sister I want amity between us as much as you do I’ve decided to release Lord Gyles He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture You can have Ser Boros Blount back as well

The queen’s mouth tightened Ser Boros can rot at Rosby she said but Tommen—

—stays where he is He’s safer under Lord Jacelyn’s protection than he would ever have been with Lord Gyles

Serving men cleared away the swan hardly touched Cersei beckoned for the sweet I hope you like blackberry tarts

I love all sorts of tarts

Oh I’ve known that a long while Do you know why Varys is so dangerous

Are we playing at riddles now No

He doesn’t have a cock

Neither do you And don’t you just hate that Cersei

Perhaps I’m dangerous too You on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man That worm between your legs does half your thinking

Tyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers He did not like his sister’s smile Yes and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave

Are you unwell brother She leaned forward giving him a good look at the top of her breasts Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered

Flustered Tyrion glanced at the door He thought he’d heard something outside He was beginning to regret coming here alone You’ve never shown much interest in my cock before

It’s not your cock that interests me so much as what you stick it in I don’t depend on the eunuch for everything as you do I have my own ways of finding out things    especially things that people don’t want me to know

What are you trying to say

Only this—I have your little whore

Tyrion reached for his wine cup buying a moment to gather his thoughts I thought men were more to your taste

You’re such a droll little fellow Tell me have you married this one yet When he gave her no answer she laughed and said Father will be ever so relieved

His belly felt as if it were full of eels How had she found Shae Had Varys betrayed him Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed

A Lannister always pays his debts she said You’ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King’s Landing You sold Myrcella stole Tommen and now you plot to have Joff killed You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen

Well I can’t say the notion isn’t tempting This is madness Cersei Stannis will be here in days You need me

For what Your great prowess in battle

Bronn’s sellswords will never fight without me he lied

Oh I think they will It’s your gold they love not your impish wit Have no fear though they won’t be without you I won’t say I haven’t thought of slitting your throat from time to time but Jaime would never forgive me if I did

And the whore He would not call her by name If I can convince her Shae means nothing to me perhaps   

She’ll be treated gently enough so long as no harm comes to my sons If Joff should be killed however or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies your little cunt will die more painfully than you can possibly imagine

She truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew The boys are safe he promised her wearily Gods be good Cersei they’re my own blood What sort of man do you take me for

A small and twisted one

Tyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of his wine cup What would Jaime do in my place Kill the bitch most likely and worry about the consequences afterward But Tyrion did not have a golden sword nor the skill to wield one He loved his brother’s reckless wrath but it was their lord father he must try and emulate Stone I must be stone I must be Casterly Rock hard and unmovable If I fail this test I had as lief seek out the nearest grotesquerie For all I know you’ve killed her already he said

Would you like to see her I thought you might Cersei crossed the room and threw open the heavy oaken door Bring in my brother’s whore

Ser Osmund’s brothers Osney and Osfryd were peas from the same pod tall men with hooked noses dark hair and cruel smiles She hung between them eyes wide and white in her dark face Blood trickled from her broken lip and he could see bruises through her torn clothing Her hands were bound with rope and they’d gagged her so she could not speak

You said she wouldn’t be hurt

She fought Unlike his brothers Osney Kettleblack was clean-shaven so the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks Got claws like a shadowcat this one

Bruises heal said Cersei in a bored tone The whore will live So long as Joff does

Tyrion wanted to laugh at her It would have been so sweet so very very sweet but it would have given the game away You’ve lost Cersei and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed All he needed to do was say the words

Instead he looked at the girl’s face and said You swear you’ll release her after the battle

If you release Tommen yes

He pushed himself to his feet Keep her then but keep her safe If these animals think they can use her    well sweet sister let me point out that a scale tips two ways His tone was calm flat uncaring he’d reached for his father’s voice and found it Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well and that includes the beatings and rapes If she thinks me such a monster I’ll play the part for her

Cersei had not expected that You would not dare

Tyrion made himself smile slow and cold Green and black his eyes laughed at her Dare I’ll do it myself

His sister’s hand flashed at his face but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out Osfryd moved to her rescue One more step and I’ll break her arm the dwarf warned him The man stopped You remember when I said you’d never hit me again Cersei He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks Untie her and remove that gag

The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands She cried out in pain as the circulation returned Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned Sweetling he said you must be brave I am sorry they hurt you

I know you’ll free me my lord

I will he promised and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow Her broken lips left a smear of blood on his forehead A bloody kiss is more than I deserve Tyrion thought She would never have been hurt but for me

Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen I have never liked you Cersei but you were my own sister so I never did you harm You’ve ended that I will hurt you for this I don’t know how yet but give me time A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you’ll know the debt is paid

In war his father had told him once the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees No matter that they’re as numerous as they were a moment before still armed and armored once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again So it was with Cersei Get out was all the answer she could summon Get out of my sight

Tyrion bowed Good night then And pleasant dreams
