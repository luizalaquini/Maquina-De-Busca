heart
Coin smiles Of course And Ill make sure he knows
about the Games
Thank you I say
People sweep into the room surround me The last
touch of powder the instructions from Plutarch as Im
guided to the front doors of the mansion The City Circle
runs over spills people down the side streets The others
take their places outside Guards Officials Rebel leaders
Victors I hear the cheers that indicate Coin has appeared
on the balcony Then Effie taps my shoulder and I step out
into the cold winter sunlight Walk to my position
accompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd As
directed I turn so they see me in profile and wait When
they march Snow out the door the audience goes insane
They secure his hands behind a post which is
unnecessary Hes not going anywhere Theres nowhere to
go This is not the roomy stage before the Training Center
but the narrow terrace in front of the presidents mansion
No wonder no one bothered to have me practice Hes ten
yards away
I feel the bow purring in my hand Reach back and
grasp the arrow Position it aim at the rose but watch his
face He coughs and a bloody dribble runs down his chin
His tongue flicks over his puffy lips I search his eyes for the
slightest sign of anything fear remorse anger But theres
only the same look of amusement that ended our last
conversation Its as if hes speaking the words again Oh
my dear Miss Everdeen I thought we had agreed not to
lie to each other
Hes right We did
The point of my arrow shifts upward I release the
string And President Coin collapses over the side of the
balcony and plunges to the ground Dead
27
In the stunned reaction that follows Im aware of one
sound Snows laughter An awful gurgling cackle
accompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when the
coughing begins I see him bend forward spewing out his
life until the guards block him from my sight
As the gray uniforms begin to converge on me I think
of what my brief future as the assassin of Panems new
president holds The interrogation probable torture certain
public execution Having yet again to say my final
goodbyes to the handful of people who still maintain a hold
on my heart The prospect of facing my mother who will
now be entirely alone in the world decides it
Good night I whisper to the bow in my hand and feel
it go still I raise my left arm and twist my neck down to rip
off the pill on my sleeve Instead my teeth sink into flesh I
yank my head back in confusion to find myself looking into
Peetas eyes only now they hold my gaze Blood runs from
the teeth marks on the hand he clamped over my nightlock
Let me go I snarl at him trying to wrest my arm from his
grasp
I cant he says As they pull me away from him I feel
the pocket ripped from my sleeve see the deep violet pill
fall to the ground watch Cinnas last gift get crunched under
a guards boot I transform into a wild animal kicking
clawing biting doing whatever I can to free myself from this
web of hands as the crowd pushes in The guards lift me up
above the fray where I continue to thrash as Im conveyed
over the crush of people I start screaming for Gale I cant
find him in the throng but he will know what I want A good
clean shot to end it all Only theres no arrow no bullet Is it
possible he cant see me No Above us on the giant
screens placed around the City Circle everyone can watch
the whole thing being played out He sees he knows but
he doesnt follow through Just as I didnt when he was
captured Sorry excuses for hunters and friends Both of us
Im on my own
In the mansion they handcuff and blindfold me Im half
dragged half carried down long passages up and down
elevators and deposited on a carpeted floor The cuffs are
removed and a door slams closed behind me When I push
the blindfold up I find Im in my old room at the Training
Center The one where I lived during those last precious
days before my first Hunger Games and the Quarter Quell
The beds stripped to the mattress the closet gapes open
showing the emptiness inside but Id know this room
anywhere
Its a struggle to get to my feet and peel off my
Mockingjay suit Im badly bruised and might have a broken
finger or two but its my skin thats paid most dearly for my
struggle with the guards The new pink stuff has shredded
like tissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratorygrown
cells No medics show up though and as Im too far
gone to care I crawl up onto the mattress expecting to
bleed to death
No such luck By evening the blood clots leaving me
stiff and sore and sticky but alive I limp into the shower and
program in the gentlest cycle I can remember free of any
soaps and hair products and squat under the warm spray
elbows on my knees head in my hands
My name is Katniss Everdeen Why am I not dead I
should be dead It would be best for everyone if I were
dead
When I step out on the mat the hot air bakes my
damaged skin dry Theres nothing clean to put on Not
even a towel to wrap around me Back in the room I find
