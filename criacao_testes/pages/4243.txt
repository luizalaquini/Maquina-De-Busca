I was no more to her than a morsel of scroffin the fuei
house
I must go and find her out at once -- O yes I see
that-i must go Oak is head man still isnt he
Yes a blieve And at Little Weatherbury Farm
too He manages everything
Twill puzzle him to manage her or any other man
of his compass
I dont know about that She cant do without
him and knowing it well hes pretty independent
And sheve a few soft corners to her mind though
Ive never been able to get into one the devils int
Ah baily shes a notch above you and you must
own it a higher class of animai-a finer tissue How+
ever stick to me and neither this haughty goddess
dashing piece of womanhood Juno-wife of mine Juno
was a goddess you know nor
P 424
anybody else shall hurt
you But all this wants looking into I perceive
What with one thing and another I see that my work
is well cut out for me

How do I look to-night Liddy said Bathsheba
giving a final adjustment to her dress before leaving the
glass
I never saw you look so well before Yes-ill tell
you when you looked like it -- that night a year and a
half ago when you came in so wildiike and scolded us
for making remarks about you and Mr Troy
Everybody will think that I am setting myself to
captivate Mr Boldwood I suppose she murmured
At least theyll say so Cant my hair be brushed
down a little flatter I dread going -- yet I dread the
risk of wounding him by staying away
Anyhow maam you cant well be dressed plainer
than you are unless you go in sackcloth at once Tis
your excitement is what makes you look so noticeable
to-night
I dont know whats the matter I feel wretched at
one time and buoyant at another I wish I could have
continued quite alone as I have been for the last year
or so with no hopes and no fears and no pleasure and
no grief
Now just suppose Mr Boldwood should ask you
 -- only just suppose it -- to run away with him what
would you do maam
Liddy -- none of that said Bathsheba gravely
Mind I wont hear joking on any such matter Do
you hear
I beg pardon maam But knowing what rum
things we women be I just said -- however I wont
speak of it again
No marrying for me yet for many a year if ever
twill be for reasons very very different from those you
think or others will believe Now get my cloak for it
is time to go
                        VI
Oak said Boldwood before you go I want to
mention what has been passing in my mind lately --
that little arrangement we made about your share in the
farm I mean That share is small too small consider+
ing how little I attend to business now and how much
time and thought you give to it Well
P 425
since the world
is brightening for me I want to show my sense of it
by increasing yopur proportion in the partnership Ill
make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck
me as likely to be convenient for I havent time to talk
about it now and then well discuss it at our leisure
My intention is ultimately to retire from the manage+
ment altogether and until you can take all the expendi+
ture upon your shoulders Ill be a sleeping partner in
the stock Then if I marry her -- and I hope-i feel I
shall why --  -- 
Pray dont speak of it sir said Oak hastily We
dont know what may happen So many upsets may
befall ee Theres many a slip as they say -- and I
would advise you-i know youll pardon me this once --
not to be 1too sure1
I know I know But the feeling I have about in+
creasing your share is on account of what I know of you
Oak I have learnt a little about your secret your
interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an em+
ployer But you have behaved like a man and I as a
sort of successful rivai-successful partly through your
goodness of heart -- should like definitely to show my
sense of your friendship under what must have been a
great pain to you
O thats not necessary thank ee said Oak
hurriedly I must get used to such as that other
men have and so shall I
Oak then left him He was uneasy on Boldwoods
account for he saw anew that this constant passion
of the farmer made him not the man he once had
been
As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone --
ready and dressed to receive his company -- the mood of
anxiety about his appearance seemed to pass away and
