You forgave the old man…

He lied to me about his name You sold my secrets to the men who killed my father and stole my brother’s throne

I protected you I fought for you Killed for you

Kissed me she thought betrayed me

I went down into the sewers like a rat For you

It might have been kinder if you’d died there Dany said nothing There was nothing to say

Daenerys he said I have loved you

And there it was Three treasons will you know Once for blood and once for gold and once for love The gods do nothing without a purpose they say You did not die in battle so it must be they still have some use for you But I don’t I will not have you near me You are banished ser Go back to your masters in King’s Landing and collect your pardon if you can Or to Astapor No doubt the butcher king needs knights

No He reached for her Daenerys please hear me…

She slapped his hand away Do not ever presume to touch me again or to speak my name You have until dawn to collect your things and leave this city If you’re found in Meereen past break of day I will have Strong Belwas twist your head off I will Believe that She turned her back on him her skirts swirling I cannot bear to see his face Remove this liar from my sight she commanded I must not weep I must not If I weep I will forgive him Strong Belwas seized Ser Jorah by the arm and dragged him out When Dany glanced back the knight was walking as if drunk stumbling and slow She looked away until she heard the doors open and close Then she sank back onto the ebony bench He’s gone then My father and my mother my brothers Ser Willem Darry Drogo who was my sun-and-stars his son who died inside me and now Ser Jorah…

The queen has a good heart Daario purred through his deep purple whiskers but that one is more dangerous than all the Oznaks and Meros rolled up in one His strong hands caressed the hilts of his matched blades those wanton golden women You need not even say the word my radiance Only give the tiniest nod and your Daario shall fetch you back his ugly head

Leave him be The scales are balanced now Let him go home Dany pictured Jorah moving amongst old gnarled oaks and tall pines past flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss and little creeks running icy down steep hillsides She saw him entering a hall built of huge logs where dogs slept by the hearth and the smell of meat and mead hung thick in the smoky air We are done for now she told her captains

It was all she could do not to run back up the wide marble stairs Irri helped her slip from her court clothes and into more comfortable garb baggy woolen breeches a loose felted tunic a painted Dothraki vest You are trembling Khaleesi the girl said as she knelt to lace up Dany’s sandals

I’m cold Dany lied Bring me the book I was reading last night She wanted to lose herself in the words in other times and other places The fat leather-bound volume was full of songs and stories from the Seven Kingdoms Children’s stories if truth be told too simple and fanciful to be true history All the heroes were tall and handsome and you could tell the traitors by their shifty eyes Yet she loved them all the same Last night she had been reading of the three princesses in the red tower locked away by the king for the crime of being beautiful

When her handmaid brought the book Dany had no trouble finding the page where she had left off but it was no good She found herself reading the same passage half a dozen times Ser Jorah gave me this book as a bride’s gift the day I wed Khal Drogo But Daario is right I shouldn’t have banished him I should have kept him or I should have killed him She played at being a queen yet sometimes she still felt like a scared little girl Viserys always said what a dolt I was Was he truly mad She closed the book She could still recall Ser Jorah if she wished Or send Daario to kill him

Dany fled from the choice out onto the terrace She found Rhaegal asleep beside the pool a green and bronze coil basking in the sun Drogon was perched up atop the pyramid in the place where the huge bronze harpy had stood before she had commanded it to be pulled down He spread his wings and roared when he spied her There was no sign of Viserion but when she went to the parapet and scanned the horizon she saw pale wings in the far distance sweeping above the river He is hunting They grow bolder every day Yet it still made her anxious when they flew too far away One day one of them may not return she thought

Your Grace

She turned to find Ser Barristan behind her What more would you have of me ser I spared you I took you into my service now give me some peace

Forgive me Your Grace It was only… now that you know who I am… The old man hesitated A knight of the Kingsguard is in the king’s presence day and night For that reason our vows require us to protect his secrets as we would his life But your father’s secrets by rights belong to you now along with his throne and… I thought perhaps you might have questions for me

Questions She had a hundred questions a thousand ten thousand Why couldn’t she think of one Was my father truly mad she blurted out Why do I ask that Viserys said this talk of madness was a ploy of the Usurper’s…

Viserys was a child and the queen sheltered him as much as she could Your father always had a little madness in him I now believe Yet he was charming and generous as well so his lapses were forgiven His reign began with such promise… but as the years passed the lapses grew more frequent until…

Dany stopped him Do I want to hear this now

Ser Barristan considered a moment Perhaps not Not now

Not now she agreed One day One day you must tell me all The good and the bad There is some good to be said of my father surely

There is Your Grace Of him and those who came before him Your grandfather Jaehaerys and his brother their father Aegon your mother… and Rhaegar Him most of all

I wish I could have known him Her voice was wistful

I wish he could have known you the old knight said When you are ready I will tell you all
