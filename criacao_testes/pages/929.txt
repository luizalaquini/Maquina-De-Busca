1541 There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon
and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another
star in glory

1542 So also is the resurrection of the dead It is sown in
corruption it is raised in incorruption 1543 It is sown in
dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised
in power 1544 It is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual
body There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body

1545 And so it is written The first man Adam was made a living soul
the last Adam was made a quickening spirit

1546 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is
natural and afterward that which is spiritual

1547 The first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the
Lord from heaven

1548 As is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is
the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly

1549 And as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear
the image of the heavenly

1550 Now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption

1551 Behold I shew you a mystery We shall not all sleep but we
shall all be changed 1552 In a moment in the twinkling of an eye
at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible and we shall be changed

1553 For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
must put on immortality

1554 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and
this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in victory

1555 O death where is thy sting O grave where is thy victory
1556 The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law

1557 But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ

1558 Therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable
always abounding in the work of the Lord forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the Lord

161 Now concerning the collection for the saints as I have given
order to the churches of Galatia even so do ye

162 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
store as God hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when I
come

163 And when I come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters
them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem

164 And if it be meet that I go also they shall go with me

165 Now I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia
for I do pass through Macedonia

166 And it may be that I will abide yea and winter with you that
ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go

167 For I will not see you now by the way but I trust to tarry a
while with you if the Lord permit

168 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost

169 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are
many adversaries

1610 Now if Timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear
for he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do

1611 Let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in
peace that he may come unto me for I look for him with the brethren

1612 As touching our brother Apollos I greatly desired him to come
unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at
this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time

1613 Watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong

1614 Let all your things be done with charity

1615 I beseech you brethren ye know the house of Stephanas that
it is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have addicted
themselves to the ministry of the saints 1616 That ye submit
yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and
laboureth

1617 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied
