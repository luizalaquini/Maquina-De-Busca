…or killed Bran thought but what he said was He was not made for chains We will wait in your tower all of us

That is quite impossible Maester Luwin said

Osha grinned The boy’s the lordling here as I recall She handed Luwin back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again The maester’s tower it is

Will you come Rickon

His brother nodded If Shaggy comes too he said running after Osha and Bran and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow keeping a wary eye on the wolves

Maester Luwin’s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door star charts hung from the walls shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes papers quills and pots of inks were everywhere and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters Their strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester’s wounds under Luwin’s terse instruction This is folly the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream yet when you stop to consider it it’s only natural You miss your lord father and you know that he is a captive Fear can fever a man’s mind and give him queer thoughts Rickon is too young to comprehend—

I’m four now Rickon said He was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the First Keep The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room licking their wounds and gnawing on bones

—too young and—ooh seven hells that burns no don’t stop more Too young as I say but you Bran you’re old enough to know that dreams are only dreams

Some are some aren’t Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash Luwin gasped The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming

Tears were streaming down the maester’s face yet he shook his head doggedly The children… live only in dreams Now Dead and gone Enough that’s enough Now the bandages Pads and then wrap and make it tight I’ll be bleeding

Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals Bran said She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it

And all this they did with magic Maester Luwin said distracted I wish they were here now A spell would heal my arm less painfully and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite He gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye Take a lesson Bran The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword As the children did Here let me show you something He stood abruptly crossed the room and returned with a green jar in his good hand Have a look at these he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads

Bran picked one up It’s made of glass Curious Rickon drifted closer to peer over the table

Dragonglass Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin bandagings in hand

Obsidian Maester Luwin insisted holding out his wounded arm Forged in the fires of the gods far below the earth The children of the forest hunted with that thousands of years ago The children worked no metal In place of mail they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark so they seemed to melt into the wood In place of swords they carried blades of obsidian

And still do Osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maester’s forearm and bound them tight with long strips of linen

Bran held the arrowhead up close The black glass was slick and shiny He thought it beautiful Can I keep one

As you wish the maester said

I want one too Rickon said I want four I’m four

Luwin made him count them out Careful they’re still sharp Don’t cut yourself

Tell me about the children Bran said It was important

What do you wish to know

Everything

Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck They were people of the Dawn Age the very first before kings and kingdoms he said In those days there were no castles or holdfasts no cities not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne There were no men at all Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms

They were a people dark and beautiful small of stature no taller than children even when grown to manhood They lived in the depths of the wood in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns Slight as they were the children were quick and graceful Male and female hunted together with weirwood bows and flying snares Their gods were the gods of the forest stream and stone the old gods whose names are secret Their wise men were called greenseers and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods How long the children reigned here or where they came from no man can know

But some twelve thousand years ago the First Men appeared from the east crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields riding horses No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire Horror-struck the children went to war The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land shattering the Arm but it was too late to close the door The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both but more children than men for men were bigger and stronger and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze Finally the wise of both races prevailed and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called Gods Eye

There they forged the Pact The First Men were given the coastlands the high plains and bright meadows the mountains and bogs but the deep woods were to remain forever the children’s and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm So the gods might bear witness to the signing every tree on the island was given a face and afterward the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces
