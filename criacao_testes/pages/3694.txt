It was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more and even the Common Tongue Dany thought as they approached the first ship Sailors dockworkers and merchants alike gave way before her not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side Despite the heat of the day Ser Jorah wore his green wool surcoat over chainmail the black bear of Mormont sewn on his chest

But neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships they needed

You require passage for a hundred Dothraki all their horses yourself and this knight and three dragons said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before he walked away laughing When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn Queen of the Seven Kingdoms he gave her a deadface look and said Aye and I’m Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire The owner of Lord Faro’s Belly would risk dragons but not Dothraki I’ll have no such godless savages in my Belly I’ll not The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means and might have been beyond Xaro’s Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for her needs Bravo was bound for the Jade Sea and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy

As they made their way toward the next quay Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of her back Your Grace You are being followed No do not turn He guided her gently toward a brass-seller’s booth This is a noble work my queen he proclaimed loudly lifting a large platter for her inspection See how it shines in the sun

The brass was polished to a high sheen Dany could see her face in it… and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right she could see behind her I see a fat brown man and an older man with a staff Which is it

Both of them Ser Jorah said They have been following us since we left Quicksilver

The ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly making one man seem long and gaunt the other immensely squat and broad A most excellent brass great lady the merchant exclaimed Bright as the sun And for the Mother of Dragons only thirty honors

The platter was worth no more than three Where are my guards Dany declared This man is trying to rob me For Jorah she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue They may not mean me ill Men have looked at women since time began perhaps it is no more than that

The brass-seller ignored their whispers Thirty Did I say thirty Such a fool I am The price is twenty honors

All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors Dany told him as she studied the reflections The old man had the look of Westeros about him and the brown-skinned one must weigh twenty stone The Usurper offered a lordship to the man who kills me and these two are far from home Or could they be creatures of the warlocks meant to take me unawares

Ten Khaleesi because you are so lovely Use it for a looking glass Only brass this fine could capture such beauty

It might serve to carry nightsoil If you threw it away I might pick it up so long as I did not need to stoop But pay for it Dany shoved the platter back into his hands Worms have crawled up your nose and eaten your wits

Eight honors he cried My wives will beat me and call me fool but I am a helpless child in your hands Come eight that is less than it is worth

What do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold As she turned to walk off Dany let her glance sweep over the strangers The brown man was near as wide as he’d looked in the platter with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks of a eunuch A long curving arakh was thrust through the sweat-stained yellow silk of his bellyband Above the silk he was naked but for an absurdly tiny iron-studded vest Old scars crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms huge chest and massive belly pale against his nut-brown skin

The other man wore a traveler’s cloak of undyed wool the hood thrown back Long white hair fell to his shoulders and a silky white beard covered the lower half of his face He leaned his weight on a hardwood staff as tall as he was Only fools would stare so openly if they meant me harm All the same it might be prudent to head back toward Jhogo and Aggo The old man does not wear a sword she said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as she drew him away

The brass merchant came hopping after them Five honors for five it is yours it was meant for you

Ser Jorah said A hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace

Four I know you want it He danced in front of them scampering backward as he thrust the platter at their faces

Do they follow

Lift that up a little higher the knight told the merchant Yes The old man pretends to linger at a potter’s stall but the brown one has eyes only for you

Two honors Two Two The merchant was panting heavily from the effort of running backward

Pay him before he kills himself Dany told Ser Jorah wondering what she was going to do with a huge brass platter She turned back as he reached for his coins intending to put an end to this mummer’s farce The blood of the dragon would not be herded through the bazaar by an old man and a fat eunuch

A Qartheen stepped into her path Mother of Dragons for you He knelt and thrust a jewel box into her face

Dany took it almost by reflex The box was carved wood its mother-of-pearl lid inlaid with jasper and chalcedony You are too generous She opened it Within was a glittering green scarab carved from onyx and emerald Beautiful she thought This will help pay for our passage As she reached inside the box the man said I am so sorry but she hardly heard

The scarab unfolded with a hiss

Dany caught a glimpse of a malign black face almost human and an arched tail dripping venom… and then the box flew from her hand in pieces turning end over end Sudden pain twisted her fingers As she cried out and clutched her hand the brass merchant let out a shriek a woman screamed and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other aside Ser Jorah slammed past her and Dany stumbled to one knee She heard the hiss again The old man drove the butt of his staff into the ground Aggo came riding through an eggseller’s stall and vaulted from his saddle Jhogo’s whip cracked overhead Ser Jorah slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter sailors and whores and merchants were fleeing or shouting or both…

Your Grace a thousand pardons The old man knelt It’s dead Did I break your hand

She closed her fingers wincing I don’t think so

I had to knock it away he started but her bloodriders were on him before he could finish Aggo kicked his staff away and Jhogo seized him round the shoulders forced him to his knees and pressed a dagger to his throat Khaleesi we saw him strike you Would you see the color of his blood

Release him Dany climbed to her feet Look at the bottom of his staff blood of my blood Ser Jorah had been shoved off his feet by the eunuch She ran between them as arakh and longsword both came flashing from their sheaths Put down your steel Stop it

Your Grace Mormont lowered his sword only an inch These men attacked you

They were defending me Dany snapped her hand to shake the sting from her fingers It was the other one the Qartheen When she looked around he was gone He was a Sorrowful Man There was a manticore in that jewel box he gave me This man knocked it out of my hand The brass merchant was still rolling on the ground She went to him and helped him to his feet Were you stung

No good lady he said shaking or else I would be dead But it touched me aieeee when it fell from the box it landed on my arm He had soiled himself she saw and no wonder

She gave him a silver for his trouble and sent him on his way before she turned back to the old man with the white beard Who is it that I owe my life to

You owe me nothing Your Grace I am called Arstan though Belwas named me Whitebeard on the voyage here Though Jhogo had released him the old man remained on one knee Aggo picked up his staff turned it over cursed softly in Dothraki scraped the remains of the manticore off on a stone and handed it back

And who is Belwas she asked

The huge brown eunuch swaggered forward sheathing his arakh I am Belwas Strong Belwas they name me in the fighting pits of Meereen Never did I lose He slapped his belly covered with scars I let each man cut me once before I kill him Count the cuts and you will know how many Strong Belwas has slain

Dany had no need to count his scars there were many she could see at a glance And why are you here Strong Belwas

From Meereen I am sold to Qohor and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in his hair He it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea and old Whitebeard to serve him

The fat man with sweet stink in his hair…Illyrio she said You were sent by Magister Illyrio

We were Your Grace old Whitebeard replied The Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending us in his stead but he cannot sit a horse as he did in his youth and sea travel upsets his digestion Earlier he had spoken in the Valyrian of the Free Cities but now he changed to the Common Tongue I regret if we caused you alarm If truth be told we were not certain we expected someone more… more…

Regal Dany laughed She had no dragon with her and her raiment was hardly queenly You speak the Common Tongue well Arstan Are you of Westeros

I am I was born on the Dornish Marches Your Grace As a boy I squired for a knight of Lord Swann’s household He held the tall staff upright beside him like a lance in need of a banner Now I squire for Belwas

A bit old for such aren’t you Ser Jorah had shouldered his way to her side holding the brass platter awkwardly under his arm Belwas’s hard head had left it badly bent

Not too old to serve my liege Lord Mormont

You know me as well

I saw you fight a time or two At Lannisport where you near unhorsed the Kingslayer And on Pyke there as well You do not recall Lord Mormont

Ser Jorah frowned Your face seems familiar but there were hundreds at Lannisport and thousands on Pyke And I am no lord Bear Island was taken from me I am but a knight

A knight of my Queensguard Dany took his arm And my true friend and good counselor She studied Arstan’s face He had a great dignity to him a quiet strength she liked Rise Arstan Whitebeard Be welcome Strong Belwas Ser Jorah you know Ko Aggo and Ko Jhogo are blood of my blood They crossed the red waste with me and saw my dragons born

Horse boys Belwas grinned toothily Belwas has killed many horse boys in the fighting pits They jingle when they die
