And who will give me courage she wondered yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her Grey Wind shadowing his steps Behind him his battle guard formed up When he’d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors she had insisted that he be guarded as well and the lords bannermen had agreed Many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf as they had taken to calling him Torrhen Karstark and his brother Eddard were among his thirty and Patrek Mallister Smalljon Umber Daryn Hornwood Theon Greyjoy no less than five of Walder Frey’s vast brood along with older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint One of his companions was even a woman Dacey Mormont Lady Maege’s eldest daughter and heir to Bear Island a lanky six-footer who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls Some of the other lords muttered about that but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints This is not about the honor of your houses she told them This is about keeping my son alive and whole

And if it comes to that she wondered will thirty be enough Will six thousand be enough

A bird called faintly in the distance a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand on Catelyn’s neck Another bird answered a third a fourth She knew their call well enough from her years at Winterfell Snow shrikes Sometimes you saw them in the deep of winter when the godswood was white and still They were northern birds

They are coming Catelyn thought

They’re coming my lady Hal Mollen whispered He was always a man for stating the obvious Gods be with us

She nodded as the woods grew still around them In the quiet she could hear them far off yet moving closer the tread of many horses the rattle of swords and spears and armor the murmur of human voices with here a laugh and there a curse

Eons seemed to come and go The sounds grew louder She heard more laughter a shouted command splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream A horse snorted A man swore And then at last she saw him… only for an instant framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor yet she knew it was him Even at a distance Ser Jaime Lannister was unmistakable The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair and turned his crimson cloak to black He was not wearing a helm

He was there and he was gone again his silvery armor obscured by the trees once more Others came behind him long columns of them knights and sworn swords and freeriders three quarters of the Lannister horse

He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers Ser Brynden had promised He has ridden out with his knights thrice already to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast

Nodding Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him Ned had taught him to read maps Raid him here he said pointing A few hundred men no more Tully banners When he comes after you we will be waiting—his finger moved an inch to the left—here

Here was a hush in the night moonlight and shadows a thick carpet of dead leaves underfoot densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away

Here was her son on his stallion glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute

Here was the call of Maege Mormont’s warhorn a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east to tell them that the last of Jaime’s riders had entered the trap

And Grey Wind threw back his head and howled

The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark and she found herself shivering It was a terrible sound a frightening sound yet there was music in it too For a second she felt something like pity for the Lannisters below So this is what death sounds like she thought

HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded his own horn To east and west the trumpets of the Mallisters and Freys blew vengeance North where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow Lord Karstark’s warhorns added their own deep mournful voices to the dark chorus Men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below

The whispering wood let out its breath all at once as the bowmen Robb had hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses All around her the riders raised their lances and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel Winterfell she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again He moved away from her at a trot leading his men downhill

Catelyn sat on her horse unmoving with Hal Mollen and her guard around her and she waited as she had waited before for Brandon and Ned and her father She was high on the ridge and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath her A heartbeat two four and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone in the wood The rest were melted away into the green

Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge she saw the Greatjon’s riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees They were in a long line an endless line and as they burst from the wood there was an instant the smallest part of a heartbeat when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge wreathed in silver flame

Then she blinked and they were only men rushing down to kill or die

Afterward she could not claim she had seen the battle Yet she could hear and the valley rang with echoes The crack of a broken lance the clash of swords the cries of Lannister and Winterfell and Tully Riverrun and Tully When she realized there was no more to see she closed her eyes and listened The battle came alive around her She heard hoofbeats iron boots splashing in shallow water the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel the hiss of arrows the thunder of drums the terrified screaming of a thousand horses Men shouted curses and begged for mercy and got it or not and lived or died The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound Once she heard Robb’s voice as clear as if he’d been standing at her side calling To me To me And she heard his direwolf snarling and growling heard the snap of those long teeth the tearing of flesh shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike Was there only one wolf It was hard to be certain

Little by little the sounds dwindled and died until at last there was only the wolf As a red dawn broke in the east Grey Wind began to howl again

Robb came back to her on a different horse riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion he had taken down into the valley The wolf’s head on his shield was slashed half to pieces raw wood showing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak but Robb himself seemed unhurt Yet when he came closer Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood You’re hurt she said

Robb lifted his hand opened and closed his fingers No he said This is… Torrhen’s blood perhaps or… He shook his head I do not know

A mob of men followed him up the slope dirty and dented and grinning with Theon and the Greatjon at their head Between them they dragged Ser Jaime Lannister They threw him down in front of her horse The Kingslayer Hal announced unnecessarily

Lannister raised his head Lady Stark he said from his knees Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair I would offer you my sword but I seem to have mislaid it

It is not your sword I want ser she told him Give me my father and my brother Edmure Give me my daughters Give me my lord husband

I have mislaid them as well I fear

A pity Catelyn said coldly

Kill him Robb Theon Greyjoy urged Take his head off

No her son answered peeling off his bloody glove He’s more use alive than dead And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle

A wise man Jaime Lannister said and honorable

Take him away and put him in irons Catelyn said

Do as my lady mother says Robb commanded and make certain there’s a strong guard around him Lord Karstark will want his head on a pike

That he will the Greatjon agreed gesturing Lannister was led away to be bandaged and chained

Why should Lord Karstark want him dead Catelyn asked

Robb looked away into the woods with the same brooding look that Ned often got He… he killed them…

Lord Karstark’s sons Galbart Glover explained

Both of them said Robb Torrhen and Eddard And Daryn Hornwood as well

No one can fault Lannister on his courage Glover said When he saw that he was lost he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down And almost did

He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark’s neck after he took Torrhen’s hand off and split Daryn Hornwood’s skull open Robb said All the time he was shouting for me If they hadn’t tried to stop him—

—I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark Catelyn said Your men did what they were sworn to do Robb They died protecting their liege lord Grieve for them Honor them for their valor But not now You have no time for grief You may have lopped the head off the snake but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my father’s castle We have won a battle not a war

But such a battle said Theon Greyjoy eagerly My lady the realm has not seen such a victory since the Field of Fire I vow the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell We’ve taken close to a hundred knights captive and a dozen lords bannermen Lord Westerling Lord Banefort Ser Garth Greenfield Lord Estren Ser Tytos Brax Mallor the Dornishman… and three Lannisters besides Jaime Lord Tywin’s own nephews two of his sister’s sons and one of his dead brother’s…

And Lord Tywin Catelyn interrupted Have you perchance taken Lord Tywin Theon

No Greyjoy answered brought up short

Until you do this war is far from done

Robb raised his head and pushed his hair back out of his eyes My mother is right We still have Riverrun
