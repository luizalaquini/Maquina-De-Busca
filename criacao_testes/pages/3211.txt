1232 And the scribe said unto him Well Master thou hast said the
truth for there is one God and there is none other but he 1233 And
to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and
with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his
neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices

1234 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto
him Thou art not far from the kingdom of God And no man after that
durst ask him any question

1235 And Jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple How
say the scribes that Christ is the son of David  1236 For David
himself said by the Holy Ghost The LORD said to my Lord Sit thou on
my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool

1237 David therefore himself calleth him Lord and whence is he then
his son And the common people heard him gladly

1238 And he said unto them in his doctrine Beware of the scribes
which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the
marketplaces 1239 And the chief seats in the synagogues and the
uppermost rooms at feasts 1240 Which devour widows houses and for
a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation

1241 And Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in
much

1242 And there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites
which make a farthing

1243 And he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them
Verily I say unto you That this poor widow hath cast more in than
all they which have cast into the treasury 1244 For all they did
cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that
she had even all her living

131 And as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto
him Master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here
132 And Jesus answering said unto him Seest thou these great
buildings  there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall
not be thrown down

133 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple
Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately 134 Tell us
when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these
things shall be fulfilled  135 And Jesus answering them began to
say Take heed lest any man deceive you 136 For many shall come in
my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many

137 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not
troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet

138 For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there
shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows

139 But take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to
councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be
brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against
them

1310 And the gospel must first be published among all nations

1311 But when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but
whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is
not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost

1312 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the
father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and
shall cause them to be put to death

1313 And ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that
shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved

1314 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of
by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that
readeth understand then let them that be in Judaea flee to the
mountains 1315 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into
the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house
1316 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
up his garment

1317 But woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck
in those days  1318 And pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter

1319 For in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time neither
shall be

1320 And except that the Lord had shortened those days no flesh
should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he
hath shortened the days

1321 And then if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or
lo he is there believe him not 1322 For false Christs and false
prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if
