Lannister snorted Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence My mutton-headed uncle had not even troubled to post sentries it would seem His host was raw—apprentice boys miners fieldhands fisherfolk the sweepings of Lannisport The only mystery is how your brother reached him Our forces still hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth and they swear he did not pass The dwarf gave an irritated shrug Well Robb Stark is my father’s bane Joffrey is mine Tell me what do you feel for my kingly nephew

I love him with all my heart Sansa said at once

Truly He did not sound convinced Even now

My love for His Grace is greater than it has ever been

The Imp laughed aloud Well someone has taught you to lie well You may be grateful for that one day child You are a child still are you not Or have you flowered

Sansa blushed It was a rude question but the shame of being stripped before half the castle made it seem like nothing No my lord

That’s all to the good If it gives you any solace I do not intend that you ever wed Joffrey No marriage will reconcile Stark and Lannister after all that has happened I fear More’s the pity The match was one of King Robert’s better notions if Joffrey hadn’t mucked it up

She knew she ought to say something but the words caught in her throat

You grow very quiet Tyrion Lannister observed Is this what you want An end to your betrothal

I… Sansa did not know what to say Is it a trick Will he punish me if I tell the truth She stared at the dwarf’s brutal bulging brow the hard black eye and the shrewd green one the crooked teeth and wiry beard I only want to be loyal

Loyal the dwarf mused and far from any Lannisters I can scarce blame you for that When I was your age I wanted the same thing He smiled They tell me you visit the godswood every day What do you pray for Sansa

I pray for Robb’s victory and Joffrey’s death… and for home For Winterfell I pray for an end to the fighting

We’ll have that soon enough There will be another battle between your brother Robb and my lord father and that will settle the issue

Robb will beat him Sansa thought He beat your uncle and your brother Jaime he’ll beat your father too

It was as if her face were an open book so easily did the dwarf read her hopes Do not take Oxcross too much to heart my lady he told her not unkindly A battle is not a war and my lord father is assuredly not my uncle Stafford The next time you visit the godswood pray that your brother has the wisdom to bend the knee Once the north returns to the king’s peace I mean to send you home He hopped down off the window seat and said You may sleep here tonight I’ll give you some of my own men as a guard some Stone Crows perhaps—

No Sansa blurted out aghast If she was locked in the Tower of the Hand guarded by the dwarf’s men how would Ser Dontos ever spirit her away to freedom

Would you prefer Black Ears I’ll give you Chella if a woman would make you more at ease

Please no my lord the wildlings frighten me

He grinned Me as well But more to the point they frighten Joffrey and that nest of sly vipers and lickspittle dogs he calls a Kingsguard With Chella or Timett by your side no one would dare offer you harm

I would sooner return to my own bed A lie came to her suddenly but it seemed so right that she blurted it out at once This tower was where my father’s men were slain Their ghosts would give me terrible dreams and I would see their blood wherever I looked

Tyrion Lannister studied her face I am no stranger to nightmares Sansa Perhaps you are wiser than I knew Permit me at least to escort you safely back to your own chambers





CATELYN

It was full dark before they found the village Catelyn found herself wondering if the place had a name If so its people had taken that knowledge with them when they fled along with all they owned down to the candles in the sept Ser Wendel lit a torch and led her through the low door

Within the seven walls were cracked and crooked God is one Septon Osmynd had taught her when she was a girl with seven aspects as the sept is a single building with seven walls The wealthy septs of the cities had statues of the Seven and an altar to each In Winterfell Septon Chayle hung carved masks from each wall Here Catelyn found only rough charcoal drawings Ser Wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door and left to wait outside with Robar Royce

Catelyn studied the faces The Father was bearded as ever The Mother smiled loving and protective The Warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face the Smith his hammer The Maid was beautiful the Crone wizened and wise
