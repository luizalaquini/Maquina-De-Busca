sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine
grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into
Jerusalem on the sabbath day and I testified against them in the day
wherein they sold victuals

1316 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein which brought fish and
all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of
Judah and in Jerusalem

1317 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them
What evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day
1318 Did not your fathers thus and did not our God bring all this
evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the sabbath

1319 And it came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
be dark before the sabbath I commanded that the gates should be shut
and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and
some of my servants set I at the gates that there should no burden be
brought in on the sabbath day

1320 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Jerusalem once or twice

1321 Then I testified against them and said unto them Why lodge ye
about the wall if ye do so again I will lay hands on you From that
time forth came they no more on the sabbath

1322 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves
and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath
day

Remember me O my God concerning this also and spare me according to
the greatness of thy mercy

1323 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod
of Ammon and of Moab 1324 And their children spake half in the
speech of Ashdod and could not speak in the Jews language but
according to the language of each people

1325 And I contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of
them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by God saying
Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their
daughters unto your sons or for yourselves

1326 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things yet among
many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his God
and God made him king over all Israel nevertheless even him did
outlandish women cause to sin

1327 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to
transgress against our God in marrying strange wives  1328 And one
of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was son in
law to Sanballat the Horonite therefore I chased him from me

1329 Remember them O my God because they have defiled the
priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites

1330 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers and appointed the wards
of the priests and the Levites every one in his business 1331 And
for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits
Remember me O my God for good
