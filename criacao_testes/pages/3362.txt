The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews


11 God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets 12 Hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom
also he made the worlds 13 Who being the brightness of his glory
and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the
word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on
the right hand of the Majesty on high 14 Being made so much better
than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name than they

15 For unto which of the angels said he at any time Thou art my Son
this day have I begotten thee And again I will be to him a Father
and he shall be to me a Son  16 And again when he bringeth in the
firstbegotten into the world he saith And let all the angels of God
worship him

17 And of the angels he saith Who maketh his angels spirits and his
ministers a flame of fire

18 But unto the Son he saith Thy throne O God is for ever and
ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom

19 Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God
even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows

110 And Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands 111 They shall
perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment 112 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall
be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail

113 But to which of the angels said he at any time Sit on my right
hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool  114 Are they not all
ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be
heirs of salvation  21 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let
them slip

22 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward
23 How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at
the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
them that heard him 24 God also bearing them witness both with
signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
Ghost according to his own will  25 For unto the angels hath he not
put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak

26 But one in a certain place testified saying What is man that
thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him
27 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him
with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands
28 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet For in that
he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put
under him

But now we see not yet all things put under him

29 But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the
grace of God should taste death for every man

210 For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all
things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their
salvation perfect through sufferings

211 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren 212
Saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the
church will I sing praise unto thee

213 And again I will put my trust in him And again Behold I and
the children which God hath given me

214 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood
he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
215 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage

216 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took
on him the seed of Abraham
