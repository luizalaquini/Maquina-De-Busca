The younger man started for the door But there he turned back Renly thought she was absurd A woman dressed in man’s mail pretending to be a knight

If he’d ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace he would not have complained

I asked him why he kept her close if he thought her so grotesque He said that all his other knights wanted things of him castles or honors or riches but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him When I saw him all bloody with her fled and the three of them unharmed… if she’s innocent then Robar and Emmon… He could not seem to say the words

Jaime had not stopped to consider that aspect of it I would have done the same ser The lie came easy but Ser Loras seemed grateful for it

When he was gone the Lord Commander sat alone in the white room wondering The Knight of Flowers had been so mad with grief for Renly that he had cut down two of his own Sworn Brothers but it had never occurred to Jaime to do the same with the five who had failed Joffrey He was my son my secret son… what am I if I do not lift the hand I have left to avenge mine own blood and seed He ought to kill Ser Boros at least just to be rid of him

He looked at his stump and grimaced I must do something about that If the late Ser Jacelyn Bywater could wear an iron hand he should have a gold one Cersei might like that A golden hand to stroke her golden hair and hold her hard against me

His hand could wait though There were other things to tend to first There were other debts to pay





Sansa


The ladder to the forecastle was steep and splintery so Sansa accepted a hand up from Lothor Brune Ser Lothor she had to remind herself the man had been knighted for his valor in the Battle of the Blackwater Though no proper knight would wear those patched brown breeches and scuffed boots nor that cracked and waterstained leather jerkin A square-faced stocky man with a squashed nose and a mat of nappy grey hair Brune spoke seldom He is stronger than he looks though She could tell by the ease with which he lifted her as if she weighed nothing at all

Off the bow of the Merling King stretched a bare and stony strand windswept treeless and uninviting Even so it made a welcome sight They had been a long while clawing their way back on course The last storm had swept them out of sight of land and sent such waves crashing over the sides of the galley that Sansa had been certain they were all going to drown Two men had been swept overboard she had heard old Oswell saying and another had fallen from the mast and broken his neck

She had seldom ventured out on deck herself Her little cabin was dank and cold but Sansa had been sick for most of the voyage… sick with terror sick with fever or seasick… she could keep nothing down and even sleep came hard Whenever she closed her eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at his collar clawing at the soft skin of his throat dying with flakes of pie crust on his lips and wine stains on his doublet And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he’d made as he fought to draw in air Sometimes she dreamed of Tyrion as well He did nothing she told Littlefinger once when he paid a visit to her cabin to see if she were feeling any better

He did not kill Joffrey true but the dwarf’s hands are far from clean He had a wife before you did you know that

He told me

And did he tell you that when he grew bored with her he made a gift of her to his father’s guardsmen He might have done the same to you in time Shed no tears for the Imp my lady

The wind ran salty fingers through her hair and Sansa shivered Even this close to shore the rolling of the ship made her tummy queasy She desperately needed a bath and a change of clothes I must look as haggard as a corpse and smell of vomit

Lord Petyr came up beside her cheerful as ever Good morrow The salt air is bracing don’t you think It always sharpens my appetite He put a sympathetic arm about her shoulders Are you quite well You look so pale

It’s only my tummy The seasickness

A little wine will be good for that We’ll get you a cup as soon as we’re ashore Petyr pointed to where an old flint tower stood outlined against a bleak grey sky the breakers crashing on the rocks beneath it Cheerful is it not I fear there’s no safe anchorage here We’ll put ashore in a boat

Here She did not want to go ashore here The Fingers were a dismal place she’d heard and there was something forlorn and desolate about the little tower Couldn’t I stay on the ship until we make sail for White Harbor

From here the King turns east for Braavos Without us

But… my lord you said… you said we were sailing home

And there it stands miserable as it is My ancestral home It has no name I fear A great lord’s seat ought to have a name wouldn’t you agree Winterfell the Eyrie Riverrun those are castles Lord of Harrenhal now that has a sweet ring to it but what was I before Lord of Sheepshit and Master of the Drearfort It lacks a certain something His grey-green eyes regarded her innocently You look distraught Did you think we were making for Winterfell sweetling Winterfell has been taken burned and sacked All those you knew and loved are dead What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen are warring amongst themselves Even the Wall is under attack Winterfell was the home of your childhood Sansa but you are no longer a child You’re a woman grown and you need to make your own home

But not here she said dismayed It looks so…

…small and bleak and mean It’s all that and less The Fingers are a lovely place if you happen to be a stone But have no fear we shan’t stay more than a fortnight I expect your aunt is already riding to meet us He smiled The Lady Lysa and I are to be wed

Wed Sansa was stunned You and my aunt

The Lord of Harrenhal and the Lady of the Eyrie

You said it was my mother you loved But of course Lady Catelyn was dead so even if she had loved Petyr secretly and given him her maidenhood it made no matter now

So silent my lady said Petyr I was certain you would wish to give me your blessing It is a rare thing for a boy born heir to stones and sheep pellets to wed the daughter of Hoster Tully and the widow of Jon Arryn

I… I pray you will have long years together and many children and be very happy in one another It had been years since Sansa last saw her mother’s sister She will be kind to me for my mother’s sake surely She’s my own blood And the Vale of Arryn was beautiful all the songs said so Perhaps it would not be so terrible to stay here for a time

Lothor and old Oswell rowed them ashore Sansa huddled in the bow under her cloak with the hood drawn up against the wind wondering what awaited her Servants emerged from the tower to meet them a thin old woman and a fat middle-aged one two ancient white-haired men and a girl of two or three with a sty on one eye When they recognized Lord Petyr they knelt on the rocks My household he said I don’t know the child Another of Kella’s bastards I suppose She pops one out every few years

The two old men waded out up to their thighs to lift Sansa from the boat so she would not get her skirts wet Oswell and Lothor splashed their way ashore as did Littlefinger himself He gave the old woman a kiss on the cheek and grinned at the younger one Who fathered this one Kella

The fat woman laughed I can’t rightly say m’lord I’m not one for telling them no

And all the local lads are grateful I am quite sure

It is good to have you home my lord said one old man He looked to be at least eighty but he wore a studded brigantine and a longsword at his side How long will you be in residence

As short a time as possible Bryen have no fear Is the place habitable just now would you say

If we knew you was coming we would have laid down fresh rushes m’lord said the crone There’s a dung fire burning

Nothing says home like the smell of burning dung Petyr turned to Sansa Grisel was my wet nurse but she keeps my castle now Umfred’s my steward and Bryen—didn’t I name you captain of the guard the last time I was here

You did my lord You said you’d be getting some more men too but you never did Me and the dogs stand all the watches

And very well I’m sure No one has made off with any of my rocks or sheep pellets I see that plainly Petyr gestured toward the fat woman Kella minds my vast herds How many sheep do I have at present Kella

She had to think a moment Three and twenty m’lord There was nine and twenty but Bryen’s dogs killed one and we butchered some others and salted down the meat

Ah cold salt mutton I must be home When I break my fast on gulls’ eggs and seaweed soup I’ll be certain of it

If you like m’lord said the old woman Grisel

Lord Petyr made a face Come let’s see if my hall is as dreary as I recall He led them up the strand over rocks slick with rotting seaweed A handful of sheep were wandering about the base of the flint tower grazing on the thin grass that grew between the sheepfold and thatched stable Sansa had to step carefully there were pellets everywhere

Within the tower seemed even smaller An open stone stair wound round the inside wall from undercroft to roof Each floor was but a single room The servants lived and slept in the kitchen at ground level sharing the space with a huge brindled mastiff and a half-dozen sheepdogs Above that was a modest hall and higher still the bedchamber There were no windows but arrowslits were embedded in the outer wall at intervals along the curve of the stair Above the hearth hung a broken longsword and a battered oaken shield its paint cracked and flaking

The device painted on the shield was one Sansa did not know a grey stone head with fiery eyes upon a light green field My grandfather’s shield Petyr explained when he saw her gazing at it His own father was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray so my grandfather took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted

It’s very fierce said Sansa

Rather too fierce for an amiable fellow like me said Petyr I much prefer my mockingbird

Oswell made two more trips out to the Merling King to offload provisions Among the loads he brought ashore were several casks of wine Petyr poured Sansa a cup as promised Here my lady that should help your tummy I would hope
