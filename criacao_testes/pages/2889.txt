6611 Thou broughtest us into the net thou laidst affliction upon our
loins

6612 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through
fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
place

6613 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings I will pay thee
my vows

6614 Which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when I was
in trouble

6615 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the
incense of rams I will offer bullocks with goats Selah

6616 Come and hear all ye that fear God and I will declare what he
hath done for my soul

6617 I cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my
tongue

6618 If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me

6619 But verily God hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of
my prayer

6620 Blessed be God which hath not turned away my prayer nor his
mercy from me



671 God be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to
shine upon us Selah

672 That thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all
nations

673 Let the people praise thee O God let all the people praise
thee

674 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge
the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth Selah

675 Let the people praise thee O God let all the people praise
thee

676 Then shall the earth yield her increase and God even our own
God shall bless us

677 God shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him



681 Let God arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that
hate him flee before him

682 As smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth
before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of God

683 But let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before God yea
let them exceedingly rejoice

684 Sing unto God sing praises to his name extol him that rideth
upon the heavens by his name JAH and rejoice before him

685 A father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in
his holy habitation

686 God setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land

687 O God when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst
march through the wilderness Selah

688 The earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of God
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God the God of Israel

689 Thou O God didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst
confirm thine inheritance when it was weary

6810 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou O God hast prepared
of thy goodness for the poor

6811 The Lord gave the word great was the company of those that
published it

6812 Kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home
divided the spoil

6813 Though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold

6814 When the Almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in
Salmon

6815 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan an high hill as the
hill of Bashan
