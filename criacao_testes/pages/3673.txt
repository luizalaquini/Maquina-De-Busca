A watcher said Stonesnake A wildling Finish her

Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her One thrust and it’s done he told himself He was so close he could smell onion on her breath She is no older than I am Something about her made him think of Arya though they looked nothing at all alike Will you yield he asked giving the dirk a half turn And if she doesn’t

I yield Her words steamed in the cold air

You’re our captive then He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat

Qhorin said nothing of taking captives said Stonesnake

He never said not to Jon let go his grip on the girl’s hair and she scuttled backward away from them

She’s a spearwife Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her sleeping furs She was reaching for that when you grabbed her Give her half a chance and she’ll bury it between your eyes

I won’t give her half a chance Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl’s reach Do you have a name

Ygritte Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody She stared at the wetness

Sheathing his dirk he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he’d killed You are my captive Ygritte

I gave you my name

I’m Jon Snow

She flinched An evil name

A bastard name he said My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell

The girl watched him warily but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle It’s the captive supposed to tell things remember The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire Not that she will I’ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they’d answer a question When the end of the branch was blazing merrily he took two steps and flung it out over the pass It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight

You ought to burn them you killed said Ygritte

Need a bigger fire for that and big fires burn bright Stonesnake turned his eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light Are there more wildlings close by is that it

Burn them the girl repeated stubbornly or it might be you’ll need them swords again

Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands Maybe we should do as she says

There are other ways Stonesnake knelt beside the man he’d slain stripped him of cloak and boots and belt and vest then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it to the edge He grunted as he tossed it over A moment later they heard a wet heavy smack well below them By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging it by the arms Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of the night

Ygritte watched and said nothing She was older than he’d thought at first Jon realized maybe as old as twenty but short for her age bandy-legged with a round face small hands and a pug nose Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions She looked plump as she crouched there but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya

Were you sent to watch for us Jon asked her

You and others

Stonesnake warmed his hands over the fire What waits beyond the pass

The free folk

How many

Hundreds and thousands More than you ever saw crow She smiled Her teeth were crooked but very white

She doesn’t know how many Why come here

Ygritte fell silent

What’s in the Frostfangs that your king could want You can’t stay here there’s no food

She turned her face away from him

Do you mean to march on the Wall When

She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him

Do you know anything of my uncle Benjen Stark

Ygritte ignored him Stonesnake laughed if she spits out her tongue don’t say I didn’t warn you

A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock Shadowcat Jon knew at once As he rose he heard another closer at hand He pulled his sword and turned listening

They won’t trouble us Ygritte said It’s the dead they’ve come for Cats can smell blood six miles off They’ll stay near the bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ meat and cracked the bones for the marrow

Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks It gave him an uneasy feeling The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was but he dared not sleep He had taken a captive and it was on him to guard her Were they your kin he asked her quietly The two we killed

No more than you are

Me He frowned What do you mean

You said you were the Bastard o’ Winterfell

I am

Who was your mother

Some woman Most of them are Someone had said that to him once He did not remember who

She smiled again a flash of white teeth And she never sung you the song o’ the winter rose

I never knew my mother Or any such song

Bael the Bard made it said Ygritte He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back All the free folk know his songs but might be you don’t sing them in the south

Winterfell’s not in the south Jon objected

Yes it is Everything below the Wall’s south to us

He had never thought of it that way I suppose it’s all in where you’re standing
