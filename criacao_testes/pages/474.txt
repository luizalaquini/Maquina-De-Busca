When he was done the eunuch made a little clucking sound I will do as my lord commands of course… but I must warn you the kitchens are full of eyes and ears Even if the girl falls under no particular suspicion she will be subject to a thousand questions Where was she born Who were her parents How did she come to King’s Landing The truth will never do so she must lie… and lie and lie He glanced down at Tyrion And such a pretty young kitchen wench will incite lust as well as curiosity She will be touched pinched patted and fondled Pot boys will crawl under her blankets of a night Some lonely cook may seek to wed her Bakers will knead her breasts with floured hands

I’d sooner have her fondled than stabbed said Tyrion

Varys rode on a few paces and said It might be that there is another way As it happens the maidservant who attends Lady Tanda’s daughter has been filching her jewels Were I to inform Lady Tanda she would be forced to dismiss the girl at once And the daughter would require a new maidservant

I see This had possibilities Tyrion saw at once A lady’s bedmaid wore finer garb than a scullion and often even a jewel or two Shae should be pleased by that And Cersei thought Lady Tanda tedious and hysterical and Lollys a bovine lackwit She was not like to pay them any friendly calls

Lollys is timid and trusting Varys said She will accept any tale she is told Since the mob took her maidenhood she is afraid to leave her chambers so Shae will be out of sight… but conveniently close should you have need of comfort

The Tower of the Hand is watched you know as well as I Cersei would be certain to grow curious if Lollys’s bedmaid starting paying me calls

I might be able to slip the child into your bedchamber unseen Chataya’s is not the only house to boast a hidden door

A secret access To my chambers Tyrion was more annoyed than surprised Why else would Maegor the Cruel have ordered death for all the builders who had worked on his castle except to preserve such secrets Yes I suppose there would be Where will I find the door In my solar My bedchamber

My friend you would not force me to reveal all my little secrets would you

Henceforth think of them as our little secrets Varys Tyrion glanced up at the eunuch in his smelly mummer’s garb Assuming you are on my side…

Can you doubt it

Why no I trust you implicitly A bitter laugh echoed off the shuttered windows I trust you like one of my own blood in truth Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died

It is said that he threw himself from a tower

Threw himself No I will not believe that

His guards saw no man enter his chambers nor did they find any within afterward

Then the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed Tyrion suggested or he climbed down from the roof on a rope Perhaps the guards are lying Who’s to say they did not do the thing themselves

Doubtless you are right my lord

His smug tone said otherwise But you do not think so How was it done then

For a long moment Varys said nothing The only sound was the stately clack of horseshoes on cobbles Finally the eunuch cleared his throat My lord do you believe in the old powers

Magic you mean Tyrion said impatiently Bloodspells curses shapeshifting those sorts of things He snorted Do you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to his death

Ser Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning he died I ask you is this the act of a man lost to despair Then there is the matter of Lord Renly’s mysterious and most fortuitous murder even as his battle lines were forming up to sweep his brother from the field The eunuch paused a moment My lord you once asked me how it was that I was cut

I recall said Tyrion You did not want to talk of it

Nor do I but… This pause was longer than the one before and when Varys spoke again his voice was different somehow I was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly Our master owned a fat little cog and we sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King’s Landing

One day at Myr a certain man came to our folly After the performance he made an offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse I was in terror I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses With a long hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call though I did not understand the words they spoke

The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me Once I had served his purpose the man had no further interest in me so he put me out When I asked him what I should do now he answered that he supposed I should die To spite him I resolved to live I begged I stole and I sold what parts of my body still remained to me Soon I was as good a thief as any in Myr and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man’s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse

Yet I still dream of that night my lord Not of the sorcerer nor his blade nor even the way my manhood shriveled as it burned I dream of the voice The voice from the flames Was it a god a demon some conjurer’s trick I could not tell you and I know all the tricks All I can say for a certainty is that he called it and it answered and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it If Lord Stannis is one such I mean to see him dead

When he was done they rode in silence for a time Finally Tyrion said A harrowing tale I’m sorry
