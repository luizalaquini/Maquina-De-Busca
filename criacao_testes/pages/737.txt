Sansa sat with her hands in her lap watching how the queen moved and laughed and tossed her blonde curls She charms them all she thought dully How I hate her She looked away to where Moon Boy danced with Dontos

Lady Sansa Ser Garlan Tyrell stood beside the dais Would you honor me If your lord consents

The Imp’s mismatched eyes narrowed My lady can dance with whomever she pleases

Perhaps she ought to have remained beside her husband but she wanted to dance so badly… and Ser Garlan was brother to Margaery to Willas to her Knight of Flowers I see why they name you Garlan the Gallant ser she said as she took his hand

My lady is gracious to say so My brother Willas gave me that name as it happens To protect me

To protect you She gave him a puzzled look

Ser Garlan laughed I was a plump little boy I fear and we do have an uncle called Garth the Gross So Willas struck first though not before threatening me with Garlan the Greensick Garlan the Galling and Garlan the Gargoyle

It was so sweet and silly that Sansa had to laugh despite everything Afterward she was absurdly grateful Somehow the laughter made her hopeful again if only for a little while Smiling she let the music take her losing herself in the steps in the sound of flute and pipes and harp in the rhythm of the drum… and from time to time in Ser Garlan’s arms when the dance brought them together My lady wife is most concerned for you he said quietly one such time

Lady Leonette is too sweet Tell her I am well

A bride at her wedding should be more than well His voice was not unkind You seemed close to tears

Tears of joy ser

Your eyes give the lie to your tongue Ser Garlan turned her drew her close to his side My lady I have seen how you look at my brother Loras is valiant and handsome and we all love him dearly… but your Imp will make a better husband He is a bigger man than he seems I think

The music spun them apart before Sansa could think of a reply It was Mace Tyrell opposite her red-faced and sweaty and then Lord Merryweather and then Prince Tommen I want to be married too said the plump little princeling who was all of nine I’m taller than my uncle

I know you are said Sansa before the partners changed again Ser Kevan told her she was beautiful Jalabhar Xho said something she did not understand in the Summer Tongue and Lord Redwyne wished her many fat children and long years of joy And then the dance brought her face-to-face with Joffrey

Sansa stiffened as his hand touched hers but the king tightened his grip and drew her closer You shouldn’t look so sad My uncle is an ugly little thing but you’ll still have me

You’re to marry Margaery

A king can have other women Whores My father did One of the Aegons did too The third one or the fourth He had lots of whores and lots of bastards As they whirled to the music Joff gave her a moist kiss My uncle will bring you to my bed whenever I command it

Sansa shook her head He won’t

He will or I’ll have his head That King Aegon he had any woman he wanted whether they were married or no

Thankfully it was time to change again Her legs had turned to wood though and Lord Rowan Ser Tallad and Elinor’s squire all must have thought her a very clumsy dancer And then she was back with Ser Garlan once more and soon blessedly the dance was over

Her relief was short-lived No sooner had the music died than she heard Joffrey say It’s time to bed them Let’s get the clothes off her and have a look at what the she-wolf’s got to give my uncle Other men took up the cry loudly

Her dwarf husband lifted his eyes slowly from his wine cup I’ll have no bedding

Joffrey seized Sansa’s arm You will if I command it

The Imp slammed his dagger down in the table where it stood quivering Then you’ll service your own bride with a wooden prick I’ll geld you I swear it

A shocked silence fell Sansa pulled away from Joffrey but he had a grip on her and her sleeve ripped No one even seemed to hear Queen Cersei turned to her father Did you hear him

Lord Tywin rose from his seat I believe we can dispense with the bedding Tyrion I am certain you did not mean to threaten the king’s royal person

Sansa saw a spasm of rage pass across her husband’s face I misspoke he said It was a bad jape sire
