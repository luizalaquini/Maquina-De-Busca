them wherefore should they say among the people Where is their God
218 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land and pity his people

219 Yea the LORD will answer and say unto his people Behold I will
send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith
and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen 220 But I
will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him
into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea
and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come
up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great
things

221 Fear not O land be glad and rejoice for the LORD will do great
things

222 Be not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the
wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and
the vine do yield their strength

223 Be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the LORD your
God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will
cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter
rain in the first month

224 And the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall
overflow with wine and oil

225 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten
the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army
which I sent among you

226 And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name
of the LORD your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my
people shall never be ashamed

227 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am
the LORD your God and none else and my people shall never be
ashamed

228 And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see
visions 229 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in
those days will I pour out my spirit

230 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood
and fire and pillars of smoke

231 The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and terrible day of the LORD come

232 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name
of the LORD shall be delivered for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem
shall be deliverance as the LORD hath said and in the remnant whom
the LORD shall call

31 For behold in those days and in that time when I shall bring
again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem 32 I will also gather all
nations and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and
will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel
whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land

33 And they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for an
harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink

34 Yea and what have ye to do with me O Tyre and Zidon and all
the coasts of Palestine will ye render me a recompence and if ye
recompense me swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon
your own head 35 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold and
have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things 36 The
children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto
the Grecians that ye might remove them far from their border

37 Behold I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold
them and will return your recompence upon your own head 38 And I
will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children
of Judah and they shall sell them to the Sabeans to a people far
off for the LORD hath spoken it

39 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles Prepare war wake up the
mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up 310
Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears
let the weak say I am strong

311 Assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather
yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come
down O LORD

312 Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of
Jehoshaphat for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round
about

313 Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you
down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness
is great

314 Multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of
the LORD is near in the valley of decision

315 The sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall
