Lord Snow he heard Soft and meek He turned

Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her Sam’s cloak Jon realized at once Why is she wearing Sam’s cloak The fat one told me I’d find you here m’lord she said

We ate the rabbit if that’s what you came for The admission made him feel absurdly guilty

Old Lord Crow him with the talking bird he gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits Her arms closed over the swell of her belly Is it true m’lord Are you brother to a king

A half brother he admitted I’m Ned Stark’s bastard My brother Robb is the King in the North Why are you here

The fat one that Sam he said to see you He give me his cloak so no one would say I didn’t belong

Won’t Craster be angry with you

My father drank overmuch of the Lord Crow’s wine last night He’ll sleep most of the day Her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs They say the king gives justice and protects the weak She started to climb off the rock awkwardly but the ice had made it slippery and her foot went out from under her Jon caught her before she could fall and helped her safely down The woman knelt on the icy ground M’lord I beg you—

Don’t beg me anything Go back to your hall you shouldn’t be here We were commanded not to speak to Craster’s women

You don’t have to speak with me m’lord Just take me with you when you go that’s all I ask

All she asks he thought As if that were nothing

I’ll… I’ll be your wife if you like My father he’s got nineteen now one less won’t hurt him none

Black brothers are sworn never to take wives don’t you know that And we’re guests in your father’s hall besides

Not you she said I watched You never ate at his board nor slept by his fire He never gave you guest-right so you’re not bound to him It’s for the baby I have to go

I don’t even know your name

Gilly he called me For the gillyflower

That’s pretty He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name He could not help the girl but perhaps the courtesy would please her Is it Craster who frightens you Gilly

For the baby not for me If it’s a girl that’s not so bad she’ll grow a few years and he’ll marry her But Nella says it’s to be a boy and she’s had six and knows these things He gives the boys to the gods Come the white cold he does and of late it comes more often That’s why he started giving them sheep even though he has a taste for mutton Only now the sheep’s gone too Next it will be dogs till… She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly

What gods Jon was remembering that they’d seen no boys in Craster’s Keep nor men either save Craster himself

The cold gods she said The ones in the night The white shadows

And suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commander’s Tower again A severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword it lay writhing fingers opening and closing The dead man rose to his feet blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly yet there was no blood

What color are their eyes he asked her

Blue As bright as blue stars and as cold

She has seen them he thought Craster lied

Will you take me Just so far as the Wall—

We do not ride for the Wall We ride north after Mance Rayder and these Others these white shadows and their wights We seek them Gilly Your babe would not be safe with us

Her fear was plain on her face You will come back though When your warring’s done you’ll pass this way again
