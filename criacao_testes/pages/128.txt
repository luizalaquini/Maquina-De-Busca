Bran shook his head I was just remembering he said Jory brought us here once to fish for trout You and me and Jon Do you remember

I remember Robb said his voice quiet and sad

I didn’t catch anything Bran said but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell Will we ever see Jon again

We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit Robb pointed out Jon will visit too you’ll see

The stream was running high and fast Robb dismounted and led his gelding across the ford In the deepest part of the crossing the water came up to midthigh He tied his horse to a tree on the far side and waded back across for Bran and Dancer The current foamed around rock and root and Bran could feel the spray on his face as Robb led him over It made him smile For a moment he felt strong again and whole He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them right up to the very top with the whole forest spread out beneath him

They were on the far side when they heard the howl a long rising wail that moved through the trees like a cold wind Bran raised his head to listen Summer he said No sooner had he spoken than a second voice joined the first

They’ve made a kill Robb said as he remounted I’d best go and bring them back Wait here Theon and the others should be along shortly

I want to go with you Bran said

I’ll find them faster by myself Robb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees

Once he was gone the woods seemed to close in around Bran The snow was falling more heavily now Where it touched the ground it melted but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white As he waited he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt He could not feel his legs hanging useless in the stirrups but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing and the melting snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin and Joseth and the rest

When he heard the rustle of leaves Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn expecting to see his friends but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers

Good day to you he said nervously One look and Bran knew they were neither foresters nor farmers He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed His surcoat was new dark grey wool with silver buttons and a heavy silver pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders His boots and gloves were lined with fur as well

All alone are you said the biggest of them a bald man with a raw windburnt face Lost in the wolfswood poor lad

I’m not lost Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at him He counted four but when he turned his head he saw two others behind him My brother rode off just a moment ago and my guard will be here shortly

Your guard is it a second man said Grey stubble covered his gaunt face And what would they be guarding my little lord Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak

Pretty said a woman’s voice She scarcely looked like a woman tall and lean with the same hard face as the others her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm The spear she held was eight feet of black oak tipped in rusted steel

Let’s have a look said the big bald man

Bran watched him anxiously The man’s clothes were filthy fallen almost to pieces patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green and faded everywhere to grey but once that cloak might have been black The grey stubbly man wore black rags too he saw with a sudden start Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded the day they had found the wolf pups that man had worn black as well and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night’s Watch No man is more dangerous he remembered Lord Eddard saying The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile or cruel

The pin lad the big man said He held out his hand

We’ll take the horse too said another of them a woman shorter than Robb with a broad fiat face and lank yellow hair Get down and be quick about it A knife slid from her sleeve into her hand its edge jagged as a saw

No Bran blurted I can’t…

The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off You can lordling… and will if you know what’s good for you

Stiv look how he’s strapped on The tall woman pointed with her spear Might be it’s the truth he’s telling

Straps is it Stiv said He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt There’s ways to deal with straps

You some kind of cripple asked the short woman

Bran flared I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and you better let go of my horse or I’ll see you all dead

The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed The boy’s a Stark true enough Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg
