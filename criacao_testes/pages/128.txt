and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one
ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the
land

915 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until
the morning

916 So it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance
of fire by night

917 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after
that the children of Israel journeyed and in the place where the
cloud abode there the children of Israel pitched their tents

918 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed
and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched as long as the cloud
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents

919 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD and journeyed
not

920 And so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle
according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents
and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed

921 And so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they
journeyed

922 Or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of
Israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken
up they journeyed

923 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents and at
the commandment of the LORD they journeyed they kept the charge of
the LORD at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses

101 And the LORD spake unto Moses saying 102 Make thee two
trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the
journeying of the camps

103 And when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation

104 And if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which
are heads of the thousands of Israel shall gather themselves unto
thee

105 When ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward

106 When ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on
the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys

107 But when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall
blow but ye shall not sound an alarm

108 And the sons of Aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations

109 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye
shall be remembered before the LORD your God and ye shall be saved
from your enemies

1010 Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and
in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over
your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings
that they may be to you for a memorial before your God I am the LORD
your God

1011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in
the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony

1012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran

1013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of Moses

1014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
of Judah according to their armies and over his host was Nahshon the
son of Amminadab

1015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
Nethaneel the son of Zuar

1016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
Eliab the son of Helon
