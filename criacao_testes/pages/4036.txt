  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going
off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up
again with a little shriek and went on  `--that begins with an
M such as mouse-traps and the moon and memory and muchness--
you know you say things are much of a muchness--did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness

  `Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused `I
dont think--

  `Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear  she got
up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that
they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot

  `At any rate Ill never go THERE again said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood  `Its the stupidest tea-party I
ever was at in all my life

  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it  `Thats very curious she thought
`But everythings curious today  I think I may as well go in at
once  And in she went

  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the
little glass table  `Now Ill manage better this time she
said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and
unlocking the door that led into the garden  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the
little passage  and THEN--she found herself at last in the
beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queens Croquet-Ground


  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden  the
roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at
it busily painting them red  Alice thought this a very curious
thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say `Look out now Five  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that

  `I couldnt help it said Five in a sulky tone `Seven jogged
my elbow

  On which Seven looked up and said `Thats right Five  Always
lay the blame on others

  `YOUD better not talk said Five  `I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded

  `What for said the one who had spoken first

  `Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven

  `Yes it IS his business said Five `and Ill tell him--it
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions

  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun `Well of all
the unjust things-- when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
others looked round also and all of them bowed low

  `Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly `why you are
painting those roses

  Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two  Two began in a
low voice `Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to
have been a RED rose-tree and we put a white one in by mistake
and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads
cut off you know  So you see Miss were doing our best afore
she comes to--  At this moment Five who had been anxiously
looking across the garden called out `The Queen  The Queen
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces  There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice
looked round eager to see the Queen

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and
feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the
soldiers did  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  Next
came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
noticing her  Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this
