them down unto the water and I will try them for thee there and it
shall be that of whom I say unto thee This shall go with thee the
same shall go with thee and of whomsoever I say unto thee This shall
not go with thee the same shall not go

75 So he brought down the people unto the water and the LORD said
unto Gideon Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a
dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that
boweth down upon his knees to drink

76 And the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their
mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed
down upon their knees to drink water

77 And the LORD said unto Gideon By the three hundred men that
lapped will I save you and deliver the Midianites into thine hand
and let all the other people go every man unto his place

78 So the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and
he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent and retained
those three hundred men and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
valley

79 And it came to pass the same night that the LORD said unto him
Arise get thee down unto the host for I have delivered it into thine
hand

710 But if thou fear to go down go thou with Phurah thy servant down
to the host 711 And thou shalt hear what they say and afterward
shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host Then went
he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that
were in the host

712 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and
their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for
multitude

713 And when Gideon was come behold there was a man that told a
dream unto his fellow and said Behold I dreamed a dream and lo a
cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian and came unto a
tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay
along

714 And his fellow answered and said This is nothing else save the
sword of Gideon the son of Joash a man of Israel for into his hand
hath God delivered Midian and all the host

715 And it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and
the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the
host of Israel and said Arise for the LORD hath delivered into your
hand the host of Midian

716 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he
put a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lamps
within the pitchers

717 And he said unto them Look on me and do likewise and behold
when I come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as I do so
shall ye do

718 When I blow with a trumpet I and all that are with me then blow
ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say The sword
of the LORD and of Gideon

719 So Gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had
but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the
pitchers that were in their hands

720 And the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the
pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in
their right hands to blow withal and they cried The sword of the
LORD and of Gideon

721 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp and
all the host ran and cried and fled

722 And the three hundred blew the trumpets and the LORD set every
mans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the
host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath and to the border of
Abelmeholah unto Tabbath

723 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh and pursued after
the Midianites

724 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim saying
come down against the Midianites and take before them the waters unto
Bethbarah and Jordan Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves
together and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan

725 And they took two princes of the Midianites Oreb and Zeeb and
they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb and Zeeb they slew at the winepress
of Zeeb and pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon on the other side Jordan

81 And the men of Ephraim said unto him Why hast thou served us
thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the
Midianites  And they did chide with him sharply
