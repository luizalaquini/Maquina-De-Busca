Sharna says she needs me to bake bread he’d told her the day they rode Anyhow I’m tired of rain and saddlesores and being scared all the time There’s ale here and rabbit to eat and the bread will be better when I make it You’ll see when you come back You will come back won’t you When the war’s done He remembered who she was then and added My lady reddening

Arya didn’t know if the war would ever be done but she had nodded I’m sorry I beat you that time she said Hot Pie was stupid and craven but he’d been with her all the way from King’s Landing and she’d gotten used to him I broke your nose

You broke Lem’s too Hot Pie grinned That was good

Lem didn’t think so Arya said glumly Then it was time to go When Hot Pie asked if he might kiss milady’s hand she punched his shoulder Don’t call me that You’re Hot Pie and I’m Arry

I’m not Hot Pie here Sharna just calls me Boy The same as she calls the other boy It’s going to be confusing

She missed him more than she thought she would but Harwin made up for it some She had told him about his father Hullen and how she’d found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep the day she fled He always said he’d die in a stable Harwin said but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death not a pack of lions Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King’s Landing as well and much that had happened since but she left out the stableboy she’d stabbed with Needle and the guard whose throat she’d cut to get out of Harrenhal Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know

Nor did she speak of Jaqen H’ghar and the three deaths he’d owed and paid The iron coin he’d given her Arya kept tucked away beneath her belt but sometimes at night she would take it out and remember how his face had melted and changed when he ran his hand across it Valar morghulis she would say under her breath Ser Gregor Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Queen Cersei King Joffrey

Only six Winterfell men remained of the twenty her father had sent west with Beric Dondarrion Harwin told her and they were scattered It was a trap milady Lord Tywin sent his Mountain across the Red Fork with fire and sword hoping to draw your lord father He planned for Lord Eddard to come west himself to deal with Gregor Clegane If he had he would have been killed or taken prisoner and traded for the Imp who was your lady mother’s captive at the time Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord Tywin’s plan and when he heard about his brother’s capture he attacked your father in the streets of King’s Landing

I remember said Arya He killed Jory Jory had always smiled at her when he wasn’t telling her to get from underfoot

He killed Jory Harwin agreed and your father’s leg was broken when his horse fell on him So Lord Eddard couldn’t go west He sent Lord Beric instead with twenty of his own men and twenty from Winterfell me among them There were others besides Thoros and Ser Raymun Darry and their men Ser Gladden Wylde a lord named Lothar Mallery But Gregor was waiting for us at the Mummer’s Ford with men concealed on both banks As we crossed he fell upon us from front and rear

I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that it took Darry’s arm off at the elbow and killed the horse beneath him too Gladden Wylde died there with him and Lord Mallery was ridden down and drowned We had lions on every side and I thought I was doomed with the rest but Alyn shouted commands and restored order to our ranks and those still a horse rallied around Thoros and cut our way free Six score we’d been that morning By dark no more than two score were left and Lord Beric was gravely wounded Thoros drew a foot of lance from his chest that night and poured boiling wine into the hole it left

Every man of us was certain his lordship would be dead by daybreak But Thoros prayed with him all night beside the fire and when dawn came he was still alive and stronger than he’d been It was a fortnight before he could mount a horse but his courage kept us strong He told us that our war had not ended at the Mummer’s Ford but only begun there and that every man of ours who’d fallen would be avenged tenfold

By then the fighting had passed by us The Mountain’s men were only the van of Lord Tywin’s host They crossed the Red Fork in strength and swept up into the riverlands burning everything in their path We were so few that all we could do was harry their rear but we told each other that we’d join up with King Robert when he marched west to crush Lord Tywin’s rebellion Only then we heard that Robert was dead and Lord Eddard as well and Cersei Lannister’s whelp had ascended the Iron Throne

That turned the whole world on its head We’d been sent out by the King’s Hand to deal with outlaws you see but now we were the outlaws and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King There was some wanted to yield then but Lord Beric wouldn’t hear of it We were still king’s men he said and these were the king’s people the lions were savaging If we could not fight for Robert we would fight for them until every man of us was dead And so we did but as we fought something queer happened For every man we lost two showed up to take his place A few were knights or squires of gentle birth but most were common men—fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps servants and shoemakers even two septons Men of all sorts and women too children dogs…

Dogs said Arya

Aye Harwin grinned One of our lads keeps the meanest dogs you’d ever want to see

I wish I had a good mean dog said Arya wistfully A lion-killing dog She’d had a direwolf once Nymeria but she’d thrown rocks at her until she fled to keep the queen from killing her Could a direwolf kill a lion she wondered

It rained again that afternoon and long into the evening Thankfully the outlaws had secret friends all over so they did not need to camp out in the open or seek shelter beneath some leaky bower as she and Hot Pie and Gendry had done so often

That night they sheltered in a burned abandoned village At least it seemed to be abandoned until Jack-Be-Lucky blew two short blasts and two long ones on his hunting horn Then all sorts of people came crawling out of the ruins and up from secret cellars They had ale and dried apples and some stale barley bread and the outlaws had a goose that Anguy had brought down on the ride so supper that night was almost a feast

Arya was sucking the last bit of meat off a wing when one of the villagers turned to Lem Lemoncloak and said There were men through here not two days past looking for the Kingslayer

Lem snorted They’d do better looking in Riverrun Down in the deepest dungeons where it’s nice and damp His nose looked like a squashed apple red and raw and swollen and his mood was foul

No another villager said He’s escaped

The Kingslayer Arya could feel the hair on the back of her neck prickling She held her breath to listen

Could that be true Tom o’ Sevens said

I’ll not believe it said the one-eyed man in the rusty pothelm The other outlaws called him Jack-Be-Lucky though losing an eye didn’t seem very lucky to Arya I’ve had me a taste o’ them dungeons How could he escape

The villagers could only shrug at that Greenbeard stroked his thick grey-and-green whiskers and said The wolves will drown in blood if the Kingslayer’s loose again Thoros must be told The Lord of Light will show him Lannister in the flames

There’s a fine fire burning here said Anguy smiling
