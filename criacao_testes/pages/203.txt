Varys tsked Cersei will not want to hear that I promise you Stannis may win the throne but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours Sansa begged so sweetly it would be a shame if you threw it all away You are being given your life back if you’ll take it Cersei is no fool She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one

You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king butchered my men and crippled my son Ned’s voice was thick with disbelief

I want you to serve the realm Varys said Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason command your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis and pledge to carry her secret to your grave I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall with your brother and that baseborn son of yours

The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame and a sorrow too deep for words If only he could see the boy again sit and talk with him… pain shot through his broken leg beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast He winced his fingers opening and closing helplessly Is this your own scheme he gasped out at Varys or are you in league with Littlefinger

That seemed to amuse the eunuch I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms Oh I feed him choice whispers sufficient so that he thinks I am his… just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers

And just as you let me believe that you were mine Tell me Lord Varys who do you truly serve

Varys smiled thinly Why the realm my good lord how ever could you doubt that I swear it by my lost manhood I serve the realm and the realm needs peace He finished the last swallow of wine and tossed the empty skin aside So what is your answer Lord Eddard Give me your word that you’ll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling

If I did my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor My life is not so precious to me as that

Pity The eunuch stood And your daughter’s life my lord How precious is that

A chill pierced Ned’s heart My daughter…

Surely you did not think I’d forgotten about your sweet innocent my lord The queen most certainly has not

No Ned pleaded his voice cracking Varys gods have mercy do as you like with me but leave my daughter out of your schemes Sansa’s no more than a child

Rhaenys was a child too Prince Rhaegar’s daughter A precious little thing younger than your girls She had a small black kitten she called Balerion did you know I always wondered what happened to him Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion the Black Dread of old but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough the day they broke down her door Varys gave a long weary sigh the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders The High Septon once told me that as we sin so do we suffer If that’s true Lord Eddard tell me… why is it always the innocents who suffer most when you high lords play your game of thrones Ponder it if you would while you wait upon the queen And spare a thought for this as well The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your pain… or he could bring you Sansa’s head

The choice my dear lord Hand is entirely yours





CATELYN

As the host trooped down the causeway through the black bogs of the Neck and spilled out into the riverlands beyond Catelyn’s apprehensions grew She masked her fears behind a face kept still and stern yet they were there all the same growing with every league they crossed Her days were anxious her nights restless and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth

She feared for her lord father and wondered at his ominous silence She feared for her brother Edmure and prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the Kingslayer in battle She feared for Ned and her girls and for the sweet sons she had left behind at Winterfell And yet there was nothing she could do for any of them and so she made herself put all thought of them aside You must save your strength for Robb she told herself He is the only one you can help You must be as fierce and hard as the north Catelyn Tully You must be a Stark for true now like your son

Robb rode at the front of the column beneath the flapping white banner of Winterfell Each day he would ask one of his lords to join him so they might confer as they marched he honored every man in turn showing no favorites listening as his lord father had listened weighing the words of one against the other He has learned so much from Ned she thought as she watched him but has he learned enough

The Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to screen their movements and scout the way The reports Ser Brynden’s riders brought back did little to reassure her Lord Tywin’s host was still many days to the south… but Walder Frey Lord of the Crossing had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork

Late again Catelyn murmured when she heard It was the Trident all over damn the man Her brother Edmure had called the banners by rights Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun yet here he sat

Four thousand men Robb repeated more perplexed than angry Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself Surely he means to join his power to ours

Does he Catelyn asked She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover his companion of the day The vanguard spread out behind them a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears I wonder Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you will never be surprised

He’s your father’s bannerman

Some men take their oaths more seriously than others Robb And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister’s sister That means little of itself to be sure Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years and they must needs marry someone Still…

Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters my lady Robett Glover asked gravely
