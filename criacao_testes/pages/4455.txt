You will talk of naught The sharpness was back in Luwin’s voice You are still a child of eight   

Almost nine

Eight the maester repeated firmly Speak nothing but courtesies unless Ser Rodrik or Lord Wyman puts you a question

Bran nodded I’ll remember

I will say nothing to Ser Rodrik of what passed between you and the Frey boys

Thank you

They put Bran in his father’s oak chair with the grey velvet cushions behind a long plank-and-trestle table Ser Rodrik sat on his right hand and Maester Luwin to his left armed with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired Bran ran a hand across the rough wood of the table and begged Lord Wyman’s pardons for being late

Why no prince is ever late the Lord of White Harbor responded amiably Those who arrive before him have come early that’s all Wyman Manderly had a great booming laugh It was small wonder he could not sit a saddle he looked as if he outweighed most horses As windy as he was vast he began by asking Winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he had appointed for White Harbor The old ones had been holding back silver for King’s Landing rather than paying it over to the new King in the North King Robb needs his own coinage as well he declared and White Harbor is the very place to mint it He offered to take charge of the matter as it please the king and went from that to speak of how he had strengthened the port’s defenses detailing the cost of every improvement

In addition to a mint Lord Manderly also proposed to build Robb a warfleet We have had no strength at sea for hundreds of years since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his father’s ships Grant me the gold and within the year I will float you sufficient galleys to take Dragonstone and King’s Landing both

Bran’s interest pricked up at talk of warships No one asked him but he thought Lord Wyman’s notion a splendid one In his mind’s eye he could see them already He wondered if a cripple had ever commanded a warship But Ser Rodrik promised only to send the proposal on to Robb for his consideration while Maester Luwin scratched at the parchment

Midday came and went Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the kitchens and they dined in the solar on cheese capons and brown oatbread While tearing apart a bird with fat fingers Lord Wyman made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood who was a cousin of his She was born a Manderly you know Perhaps when her grief has run its course she would like to be a Manderly again eh He took a bite from a wing and smiled broadly As it happens I am a widower these past eight years Past time I took another wife don’t you agree my lords A man does get lonely Tossing the bones aside he reached for a leg Or if the lady fancies a younger lad well my son Wendel is unwed as well He is off south guarding Lady Catelyn but no doubt he will wish to take a bride on his return A valiant boy and jolly Just the man to teach her to laugh again eh He wiped a bit of grease off his chin with the sleeve of his tunic

Bran could hear the distant clash of arms through the windows He cared nothing about marriages I wish I was down in the yard

His lordship waited until the table had been cleared before he raised the matter of a letter he had received from Lord Tywin Lannister who held his elder son Ser Wylis taken captive on the Green Fork He offers him back to me without ransom provided I withdraw my levies from His Grace and vow to fight no more

You will refuse him of course said Ser Rodrik

Have no fear on that count the lord assured them King Robb has no more loyal servant than Wyman Manderly I would be loath to see my son languish at Harrenhal any longer than he must however That is an ill place Cursed they say Not that I am the sort to swallow such tales but still there it is Look at what’s befallen this Janos Slynt Raised up to Lord of Harrenhal by the queen and cast down by her brother Shipped off to the Wall they say I pray some equitable exchange of captives can be arranged before too very long I know Wylis would not want to sit out the rest of the war Gallant that son of mine and fierce as a mastiff

Bran’s shoulders were stiff from sitting in the same chair by the time the audience drew to a close And that night as he sat to supper a horn sounded to herald the arrival of another guest Lady Donella Hornwood brought no tail of knights and retainers only herself and six tired men-at-arms with a moosehead badge on their dusty orange livery We are very sorry for all you have suffered my lady Bran said when she came before him to speak her words of greetings Lord Hornwood had been killed in the battle on the Green Fork their only son cut down in the Whispering Wood Winterfell will remember

That is good to know She was a pale husk of a woman every line of her face etched with grief I am very weary my lord If I might have leave to rest I should be thankful

To be sure Ser Rodrik said There is time enough for talk on the morrow

When the morrow came most of the morning was given over to talk of grains and greens and salting meat Once the maesters in their Citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn wise men put away a portion of each harvest    though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to require much talk Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest At Maester Luwin’s suggestion she vowed to increase that to a quarter

Bolton’s bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort she warned them I hope he means to take them south to join his father at the Twins but when I sent to ask his intent he told me that no Bolton would be questioned by a woman As if he were trueborn and had a right to that name

Lord Bolton has never acknowledged the boy so far as I know Ser Rodrik said I confess I do not know him

Few do she replied He lived with his mother until two years past when young Domeric died and left Bolton without an heir That was when he brought his bastard to the Dreadfort The boy is a sly creature by all accounts and he has a servant who is almost as cruel as he is Reek they call the man It’s said he never bathes They hunt together the Bastard and this Reek and not for deer I’ve heard tales things I can scarce believe even of a Bolton And now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the gods the Bastard looks at my lands hungrily

Bran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend her rights but Ser Rodrik only said He may look but should he do more I promise you there will be dire retribution You will be safe enough my lady    though perhaps in time when your grief is passed you may find it prudent to wed again

I am past my childbearing years what beauty I had long fled she replied with a tired half smile yet men come sniffing after me as they never did when I was a maid

You do not look favorably on these suitors asked Luwin

I shall wed again if His Grace commands it Lady Hornwood replied but Mors Crowfood is a drunken brute and older than my father As for my noble cousin of Manderly my lord’s bed is not large enough to hold one of his majesty and I am surely too small and frail to lie beneath him

Bran knew that men slept on top of women when they shared a bed Sleeping under Lord Manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse he imagined Ser Rodrik gave the widow a sympathetic nod You will have other suitors my lady We shall try and find you a prospect more to your taste

Perhaps you need not look very far ser

After she had taken her leave Maester Luwin smiled Ser Rodrik I do believe my lady fancies you

Ser Rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable

She was very sad said Bran

Ser Rodrik nodded Sad and gentle and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years for all her modesty Yet a danger to the peace of your brother’s realm nonetheless

Her Bran said astonished

Maester Luwin answered With no direct heir there are sure to be many claimants contending for the Hornwood lands The Tallharts Flints and Karstarks all have ties to House Hornwood through the female line and the Glovers are fostering Lord Harys’s bastard at Deepwood Motte The Dreadfort has no claim that I know but the lands adjoin and Roose Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance

Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers In such cases her liege lord must find her a suitable match

Why can’t you marry her Bran asked You said she was comely and Beth would have a mother

The old knight put a hand on Bran’s arm A kindly thought my prince but I am only a knight and besides too old I might hold her lands for a few years but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find herself back in the same mire and Beth’s prospects might be perilous as well

Then let Lord Hornwood’s bastard be the heir Bran said thinking of his half brother Jon

Ser Rodrik said That would please the Glovers and perhaps Lord Hornwood’s shade as well but I do not think Lady Hornwood would love us The boy is not of her blood

Still said Maester Luwin it must be considered Lady Donella is past her fertile years as she said herself If not the bastard who

May I be excused Bran could hear the squires at their swordplay in the yard below the ring of steel on steel

As you will my prince said Ser Rodrik You did well Bran flushed with pleasure Being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared and since Lady Hornwood had been so much briefer than Lord Manderly he even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with Summer He liked to spend time with his wolf every day when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed it

No sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than Summer emerged from under an oak almost as if he had known they were coming Bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching from the undergrowth as well Shaggy he called Here Shaggydog To me But Rickon’s wolf vanished as swiftly as he’d appeared

Hodor knew Bran’s favorite place so he took him to the edge of the pool beneath the great spread of the heart tree where Lord Eddard used to kneel to pray Ripples were running across the surface of the water when they arrived making the reflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance There was no wind though For an instant Bran was baffled

And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash so sudden that even Summer leapt back snarling Hodor jumped away wailing Hodor Hodor in dismay until Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears How can you swim in there he asked Osha Isn’t it cold

As a babe I suckled on icicles boy I like the cold Osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping She was naked her skin bumpy with gooseprickles Summer crept close and sniffed at her I wanted to touch the bottom

I never knew there was a bottom

Might be there isn’t She grinned What are you staring at boy Never seen a woman before

I have so Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he’d seen serving women in the hot pools too Osha looked different though hard and sharp instead of soft and curvy Her legs were all sinew her breasts flat as two empty purses You’ve got a lot of scars

Every one hard earned She picked up her brown shift shook some leaves off of it and pulled it down over her head
