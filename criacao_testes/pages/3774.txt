Notch said Blane and twenty black arrows were pulled from as many quivers and notched to as many bowstrings

Gods be good there’s hundreds a voice said softly

Draw Blane said and then hold Sam could not see and did not want to see The men of the Night’s Watch stood behind their torches waiting with arrows pulled back to their ears as something came up that dark slippery slope through the snow Hold Blane said again hold hold And then Loose

The arrows whispered as they flew

A ragged cheer went up from the men along the ringwall but it died quickly They’re not stopping m’lord a man said to Blane and another shouted More Look there coming from the trees and yet another said Gods ha’ mercy they’s crawling They’s almost here they’s on us Sam had been backing away by then shaking like the last leaf on the tree when the wind kicks up as much from cold as from fear It had been very cold that night Even colder than now The snow feels almost warm I feel better now A little rest was all I needed Maybe in a little while I’ll be strong enough to walk again In a little while

A horse stepped past his head a shaggy grey beast with snow in its mane and hooves crusted with ice Sam watched it come and watched it go Another appeared from out of the falling snow with a man in black leading it When he saw Sam in his path he cursed him and led the horse around I wish I had a horse he thought If I had a horse I could keep going I could sit and even sleep some in the saddle Most of their mounts had been lost at the Fist though and those that remained carried their food their torches and their wounded Sam wasn’t wounded Only fat and weak and the greatest craven in the Seven Kingdoms

He was such a coward Lord Randyll his father had always said so and he had been right Sam was his heir but he had never been worthy so his father had sent him away to the Wall His little brother Dickon would inherit the Tarly lands and castle and the greatsword Heartsbane that the lords of Horn Hill had borne so proudly for centuries He wondered whether Dickon would shed a tear for his brother who died in the snow somewhere off beyond the edge of the world Why should he A coward’s not worth weeping over He had heard his father tell his mother as much half a hundred times The Old Bear knew it too

Fire arrows the Lord Commander roared that night on the Fist when he appeared suddenly astride his horse give them flame It was then he noticed Sam there quaking Tarly Get out of here Your place is with the ravens

I… I… I got the messages away

Good On Mormont’s shoulder his own raven echoed Good good

The Lord Commander looked huge in fur and mail Behind his black iron visor his eyes were fierce You’re in the way here Go back to your cages If I need to send another message I don’t want to have to find you first See that the birds are ready He did not wait for a response but turned his horse and trotted around the ring shouting Fire Give them fire

Sam did not need to be told twice He went back to the birds as fast as his fat legs could carry him I should write the message ahead of time he thought so we can get the birds away as fast as need be It took him longer than it should have to light his little fire to warm the frozen ink He sat beside it on a rock with quill and parchment and wrote his messages

Attacked amidst snow and cold but we’ve thrown them back with fire arrows he wrote as he heard Thoren Smallwood’s voice ring out with a command of Notch draw… loose The flight of arrows made a sound as sweet as a mother’s prayer Burn you dead bastards burn Dywen sang out cackling The brothers cheered and cursed All safe he wrote We remain on the Fist of the First Men Sam hoped they were better archers than him

He put that note aside and found another blank parchment Still fighting on the Fist amidst heavy snow he wrote when someone shouted They’re still coming Result uncertain Spears someone said It might have been Ser Mallador but Sam could not swear to it Wights attacked us on the Fist in snow he wrote but we drove them off with fire He turned his head Through the drifting snow all he could see was the huge fire at the center of the camp with mounted men moving restlessly around it The reserve he knew ready to ride down anything that breached the ringwall They had armed themselves with torches in place of swords and were lighting them in the flames

Wights all around us he wrote when he heard the shouts from the north face Coming up from north and south at once Spears and swords don’t stop them only fire Loose loose loose a voice screamed in the night and another shouted Bloody huge and a third voice said A giant and a fourth insisted A bear a bear A horse shrieked and the hounds began to bay and there was so much shouting that Sam couldn’t make out the voices anymore He wrote faster note after note Dead wildlings and a giant or maybe a bear on us all around He heard the crash of steel on wood which could only mean one thing Wights over the ringwall Fighting inside the camp A dozen mounted brothers pounded past him toward the east wall burning brands streaming flames in each rider’s hand Lord Commander Mormont is meeting them with fire We’ve won We’re winning We’re holding our own We’re cutting our way free and retreating for the Wall We’re trapped on the Fist hard pressed

One of the Shadow Tower men came staggering out of the darkness to fall at Sam’s feet He crawled within a foot of the fire before he died Lost Sam wrote the battle’s lost We’re all lost

Why must he remember the fight at the Fist He didn’t want to remember Not that He tried to make himself remember his mother or his little sister Talla or that girl Gilly at Craster’s Keep Someone was shaking him by the shoulder Get up a voice said Sam you can’t go to sleep here Get up and keep walking

I wasn’t asleep I was remembering Go away he said his words frosting in the cold air I’m well I want to rest

Get up Grenn’s voice harsh and husky He loomed over Sam his blacks crusty with snow There’s no resting the Old Bear said You’ll die

Grenn He smiled No truly I’m good here You just go on I’ll catch you after I’ve rested a bit longer

You won’t Grenn’s thick brown beard was frozen all around his mouth It made him look like some old man You’ll freeze or the Others will get you Sam get up

The night before they left the Wall Pyp had teased Grenn the way he did Sam remembered smiling and saying how Grenn was a good choice for the ranging since he was too stupid to be terrified Grenn hotly denied it until he realized what he was saying He was stocky and thick-necked and strong—Ser Alliser Thorne had called him Aurochs the same way he called Sam Ser Piggy and Jon Lord Snow—but he had always treated Sam nice enough That was only because of Jon though If it weren’t for Jon none of them would have liked me And now Jon was gone lost in the Skirling Pass with Qhorin Halfhand most likely dead Sam would have cried for him but those tears would only freeze as well and he could scarcely keep his eyes open now

A tall brother with a torch stopped beside them and for a wonderful moment Sam felt the warmth on his face Leave him the man said to Grenn If they can’t walk they’re done Save your strength for yourself Grenn

He’ll get up Grenn replied He only needs a hand

The man moved on taking the blessed warmth with him Grenn tried to pull Sam to his feet That hurts he complained Stop it Grenn you’re hurting my arm Stop it

You’re too bloody heavy Grenn jammed his hands into Sam’s armpits gave a grunt and hauled him upright But the moment he let go the fat boy sat back down in the snow Grenn kicked him a solid thump that cracked the crust of snow around his boot and sent it flying everywhere Get up He kicked him again Get up and walk You have to walk

Sam fell over sideways curling up into a tight ball to protect himself from the kicks He hardly felt them through all his wool and leather and mail but even so they hurt I thought Grenn was my friend You shouldn’t kick your friends Why won’t they let me be I just need to rest that’s all to rest and sleep some and maybe die a little

If you take the torch I can take the fat boy

Suddenly he was jerked up into the cold air away from his sweet soft snow he was floating There was an arm under his knees and another one under his back Sam raised his head and blinked A face loomed close a broad brutal face with a flat nose and small dark eyes and a thicket of coarse brown beard He had seen the face before but it took him a moment to remember Paul Small Paul Melting ice ran down into his eyes from the heat of the torch Can you carry him he heard Grenn ask

I carried a calf once was heavier than him I carried him down to his mother so he could get a drink of milk

Sam’s head bobbed up and down with every step that Small Paul took Stop it he muttered put me down I’m not a baby I’m a man of the Night’s Watch He sobbed Just let me die

Be quiet Sam said Grenn Save your strength Think about your sisters and brother Maester Aemon Your favorite foods Sing a song if you like

Aloud

In your head

Sam knew a hundred songs but when he tried to think of one he couldn’t The words had all gone from his head He sobbed again and said I don’t know any songs Grenn I did know some but now I don’t

Yes you do said Grenn How about ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’ everybody knows that one A bear there was a bear a bear All black and brown and covered with hair

No not that one Sam pleaded The bear that had come up the Fist had no hair left on its rotted flesh He didn’t want to think about bears No songs Please Grenn

Think about your ravens then

They were never mine They were the Lord Commander’s ravens the ravens of the Night’s Watch They belonged to Castle Black and the Shadow Tower

Small Paul frowned Chett said I could have the Old Bear’s raven the one that talks I saved food for it and everything He shook his head I forgot though I left the food where I hid it He plodded onward pale white breath coming from his mouth with every step then suddenly said Could I have one of your ravens Just the one I’d never let Lark eat it

They’re gone said Sam I’m sorry So sorry They’re flying back to the Wall now He had set the birds free when he’d heard the warhorns sound once more calling the Watch to horse Two short blasts and a long one that was the call to mount up But there was no reason to mount unless to abandon the Fist and that meant the battle was lost The fear bit him so strong then that it was all Sam could do to open the cages Only as he watched the last raven flap up into the snowstorm did he realize that he had forgotten to send any of the messages he’d written

No he’d squealed oh no oh no The snow fell and the horns blew ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo they cried to horse to horse to horse Sam saw two ravens perched on a rock and ran after them but the birds flapped off lazily through the swirling snow in opposite directions He chased one his breath puffing out his nose in thick white clouds stumbled and found himself ten feet from the ringwall

After that… he remembered the dead coming over the stones with arrows in their faces and through their throats Some were all in ringmail and some were almost naked… wildlings most of them but a few wore faded blacks He remembered one of the Shadow Tower men shoving his spear through a wight’s pale soft belly and out his back and how the thing staggered right up the shaft and reached out his black hands and twisted the brother’s head around until blood came out his mouth That was when his bladder let go the first time he was almost sure

He did not remember running but he must have because the next he knew he was near the fire half a camp away with old Ser Ottyn Wythers and some archers Ser Ottyn was on his knees in the snow staring at the chaos around them until a riderless horse came by and kicked him in the face The archers paid him no mind They were loosing fire arrows at shadows in the dark Sam saw one wight hit saw the flames engulf it but there were a dozen more behind it and a huge pale shape that must have been the bear and soon enough the bowmen had no arrows

And then Sam found himself on a horse It wasn’t his own horse and he never recalled mounting up either Maybe it was the horse that had smashed Ser Ottyn’s face in The horns were still blowing so he kicked the horse and turned him toward the sound

In the midst of carnage and chaos and blowing snow he found Dolorous Edd sitting on his garron with a plain black banner on a spear Sam Edd said when he saw him would you wake me please I am having this terrible nightmare

More men were mounting up every moment The warhorns called them back Ahooo ahooo ahooooooooooooooooooo They’re over the west wall m’lord Thoren Smallwood screamed at the Old Bear as he fought to control his horse I’ll send reserves…

NO Mormont had to bellow at the top of his lungs to be heard over the horns Call them back we have to cut our way out He stood in his stirrups his black cloak snapping in the wind the fire shining off his armor Spearhead he roared Form wedge we ride Down the south face then east

My lord the south slope’s crawling with them

The others are too steep Mormont said We have—
