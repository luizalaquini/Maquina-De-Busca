Yes Ned said grimly Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news Small wonder he had slept so badly

Ser Barristan’s look was troubled They say night’s beauties fade at dawn and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light

They say so Ned agreed but not of Robert Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado but Robert Baratheon would remember and remembering would never back down

The king’s pavilion was close by the water and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps of grey It was all of golden silk the largest and grandest structure in the camp Outside the entrance Robert’s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon

Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep but luck was not with him They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor Your Grace one was saying almost in tears it’s made too small it won’t go He fumbled and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert’s thick neck tumbled to the ground

Seven hells Robert swore Do I have to do it myself Piss on the both of you Pick it up Don’t just stand there gaping Lancel pick it up The lad jumped and the king noticed his company Look at these oafs Ned My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me and they’re worse than useless Can’t even put a man’s armor on him properly Squires they say I say they’re swineherds dressed up in silk

Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty The boys are not at fault he told the king You’re too fat for your armor Robert

Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said darkly Fat Fat is it Is that how you speak to your king He let go his laughter sudden as a storm Ah damn you Ned why are you always right

The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them You Yes both of you You heard the Hand The king is too fat for his armor Go find Ser Aron Santagar Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher Now What are you waiting for

The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent Robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone Then he dropped back into a chair shaking with laughter

Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him Even Eddard Stark managed a smile Always though the graver thoughts crept in He could not help taking note of the two squires handsome boys fair and well made One was Sansa’s age with long golden curls the other perhaps fifteen sandy-haired with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen

Ah I wish I could be there to see Santagar’s face Robert said I hope he’ll have the wit to send them to someone else We ought to keep them running all day

Those boys Ned asked him Lannisters

Robert nodded wiping tears from his eyes Cousins Sons of Lord Tywin’s brother One of the dead ones Or perhaps the live one now that I come to think on it I don’t recall My wife comes from a very large family Ned

A very ambitious family Ned thought He had nothing against the squires but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen’s kin waking and sleeping The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night

The mirth curdled on Robert’s face The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee She’s sulking in the castle now damn her Your sister would never have shamed me like that

You never knew Lyanna as I did Robert Ned told him You saw her beauty but not the iron underneath She would have told you that you have no business in the melee

You too The king frowned You are a sour man Stark Too long in the north all the juices have frozen inside you Well mine are still running He slapped his chest to prove it

You are the king Ned reminded him

I sit on the damn iron seat when I must Does that mean I don’t have the same hungers as other men A bit of wine now and again a girl squealing in bed the feel of a horse between my legs Seven hells Ned I want to hit someone

Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up Your Grace he said it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee It would not be a fair contest Who would dare strike you

Robert seemed honestly taken aback Why all of them damn it If they can And the last man left standing…

…will be you Ned finished He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert but this touched on his pride Ser Barristan is right There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you

The king rose to his feet his face flushed Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win

For a certainty Ned said and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord

For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak He strode across the tent whirled strode back his face dark and angry He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury Selmy dodged Get out the king said then coldly Get out before I kill you

Ser Barristan left quickly Ned was about to follow when the king called out again Not you Ned

Ned turned back Robert took up his horn again filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner and thrust it at Ned Drink he said brusquely

I’ve no thirst—

Drink Your king commands it

Ned took the horn and drank The beer was black and thick so strong it stung the eyes

Robert sat down again Damn you Ned Stark You and Jon Arryn I loved you both What have you done to me You were the one should have been king you or Jon

You had the better claim Your Grace

I told you to drink not to argue You made me king you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk damn you Look at me Ned Look at what kinging has done to me Gods too fat for my armor how did it ever come to this

Robert…

Drink and stay quiet the king is talking I swear to you I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne or so dead as now that I’ve won it And Cersei… I have Jon Arryn to thank for her I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me but Jon said the realm needed an heir Cersei Lannister would be a good match he told me she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s throne The king shook his head I loved that old man I swear it but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy Oh Cersei is lovely to look at truly but cold… the way she guards her cunt you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs Here give me that beer if you won’t drink it He took the horn upended it belched wiped his mouth I am sorry for your girl Ned Truly About the wolf I mean My son was lying I’d stake my soul on it My son… you love your children don’t you

With all my heart Ned said

Let me tell you a secret Ned More than once I have dreamed of giving up the crown Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer spend my time warring and whoring that’s what I was made for The sellsword king how the singers would love me You know what stops me The thought of Joffrey on the throne with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear My son How could I have made a son like that Ned

He’s only a boy Ned said awkwardly He had small liking for Prince Joffrey but he could hear the pain in Robert’s voice Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age

It would not trouble me if the boy was wild Ned You don’t know him as I do He sighed and shook his head Ah perhaps you are right Jon despaired of me often enough yet I grew into a good king Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence You might speak up and agree now you know

Your Grace… Ned began carefully

Robert slapped Ned on the back Ah say that I’m a better king than Aerys and be done with it You never could lie for love nor honor Ned Stark I’m still young and now that you’re here with me things will be different We’ll make this a reign to sing of and damn the Lannisters to seven hells I smell bacon Who do you think our champion will be today Have you seen Mace Tyrell’s boy The Knight of Flowers they call him Now there’s a son any man would be proud to own to Last tourney he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump you ought to have seen the look on Cersei’s face I laughed till my sides hurt Renly says he has this sister a maid of fourteen lovely as a dawn…

They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon at a trestle table by the river’s edge The king’s melancholy melted away with the morning mist and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys …had given Jon a barrel of oranges remember Only the things had gone rotten so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose You remember Redfort’s pock-faced squire He tossed one back at me and before Jon could so much as fart there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction He laughed uproariously and even Ned smiled remembering

This was the boy he had grown up with he thought this was the Robert Baratheon he’d known and loved If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn this man would listen Then Cersei would fall and the Kingslayer with her and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident He could see it all so clearly

That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time and afterward his smiles came easier and more often until it was time for the tournament to resume

Ned walked with the king to the jousting field He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa Septa Mordane was ill today and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting As he saw Robert to his place he noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear the place beside the king was empty That too gave Ned cause to hope

He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the day’s first joust Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his arrival

Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear He wore an olive-green cloak over his soot-grey armor That and his hound’s-head helm were his only concession to ornament

A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered the lists riding an elegant blood bay destrier The horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail and Jaime glittered from head to heel Even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles

Done Lord Renly shouted back The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning
