Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle saw what was happening and dropped everything but his dagger Is it a fight he asked

I guess said Hot Pie scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw Arya could not believe what she was seeing She hated Hot Pie Why would he risk himself for her

The one with the broken nose still thought it was funny You girls put away them rocks and sticks before you get spanked None of you knows what end of a sword to hold

I do Arya wouldn’t let them die for her like Syrio She wouldn’t Shoving through the hedge with Needle in hand she slid into a water dancer’s stance

Broken Nose guffawed The officer looked her up and down Put the blade away little girl no one wants to hurt you

I’m not a girl she yelled furious What was wrong with them They rode all this way for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her I’m the one you want

He’s the one we want The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull who’d come forward to stand beside her Praed’s cheap steel in his hand

But it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren even for an instant Quick as that the black brother’s sword was pressed to the apple of the officer’s throat Neither’s the one you get less you want me to see if your apple’s ripe yet I got me ten fifteen more brothers in that inn if you still need convincing I was you I’d let loose of that gutcutter spread my cheeks over that fat little horse and gallop on back to the city He spat and poked harder with the point of his sword Now

The officer’s fingers uncurled His sword fell in the dust

We’ll just keep that Yoren said Good steel’s always needed on the Wall

As you say For now Men The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up You’d best scamper up to that Wall of yours in a hurry old man The next time I catch you I believe I’ll have your head to go with the bastard boy’s

Better men than you have tried Yoren slapped the rump of the officer’s horse with the flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad His men followed

When they were out of sight Hot Pie began to whoop but Yoren looked angrier than ever Fool You think he’s done with us Next time he won’t prance up and hand me no damn ribbon Get the rest out o’ them baths we need to be moving Ride all night maybe we can stay ahead o’ them for a bit He scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped Who wants this

Me Hot Pie yelled

Don’t be using it on Arry He handed the boy the sword hilt first and walked over to Arya but it was the Bull he spoke to Queen wants you bad boy

Arya was lost Why should she want him

The Bull scowled at her Why should she want you You’re nothing but a little gutter rat

Well you’re nothing but a bastard boy Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy What’s your true name

Gendry he said like he wasn’t quite sure

Don’t see why no one wants neither o’ you Yoren said but they can’t have you regardless You ride them two coursers First sight of a gold cloak make for the Wall like a dragon’s on your tail The rest o’ us don’t mean spit to them

Except for you Arya pointed out That man said he’d take your head too

Well as to that Yoren said if he can get it off my shoulders he’s welcome to it





JON

Sam Jon called softly

The air smelled of paper and dust and years Before him tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp Jon blew out the taper he carried preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper Instead he followed the light wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings All in black he was a shadow among shadows dark of hair long of face grey of eye Black moleskin gloves covered his hands the right because it was burned the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove

Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall The glow came from the lamp hung over his head He looked up at the sound of Jon’s steps

Have you been here all night

Have I Sam looked startled

You didn’t break your fast with us and your bed hadn’t been slept in Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted but Jon never believed it Desertion required its own sort of courage and Sam had little enough of that

Is it morning Down here there’s no way to know

Sam you’re a sweet fool Jon said You’ll miss that bed when we’re sleeping on the cold hard ground I promise you

Sam yawned Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander I never thought    Jon the books have you ever seen their like There are thousands

He gazed about him The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred Did you find the maps

Oh yes Sam’s hand swept over the table fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him A dozen at the least He unfolded a square of parchment The paint has faded but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages and there’s another book    where is it now I was reading it a moment ago He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather This he said reverently is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore written by a ranger named Redwyn It’s not dated but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North so it must be from before the Conquest Jon they fought giants Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest it’s all here Ever so delicately he turned pages with a finger He drew maps as well see   

Maybe you could write an account of our ranging Sam

He’d meant to sound encouraging but it was the wrong thing to say The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly There’s more maps If I had time to search    everything’s a jumble I could set it all to order though I know I could but it would take time    well years in truth

Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that Jon plucked a scroll from a bin blew off the worst of the dust A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it Look this one is crumbling he said frowning over the faded script

Be gentle Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand holding it as if it were a wounded animal The important books used to be copied over when they needed them Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times probably

Well don’t bother copying that one Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod eighteen jars of fish oil a cask of salt   

An inventory Sam said or perhaps a bill of sale

Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago Jon wondered

I would Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it You can learn so much from ledgers like that truly you can It can tell you how many men were in the Night’s Watch then how they lived what they ate   

They ate food said Jon and they lived as we live

You’d be surprised This vault is a treasure Jon

If you say so Jon was doubtful Treasure meant gold silver and jewels not dust spiders and rotting leather

I do the fat boy blurted He was older than Jon a man grown by law but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy I found drawings of the faces in the trees and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest    works that even the Citadel doesn’t have scrolls from old Valyria counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years   

The books will still be here when we return

If we return
