504 And when the days of his mourning were past Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh saying If now I have found grace in your eyes
speak I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying 505 My father made
me swear saying Lo I die in my grave which I have digged for me in
the land of Canaan there shalt thou bury me Now therefore let me go
up I pray thee and bury my father and I will come again

506 And Pharaoh said Go up and bury thy father according as he
made thee swear

507 And Joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all
the servants of Pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders
of the land of Egypt 508 And all the house of Joseph and his
brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their
flocks and their herds they left in the land of Goshen

509 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was
a very great company

5010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad which is beyond
Jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation
and he made a mourning for his father seven days

5011 And when the inhabitants of the land the Canaanites saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad they said This is a grievous mourning
to the Egyptians wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim
which is beyond Jordan

5012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them 5013
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite before
Mamre

5014 And Joseph returned into Egypt he and his brethren and all
that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his
father

5015 And when Josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they
said Joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him

5016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph saying Thy father did
command before he died saying 5017 So shall ye say unto Joseph
Forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin
for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the
trespass of the servants of the God of thy father And Joseph wept
when they spake unto him

5018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face and
they said Behold we be thy servants

5019 And Joseph said unto them Fear not for am I in the place of
God  5020 But as for you ye thought evil against me but God meant
it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people
alive

5021 Now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little
ones

And he comforted them and spake kindly unto them

5022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his fathers house and
Joseph lived an hundred and ten years

5023 And Joseph saw Ephraims children of the third generation the
children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
Josephs knees

5024 And Joseph said unto his brethren I die and God will surely
visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware
to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob

5025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God
will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence

5026 So Joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they
embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt

11 Now these are the names of the children of Israel which came
into Egypt every man and his household came with Jacob

12 Reuben Simeon Levi and Judah 13 Issachar Zebulun and
Benjamin 14 Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher

15 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
souls for Joseph was in Egypt already

16 And Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation

17 And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased
abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land
was filled with them
