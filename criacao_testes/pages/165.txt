Cayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax Desmond was with him and between them Littlefinger Ned thanked his guards and sent them away

Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves his silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds I suppose congratulations are in order he said as he seated himself

Ned scowled The king lies wounded and near to death

I know Littlefinger said I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm

Ned’s eyes flicked to the king’s letter on the table beside him its seal unbroken And how is it you know that my lord

Varys hinted as much Littlefinger said and you have just confirmed it

Ned’s mouth twisted in anger Damn Varys and his little birds Catelyn spoke truly the man has some black art I do not trust him

Excellent You’re learning Littlefinger leaned forward Yet I’ll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch

No Ned admitted I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister’s bastards born of his incestuous union with the queen

Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow Shocking he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all The girl as well No doubt So when the king dies…

The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis the elder of Robert’s two brothers

Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter So it would seem Unless…

Unless my lord There is no seeming to this Stannis is the heir Nothing can change that

Stannis cannot take the throne without your help If you’re wise you’ll make certain Joffrey succeeds

Ned gave him a stony stare Have you no shred of honor

Oh a shred surely Littlefinger replied negligently Hear me out Stannis is no friend of yours nor of mine Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him The man is iron hard and unyielding He’ll give us a new Hand and a new council for a certainty No doubt he’ll thank you for handing him the crown but he won’t love you for it And his ascent will mean war Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are dead Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter’s head is measured for a spike Casterly Rock will rise and not alone Robert found it in him to pardon men who served King Aerys so long as they did him fealty Stannis is less forgiving He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm’s End and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you the realm will bleed

Now look at the other side of the coin Joffrey is but twelve and Robert gave you the regency my lord You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm The power is yours Lord Stark All you need do is reach out and take it Make your peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed Joffrey to your Sansa Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen and your heir to Myrcella It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age By then he will look to you as a second father and if not well… four years is a good long while my lord Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis Then should Joffrey prove troublesome we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne

We Ned repeated

Littlefinger gave a shrug You’ll need someone to share your burdens I assure you my price would be modest

Your price Ned’s voice was ice Lord Baelish what you suggest is treason

Only if we lose

You forget Ned told him You forget Jon Arryn You forget Jory Cassel And you forget this He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel as sharp as the difference between right and wrong between true and false between life and death They sent a man to cut my son’s throat Lord Baelish

Littlefinger sighed I fear I did forget my lord Pray forgive me For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark His mouth quirked So it will be Stannis and war

It is not a choice Stannis is the heir

Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector What would you have of me then Not my wisdom for a certainty

I shall do my best to forget your… wisdom Ned said with distaste I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn This is a perilous hour for all of us Robert has named me Protector true enough but in the eyes of the world Joffrey is still his son and heir The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands… enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard And for all I know her brother Jaime may be riding for King’s Landing even as we speak with a Lannister host at his back

And you without an army Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table turning it slowly with a finger There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters Bronze Yohn Royce Ser Balon Swann Ser Loras Lady Tanda the Redwyne twins… each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court
