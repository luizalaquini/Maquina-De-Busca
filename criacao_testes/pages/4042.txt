  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle `Drive on old fellow
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words

  `Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe
it--

  `I never said I didnt interrupted Alice

  `You did said the Mock Turtle

  `Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak
again  The Mock Turtle went on

  `We had the best of educations--in fact we went to school
every day--

  `IVE been to a day-school too said Alice `you neednt be
so proud as all that

  `With extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

  `Yes said Alice `we learned French and music

  `And washing said the Mock Turtle

  `Certainly not said Alice indignantly

  `Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief  `Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill French music AND WASHING--extra

  `You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice `living at the
bottom of the sea

  `I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh  `I only took the regular course

  `What was that inquired Alice

  `Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock
Turtle replied `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--
Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision

  `I never heard of Uglification Alice ventured to say  `What
is it

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise  `What  Never
heard of uglifying it exclaimed  `You know what to beautify
is I suppose

  `Yes said Alice doubtfully  `it means--to--make--anything--
prettier

  `Well then the Gryphon went on `if you dont know what to
uglify is you ARE a simpleton

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said `What else had you
to learn

  `Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting
off the subjects on his flappers `--Mystery ancient and modern
with Seaography  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
conger-eel that used to come once a week  HE taught us
Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils

  `What was THAT like said Alice

  `Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said  `Im
too stiff  And the Gryphon never learnt it

  `Hadnt time said the Gryphon  `I went to the Classics
master though  He was an old crab HE was

  `I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh  `he
taught Laughing and Grief they used to say

  `So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws

  `And how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice in a
hurry to change the subject

  `Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle `nine the
next and so on

  `What a curious plan exclaimed Alice

  `Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon
remarked  `because they lessen from day to day

  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark  `Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday

  `Of course it was said the Mock Turtle
