if they were knots of red worms and above shone
imaginary fiery faces tongues hanging from lips glaring
eyes and other impish forms from which at intervals
sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest
Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator
by discovering the case to be more serious than he had
at first imagined A scroll of smoke blew aside and
revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition
with the decaying one and behind this a series of
others composing the main corn produce of the farm
so that instead of the straw-stack standing as he had
imagined comparatively isolated there was a regular
connection between it and the remaining stacks of the
group
Gabriel leapt over the hedge and saw that he was
not alone The first man he came to was running
about in a great hurry as if his thoughts were several
yards in advance of his body which they could never
drag on fast enough
O man -- fire fire  A good master and a bad
servant is fire fire  -- I mane a bad servant and a good
master O Mark Clark -- come - And you Billy
Smallbury -- and you Maryann Money -- and you Jan
Coggan and Matthew there Other figures now
appeared behind this shouting man and among the
smoke and

Gabriel found that far from being alone
he was in a great company -- whose shadows danced
merrily up and down timed by the jigging of the
flames and not at all by their owners movements
The assemblage -- -belonging to that class of society
which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling and
its feelings into the form of commotion -- set to work
with a remarkable confusion of purpose
Stop the draught under the wheat-rick cried
Gabriel to those nearest to him The corn stood on
stone staddles and between these tongues of yellow
hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully
If the fire once got under this stack all would be
lost
Get a tarpaulin -- quick   said Gabriel
A rick-cloth was brought and they hung it like a
curtain across the channel The flames immediately
ceased to go under the bottom of the corn-stack and
stood up vertical
Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the
cloth wet said Gabriel again
The flames now driven upwards began to attack
the angles of the huge roof covering the wheat-stack
A ladder cried Gabriel
The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt
to a cinder said a spectre-like form in the smoke
Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves as if he
were going to engage in the operation of  reed-drawing
and digging in his feet and occasionally sticking in the
stem of his sheep-crook he clambered up the beetling
face He at once sat astride the very apex and began
with his crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had
lodged thereon shouting to the others to get him a
bough and a ladder and some water
Billy Smallbury -- one of the men who had been on
the waggon -- by this time had found a ladder which
Mark Clark ascended holding on beside Oak upon the
thatch The smoke at this corner was stifling and
Clark a nimble fellow having been handed a bucket
of water bathed Oaks face and sprinkled him generally
whilst Gabriel now with a long beech-bough in one
hand in addition to his crook in the other kept
sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles
P 96
On the ground the groups of villagers were still
occupied in doing all they could to keep down the
conflagration which was not much They were all
tinged orange and backed up by shadows of varying
pattern Round the corner of the largest stack out
of the direct rays of the fire stood a pony bearing a
young woman on its back By her side was another
woman on foot These two seemed to keep at a
distance from the fire that the horse might not beome
restive
Hes a shepherd said the woman on foot Yes --
he is See how his crook shines as he beats the rick
with it And his smock-frock is burnt in two holes I
declare A fine young shepherd he is too maam
 Whose shepherd is he said the equestrian in a
clear voice
Dont know maam
  Dont any of the others know 
  Nobody at all -- Ive asked em Quite a stranger
 they say
 The young woman on the pony rode out from the
shade and looked anxiously around
Do you think the barn is safe  she said
Dye think the barn is safe Jan Coggan  said
the second woman passing on the question to the
nearest man in that direction
Safe -now -- leastwise I think so If this rick had
gone the barn would have followed Tis- that bold
shepherd up there that have done the most good -- he
