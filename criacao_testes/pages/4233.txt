lodging  Moreover it was not at all unlikely that his
wife would fail at her farming if she had not already
done so and he would then become liable for her
maintenance  and what a life such a future of poverty
with her would be the spectre of Fanny constantly be+
tween them harrowing his temper and embittering her
words Thus for reasons touching on distaste regret
and shame commingled he put off his return from day
to day and would have decided to put it off altogether
if he could have found anywhere else the ready-made
establishment which existed for him there
At this time -- the July preceding the September in
which we find at Greenhill Fair -- he fell in with a
travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of
a northern town Troy introduced himself to the
manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe hitting
a suspended apple with pistol-+

bullet fired from the
animals back when in full gallop and other feats For
his merits in these -- all more or less based upon his ex+
periences as a dragoon-guardsman -- Troy was taken into
the company and the play of Turpin was prepared with
a view to his personation of the chief character Troy
was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which
he was undoubtedly treated but he thought the engage+
ment might afford him a few weeks for consideration
It was thus carelessly and without having formed any
definite plan for the future that Troy found himself
at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this
day
And now the mild autumn sun got lower and in
front of the pavilion the following incident had taken
place Bathsheba -- who was driven to the fair that day
by her odd man Poorgrass -- had like every one else
read or heard the announcement that Mr Francis the
Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider would
enact the part of Turpin and she was not yet too old
and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him
This particular show was by far the largest and grandest
in the fair a horde of little shows grouping themselves
under its shade like chickens around a hen The crowd
had passed in and Boldwood who had been watching
all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her seeing
her comparatively isolated came up to her side
I hope the sheep have done well to-day Mrs Troy
he said nervously
O yes thank you said Bathsheba colour springing
up in the centre of her cheeks I was fortunate
enough to sell them all just as we got upon the hill so
we hadnt to pen at all
And now you are entirely at leisure 
Yes except that I have to see one more dealer in
two hours time  otherwise I should be going home
was looking at this large tent and the announcement
Have you ever seen the play of Turpins Ride to
York Turpin was a real man was he not 
O yes perfectly true -- all of it Indeed I think
Ive heard Jan Coggan say that a relation of his knew
Tom King Turpins friend quite well
P 402
Coggan is rather given to strange stories connected
with his relations we must remember I hope they
can all be believed
Yes yes we know Coggan But Turpin is true
enough You have never seen it played I suppose
Never I was not allowed to go into these places
when I was young Hark Whats that prancing
How they shout
Black Bess just started off I suppose Am I right
in supposing you would like to see the performance
Mrs Troy  Please excuse my mistake if it is one
but if you would like to Ill get a seat for you with
pleasure Perceiving that she hesitated he added I
myself shall not stay to see it Ive seen it before
Now Bathsheba did care a little to see the show and
had only withheld her feet from the ladder because she
feared to go in alone She had been hoping that Oak
might appear whose assistance in such cases was always
accepted as an inalienable right but Oak was nowhere
to be seen and hence it was that she said Then if
you will just look in first to see if theres room I think
I will go in for a minute or two
And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared
in the tent with Boldwood at her elbow who taking
her to a  reserved  seat again withdrew
This feature consisted of one raised bench in very
conspicuous part of the circle covered with red cloth
and floored with a piece of carpet and Bathsheba
immediately found to her confusion that she was the
single reserved individual in the tent the rest of the
crowded spectators one and all standing on their legs
on the borders of the arena where they got twice as
good a view of the performance for half the money
Hence as many eyes were turned upon her enthroned
alone in this place of honour against a scarlet back+
ground as upon the ponies and clown who were
engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre Turpin
not having yet appeared Once there Bathsheba was
forced to make the best of it and remain she sat
