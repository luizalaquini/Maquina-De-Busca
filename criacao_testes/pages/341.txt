Hezekiah answered It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten
degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees

2011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD and he brought the
shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of
Ahaz

2012 At that time Berodachbaladan the son of Baladan king of
Babylon sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah for he had heard
that Hezekiah had been sick

2013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house
of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and
the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that
was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all
his dominion that Hezekiah shewed them not

2014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah and said unto
him What said these men and from whence came they unto thee And
Hezekiah said They are come from a far country even from Babylon

2015 And he said What have they seen in thine house And Hezekiah
answered All the things that are in mine house have they seen there
is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them

2016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah Hear the word of the LORD

2017 Behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that
which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be
carried into Babylon nothing shall be left saith the LORD

2018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt
beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace
of the king of Babylon

2019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah Good is the word of the LORD
which thou hast spoken And he said Is it not good if peace and
truth be in my days  2020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and
all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought
water into the city are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah  2021 And Hezekiah slept with his
fathers and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead

211 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned
fifty and five years in Jerusalem And his mothers name was
Hephzibah

212 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD after
the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD cast out before the
children of Israel

213 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father
had destroyed and he reared up altars for Baal and made a grove as
did Ahab king of Israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and
served them

214 And he built altars in the house of the LORD of which the LORD
said In Jerusalem will I put my name

215 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the LORD

216 And he made his son pass through the fire and observed times
and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD to provoke him to
anger

217 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
house of which the LORD said to David and to Solomon his son In
this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all tribes of
Israel will I put my name for ever 218 Neither will I make the feet
of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers
only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded
them and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded
them

219 But they hearkened not and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of
Israel

2110 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets saying 2111
Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations and hath
done wickedly above all that the Amorites did which were before him
and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols 2112 Therefore thus
saith the LORD God of Israel Behold I am bringing such evil upon
Jerusalem and Judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall
tingle

2113 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the
plummet of the house of Ahab and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man
wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down

2114 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver
them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and
a spoil to all their enemies 2115 Because they have done that which
was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day
their fathers came forth out of Egypt even unto this day

2116 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had
filled Jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he
