Tyrion

He gave a resigned smile Do I hear the herald summoning me to the lists

Your whoring is a weakness in you Lord Tywin said without preamble but perhaps some share of the blame is mine Since you stand no taller than a boy I have found it easy to forget that you are in truth a man grown with all of a man’s baser needs It is past time you were wed

I was wed or have you forgotten Tyrion’s mouth twisted and the noise emerged that was half laugh and half snarl

Does the prospect of marriage amuse you

Only imagining what a bugger-all handsome bridegroom I’ll make A wife might be the very thing he needed If she brought him lands and a keep it would give him a place in the world apart from Joffrey’s court… and away from Cersei and their father

On the other hand there was Shae She will not like this for all she swears that she is content to be my whore

That was scarcely a point to sway his father however so Tyrion squirmed higher in his seat and said You mean to wed me to Sansa Stark But won’t the Tyrells take the match as an affront if they have designs on the girl

Lord Tyrell will not broach the matter of the Stark girl until after Joffrey’s wedding If Sansa is wed before that how can he take offense when he gave us no hint of his intentions

Quite so said Ser Kevan and any lingering resentments should be soothed by the offer of Cersei for his Willas

Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of his nose The scar tissue itched abominably sometimes His Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa’s life a misery since the day her father died and now that she is finally rid of Joffrey you propose to marry her to me That seems singularly cruel Even for you Father

Why do you plan to mistreat her His father sounded more curious than concerned The girl’s happiness is not my purpose nor should it be yours Our alliances in the south may be as solid as Casterly Rock but there remains the north to win and the key to the north is Sansa Stark

She is no more than a child

Your sister swears she’s flowered If so she is a woman fit to be wed You must needs take her maidenhead so no man can say the marriage was not consummated After that if you prefer to wait a year or two before bedding her again you would be within your rights as her husband

Shae is all the woman I need just now he thought and Sansa’s a girl no matter what you say If your purpose here is to keep her from the Tyrells why not return her to her mother Perhaps that would convince Robb Stark to bend the knee

Lord Tywin’s look was scornful Send her to Riverrun and her mother will match her with a Blackwood or a Mallister to shore up her son’s alliances along the Trident Send her north and she will be wed to some Manderly or Umber before the moon turns Yet she is no less dangerous here at court as this business with the Tyrells should prove She must marry a Lannister and soon

The man who weds Sansa Stark can claim Winterfell in her name his uncle Kevan put in Had that not occurred to you

If you will not have the girl we shall give her to one of your cousins said his father Kevan is Lancel strong enough to wed do you think

Ser Kevan hesitated If we bring the girl to his bedside he could say the words… but to consummate no… I would suggest one of the twins but the Starks hold them both at Riverrun They have Genna’s boy Tion as well else he might serve

Tyrion let them have their byplay it was all for his benefit he knew Sansa Stark he mused Soft-spoken sweet-smelling Sansa who loved silks songs chivalry and tall gallant knights with handsome faces He felt as though he was back on the bridge of boats the deck shifting beneath his feet

You asked me to reward you for your efforts in the battle Lord Tywin reminded him forcefully This is a chance for you Tyrion the best you are ever likely to have He drummed his fingers impatiently on the table I once hoped to marry your brother to Lysa Tully but Aerys named Jaime to his Kingsguard before the arrangements were complete When I suggested to Lord Hoster that Lysa might be wed to you instead he replied that he wanted a whole man for his daughter

So he wed her to Jon Arryn who was old enough to be her grandfather Tyrion was more inclined to be thankful than angry considering what Lysa Arryn had become

When I offered you to Dorne I was told that the suggestion was an insult Lord Tywin continued In later years I had similar answers from Yohn Royce and Leyton Hightower I finally stooped so low as to suggest you might take the Florent girl Robert deflowered in his brother’s wedding bed but her father preferred to give her to one of his own household knights

If you will not have the Stark girl I shall find you another wife Somewhere in the realm there is doubtless some little lordling who’d gladly part with a daughter to win the friendship of Casterly Rock Lady Tanda has offered Lollys…

Tyrion gave a shudder of dismay I’d sooner cut it off and feed it to the goats

Then open your eyes The Stark girl is young nubile tractable of the highest birth and still a maid She is not uncomely Why would you hesitate

Why indeed A quirk of mine Strange to say I would prefer a wife who wants me in her bed
