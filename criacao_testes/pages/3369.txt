not when she had received the spies with peace

1132 And what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of
Gedeon and of Barak and of Samson and of Jephthae of David also
and Samuel and of the prophets 1133 Who through faith subdued
kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths
of lions

1134 Quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword
out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to
flight the armies of the aliens

1135 Women received their dead raised to life again and others were
tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better
resurrection 1136 And others had trial of cruel mockings and
scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment 1137 They were
stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the
sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being
destitute afflicted tormented 1138 Of whom the world was not
worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and
caves of the earth

1139 And these all having obtained a good report through faith
received not the promise 1140 God having provided some better thing
for us that they without us should not be made perfect

121 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which
doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is
set before us 122 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our
faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross
despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of God

123 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds

124 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin

125 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
unto children My son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him 126 For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth

127 If ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not  128 But if ye be
without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards
and not sons

129 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us
and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection
unto the Father of spirits and live  1210 For they verily for a few
days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit
that we might be partakers of his holiness

1211 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but
grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby

1212 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble
knees 1213 And make straight paths for your feet lest that which is
lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed

1214 Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man
shall see the Lord 1215 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the
grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you
and thereby many be defiled 1216 Lest there be any fornicator or
profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
birthright

1217 For ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the
blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though
he sought it carefully with tears

1218 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and
that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
1219 And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice
they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them
any more 1220 For they could not endure that which was commanded
And if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
thrust through with a dart 1221 And so terrible was the sight that
Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake 1222 But ye are come unto
mount Sion and unto the city of the living God the heavenly
Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels 1223 To the
general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in
heaven and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of just men
made perfect 1224 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and
to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of
Abel

1225 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh For if they escaped
not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we
escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 1226
Whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying
Yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven

1227 And this word Yet once more signifieth the removing of those
things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain
