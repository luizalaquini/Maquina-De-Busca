If a vowel for example is spoken and prolonged it can readily be
identified by listening to any part of the utterance
This is not true for diphthongs  if you say I very slowly and freeze
your vocal tract posture at any time the resulting steady-state sound
will not be sufficient to identify the diphthong  Rather it will be
a vowel somewhere between
ul
aa
in had or
ul
ar
in hard and
ul
ee
in heed
Neither is it true for glides for prolonging
ul
w
in want or
ul
y
in you results in vowels resembling respectively
ul
u
hood or
ul
ee
heed
Fricatives voiced or unvoiced can be identified from the steady state
but stops can not for theirs is silent or em in the case
of voiced stops em something close to it
pp
Segments which are identifiable from their steady state are easy to synthesize
The difficulty lies with the others for it must be the transitions which
carry the information  Thus transitions are an essential part of speech
and perhaps the term is unfortunate for it calls to mind an unimportant
bridge between one segment and the next
It is tempting to use the words continuant and non-continuant to distinguish
the two categories unfortunately they are used by phoneticians in a different
sense
We will call them steady-state and transient segments  The latter term
is not particularly appropriate for even sounds in this class
ul
can
be prolonged  the point is that the identifying information is in the
transitions rather than the steady state

FG Table 72  Resonance synthesizer parameters for steady-state sounds
rh Steady-state segments
Table 72 shows appropriate values for the resonance parameters and
excitation sources of a resonance synthesizer for steady-state
segments only
There are several points to note about it
Firstly all the frequencies involved obviously depend upon the
speaker em the size of his vocal tract his accent and speaking habits
The values given are nominal ones for a male speaker with a dialect of
British English called received pronunciation RP em for it is what
used to be received on the wireless in the old days
