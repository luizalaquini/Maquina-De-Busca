He set aside his wine cup I’ll hear no warnings from you boy

Ser Lancel said stiffly He touched his sword perhaps to remind Tyrion that he wore one Have a care how you speak to me Imp Doubtless he meant to sound threatening but that absurd wisp of a mustache ruined the effect

Oh unhand your sword One cry from me and Shagga will burst in and kill you With an axe not a wineskin

Lancel reddened was he such a fool as to believe his part in Robert’s death had gone unnoted I am a knight—

So I’ve noted Tell me—did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed

The flicker in Lancel’s green eyes was all the admission Tyrion needed So Varys told it true Well no one can ever claim that my sister does not love her family What nothing to say No more warnings for me ser

You will withdraw these filthy accusations or—

Please Have you given any thought to what Joffrey will do when I tell him you murdered his father to bed his mother

It was not like that Lancel protested horrified

No What was it like pray

The queen gave me the strongwine Your own father Lord Tywin when I was named the king’s squire he told me to obey her in everything

Did he tell you to fuck her too Look at him Not quite so tall his features not so fine and his hair is sand instead of spun gold yet still… even a poor copy of Jaime is sweeter than an empty bed I suppose No I thought not

I never meant… I only did as I was bid I…

…hated every instant of it is that what you would have me believe A high place at court knighthood my sister’s legs opening for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible for you Tyrion pushed himself to his feet Wait here His Grace will want to hear this

The defiance went from Lancel all at once The young knight fell to his knees a frightened boy Mercy my lord I beg you

Save it for Joffrey He likes a good beg

My lord it was your sister’s bidding the queen as you said but His Grace… he’d never understand…

Would you have me keep the truth from the king

For my father’s sake I’ll leave the city it will be as if it never happened I swear I will end it…

It was hard not to laugh I think not

Now the lad looked lost My lord

You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Very well obey her Stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her as often as she requires it No one need ever know… so long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing Where she goes who she sees what they talk of what plans she is hatching All And you will be the one to tell me won’t you

Yes my lord Lancel spoke without a moment’s hesitation Tyrion liked that I will I swear it As you command

Rise Tyrion filled the second cup and pressed it on him Drink to our understanding I promise there are no boars in the castle that I know of Lancel lifted the cup and drank albeit stiffly Smile cousin My sister is a beautiful woman and it’s all for the good of the realm You could do well out of this Knighthood is nothing If you’re clever you’ll have a lordship from me before you’re done Tyrion swirled the wine in his cup We want Cersei to have every faith in you Go back and tell her I beg her forgiveness Tell her that you frightened me that I want no conflict between us that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent

But… her demands…

Oh I’ll give her Pycelle

You will Lancel seemed astonished
