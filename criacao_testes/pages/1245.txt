It was best her father whispered Jon’s a good man good… strong kind… take care of you… he will… and well born listen to me you must I’m your father… your father… you’ll wed when Cat does yes you will…

He thinks I’m Lysa Catelyn realized Gods be good he talks as if we were not married yet

Her father’s hands clutched at hers fluttering like two frightened white birds That stripling… wretched boy… not speak that name to me your duty… your mother she would… Lord Hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over him Oh gods forgive me forgive me forgive me My medicine…

And then Maester Vyman was there holding a cup to his lips Lord Hoster sucked at the thick white potion as eager as a babe at the breast and Catelyn could see peace settle over him once more He’ll sleep now my lady the maester said when the cup was empty The milk of the poppy had left a thick white film around her father’s mouth Maester Vyman wiped it away with a sleeve

Catelyn could watch no more Hoster Tully had been a strong man and proud It hurt her to see him reduced to this She went out to the terrace The yard below was crowded with refugees and chaotic with their noises but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure and endless Those are his rivers and soon he will return to them for his last voyage

Maester Vyman had followed her out My lady he said softly I cannot keep the end at bay much longer We ought send a rider after his brother Ser Brynden would wish to be here

Yes Catelyn said her voice thick with her grief

And the Lady Lysa as well perhaps

Lysa will not come

If you wrote her yourself perhaps…

I will put some words to paper if that please you She wondered who Lysa’s wretched stripling had been Some young squire or hedge knight like as not… though by the vehemence with which Lord Hoster had opposed him he might have been a tradesman’s son or baseborn apprentice even a singer Lysa had always been too fond of singers I must not blame her Jon Arryn was twenty years older than our father however noble

The tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that she and Lysa had shared as maids It would feel good to sleep on a featherbed again with a warm fire in the hearth when she was rested the world would seem less bleak

But outside her chambers she found Utherydes Wayn waiting with two women clad in grey their faces cowled save for their eyes Catelyn knew at once why they were here Ned

The sisters lowered their gaze Utherydes said Ser Cleos brought him from King’s Landing my lady

Take me to him she commanded

They had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner the white banner of House Stark with its grey direwolf sigil I would look on him Catelyn said

Only the bones remain my lady

I would look on him she repeated

One of the silent sisters turned down the banner

Bones Catelyn thought This is not Ned this is not the man I loved the father of my children His hands were clasped together over his chest skeletal fingers curled about the hilt of some longsword but they were not Ned’s hands so strong and full of life They had dressed the bones in Ned’s surcoat the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the heart but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights the arms that had held her The head had been rejoined to the body with fine silver wire but one skull looks much like another and in those empty hollows she found no trace of her lord’s dark grey eyes eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone They gave his eyes to crows she remembered

Catelyn turned away That is not his sword

Ice was not returned to us my lady Utherydes said Only Lord Eddard’s bones

I suppose I must thank the queen for even that much

Thank the Imp my lady It was his doing

One day I will thank them all I am grateful for your service sisters Catelyn said but I must lay another task upon you Lord Eddard was a Stark and his bones must be laid to rest beneath Winterfell They will make a statue of him a stone likeness that will sit in the dark with a direwolf at his feet and a sword across his knees Make certain the sisters have fresh horses and aught else they need for the journey she told Utherydes Wayn Hal Mollen will escort them back to Winterfell it is his place as captain of guards She gazed down at the bones that were all that remained of her lord and love Now leave me all of you I would be alone with Ned tonight

The women in grey bowed their heads The silent sisters do not speak to the living Catelyn remembered dully but some say they can talk to the dead And how she envied that…





DAENERYS

The drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets but they could not keep out disappointment Dany climbed inside wearily glad for the refuge from the sea of Qartheen eyes Make way Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback snapping his whip make way make way for the Mother of Dragons

Reclining on cool satin cushions Xaro Xhoan Daxos poured ruby-red wine into matched goblets of jade and gold his hands sure and steady despite the sway of the palanquin I see a deep sadness written upon your face my light of love He offered her a goblet Could it be the sadness of a lost dream

A dream delayed no more Dany’s tight silver collar was chafing against her throat She unfastened it and flung it aside The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro swore would ward her against all poisons The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water They never saw me for a queen she thought bitterly I was only an afternoon’s amusement a horse girl with a curious pet

Rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a hand for the wine Wincing she shifted him to her other shoulder where he could claw her gown instead of her skin She was garbed after the Qartheen fashion Xaro had warned her that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki so she had taken care to go before them in flowing green samite with one breast bared silvered sandals on her feet with a belt of black-and-white pearls about her waist For all the help they offered I could have gone naked Perhaps I should have She drank deep

Descendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth the Pureborn commanded the Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas Daenerys Targaryen had wanted that fleet or part of it and some of their soldiers as well She made the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List sent the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones

The Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth’s vanished glory The chairs were immense fantastically carved bright with goldwork and studded with amber onyx lapis and jade each one different from all the others and each striving to be the most fabulous Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-weary that they might have been asleep They listened but they did not hear or care she thought They are Milk Men indeed They never meant to help me They came because they were curious They came because they were bored and the dragon on my shoulder interested them more than I did

Tell me the words of the Pureborn prompted Xaro Xhoan Daxos Tell me what they said to sadden the queen of my heart

They said no The wine tasted of pomegranates and hot summer days They said it with great courtesy to be sure but under all the lovely words it was still no

Did you flatter them

Shamelessly

Did you weep

The blood of the dragon does not weep she said testily

Xaro sighed You ought to have wept The Qartheen wept often and easily it was considered a mark of the civilized man The men we bought what did they say

Mathos said nothing Wendello praised the way I spoke The Exquisite refused me with the rest but he wept afterward

Alas that Qartheen should be so faithless Xaro was not himself of the Pureborn but he had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer Weep weep for the treachery of men

Dany would sooner have wept for her gold The bribes she’d tendered to Mathos Mallarawan Wendello Qar Deeth and Egon Emeros the Exquisite might have bought her a ship or hired a score of sellswords Suppose I sent Ser Jorah to demand the return of my gifts she asked

Suppose a Sorrowful Man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept said Xaro The Sorrowful Men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins so named because they always whispered I am so sorry to their victims before they killed them The Qartheen were nothing if not polite It is wisely said that it is easier to milk the Stone Cow of Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn

Dany did not know where Faros was but it seemed to her that Qarth was full of stone cows The merchant princes grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas were divided into three jealous factions the Ancient Guild of Spicers the Tourmaline Brotherhood and the Thirteen to which Xaro belonged Each vied with the others for dominance and all three contended endlessly with the Pureborn And brooding over all were the warlocks with their blue lips and dread powers seldom seen but much feared

She would have been lost without Xaro The gold that she had squandered to open the doors of the Hall of a Thousand Thrones was largely a product of the merchant’s generosity and quick wits As the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east ever more seekers had come to learn if the tale was true—and Xaro Xhoan Daxos saw to it that the great and the humble alike offered some token to the Mother of Dragons

The trickle he started soon swelled to a flood Trader captains brought lace from Myr chests of saffron from Yi Ti amber and dragonglass out of Asshai Merchants offered bags of coin silversmiths rings and chains Pipers piped for her tumblers tumbled and jugglers juggled while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed A pair of Jogos Nhai presented her with one of their striped zorses black and white and fierce A widow brought the dried corpse of her husband covered with a crust of silvered leaves such remnants were believed to have great power especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer as this one had And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a three-headed dragon the coils were yellow gold the wings silver the heads carved from jade ivory and onyx

The crown was the only offering she’d kept The rest she sold to gather the wealth she had wasted on the Pureborn Xaro would have sold the crown too—the Thirteen would see that she had a much finer one he swore—but Dany forbade it Viserys sold my mother’s crown and men called him a beggar I shall keep this one so men will call me a queen And so she did though the weight of it made her neck ache
