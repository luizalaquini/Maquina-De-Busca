the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
420 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn
after the manner before the oracle of pure gold 421 And the
flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that
perfect gold 422 And the snuffers and the basons and the spoons
and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner
doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of
the temple were of gold

51 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was
finished and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father
had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments
put he among the treasures of the house of God

52 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto
Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the
city of David which is Zion

53 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king
in the feast which was in the seventh month

54 And all the elders of Israel came and the Levites took up the
ark

55 And they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle
these did the priests and the Levites bring up

56 Also king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were
assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which
could not be told nor numbered for multitude

57 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place
even under the wings of the cherubims 58 For the cherubims spread
forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered
the ark and the staves thereof above

59 And they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not
seen without And there it is unto this day

510 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
therein at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of
Israel when they came out of Egypt

511 And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy
place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did
not then wait by course 512 Also the Levites which were the singers
all of them of Asaph of Heman of Jeduthun with their sons and their
brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries
and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an
hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets 513 It came even
to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound
to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD and when they lifted up
their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick
and praised the LORD saying For he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house
of the LORD 514 So that the priests could not stand to minister by
reason of the cloud for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
God

61 Then said Solomon The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the
thick darkness

62 But I have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for
thy dwelling for ever

63 And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation
of Israel and all the congregation of Israel stood

64 And he said Blessed be the LORD God of Israel who hath with his
hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David
saying 65 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the
land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build
an house in that my name might be there neither chose I any man to
be a ruler over my people Israel 66 But I have chosen Jerusalem
that my name might be there and have chosen David to be over my
people Israel

67 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
the name of the LORD God of Israel

68 But the LORD said to David my father Forasmuch as it was in thine
heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in
thine heart 69 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but
thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the
house for my name

610 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken
for I am risen up in the room of David my father and am set on the
throne of Israel as the LORD promised and have built the house for
the name of the LORD God of Israel

611 And in it have I put the ark wherein is the covenant of the
LORD that he made with the children of Israel

612 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands 613 For
