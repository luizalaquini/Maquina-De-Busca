But where am I to go Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east away from her enemies in the Seven Kingdoms Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea even if it meant braving the red waste again Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong But her heart was full of doubts Each of these felt wrong somehow… and even when she decided where to go the question of how she would get there remained troublesome

Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her she knew that now For all his professions of devotion he was playing his own game not unlike Pyat Pree The night he asked her to leave Dany had begged one last favor of him An army is it Xaro asked A kettle of gold A galley perhaps

Dany blushed She hated begging A ship yes

Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose I am a trader Khaleesi So perhaps we should speak no more of giving but rather of trade For one of your dragons you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet You need only say that one sweet word

No she said

Alas Xaro sobbed that was not the word I meant

Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children

Whyever not They can always make more Mothers sell their children every day

Not the Mother of Dragons

Not even for twenty ships

Not for a hundred

His mouth curled downward I do not have a hundred But you have three dragons Grant me one for all my kindnesses You will still have two and thirty ships as well

Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros But I do not have a small army How many ships do you own Xaro

Eighty-three if one does not count my pleasure barge

And your colleagues in the Thirteen

Among us all perhaps a thousand

And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood

Their trifling fleets are of no account

Even so she said tell me

Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers No more than eight hundred for the Brotherhood

And the Asshai’i the Braavosi the Summer Islanders the Ibbenese and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea how many ships do they have All together

Many and more he said irritably What does this matter

I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world Dany smiled at him sweetly it seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair

Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose Did I not warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust This is the very thing I feared The whispers of the warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife A third of all the ships in the world Pah Pah I say Pah

Dany had not seen him since His seneschal brought her messages each cooler than the last She must quit his house He was done feeding her and her people He demanded the return of his gifts which she had accepted in bad faith Her only consolation was that at least she’d had the great good sense not to marry him

The warlocks whispered of three treasons… once for blood and once for gold and once for love The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people Could Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos be the second and the third She did not think so What Pyat did was not for gold and Xaro had never truly loved her

The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side Her bell rang softly and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth Child of three they had called her daughter of death slayer of lies bride of fire So many threes Three fires three mounts to ride three treasons The dragon has three heads she sighed Do you know what that means Jorah

Your Grace The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon red on black

I know that But there are no three-headed dragons

The three heads were Aegon and his sisters

Visenya and Rhaenys she recalled I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys

Blue lips speak only lies isn’t that what Xaro told you Why do you care what the warlocks whispered All they wanted was to suck the life from you you know that now

Perhaps she said reluctantly Yet the things I saw…

A dead man in the prow of a ship a blue rose a banquet of blood… what does any of it mean Khaleesi A mummer’s dragon you said What is a mummer’s dragon pray

A cloth dragon on poles Dany explained Mummers use them in their follies to give the heroes something to fight

Ser Jorah frowned

Dany could not let it go His is the song of ice and fire my brother said I’m certain it was my brother Not Viserys Rhaegar He had a harp with silver strings

Ser Jorah’s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together Prince Rhaegar played such a harp he conceded You saw him

She nodded There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon

Prince Aegon was Rhaegar’s heir by Elia of Dorne Ser Jorah said But if he was this prince that was promised the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters dashed his head against a wall

I remember Dany said sadly They murdered Rhaegar’s daughter as well the little princess Rhaenys she was named like Aegon’s sister There was no Visenya but he said the dragon has three heads What is the song of ice and fire

It’s no song I’ve ever heard

I went to the warlocks hoping for answers but instead they’ve left me with a hundred new questions

By then there were people in the streets once more Make way Aggo shouted while Jhogo sniffed at the air suspiciously I smell it Khaleesi he called The poison water The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon it Water that a horse could not drink was water they wanted no part of They will learn Dany resolved I braved their sea with Khal Drogo Now they can brave mine

Qarth was one of the world’s great ports its great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells Winesinks warehouses and gaming dens lined the streets cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods Cutpurses cutthroats spellsellers and moneychangers mingled with every crowd The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar if a man did not ask where they came from Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat’s milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders Seamen from half a hundred nations wandered amongst the stalls drinking spiced liquors and trading jokes in queer-sounding tongues The air smelled of salt and frying fish of hot tar and honey of incense and oil and sperm

Aggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled them as he rode Jhogo bought a handful of fat white cherries Elsewhere they saw beautiful bronze daggers for sale dried squids and carved onyx a potent magical elixir made of virgin’s milk and shade of the evening even dragon’s eggs which looked suspiciously like painted rocks

As they passed the long stone quays reserved for the ships of the Thirteen she saw chests of saffron frankincense and pepper being off-loaded from Xaro’s ornate Vermillion Kiss Beside her casks of wine bales of sourleaf and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure to sail on the evening tide Farther along a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves It was well known that the cheapest place to buy a slave was right off the ship and the banners floating from her masts proclaimed that the Sunblaze had just arrived from Astapor on Slaver’s Bay

Dany would get no help from the Thirteen the Tourmaline Brotherhood or the Ancient Guild of Spicers She rode her silver past several miles of their quays docks and storehouses all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer Islands Westeros and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock

She dismounted beside a gaming pit where a basilisk was tearing a big red dog to pieces amidst a shouting ring of sailors Aggo Jhogo you will guard the horses while Ser Jorah and I speak to the captains

As you say Khaleesi We will watch you as you go
