Arya didn’t think they were king’s men at all They looked more like outlaws all tattered and ragged They didn’t even have horses to ride King’s men would have had horses

But Hot Pie piped up eagerly We’re looking for Riverrun he said How many days’ ride is it do you know

Arya could have killed him You be quiet or I’ll stuff rocks in your big stupid mouth

Riverrun is a long way upstream said Tom A long hungry way Might be you’d like a hot meal before you set out There’s an inn not far ahead kept by some friends of ours We could share some ale and a bite of bread instead of fighting one another

An inn The thought of hot food made Arya’s belly rumble but she didn’t trust this Tom Not everyone who spoke you friendly was really your friend It’s near you say

Two miles upstream said Tom A league at most

Gendry looked as uncertain as she felt What do you mean friends he asked warily

Friends Have you forgotten what friends are

Sharna is the innkeep’s name Tom put in She has a sharp tongue and a fierce eye I’ll grant you that but her heart’s a good one and she’s fond of little girls

I’m not a little girl she said angrily Who else is there You said friends

Sharna’s husband and an orphan boy they took in They won’t harm you There’s ale if you think you’re old enough Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat Tom glanced toward the cottage And whatever you stole from Old Pate’s garden besides

We never stole said Arya

Are you Old Pate’s daughter then A sister A wife Tell me no lies Squab I buried Old Pate myself right there under that willow where you were hiding and you don’t have his look He drew a sad sound from his harp We’ve buried many a good man this past year but we’ve no wish to bury you I swear it on my harp Archer show her

The archer’s hand moved quicker than Arya would have believed His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried itself in the trunk of the willow behind her By then the bowman had a second arrow notched and drawn She’d thought she understood what Syrio meant by quick as a snake and smooth as summer silk but now she knew she hadn’t The arrow thrummed behind her like a bee You missed she said

More fool you if you think so said Anguy They go where I send them

That they do agreed Lem Lemoncloak

There were a dozen steps between the archer and the point of her sword We have no chance Arya realized wishing she had a bow like his and the skill to use it Glumly she lowered her heavy longsword till the point touched the ground We’ll come see this inn she conceded trying to hide the doubt in her heart behind bold words You walk in front and we’ll ride behind so we can see what you’re doing

Tom Sevenstrings bowed deeply and said Before behind it makes no matter Come along lads let’s show them the way Anguy best pull up those arrows we won’t be needing them here

Arya sheathed her sword and crossed the road to where her friends sat on their horses keeping her distance from the three strangers Hot Pie get those cabbages she said as she vaulted into her saddle And the carrots too

For once he did not argue They set off as she had wanted walking their horses slowly down the rutted road a dozen paces behind the three on foot But before very long somehow they were riding right on top of them Tom Sevenstrings walked slowly and liked to strum his woodharp as he went Do you know any songs he asked them I’d dearly love someone to sing with that I would Lem can’t carry a tune and our longbow lad only knows marcher ballads every one of them a hundred verses long

We sing real songs in the marches Anguy said mildly

Singing is stupid said Arya Singing makes noise We heard you a long way off We could have killed you

Tom’s smile said he did not think so There are worse things than dying with a song on your lips

If there were wolves hereabouts we’d know it groused Lem Or lions These are our woods

You never knew we were there said Gendry

Now lad you shouldn’t be so certain of that said Tom Sometimes a man knows more than he says

Hot Pie shifted his seat I know the song about the bear he said Some of it anyhow
