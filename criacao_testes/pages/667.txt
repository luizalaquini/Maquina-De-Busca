grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his
mercies

333 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men

334 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth

335 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
High 336 To subvert a man in his cause the LORD approveth not

337 Who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord
commandeth it not  338 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth
not evil and good  339 Wherefore doth a living man complain a man
for the punishment of his sins  340 Let us search and try our ways
and turn again to the LORD

341 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens

342 We have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned

343 Thou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain
thou hast not pitied

344 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should
not pass through

345 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of
the people

346 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us

347 Fear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destruction

348 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of
the daughter of my people

349 Mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any
intermission

350 Till the LORD look down and behold from heaven

351 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
city

352 Mine enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause

353 They have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon
me

354 Waters flowed over mine head then I said I am cut off

355 I called upon thy name O LORD out of the low dungeon

356 Thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at
my cry

357 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee thou
saidst Fear not

358 O LORD thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast
redeemed my life

359 O LORD thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause

360 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
against me

361 Thou hast heard their reproach O LORD and all their
imaginations against me 362 The lips of those that rose up against
me and their device against me all the day

363 Behold their sitting down and their rising up I am their
musick

364 Render unto them a recompence O LORD according to the work of
their hands

365 Give them sorrow of heart thy curse unto them

366 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
LORD

41 How is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the
stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street

42 The precious sons of Zion comparable to fine gold how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter
43 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their
young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the
ostriches in the wilderness

44 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto
them

45 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they
that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills

46 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom that was overthrown
