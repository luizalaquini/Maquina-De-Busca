Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge Blood welled and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table

Careful Catelyn told him it’s sharp

Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand testing the grip He flipped it in the air caught it again with his other hand Such sweet balance You want to find the owner is that the reason for this visit You have no need of Ser Aron for that my lady You should have come to me

And if I had she said what would you have told me

I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King’s Landing He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger drew it back over his shoulder and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak quivering It’s mine

Yours It made no sense Petyr had not been at Winterfell

Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day he said crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting along with half the court Petyr’s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him many of us became a trifle poorer Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons the queen lost an emerald pendant and I lost my knife Her Grace got the emerald back but the winner kept the rest

Who Catelyn demanded her mouth dry with fear Her fingers ached with remembered pain

The Imp said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face Tyrion Lannister





JON

The courtyard rang to the song of swords

Under black wool boiled leather and mail sweat trickled icily down Jon’s chest as he pressed the attack Grenn stumbled backward defending himself clumsily When he raised his sword Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy’s leg and sent him staggering Grenn’s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm When he tried a sideswing Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain

Enough Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel

Grenn cradled his hand The bastard broke my wrist

The bastard hamstrung you opened your empty skull and cut off your hand Or would have if these blades had an edge It’s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad Get the Aurochs on his feet he has funeral arrangements to make

Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet The frosty morning air felt good on his face He leaned on his sword drew a deep breath and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory

That is a longsword not an old man’s cane Ser Alliser said sharply Are your legs hurting Lord Snow

Jon hated that name a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice The boys had picked it up and now he heard it everywhere He slid the longsword back into its scabbard No he replied

Thorne strode toward him crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved He was a compact man of fifty years spare and hard with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx The truth now he commanded

I’m tired Jon admitted His arm burned from the weight of the longsword and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done

What you are is weak

I won

No The Aurochs lost

One of the other boys sniggered Jon knew better than to reply He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him yet it gained him nothing The master-at-arms served up only derision Thorne hated him Jon had decided of course he hated the other boys even worse

That will be all Thorne told them I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day If the Others ever come for us I pray they have archers because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder

Jon followed the rest back to the armory walking alone He often walked alone here There were almost twenty in the group he trained with yet not one he could call a friend Most were two or three years his senior yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit Pyp used his sword like a dagger Jeren was weak as a girl Grenn slow and clumsy Halder’s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks The more time he spent with them the more Jon despised them

Inside Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall ignoring the others around him Methodically he began to strip off his mail leather and sweat-soaked woolens Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room but Jon found himself shivering The chill was always with him here In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm

The weariness came on him suddenly as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear He sat on a bench his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak So cold he thought remembering the warm halls of Winterfell where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man’s body There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black the walls were cold here and the people colder

No one had told him the Night’s Watch would be like this no one except Tyrion Lannister The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north but by then it had been too late Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like He must have he thought that only made it hurt the worse

Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world Up here the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person He was First Ranger and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne

Three days after their arrival Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him Benjen refused him curtly This is not Winterfell he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger On the Wall a man gets only what he earns You’re no ranger Jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you

Stupidly Jon argued I’ll be fifteen on my name day he said Almost a man grown

Benjen Stark frowned A boy you are and a boy you’ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night’s Watch If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors you were wrong We put aside our old families when we swear our vows Your father will always have a place in my heart but these are my brothers now He gestured with his dagger at the men around them all the hard cold men in black

Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave One of his rangers a big ugly man sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron his breath steaming in the cold morning air Ben Stark smiled at that but he had no smile for his nephew How often must I tell you no Jon We’ll speak when I return

As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad and in his mind’s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead his blood red on the snow The thought made him sick What was he becoming

Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell and buried his face in his thick white fur

If he must be alone he would make solitude his armor Castle Black had no godswood only a small sept and a drunken septon but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods old or new If they were real he thought they were as cruel and implacable as winter

He missed his true brothers little Rickon bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet Robb his rival and best friend and constant companion Bran stubborn and curious always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing He missed the girls too even Sansa who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant And Arya… he missed her even more than Robb skinny little thing that she was all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes so fierce and willful Arya never seemed to fit no more than he had… yet she could always make Jon smile He would give anything to be with her now to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face to hear her finish a sentence with him

You broke my wrist bastard boy

Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice Grenn loomed over him thick of neck and red of face with three of his friends behind him He knew Todder a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice The recruits all called him Toad The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them Jon remembered rapers taken down in the Fingers He’d forgotten their names He hardly ever spoke to them if he could help it They were brutes and bullies without a thimble of honor between them

Jon stood up I’ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon All four of them were bigger than he was but they did not scare him He’d beaten every one of them in the yard

Maybe we’ll break you one of the rapers said

Try Jon reached back for his sword but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back

You make us look bad complained Toad

You looked bad before I ever met you Jon told him The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him hard Pain lanced through him but Jon would not cry out

Toad stepped close The little lordling has a mouth on him he said He had pig eyes small and shiny Is that your mommy’s mouth bastard What was she some whore Tell us her name Maybe I had her a time or two He laughed

Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him There was a sudden cry of pain and he was free He flew at Toad knocked him backward over a bench and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat slamming his head against the packed earth

The two from the Fingers pulled him off throwing him roughly to the ground Grenn began to kick at him Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory STOP THIS NOW
