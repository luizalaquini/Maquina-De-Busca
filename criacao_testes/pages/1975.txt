In the preceding two chapters I have described how artificial speech
can be produced from a written phonetic representation with additional
markers indicating intonation contours points of major stress rhythm
and pauses
This representation is substantially the same as that used by linguists
when recording natural utterances
What we will discuss now are techniques for generating this information
or at least some of it from text
pp
Figure 91 shows various levels of the speech synthesis process
FC Figure 91
Starting from the top with plain text the first box splits it into
intonation units tone groups decides where the major emphases
tonic stresses should be placed
and further subdivides the tone group into rhythmic units feet
For intonation analysis it is necessary to decide on an interpretation
of the text which in turn as was emphasized at the beginning of the
previous chapter depends both on the semantics of what is being said and
on the attitude of the speaker to his material
The resulting representation will be at the level of Hallidays notation
for utterances with the words still in English rather than phonetics
Table 91 illustrates the utterance representation at the various levels
of the Figure

The next job is to translate the plain text into a broad phonetic
transcription
This requires knowledge of letter-to-sound pronunciation
rules for the language under consideration
But much more is needed  The structure of each word must be examined for
prefixes and suffixes because they em especially the latter em have a
strong influence on pronunciation
This is called morphological analysis
Actually it is also required for rhythmical purposes because prefixes
are frequently unstressed note that the word prefix is itself an
exception to this
