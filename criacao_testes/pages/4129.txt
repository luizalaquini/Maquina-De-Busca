and partly for poking up pigs sheep neighbours with
their backs turned and restful things in general which
seemed to require such treatment in the course of their
peregrinations During conversations each subjected
his sapling to great varieties of usage -- bending it round
his back forming anarch of it between his two hands
overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a
semicircle or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the
arm whilst the sample-bag was pulled forth and a hand+
ful of corn poured into the palm which after criticism
was flung upon the floor an issue of events perfectly
well known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which
had as usual crept into the building unobserved and
waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high+
stretched neck and oblique eye
Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided
the single one of her sex that the room contained She
was prettily and even daintily dressed She moved
between them as a chaise between carts was heard after
them as a romance after sermons was felt among them
like a breeze among furnaces It had required a little
determination -- far more than she had at

first imagined
 -- to take up a position here for at her first entry the
lumbering dialogues had ceased nearly every face had
been turned towards her and those that were already
turned rigidly fixed there
Two or three only of the farmers were personally
known to Bathsheba and to these she had made her
way But if she was to be the practical woman she had
intended to show herself business must be carried on
introductions or none and she ultimately acquired con+
fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely
known to her by hearsay Bathsheba too had her
sample-bags and by degrees adopted the professional
pour into the hand -- holding up the grains in her narrow
palm for inspection in perfect Casterbridge manner
Something in the exact arch of her upper unbroken
row of teeth and in the keenly pointed corners of her
red mouth when with parted lips she somewhat
defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a
tall man suggested that there was potentiality enough
in that lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of
sex and daring enough to carry them out But her eyes
had a softness -- invariably a softness -- which had they
not been dark would have seemed mistiness as they
were it lowered an expression that might have been
piercing to simple clearness
Strange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor
she always allowed her interlocutors to finish their state+
ments before rejoining with hers In arguing on prices
he held to her own firmly as was natural in a dealer
and reduced theirs persistently as was inevitable in a
oman But there was an elasticity in her firmness
which removed it from obstinacy as there was a naivete
in her cheapening which saved it from meanness
Those of the farmers with whom she had no dealings
by far the greater part were continually asking each
other Who is she The reply would be --
Farmer Everdenes niece took on Weatherbury
Upper Farm turned away the baily and swears shell do
verything herself
The other man would then shake his head
P 141
Yes tis a pity shes so headstrong the first would
say But we ought to be proud of her here -- she
lightens up the old place Tis such a shapely maid
however that shell soon get picked up
It would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of
her engagement in such an occupation had almost as
much to do with the magnetism as had the beauty of
her face and movements However te interest was
eneral and this Saturdays debut in the forum whatever
it may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling
farmer was unquestionably a triumph to her as the
maiden Indeed the sensation was so pronounced that
her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to
valk as a queen among these gods of the fallow like a
little sister of a little Jove andto neglect closing prices
altogether
The numerous evidences of-her power to attract were
only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception
Women seem to have eyes in their ribbons for such
matters as these Bathsheba without looking within
a right angle of him was conscious of a black sheep
among the flock
It perplexed her first If there had been a respect+
able minority on either side the case would have been
most natural If nobody had regarded her she would
have -- -taken the matter indifferently -- such cases had
occurred If eveybody this man included she would
have taken it as a matter of course -- people had done
so before But the smallness of the exception made the
mystery
She soon knew thus much of the recusants appear+
