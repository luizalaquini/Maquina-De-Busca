about me And this is how she has paid for it
Through a doorway I catch a glimpse of Gale stripped
to the waist perspiration streaming down his face as a
doctor removes something from under his shoulder blade
with a long pair of tweezers Wounded but alive I call his
name start toward him until a nurse pushes me back and
shuts me out
Finnick Something between a shriek and a cry of
joy A lovely if somewhat bedraggled young woman--dark
tangled hair sea green eyes--runs toward us in nothing but
a sheet Finnick And suddenly its as if theres no one in
the world but these two crashing through space to reach
each other They collide enfold lose their balance and
slam against a wall where they stay Clinging into one
being Indivisible
A pang of jealousy hits me Not for either Finnick or
Annie but for their certainty No one seeing them could
doubt their love
Boggs looking a little worse for wear but uninjured
finds Haymitch and me We got them all out Except
Enobaria But since shes from Two we doubt shes being
held anyway Peetas at the end of the hall The effects of
the gas are just wearing off You should be there when he
wakes
Peeta
Alive and well--maybe not well but alive and here
Away from Snow Safe Here With me In a minute I can
touch him See his smile Hear his laugh
Haymitchs grinning at me Come on then he says
Im light-headed with giddiness What will I say Oh
who cares what I say Peeta will be ecstatic no matter what
I do Hell probably be kissing me anyway I wonder if it will
feel like those last kisses on the beach in the arena the
ones I havent dared let myself consider until this moment
Peetas awake already sitting on the side of the bed
looking bewildered as a trio of doctors reassure him flash
lights in his eyes check his pulse Im disappointed that
mine was not the first face he saw when he woke but he
sees it now His features register disbelief and something
more intense that I cant quite place Desire Desperation
Surely both for he sweeps the doctors aside leaps to his
feet and moves toward me I run to meet him my arms
extended to embrace him His hands are reaching for me
too to caress my face I think
My lips are just forming his name when his fingers lock
around my throat

The cold collar chafes my neck and makes the
shivering even harder to control At least I am no longer in
the claustrophobic tube while the machines click and whir
around me listening to a disembodied voice telling me to
hold still while I try to convince myself I can still breathe
Even now when Ive been assured there will be no
permanent damage I hunger for air
The medical teams main concerns--damage to my
spinal cord airway veins and arteries--have been allayed
Bruising hoarseness the sore larynx this strange little
cough--not to be worried about It will all be fine The
Mockingjay will not lose her voice Where I want to ask is
the doctor who determines if I am losing my mind Only Im
not supposed to talk right now I cant even thank Boggs
when he comes to check on me To look me over and tell
me hes seen a lot worse injuries among the soldiers when
they teach choke holds in training
It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow
before any permanent damage could be done I know
Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadnt been
utterly unprepared To catch both Haymitch and myself off
guard is a rare thing But we have been so consumed with
saving Peeta so tortured by having him in the Capitols
hands that the elation at having him back blinded us If Id
had a private reunion with Peeta he would have killed me
Now that hes deranged
No not deranged I remind myself Hijacked Thats
the word I heard pass between Plutarch and Haymitch as I
was wheeled past them in the hallway Hijacked I dont
know what it means
Prim who appeared moments after the attack and has
stayed as close to me as possible ever since spreads
another blanket over me I think theyll take the collar off
soon Katniss You wont be so cold then My mother
whos been assisting in a complicated surgery has still not
been informed of Peetas assault Prim takes one of my
hands which is clutched in a fist and massages it until it
opens and blood begins to flow through my fingers again
Shes starting on the second fist when the doctors show up
remove the collar and give me a shot of something for pain
and swelling I lie as instructed with my head still not
aggravating the injuries to my neck
Plutarch Haymitch and Beetee have been waiting in
the hall for the doctors to give them clearance to see me I
dont know if theyve told Gale but since hes not here I
assume they havent Plutarch ushers the doctors out and
tries to order Prim to go as well but she says No If you
force me to leave Ill go directly to surgery and tell my
mother everything thats happened And I warn you she
doesnt think much of a Gamemaker calling the shots on
Katnisss life Especially when youve taken such poor care
of her
Plutarch looks offended but Haymitch chuckles Id let
