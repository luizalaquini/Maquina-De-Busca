in msec
Pairs of numbers in parentheses define a pitch specification at some
point during the preceding phoneme  the first number of the pair defines
the time offset of the specification from the beginning
of the phoneme while the second gives the pitch itself in Hz
This form of utterance specification can then be passed to a Votrax
conversion procedure
pp
The phonetic transcription is converted
to Votrax sound segments using the method described above  The wide Votrax
transcription is

which is transformed to the following narrow one according to the rules
of Table 115
LB
syll THV I S I Z syll D J AE EH3 K S syll H1 AH1 UH2 O U
S PA0 
LE
The duration and pitch specifications are preserved by the transformation
in their original positions in the string although they are not shown above
The next stage uses them to expand the transcription by adjusting
the segments to have durations as close as possible to the specifications and
computing pitch numbers to be associated with each phoneme
pp
Correct duration-expansion can in general require a great amount of
computation
Associated with each sound segment is a set of elements with the same sound quality
but different durations formed by attaching each of the four duration
qualifiers of Table 113 to the segment and any others which are
sound-equivalents to it  For example the segment Z has the duration-set
LB
3Z   2Z   1Z   0Z
LE
with durations
LB
 70   78   85   95
LE
msec respectively where the initial numerals denote the duration qualifier
The segment I has the much larger duration-set
LB
3I2   2I2   1I2   0I2   3I1   2I1   1I1   0I1   3I   2I   1I   0I
LE
with durations
LB
 58   64   71   78   83   92   101   112   118   131   144   159
LE
because segments I1 and I2 are sound-equivalents to it
Duration assignment is a matter of selecting elements from the
duration-set whose total duration is as close as possible to that desired
for the segment
It happens that Votrax deals sensibly with concatenations of more than one
identical plosive suppressing the stop burst on all but the last
Although the general problem of approximating durations in
this way is computationally demanding a simple recursive exhaustive search
works in a reasonable amount of time because the desired duration is usually
not very much greater than the longest member of the duration-set and so
the search terminates quite quickly
pp
At this point the role of the parentheses which appear on the right-hand side
of Table 115 becomes apparent  Because durations are only associated with
the input phonemes which may each be expanded into several Votrax
segments it is necessary to keep track of the segments which have descended
from a single phoneme
Target durations are simply spread equally across any parenthesized groups
to which they apply
pp
Having expanded durations mapping pitches on to the sound segments is
a simple matter  The ISP system for formant synthesizers Chapters 7 and 8
uses linear interpolation between pitch specifications and the frequency which
results for each sound segment needs to be converted to a Votrax specification
using the information in Table 114
pp
After applying these procedures to the example utterance it becomes
LB
14THV  14I1  03S  14I1  04Z  04D  04J  33AE  33EH3  c
02K  02K  02S  02H1  01AH2  01UH2  31O2  31U1  01S  c
10S  30PA0  30PA0  
LE
In several places shorter sound-equivalents have been substituted
I1 for I AH2 for AH1 O2 for O and U1 for U while doubling-up also occurs
in the K S and PA0 segments
pp
The speech which results from the use of these procedures with the
Votrax synthesizer sounds remarkably similar to that generated by the
ISP system which uses
parametrically-controlled synthesizers  Formal evaluation experiments have
not been undertaken but it seems clear from careful listening that it would
be rather difficult and probably pointless to evaluate the Votrax conversion
algorithm for the outcome would be completely dominated by the success of the
original pitch and rhythm assignment procedures
