Can I make the little man fly now

Across the garden Tyrion Lannister got to his feet Not this little man he said This little man is going down in the turnip hoist thank you very much

You presume— Lysa began

I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words the Imp said As High as Honor

You promised I could make him fly the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at his mother He began to shake

Lady Lysa’s face was flushed with fury The gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent child We have no choice but to free him She lifted her voice Guards Take my lord of Lannister and his… creature here out of my sight Escort them to the Bloody Gate and set them free See that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the Trident and make certain all their goods and weapons are returned to them They shall need them on the high road

The high road Tyrion Lannister said Lysa allowed herself a faint satisfied smile It was another sort of death sentence Catelyn realized Tyrion Lannister must know that as well Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow As you command my lady he said I believe we know the way





JON

You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard Your hands were made for manure shovels not for swords and if it were up to me the lot of you would be set to herding swine But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad One or two may even be worth the price of piss To make room for them I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will He called out the names one by one Toad Stone Head Aurochs Lover Pimple Monkey Ser Loon Last he looked at Jon And the Bastard

Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare They will call you men of Night’s Watch now but you are bigger fools than the Mummer’s Monkey here if you believe that You are boys still green and stinking of summer and when the winter comes you will die like flies And with that Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them

The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named laughing and cursing and offering congratulations Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted Toad of the Night’s Watch Yelling that a black brother needed a horse Pyp leapt onto Grenn’s shoulders and they tumbled to the ground rolling and punching and hooting Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red As they passed the wine from hand to hand grinning like fools Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard Jon offered him the skin A swallow of wine

Sam shook his head No thank you Jon

Are you well

Very well truly the fat boy lied I am so happy for you all His round face quivered as he forced a smile You will be First Ranger someday just as your uncle was

Is Jon corrected He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead Before he could say more Haider cried Here you planning to drink that all yourself Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away laughing While Grenn seized his arm Pyp gave the skin a squeeze and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face Haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine Jon sputtered and struggled Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs

By the time he wrenched free with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat Samwell Tarly had gone

That night Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion When Jon arrived at the common hall the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire The older men clapped him on the arm in passing The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs garnished with sprigs of mint and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter From the Lord Commander’s own table Bowen Marsh told them There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream

Do you think they’ll keep us together Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily

Toad made a face I hope not I’m sick of looking at those ears of yours

Ho said Pyp Listen to the crow call the raven black You’re certain to be a ranger Toad They’ll want you as far from the castle as they can If Mance Rayder attacks lift your visor and show your face and he’ll run off screaming

Everyone laughed but Grenn I hope I’m a ranger

You and everyone else said Matthar Every man who wore the black walked the Wall and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night’s Watch It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears

Not everyone said Halder It’s the builders for me What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down

The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall Once it was said they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher Those days were centuries gone however now it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could

The Old Bear’s no fool Dareon observed You’re certain to be a builder and Jon’s certain to be a ranger He’s the best sword and the best rider among us and his uncle was the First before he… His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said

Benjen Stark is still First Ranger Jon Snow told him toying with his bowl of blueberries The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle’s safe return but not him He pushed away the berries scarcely touched and rose from the bench

Aren’t you going to eat those Toad asked

They’re yours Jon had hardly tasted Hobb’s great feast I could not eat another bite He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out

Pyp followed him Jon what is it

Sam he admitted He was not at table tonight

It’s not like him to miss a meal Pyp said thoughtfully Do you suppose he’s taken ill

He’s frightened We’re leaving him He remembered the day he had left Winterfell all the bittersweet farewells Bran lying broken Robb with snow in his hair Arya raining kisses on him after he’d given her Needle Once we say our words we’ll all have duties to attend to Some of us may be sent away to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower Sam will remain in training with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad Gods only know what they’ll be like but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him first chance he gets

Pyp made a grimace You did all you could

All we could wasn’t enough Jon said

A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin’s Tower for Ghost The direwolf walked beside him to the stables Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered Jon saddled his mare mounted and rode out from Castle Black south across the moonlit night Ghost raced ahead of him flying over the ground gone in the blink of an eye Jon let him go A wolf needed to hunt

He had no destination in mind He wanted only to ride He followed the creek for a time listening to the icy trickle of water over rock then cut across the fields to the kingsroad It stretched out before him narrow and stony and pocked with weeds a road of no particular promise yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing Winterfell was down that road and beyond it Riverrun and King’s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places Casterly Rock the Isle of Faces the red mountains of Dorne the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea the smoking ruins of old Valyria All the places that Jon would never see The world was down that road… and he was here

Once he swore his vow the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon I have not sworn yet he muttered He was no outlaw bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes He had come here freely and he might leave freely… until he said the words He need only ride on and he could leave it all behind By the time the moon was full again he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers

Your half brothers a voice inside reminded him And Lady Stark who will not welcome you There was no place for him in Winterfell no place in King’s Landing either Even his own mother had not had a place for him The thought of her made him sad He wondered who she had been what she had looked like why his father had left her Because she was a whore or an adulteress fool Something dark and dishonorable or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her

Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill but the Wall was there pale beneath the moon vast and cold running from horizon to horizon

He wheeled his horse around and started for home

Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander’s Tower The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back By the time he reached the stables he knew what he must do

Maester Aemon’s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery Aged and frail the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night’s Watch being blind he was spared having to look at them Clydas was short bald and chinless with small pink eyes like a mole Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon’s egg and a face red with boils and pimples Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry

It was Chett who answered Jon’s knock I need to speak to Maester Aemon Jon told him

The maester is abed as you should be Come back on the morrow and maybe he’ll see you He began to shut the door

Jon jammed it open with his boot I need to speak to him now The morning will be too late

Chett scowled The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night Do you know how old he is

Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you Jon said Give him my pardons I would not disturb his rest if it were not important

And if I refuse
