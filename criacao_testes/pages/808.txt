great possessions

1023 And Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God
1024 And the disciples were astonished at his words But Jesus
answereth again and saith unto them Children how hard is it for
them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God  1025 It
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God

1026 And they were astonished out of measure saying among
themselves Who then can be saved  1027 And Jesus looking upon them
saith With men it is impossible but not with God for with God all
things are possible

1028 Then Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have
followed thee

1029 And Jesus answered and said Verily I say unto you There is no
man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or
mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels
1030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses
and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with
persecutions and in the world to come eternal life

1031 But many that are first shall be last and the last first

1032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus went
before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were
afraid

And he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things
should happen unto him 1033 Saying Behold we go up to Jerusalem
and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto
the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver
him to the Gentiles 1034 And they shall mock him and shall scourge
him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he
shall rise again

1035 And James and John the sons of Zebedee come unto him saying
Master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire

1036 And he said unto them What would ye that I should do for you
1037 They said unto him Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy
right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory

1038 But Jesus said unto them Ye know not what ye ask can ye drink
of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with  1039 And they said unto him We can And Jesus said
unto them Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of and with
the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized 1040 But
to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared

1041 And when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with
James and John

1042 But Jesus called them to him and saith unto them Ye know that
they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them

1043 But so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great
among you shall be your minister 1044 And whosoever of you will be
the chiefest shall be servant of all

1045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to
minister and to give his life a ransom for many

1046 And they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of
Timaeus sat by the highway side begging

1047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry
out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me

1048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried
the more a great deal Thou son of David have mercy on me

1049 And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called And they
call the blind man saying unto him Be of good comfort rise he
calleth thee

1050 And he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus

1051 And Jesus answered and said unto him What wilt thou that I
should do unto thee The blind man said unto him Lord that I might
receive my sight

1052 And Jesus said unto him Go thy way thy faith hath made thee
whole

And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way

111 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem unto Bethphage and Bethany
at the mount of Olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples 112
And saith unto them Go your way into the village over against you
and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied
whereon never man sat loose him and bring him
