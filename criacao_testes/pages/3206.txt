and lose his own soul  837 Or what shall a man give in exchange for
his soul  838 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my
words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the
Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels

91 And he said unto them Verily I say unto you That there be some
of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they
have seen the kingdom of God come with power

92 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and
John and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and he was transfigured before them

93 And his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no
fuller on earth can white them

94 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses and they were
talking with Jesus

95 And Peter answered and said to Jesus Master it is good for us to
be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for
Moses and one for Elias

96 For he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid

97 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out
of the cloud saying This is my beloved Son hear him

98 And suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man
any more save Jesus only with themselves

99 And as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they
should tell no man what things they had seen till the Son of man were
risen from the dead

910 And they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with
another what the rising from the dead should mean

911 And they asked him saying Why say the scribes that Elias must
first come  912 And he answered and told them Elias verily cometh
first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the Son of
man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought

913 But I say unto you That Elias is indeed come and they have done
unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him

914 And when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about
them and the scribes questioning with them

915 And straightway all the people when they beheld him were
greatly amazed and running to him saluted him

916 And he asked the scribes What question ye with them  917 And
one of the multitude answered and said Master I have brought unto
thee my son which hath a dumb spirit 918 And wheresoever he taketh
him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and
pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him
out and they could not

919 He answereth him and saith O faithless generation how long
shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me

920 And they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway
the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming

921 And he asked his father How long is it ago since this came unto
him  And he said Of a child

922 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters
to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us
and help us

923 Jesus said unto him If thou canst believe all things are
possible to him that believeth

924 And straightway the father of the child cried out and said with
tears Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief

925 When Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked
the foul spirit saying unto him Thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge
thee come out of him and enter no more into him

926 And the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and
he was as one dead insomuch that many said He is dead

927 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose

928 And when he was come into the house his disciples asked him
privately Why could not we cast him out  929 And he said unto them
This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting

930 And they departed thence and passed through Galilee and he
would not that any man should know it

931 For he taught his disciples and said unto them The Son of man
is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after
that he is killed he shall rise the third day

932 But they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him
