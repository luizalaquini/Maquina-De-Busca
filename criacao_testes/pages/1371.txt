Joffrey made me weep more often than you know she wanted to say but Butterbumps was not on hand to drown out her voice so she pressed her lips together and held her tongue

As for Elinor she was promised to a young squire a son of Lord Ambrose they would be wed as soon as he won his spurs He had worn her favor in the Battle of the Blackwater where he’d slain a Myrish crossbowman and a Mullendore man-at-arms Alyn said her favor made him fearless said Megga He says he shouted her name for his battle cry isn’t that ever so gallant Someday I want some champion to wear my favor and kill a hundred men Elinor told her to hush but looked pleased all the same

They are children Sansa thought They are silly little girls even Elinor They’ve never seen a battle they’ve never seen a man die they know nothing Their dreams were full of songs and stories the way hers had been before Joffrey cut her father’s head off Sansa pitied them Sansa envied them

Margaery was different though Sweet and gentle yet there was a little of her grandmother in her too The day before last she’d taken Sansa hawking It was the first time she had been outside the city since the battle The dead had been burned or buried but the Mud Gate was scarred and splintered where Lord Stannis’s rams had battered it and the hulls of smashed ships could be seen along both sides of the Blackwater charred masts poking from the shallows like gaunt black fingers The only traffic was the flat-bottomed ferry that took them across the river and when they reached the kingswood they found a wilderness of ash and charcoal and dead trees But the waterfowl teemed in the marshes along the bay and Sansa’s merlin brought down three ducks while Margaery’s peregrine took a heron in full flight

Willas has the best birds in the Seven Kingdoms Margaery said when the two of them were briefly alone He flies an eagle sometimes You will see Sansa She took her by the hand and gave it a squeeze Sister

Sister Sansa had once dreamt of having a sister like Margaery beautiful and gentle with all the world’s graces at her command Arya had been entirely unsatisfactory as sisters went How can I let my sister marry Joffrey she thought and suddenly her eyes were full of tears Margaery please she said you mustn’t It was hard to get the words out You mustn’t marry him He’s not like he seems he’s not He’ll hurt you

I shouldn’t think so Margaery smiled confidently It’s brave of you to warn me but you need not fear Joff’s spoiled and vain and I don’t doubt that he’s as cruel as you say but Father forced him to name Loras to his Kingsguard before he would agree to the match I shall have the finest knight in the Seven Kingdoms protecting me night and day as Prince Aemon protected Naerys So our little lion had best behave hadn’t he She laughed and said Come sweet sister let’s race back to the river It will drive our guards quite mad And without waiting for an answer she put her heels into her horse and flew

She is so brave Sansa thought galloping after her… and yet her doubts still gnawed at her Ser Loras was a great knight all agreed But Joffrey had other Kingsguard and gold cloaks and red cloaks besides and when he was older he would command armies of his own Aegon the Unworthy had never harmed Queen Naerys perhaps for fear of their brother the Dragonknight… but when another of his Kingsguard fell in love with one of his mistresses the king had taken both their heads

Ser Loras is a Tyrell Sansa reminded herself That other knight was only a Toyne His brothers had no armies no way to avenge him but with swords Yet the more she thought about it all the more she wondered Joff might restrain himself for a few turns perhaps as long as a year but soon or late he will show his claws and when he does… the realm might have a second Kingslayer and there would be war inside the city as the men of the lion and the men of the rose made the gutters run red

Sansa was surprised that Margaery did not see it too She is older than me she must be wiser And her father Lord Tyrell he knows what he is doing surely I am just being silly

When she told Ser Dontos that she was going to Highgarden to marry Willas Tyrell she thought he would be relieved and pleased for her Instead he had grabbed her arm and said You cannot in a voice as thick with horror as with wine I tell you these Tyrells are only Lannisters with flowers I beg of you forget this folly give your Florian a kiss and promise you’ll go ahead as we have planned The night of Joffrey’s wedding that’s not so long wear the silver hair net and do as I told you and afterward we make our escape He tried to plant a kiss on her cheek

Sansa slipped from his grasp and stepped away from him I won’t I can’t Something would go wrong When I wanted to escape you wouldn’t take me and now I don’t need to

Dontos stared at her stupidly But the arrangements are made sweetling The ship to take you home the boat to take you to the ship your Florian did it all for his sweet Jonquil

I am sorry for all the trouble I put you to she said but I have no need of boats and ships now

But it’s all to see you safe

I will be safe in Highgarden Willas will keep me safe

But he does not know you Dontos insisted and he will not love you Jonquil Jonquil open your sweet eyes these Tyrells care nothing for you It’s your claim they mean to wed

My claim She was lost for a moment

Sweetling he told her you are heir to Winterfell He grabbed her again pleading that she must not do this thing and Sansa wrenched free and left him swaying beneath the heart tree She had not visited the godswood since

But she had not forgotten his words either The heir to Winterfell she would think as she lay abed at night It’s your claim they mean to wed Sansa had grown up with three brothers She never thought to have a claim but with Bran and Rickon dead… It doesn’t matter there’s still Robb he’s a man grown now and soon he’ll wed and have a son Anyway Willas Tyrell will have Highgarden what would he want with Winterfell

Sometimes she would whisper his name into her pillow just to hear the sound of it Willas Willas Willas Willas was as good a name as Loras she supposed They even sounded the same a little What did it matter about his leg Willas would be Lord of Highgarden and she would be his lady

She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge If I give him sons he may come to love me She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon and raise them all to be as valiant as Ser Loras And to hate Lannisters too In Sansa’s dreams her children looked just like the brothers she had lost Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya

She could never hold a picture of Willas long in her head though her imaginings kept turning him back into Ser Loras young and graceful and beautiful You must not think of him like that she told herself Or else he may see the disappointment in your eyes when you meet and how could he marry you then knowing it was his brother you loved Willas Tyrell was twice her age she reminded herself constantly and lame as well and perhaps even plump and red-faced like his father But comely or no he might be the only champion she would ever have

Once she dreamed it was still her marrying Joff not Margaery and on their wedding night he turned into the headsman Ilyn Payne She woke trembling She did not want Margaery to suffer as she had but she dreaded the thought that the Tyrells might refuse to go ahead with the wedding I warned her I did I told her the truth of him Perhaps Margaery did not believe her Joff always played the perfect knight with her as once he had with Sansa She will see his true nature soon enough After the wedding if not before Sansa decided that she would light a candle to the Mother Above the next time she visited the sept and ask her to protect Margaery from Joffrey’s cruelty And perhaps a candle to the Warrior as well for Loras

She would wear her new gown for the ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor she decided as the seamstress took her last measurement That must be why Cersei is having it made for me so I will not look shabby at the wedding She really ought to have a different gown for the feast afterward but she supposed one of her old ones would do She did not want to risk getting food or wine on the new one I must take it with me to Highgarden She wanted to look beautiful for Willas Tyrell Even if Dontos was right and it is Winterfell he wants and not me he still may come to love me for myself Sansa hugged herself tightly wondering how long it would be before the gown was ready She could scarcely wait to wear it





Arya


The rains came and went but there was more grey sky than blue and all the streams were running high On the morning of the third day Arya noticed that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees We’re going the wrong way she said to Gendry as they rode past an especially mossy elm We’re going south See how the moss is growing on the trunk

He pushed thick black hair from eyes and said We’re following the road that’s all The road goes south here

We’ve been going south all day she wanted to tell him And yesterday too when we were riding along that streambed But she hadn’t been paying close attention yesterday so she couldn’t be certain I think we’re lost she said in a low voice We shouldn’t have left the river All we had to do was follow it

The river bends and loops said Gendry This is just a shorter way I bet Some secret outlaw way Lem and Tom and them have been living here for years

That was true Arya bit her lip But the moss…

The way it’s raining we’ll have moss growing from our ears before long Gendry complained

Only from our south ear Arya declared stubbornly There was no use trying to convince the Bull of anything Still he was the only true friend she had now that Hot Pie had left them

Sharna says she needs me to bake bread he’d told her the day they rode Anyhow I’m tired of rain and saddlesores and being scared all the time There’s ale here and rabbit to eat and the bread will be better when I make it You’ll see when you come back You will come back won’t you When the war’s done He remembered who she was then and added My lady reddening

Arya didn’t know if the war would ever be done but she had nodded I’m sorry I beat you that time she said Hot Pie was stupid and craven but he’d been with her all the way from King’s Landing and she’d gotten used to him I broke your nose

You broke Lem’s too Hot Pie grinned That was good

Lem didn’t think so Arya said glumly Then it was time to go When Hot Pie asked if he might kiss milady’s hand she punched his shoulder Don’t call me that You’re Hot Pie and I’m Arry

I’m not Hot Pie here Sharna just calls me Boy The same as she calls the other boy It’s going to be confusing

She missed him more than she thought she would but Harwin made up for it some She had told him about his father Hullen and how she’d found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep the day she fled He always said he’d die in a stable Harwin said but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death not a pack of lions Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King’s Landing as well and much that had happened since but she left out the stableboy she’d stabbed with Needle and the guard whose throat she’d cut to get out of Harrenhal Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know

Nor did she speak of Jaqen H’ghar and the three deaths he’d owed and paid The iron coin he’d given her Arya kept tucked away beneath her belt but sometimes at night she would take it out and remember how his face had melted and changed when he ran his hand across it Valar morghulis she would say under her breath Ser Gregor Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn Queen Cersei King Joffrey

Only six Winterfell men remained of the twenty her father had sent west with Beric Dondarrion Harwin told her and they were scattered It was a trap milady Lord Tywin sent his Mountain across the Red Fork with fire and sword hoping to draw your lord father He planned for Lord Eddard to come west himself to deal with Gregor Clegane If he had he would have been killed or taken prisoner and traded for the Imp who was your lady mother’s captive at the time Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord Tywin’s plan and when he heard about his brother’s capture he attacked your father in the streets of King’s Landing

I remember said Arya He killed Jory Jory had always smiled at her when he wasn’t telling her to get from underfoot

He killed Jory Harwin agreed and your father’s leg was broken when his horse fell on him So Lord Eddard couldn’t go west He sent Lord Beric instead with twenty of his own men and twenty from Winterfell me among them There were others besides Thoros and Ser Raymun Darry and their men Ser Gladden Wylde a lord named Lothar Mallery But Gregor was waiting for us at the Mummer’s Ford with men concealed on both banks As we crossed he fell upon us from front and rear

I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that it took Darry’s arm off at the elbow and killed the horse beneath him too Gladden Wylde died there with him and Lord Mallery was ridden down and drowned We had lions on every side and I thought I was doomed with the rest but Alyn shouted commands and restored order to our ranks and those still a horse rallied around Thoros and cut our way free Six score we’d been that morning By dark no more than two score were left and Lord Beric was gravely wounded Thoros drew a foot of lance from his chest that night and poured boiling wine into the hole it left

Every man of us was certain his lordship would be dead by daybreak But Thoros prayed with him all night beside the fire and when dawn came he was still alive and stronger than he’d been It was a fortnight before he could mount a horse but his courage kept us strong He told us that our war had not ended at the Mummer’s Ford but only begun there and that every man of ours who’d fallen would be avenged tenfold

By then the fighting had passed by us The Mountain’s men were only the van of Lord Tywin’s host They crossed the Red Fork in strength and swept up into the riverlands burning everything in their path We were so few that all we could do was harry their rear but we told each other that we’d join up with King Robert when he marched west to crush Lord Tywin’s rebellion Only then we heard that Robert was dead and Lord Eddard as well and Cersei Lannister’s whelp had ascended the Iron Throne

That turned the whole world on its head We’d been sent out by the King’s Hand to deal with outlaws you see but now we were the outlaws and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King There was some wanted to yield then but Lord Beric wouldn’t hear of it We were still king’s men he said and these were the king’s people the lions were savaging If we could not fight for Robert we would fight for them until every man of us was dead And so we did but as we fought something queer happened For every man we lost two showed up to take his place A few were knights or squires of gentle birth but most were common men—fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps servants and shoemakers even two septons Men of all sorts and women too children dogs…
