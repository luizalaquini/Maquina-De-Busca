any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate
the having to pay makes them unduly speculative
Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person
was not a married man
When marketing was over she rushed off to Liddy
who was waiting for her -- beside the yellowing in which
they had driven to town The horse was put in and
on they trotted Bathshebas sugar tea and drapery
parcels being packed behind and expeessing in some
indescribable manner by their colour shape and
general lineaments that they were that youmg lady+
farmers property and the grocers and drapers no
more
 Ive been through it Liddy and it is over I shant
mind it again for they will all have grown accustomed
to seeing me there but this morning it was as bad as
being married -- eyes everywhere
I knowed it would be Liddy said Men be such
a terrible class of society to look at a body
But there was one man who had more sense than
to waste his time upon me The information was put
in this form that Liddy might not for a moment suppose
her mistress was at all piqued A very good-looking
man she continued upright about forty I should
think Do you know at all who he could be
Liddy couldnt think
Cant you guess at all said Bathsheba with some
disappointment
I havent a notion besides tis no difference since
he took less notice of you than any of the rest Now
if hed taken more it would have mattered a great deal
Bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just
then and they bowled along in silence A low carriage
bowling along still more rapidly behind a horse of un+
impeachable breed overtook and passed them
Why there he is she said
Liddy looked That Thats Farmer Boldwood --
of course
P 143
tis -- the man you couldnt see the other day
when he called
Oh Farmer Boldwood murmured Bathsheba and
looked at him as he outstripped them The farmer had
never turned his head once but with eyes fixed on the
most advanced point along the road passed as uncon+
sciously and abstractedly as if Bathshea and her charms
were thin air
Hes an interesting man -- dont you think so she
remarked
O yes very Everybody owns it replied Liddy
I wonder why he is so wrapt up and indifferent and
seemingly so far away from all he sees around him
It is said -- but not known for certain -- that he met
with some bitter disappointment when he was a young
man and merry A woman jilted him they say
People always say that -- and we know very well
women scarcely ever jilt men tis the men who jilt us
I expect it is simply his nature to be so reserved
Simply his nature -- I expect so miss -- nothing else
in the world
Still tis more romantic to think he has been served
cruelly poor thing Perhaps after all he has I
Depend upon it he has O yes miss he has
feel he must have
However we are very apt to think extremes of
people I --  shouldnt wonder after all if it wasnt a
little of both -- just between the two -- rather cruelly
used and rather reserved
O dear no miss -- I cant think it between the
two
Thats most likely
Well yes so it is I am convinced it is most likely
You may --  take my word miss that thats whats the
matter with him

SORTES SANCTORUM -- THE VALENTINE
IT was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse on the
thirteenth of February Dinner being over Bathsheba
for want of a better companion had asked Liddy to
come and sit with her The mouldy pile was dreary
in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the
shutters closed  the atmosphere of the place seemed
as old as the walls every nook behind the furniture
had a temperature of its own for the fire was not
kindled in this part of the house early in the day
and Bathshebas new piano which was an old one
in other annals looked particularly sloping and out
of level on the warped floor before night threw a
shade over its less prominent angles and hid the
unpleasantness Liddy like a little brook though
shallow was always rippling her presence had not so
much weight as to task thought and yet enough to
exercise it
On the table lay an old quarto Bible bound in
leather Liddy looking at it said --
Did you ever find out miss who you are going to
marry by means of the Bible and key 
Dont be so foolish Liddy As if such things
could be
