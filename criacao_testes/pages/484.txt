Ser Amory addressed the captives What Hoat promised you is nothing to me Lord Tywin made me the castellan of Harrenhal and I shall do with you as I please He gestured to his guards The great cell under the Widow’s Tower ought to hold them all Any who do not care to go are free to die here

As his men herded off the captives at spearpoint Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the stairwell blinking at the torchlight If he found her missing he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her but she was not afraid He was no Weese He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one but Arya never actually knew him to hit Still it would be better if he never saw her She glanced around The oxen were being unharnessed the carts unloaded while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the curious gathered around the caged bear In the commotion it was not hard to slip off unseen She went back the way she had come wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her and thought to put her to work

Away from the gates and the stables the great castle was largely deserted The noise dwindled behind her A swirling wind gusted drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks in the Wailing Tower Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood and she could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones Now that Harrenhal was near empty once again sound did queer things here Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up noise shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence Other times the echoes had a life of their own so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army and every distant voice a ghostly feast The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie but not Arya

Quiet as a shadow she flitted across the middle bailey around the Tower of Dread and through the empty mews where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with ghostly wings She could go where she would The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal The Hall of a Hundred Hearths was closed off along with many of the lesser buildings even the Wailing Tower Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan’s chambers in Kingspyre themselves as spacious as a lord’s and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be close at hand While Lord Tywin had been in residence there was always a man-at-arms wanting to know your business But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a thousand doors and no one seemed to know who should be where or care much

As she passed the armory Arya heard the ring of a hammer A deep orange glow shone through the high windows She climbed to the roof and peeked down Gendry was beating out a breastplate When he worked nothing existed for him but metal bellows fire The hammer was like part of his arm She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made He’s strong she thought As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the breastplate into the quenching trough Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to the floor beside him

He did not seem surprised to see her You should be abed girl The breastplate hissed like a cat as he dipped it in the cold water What was all that noise

Vargo Hoat’s come back with prisoners I saw their badges There’s a Glover from Deepwood Motte he’s my father’s man The rest too mostly All of a sudden Arya knew why her feet had brought her here You have to help me get them out

Gendry laughed And how do we do that

Ser Amory sent them down to the dungeon The one under the Widow’s Tower that’s just one big cell You could smash the door open with your hammer—

While the guards watch and make bets on how many swings it will take me maybe

Arya chewed her lips We’d need to kill the guards

How are we supposed to do that

Maybe there won’t be a lot of them

If there’s two that’s too many for you and me You never learned nothing in that village did you You try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet the way he does Gendry took up the tongs again

You’re afraid

Leave me alone girl

Gendry there’s a hundred northmen Maybe more I couldn’t count them all That’s as many as Ser Amory has Well not counting the Bloody Mummers We just have to get them out and we can take over the castle and escape

Well you can’t get them out no more’n you could save Lommy Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely And if we did escape where would we go

Winterfell she said at once I’d tell Mother how you helped me and you could stay—

Would m’lady permit Could I shoe your horses for you and make swords for your lordly brothers

Sometimes he made her so angry You stop that

Why should I wager my feet for the chance to sweat in Winterfell in place of Harrenhal You know old Ben Blackthumb He came here as a boy Smithed for Lady Whent and her father before her and his father before him and even for Lord Lothston who held Harrenhal before the Whents Now he smiths for Lord Tywin and you know what he says A sword’s a sword a helm’s a helm and if you reach in the fire you get burned no matter who you’re serving Lucan’s a fair enough master I’ll stay here

The queen will catch you then She didn’t send gold cloaks after Ben Blackthumb

Likely it wasn’t even me they wanted

It was too you know it You’re somebody

I’m a ’prentice smith and one day might be I’ll make a master armorer… if I don’t run off and lose my feet or get myself killed He turned away from her picked up his hammer once more and began to bang

Arya’s hands curled into helpless fists The next helm you make put mule’s ears on it in place of bull’s horns She had to flee or else she would have started hitting him He probably wouldn’t even feel it if I did When they find who he is and cut off his stupid mulehead he’ll be sorry he didn’t help She was better off without him anyhow He was the one who got her caught at the village
