And two days later as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky Bran found himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother

You are the lord in Winterfell now Robb told him He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion his shield hung from the horse’s side wood banded with iron white and grey and on it the snarling face of a direwolf His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers sword and dagger at his waist a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders You must take my place as I took Father’s until we come home

I know Bran replied miserably He had never felt so little or alone or scared He did not know how to be a lord

Listen to Maester Luwin’s counsel and take care of Rickon Tell him that I’ll be back as soon as the fighting is done

Rickon had refused to come down He was up in his chamber redeyed and defiant No he’d screamed when Bran had asked if he didn’t want to say farewell to Robb NO farewell

I told him Bran said He says no one ever comes back

He can’t be a baby forever He’s a Stark and near four Robb sighed Well Mother will be home soon And I’ll bring back Father I promise

He wheeled his courser around and trotted away Grey Wind followed loping beside the warhorse lean and swift Hallis Mollen went before them through the gate carrying the rippling white banner of House Stark atop a high standard of grey ash Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb and their knights formed up in a double column behind them steel-tipped lances glinting in the sun

Uncomfortably he remembered Osha’s words He’s marching the wrong way he thought For an instant he wanted to gallop after him and shout a warning but when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis the moment was gone

Beyond the castle walls a roar of sound went up The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb as he rode past Bran knew cheering for Lord Stark for the Lord of Winterfell on his great stallion with his cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside him They would never cheer for him that way he realized with a dull ache He might be the lord in Winterfell while his brother and father were gone but he was still Bran the Broken He could not even get off his own horse except to fall

When the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last Winterfell seemed deserted and dead Bran looked around at the faces of those who remained women and children and old men… and Hodor The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face Hodor he said sadly

Hodor Bran agreed wondering what it meant





DAENERYS

When he had taken his pleasure Khal Drogo rose from their sleeping mats to tower above her His skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad chest Ink-black hair loose and unbound cascaded over his shoulders and down his back well past his waist His manhood glistened wetly The khal’s mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs

Dany propped herself on an elbow to look up at him so tall and magnificent She loved his hair especially It had never been cut he had never known defeat It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth she said

The earth ends at the black salt sea Drogo answered at once He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin No horse can cross the poison water

In the Free Cities there are ships by the thousand Dany told him as she had told him before Wooden horses with a hundred legs that fly across the sea on wings full of wind

Khal Drogo did not want to hear it We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs He dropped the cloth and began to dress This day I will go to the grass and hunt woman wife he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver gold and bronze

Yes my sun-and-stars Dany said Drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar the great white lion of the plains If they returned triumphant her lord husband’s joy would be fierce and he might be willing to hear her out

Savage beasts he did not fear nor any man who had ever drawn breath but the sea was a different matter To the Dothraki water that a horse could not drink was something foul the heaving grey-green plains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways she had found… but not in this If only she could get him onto a ship…

After the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with their bows Dany summoned her handmaids Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands whereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her They scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk loose and flowing As Doreah combed out her hair she sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont

The knight came at once He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest like a rider Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms My princess How may I serve you

You must talk to my lord husband Dany said Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule and no need to cross the poison water He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea

The knight looked thoughtful The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms he said They are nothing to him If he thinks of them at all no doubt he thinks of islands a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys surrounded by stormy seas The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect

But he must ride west Dany said despairing Please help me make him understand She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either no more than Drogo yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day but he was dead now and his promises had died with him
