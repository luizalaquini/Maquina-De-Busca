The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle Perhaps There are ships to be had in the Free Cities though I tell you Ned I do not like this marriage There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war They bide their time for now but give them half a chance they will murder me in my bed and my sons with me If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back the traitors will join him

He will not cross Ned promised And if by some mischance he does we will throw him back into the sea Once you choose a new Warden of the East—

The king groaned For the last time I will not name the Arryn boy Warden I know the boy is your nephew but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child

Ned was ready for that Yet we still must have a Warden of the East If Robert Arryn will not do name one of your brothers Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm’s End surely

He let the name hang there for a moment The king frowned and said nothing He looked uncomfortable

That is Ned finished quietly watching unless you have already promised the honor to another

For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled Just as quickly the look became annoyance What if I have

It’s Jaime Lannister is it not

Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows Ned kept pace with him The king rode on eyes straight ahead Yes he said at last A single hard word to end the matter

Kingslayer Ned said The rumors were true then He rode on dangerous ground now he knew An able and courageous man no doubt he said carefully but his father is Warden of the West Robert In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor No one man should hold both East and West He left unsaid his real concern that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters

I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field the king said stubbornly At the moment Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon Don’t vex me about this Ned the stone has been set

Your Grace may I speak frankly

I seem unable to stop you Robert grumbled They rode through tall brown grasses

Can you trust Jaime Lannister

He is my wife’s twin a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine

As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen’s Ned pointed out

Why should I mistrust him He has done everything I have ever asked of him His sword helped win the throne I sit on

His sword helped taint the throne you sit on Ned thought but he did not permit the words to pass his lips He swore a vow to protect his king’s life with his own Then he opened that king’s throat with a sword

Seven hells someone had to kill Aerys Robert said reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow If Jaime hadn’t done it it would have been left for you or me

We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard Ned said The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth he decided then and there Do you remember the Trident Your Grace

I won my crown there How should I forget it

You took a wound from Rhaegar Ned reminded him So when the Targaryen host broke and ran you gave the pursuit into my hands The remnants of Rhaegar’s army fled back to King’s Landing We followed Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists I expected to find the gates closed to us

Robert gave an impatient shake of his head Instead you found that our men had already taken the city What of it

Not our men Ned said patiently Lannister men The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts not the crowned stag And they had taken the city by treachery

The war had raged for close to a year Lords great and small had flocked to Robert’s banners others had remained loyal to Targaryen The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock the Wardens of the West had remained aloof from the struggle ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King’s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong professing loyalty So the mad king had ordered his last mad act He had opened his city to the lions at the gate

Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well Robert said The anger was building in him again Lannister paid them back in kind It was no less than they deserved I shall not trouble my sleep over it

You were not there Ned said bitterness in his voice Troubled sleep was no stranger to him He had lived his lies for fourteen years yet they still haunted him at night There was no honor in that conquest
