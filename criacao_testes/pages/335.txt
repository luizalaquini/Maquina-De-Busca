He knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw The inside of the hollow was red with dried sap and blackened by fire Beneath the skull he saw another smaller the jaw broken off It was half-buried in ash and bits of bone

When he brought the skull to Mormont the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets The wildlings burn their dead We’ve always known that Now I wished I’d asked them why when there were still a few around to ask

Jon Snow remembered the wight rising its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face He knew why he was certain

Would that bones could talk the Old Bear grumbled This fellow could tell us much How he died Who burned him and why Where the wildlings have gone He sighed The children of the forest could speak to the dead it’s said But I can’t He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree where it landed with a puff of fine ash Go through all these houses Giant get to the top of this tree have a look I’ll have the hounds brought up too Perchance this time the trail will be fresher His tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last

Two men went through each house to make certain nothing was missed Jon was paired with dour Eddison Tollett a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike whom the other brothers called Dolorous Edd Bad enough when the dead come walking he said to Jon as they crossed the village now the Old Bear wants them talking as well No good will come of that I’ll warrant And who’s to say the bones wouldn’t lie Why should death make a man truthful or even clever The dead are likely dull fellows full of tedious complaints—the ground’s too cold my gravestone should be larger why does he get more worms than I do…

Jon had to stoop to pass through the low door Within he found a packed dirt floor There were no furnishings no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof What a dismal place to live he said

I was born in a house much like this declared Dolorous Edd Those were my enchanted years Later I fell on hard times A nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of the room Edd looked at it with longing I’d give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a bed again

You call that a bed

If it’s softer than the ground and has a roof over it I call it a bed Dolorous Edd sniffed the air I smell dung

The smell was very faint Old dung said Jon The house felt as though it had been empty for some time Kneeling he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath then made a round of the walls It did not take very long There’s nothing here

Nothing was what he had expected Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed and it had been the same in all of them The people were gone vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had None of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked They were simply… empty What do you think happened to them all Jon asked

Something worse than we can imagine suggested Dolorous Edd Well I might be able to imagine it but I’d sooner not Bad enough to know you’re going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime

Two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged Other dogs ranged through the village Chett was cursing them loudly his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside The light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils on his face look even more inflamed than usual When he saw Jon his eyes narrowed there was no love lost between them

The other houses had yielded no wisdom Gone cried Mormont’s raven flapping up into the weirwood to perch above them Gone gone gone

There were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago Thoren Smallwood looked more a lord than Mormont did clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker’s gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate His heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable and clasped with the crossed hammers of the Rykkers wrought in silver Ser Jaremy’s cloak once… but the wight had claimed Ser Jaremy and the Night’s Watch wasted nothing

A year ago Robert was king and the realm was at peace declared Jarman Buckwell the square stolid man who commanded the scouts Much can change in a year’s time

One thing hasn’t changed Ser Mallador Locke insisted Fewer wildlings means fewer worries I won’t mourn whatever’s become of them Raiders and murderers the lot of them

Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above Two branches parted and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age The other rangers called him Giant He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said There’s water to the north A lake might be A few flint hills rising to the west not very high Nothing else to see my lords

We might camp here tonight Smallwood suggested

The Old Bear glanced up searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood No he declared Giant how much daylight remains to us

Three hours my lord

We’ll press on north Mormont decided If we reach this lake we can make camp by the shore perchance catch a few fish Jon fetch me paper it’s past time I wrote Maester Aemon

Jon found parchment quill and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the Lord Commander At Whitetree Mormont scrawled The fourth village All empty The wildlings are gone Find Tarly and see that he gets this on its way he said as he handed Jon the message When he whistled his raven came flapping down to land on his horse’s head Corn the raven suggested bobbing The horse whickered

Jon mounted his garron wheeled him about and trotted off Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night’s Watch stood beneath lesser trees tending their horses chewing strips of salt beef pissing scratching and talking When the command was given to move out again the talk died and they climbed back into their saddles Jarman Buckwell’s scouts rode out first with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper Then came the Old Bear with the main force Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and packhorses and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard Two hundred men all told with half again as many mounts

By day they followed game trails and streambeds the ranger’s roads that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root At night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits joking and trading tales but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter No one would admit to being afraid—they were men of the Night’s Watch after all—but Jon could feel the unease Four empty villages no wildlings anywhere even the game seemingly fled The haunted forest had never seemed more haunted even veteran rangers agreed

As he rode Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers Ugly things He remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya’s hair His little stick of a sister He wondered how she was faring It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again He began to flex his hand opening and closing the fingers If he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy it well might be the end of him he knew A man needed his sword beyond the Wall

Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards watering his horses He had three to tend his own mount and two packhorses each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens The birds flapped their wings at Jon’s approach and screamed at him through the bars A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words Have you been teaching them to talk he asked Sam
