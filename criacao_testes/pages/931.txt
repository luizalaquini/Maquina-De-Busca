you all

24 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know
the love which I have more abundantly unto you

25 But if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part
that I may not overcharge you all

26 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted
of many

27 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow

28 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
him

29 For to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of
you whether ye be obedient in all things

210 To whom ye forgive any thing I forgive also for if I forgave
any thing to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the
person of Christ 211 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us for
we are not ignorant of his devices

212 Furthermore when I came to Troas to preach Christs gospel and
a door was opened unto me of the Lord 213 I had no rest in my
spirit because I found not Titus my brother but taking my leave of
them I went from thence into Macedonia

214 Now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every
place

215 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are
saved and in them that perish 216 To the one we are the savour of
death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life And
who is sufficient for these things  217 For we are not as many
which corrupt the word of God but as of sincerity but as of God in
the sight of God speak we in Christ

31 Do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some
others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation
from you  32 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and
read of all men 33 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of Christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the
Spirit of the living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables
of the heart

34 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward 35 Not that we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but
our sufficiency is of God 36 Who also hath made us able ministers of
the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the
letter killeth but the spirit giveth life

37 But if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones
was glorious so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory
was to be done away 38 How shall not the ministration of the spirit
be rather glorious  39 For if the ministration of condemnation be
glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in
glory

310 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
respect by reason of the glory that excelleth

311 For if that which is done away was glorious much more that which
remaineth is glorious

312 Seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of
speech 313 And not as Moses which put a vail over his face that
the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
which is abolished 314 But their minds were blinded for until this
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
testament which vail is done away in Christ

315 But even unto this day when Moses is read the vail is upon
their heart

316 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the vail shall be
taken away

317 Now the Lord is that Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is
there is liberty

318 But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as
by the Spirit of the LORD

41 Therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy
we faint not 42 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty
not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans
conscience in the sight of God

43 But if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost 44 In
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is
