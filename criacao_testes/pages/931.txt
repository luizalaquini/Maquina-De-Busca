Only a few more Your Grace Ser Kevan Lannister assured him This is a bill of attainder against Lord Edmure Tully stripping him of Riverrun and all its lands and incomes for rebelling against his lawful king This is a similar attainder against his uncle Ser Brynden Tully the Blackfish Tommen signed them one after the other dipping the quill carefully and writing his name in a broad childish hand

Jaime watched from the foot of the table thinking of all those lords who aspired to a seat on the king’s small council They can bloody well have mine If this was power why did it taste like tedium He did not feel especially powerful watching Tommen dip his quill in the inkpot again He felt bored

And sore Every muscle in his body ached and his ribs and shoulders were bruised from the battering they’d gotten courtesy of Ser Addam Marbrand Just thinking of it made him wince He could only hope the man would keep his mouth shut Jaime had known Marbrand since he was a boy serving as a page at Casterly Rock he trusted him as much as he trusted anyone Enough to ask him to take up shields and tourney swords He had wanted to know if he could fight with his left hand

And now I do The knowledge was more painful than the beating that Ser Addam had given him and the beating was so bad he could hardly dress himself this morning If they had been fighting in earnest Jaime would have died two dozen deaths It seemed so simple changing hands It wasn’t Every instinct he had was wrong He had to think about everything where once he’d just moved And while he was thinking Marbrand was thumping him His left hand couldn’t even seem to hold a longsword properly Ser Addam had disarmed him thrice sending his blade spinning

This grants said lands incomes and castle to Ser Emmon Frey and his lady wife Lady Genna Ser Kevan presented another sheaf of parchments to the king Tommen dipped and signed This is a decree of legitimacy for a natural son of Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort And this names Lord Bolton your Warden of the North Tommen dipped signed dipped signed This grants Ser Rolph Spicer title to the castle Castamere and raises him to the rank of lord Tommen scrawled his name

I should have gone to Ser Ilyn Payne Jaime reflected The King’s Justice was not a friend as Marbrand was and might well have beat him bloody… but without a tongue he was not like to boast of it afterward All it would take would be one chance remark by Ser Addam in his cups and the whole world would soon know how useless he’d become Lord Commander of the Kingsguard It was a cruel jape that… though not quite so cruel as the gift his father had sent him

This is your royal pardon for Lord Gawen Westerling his lady wife and his daughter Jeyne welcoming them back into the king’s peace Ser Kevan said This is a pardon for Lord Jonos Bracken of Stone Hedge This is a pardon for Lord Vance This for Lord Goodbrook This for Lord Mooton of Maidenpool

Jaime pushed himself to his feet You seem to have these matters well in hand Uncle I shall leave His Grace to you

As you wish Ser Kevan rose as well Jaime you should go to your father This breach between you—

—is his doing Nor will he mend it by sending me mocking gifts Tell him that if you can pry him away from the Tyrells long enough

His uncle looked distressed The gift was heartfelt We thought that it might encourage you—

—to grow a new hand Jaime turned to Tommen Though he had Joffrey’s golden curls and green eyes the new king shared little else with his late brother He inclined to plumpness his face was pink and round and he even liked to read He is still shy of nine this son of mine The boy is not the man It would be seven years before Tommen was ruling in his own right Until then the realm would remain firmly in the hands of his lord grandfather Sire he asked do I have your leave to go

As you like Ser Uncle Tommen looked back to Ser Kevan Can I seal them now Great-Uncle Pressing his royal seal into the hot wax was his favorite part of being king so far

Jaime strode from the council chamber Outside the door he found Ser Meryn Trant standing stiff at guard in white scale armor and snowy cloak If this one should learn how feeble I am or Kettleblack or Blount should hear of it… Remain here until His Grace is done he said then escort him back to Maegor’s

Trant inclined his head As you say my lord

The outer ward was crowded and noisy that morning Jaime made for the stables where a large group of men were saddling their horses Steelshanks he called Are you off then

As soon as m’lady is mounted said Steelshanks Walton My lord of Bolton expects us Here she is now

A groom led a fine grey mare out the stable door On her back was mounted a skinny hollow-eyed girl wrapped in a heavy cloak Grey it was like the dress beneath it and trimmed with white satin The clasp that pinned it to her breast was wrought in the shape of a wolf’s head with slitted opal eyes The girl’s long brown hair blew wild in the wind She had a pretty face he thought but her eyes were sad and wary

When she saw him she inclined her head Ser Jaime she said in a thin anxious voice You are kind to see me off

Jaime studied her closely You know me then

She bit her lip You may not recall my lord as I was littler then… but I had the honor to meet you at Winterfell when King Robert came to visit my father Lord Eddard She lowered her big brown eyes and mumbled I’m Arya Stark

Jaime had never paid much attention to Arya Stark but it seemed to him that this girl was older I understand you’re to be married

I am to wed Lord Bolton’s son Ramsay He used to be a Snow but His Grace has made him a Bolton They say he’s very brave I am so happy

Then why do you sound so frightened I wish you joy my lady Jaime turned back to Steelshanks You have the coin you were promised

Aye and we’ve shared it out You have my thanks The northman grinned A Lannister always pays his debts

Always said Jaime with a last glance at the girl He wondered if there was much resemblance Not that it mattered The real Arya Stark was buried in some unmarked grave in Flea Bottom in all likelihood With her brothers dead and both parents who would dare name this one a fraud Good speed he told Steelshanks Nage raised his peace banner and the northmen formed a column as ragged as their fur cloaks and trotted out the castle gate The thin girl on the grey mare looked small and forlorn in their midst

A few of the horses still shied away from the dark splotch on the hard-packed ground where the earth had drunk the life’s blood of the stableboy Gregor Clegane had killed so clumsily The sight of it made Jaime angry all over again He had told his Kingsguard to keep the crowd out of the way but that oaf Ser Boros had let himself be distracted by the duel The fool boy himself shared some of the blame to be sure the dead Dornishman as well And Clegane most of all The blow that took the boy’s arm off had been mischance but that second cut…
