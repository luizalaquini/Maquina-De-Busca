his hand

421 And the LORD said unto Moses When thou goest to return into
Egypt see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have
put in thine hand but I will harden his heart that he shall not let
the people go

422 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh Thus saith the LORD Israel is
my son even my firstborn 423 And I say unto thee Let my son go
that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold I will
slay thy son even thy firstborn

424 And it came to pass by the way in the inn that the LORD met him
and sought to kill him

425 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her
son and cast it at his feet and said Surely a bloody husband art
thou to me

426 So he let him go then she said A bloody husband thou art
because of the circumcision

427 And the LORD said to Aaron Go into the wilderness to meet Moses
And he went and met him in the mount of God and kissed him

428 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him
and all the signs which he had commanded him

429 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
the children of Israel 430 And Aaron spake all the words which the
LORD had spoken unto Moses and did the signs in the sight of the
people

431 And the people believed and when they heard that the LORD had
visited the children of Israel and that he had looked upon their
affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped

51 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh Thus
saith the LORD God of Israel Let my people go that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness

52 And Pharaoh said Who is the LORD that I should obey his voice to
let Israel go I know not the LORD neither will I let Israel go

53 And they said The God of the Hebrews hath met with us let us go
we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto
the LORD our God lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the
sword

54 And the king of Egypt said unto them Wherefore do ye Moses and
Aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens

55 And Pharaoh said Behold the people of the land now are many and
ye make them rest from their burdens

56 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people
and their officers saying 57 Ye shall no more give the people straw
to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for
themselves

58 And the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye
shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be
idle therefore they cry saying Let us go and sacrifice to our God

59 Let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour
therein and let them not regard vain words

510 And the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers
and they spake to the people saying Thus saith Pharaoh I will not
give you straw

511 Go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished

512 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw

513 And the taskmasters hasted them saying Fulfil your works your
daily tasks as when there was straw

514 And the officers of the children of Israel which Pharaohs
taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded Wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
day as heretofore  515 Then the officers of the children of Israel
came and cried unto Pharaoh saying Wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy servants  516 There is no straw given unto thy servants and
they say to us Make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but
the fault is in thine own people

517 But he said Ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say Let us
go and do sacrifice to the LORD

518 Go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given
you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks

519 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
in evil case after it was said Ye shall not minish ought from your
bricks of your daily task

520 And they met Moses and Aaron who stood in the way as they came
