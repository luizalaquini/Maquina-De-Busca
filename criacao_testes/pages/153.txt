The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to see Arya when she went down to break her fast Where is everyone her sister wanted to know as she ripped the skin from a blood orange Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister

Sansa sighed They rode with Lord Beric to behead Ser Gregor Clegane She turned to Septa Mordane who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon Septa will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor’s head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that last night

The septa was horror-struck A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge Where are your courtesies Sansa I swear of late you’ve been near as bad as your sister

What did Gregor do Arya asked

He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people women and children too

Arya screwed up her face in a scowl Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl and the Hound murdered Mycah Somebody should have beheaded them

It’s not the same Sansa said The Hound is Joffrey’s sworn shield Your butcher’s boy attacked the prince

Liar Arya said Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers

Go ahead call me all the names you want Sansa said airily You won’t dare when I’m married to Joffrey You’ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the table It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap

You have juice on your face Your Grace Arya said

It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes Sansa wiped it away with a napkin When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress she shrieked again You’re horrible she screamed at her sister They should have killed you instead of Lady

Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet Your lord father will hear of this Go to your chambers at once At once

Me too Tears welled in Sansa’s eyes That’s not fair

The matter is not subject to discussion Go

Sansa stalked away with her head up She was to be a queen and queens did not cry At least not where people could see When she reached her bedchamber she barred the door and took off her dress The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk I hate her she screamed She balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth on top of the ashes of last night’s fire When she saw that the stain had bled through onto her underskirt she began to sob despite herself She ripped off the rest of her clothes wildly threw herself into bed and cried herself back to sleep

It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door Sansa Your lord father will see you now

Sansa sat up Lady she whispered For a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in the room looking at her with those golden eyes sad and knowing She had been dreaming she realized Lady was with her and they were running together and… and… trying to remember was like trying to catch the rain with her fingers The dream faded and Lady was dead again

Sansa The rap came again sharply Do you hear me

Yes Septa she called out Might I have a moment to dress please Her eyes were red from crying but she did her best to make herself beautiful

Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched her into the solar his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table Come here Sansa he said not unkindly when the septa had gone for her sister Sit beside me He closed the book

Septa Mordane returned with Arya squirming in her grasp Sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask gown and a look of remorse but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun she’d worn at breakfast Here is the other one the septa announced

My thanks Septa Mordane I would talk to my daughters alone if you would be so kind The septa bowed and left

Arya started it Sansa said quickly anxious to have the first word She called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress the ivory silk the one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey She hates that I’m going to marry the prince She tries to spoil everything Father she can’t stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid

Enough Sansa Lord Eddard’s voice was sharp with impatience

Arya raised her eyes I’m sorry Father I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister’s forgiveness

Sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless Finally she found her voice What about my dress

Maybe… I could wash it Arya said doubtfully
