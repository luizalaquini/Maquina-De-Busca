59 And the LORD said unto Joshua This day have I rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from off you Wherefore the name of the place is
called Gilgal unto this day

510 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of
Jericho

511 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day

512 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel manna any
more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year

513 And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted
up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against
him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and
said unto him Art thou for us or for our adversaries  514 And he
said Nay but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come And
Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto
him What saith my Lord unto his servant  515 And the captain of the
LORDs host said unto Joshua Loose thy shoe from off thy foot for
the place whereon thou standest is holy And Joshua did so

61 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
Israel none went out and none came in

62 And the LORD said unto Joshua See I have given into thine hand
Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour

63 And ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round
about the city once Thus shalt thou do six days

64 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven
times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets

65 And it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with
the rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the
people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall
fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight
before him

66 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them
Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven
trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the LORD

67 And he said unto the people Pass on and compass the city and
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD

68 And it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people that
the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on
before the LORD and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the
covenant of the LORD followed them

69 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on
and blowing with the trumpets

610 And Joshua had commanded the people saying Ye shall not shout
nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out
of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then shall ye shout

611 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city going about it once
and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp

612 And Joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the
ark of the LORD

613 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before
the ark of the LORD went on continually and blew with the trumpets
and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the
ark of the LORD the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets

614 And the second day they compassed the city once and returned
into the camp so they did six days

615 And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early
about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same
manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven
times

616 And it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew
with the trumpets Joshua said unto the people Shout for the LORD
hath given you the city

617 And the city shall be accursed even it and all that are
therein to the LORD only Rahab the harlot shall live she and all
that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we
sent

618 And ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest
ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and
make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it

619 But all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are
consecrated unto the LORD they shall come into the treasury of the
LORD
