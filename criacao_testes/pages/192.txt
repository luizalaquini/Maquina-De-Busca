They are not Starks he said

They are men Robb seasoned in battle You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past

She saw anger in his eyes at that but it was gone as quick as it came and suddenly he was a boy again I know he said abashed Are you… are you sending me back to Winterfell

Catelyn sighed I should You ought never have left Yet I dare not not now You have come too far Someday these lords will look to you as their liege If I pack you off now like a child being sent to bed without his supper they will remember and laugh about it in their cups The day will come when you need them to respect you even fear you a little Laughter is poison to fear I will not do that to you much as I might wish to keep you safe

You have my thanks Mother he said his relief obvious beneath the formality

She reached across his table and touched his hair You are my firstborn Robb I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world red-faced and squalling

He rose clearly uncomfortable with her touch and walked to the hearth Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg You know… about Father

Yes The reports of Robert’s sudden death and Ned’s fall had frightened Catelyn more than she could say but she would not let her son see her fear Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor Have you had any word of your sisters

There was a letter Robb said scratching his direwolf under the jaw One for you as well but it came to Winterfell with mine He went to the table rummaged among some maps and papers and returned with a crumpled parchment This is the one she wrote me I never thought to bring yours

Something in Robb’s tone troubled her She smoothed out the paper and read Concern gave way to disbelief then to anger and lastly to fear This is Cersei’s letter not your sister’s she said when she was done The real message is in what Sansa does not say All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her… I know the sound of a threat even whispered They have Sansa hostage and they mean to keep her

There’s no mention of Arya Robb pointed out miserable

No Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean not now not here

I had hoped… if you still held the Imp a trade of hostages… He took Sansa’s letter and crumpled it in his fist and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time Is there word from the Eyrie I wrote to Aunt Lysa asking help Has she called Lord Arryn’s banners do you know Will the knights of the Vale come join us

Only one she said the best of them my uncle… but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate

Robb took it hard Mother what are we going to do I brought this whole army together eighteen thousand men but I don’t… I’m not certain… He looked to her his eyes shining the proud young lord melted away in an instant and quick as that he was a child again a fifteen-year-old boy looking to his mother for answers

It would not do

What are you so afraid of Robb she asked gently

I… He turned his head away to hide the first tear If we march… even if we win… the Lannisters hold Sansa and Father They’ll kill them won’t they

They want us to think so

You mean they’re lying

I do not know Robb What I do know is that you have no choice If you go to King’s Landing and swear fealty you will never be allowed to leave If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell your lords will lose all respect for you Some may even go over to the Lannisters Then the queen with that much less to fear can do as she likes with her prisoners Our best hope our only true hope is that you can defeat the foe in the field If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive why then a trade might very well be possible but that is not the heart of it So long as you have power enough that they must fear you Ned and your sister should be safe Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace should the fighting go against her

What if the fighting doesn’t go against her Robb asked What if it goes against us

Catelyn took his hand Robb I will not soften the truth for you If you lose there is no hope for any of us They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock Remember the fate of Rhaegar’s children

She saw the fear in his young eyes then but there was a strength as well Then I will not lose he vowed

Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands she said She had to learn if he was truly ready

Less than a fortnight past they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth Robb said Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass but the Kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight Lord Vance was slain The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and his other bannermen at Riverrun with Jaime Lannister on his heels That’s not the worst of it though All the time they were battling in the pass Lord Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army around from the south It’s said to be even larger than Jaime’s host

Father must have known that because he sent out some men to oppose them under the king’s own banner He gave the command to some southron lordling Lord Erik or Derik or something like that but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him and the letter said there were other knights as well and a force of Father’s own guardsmen Only it was a trap Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him the king’s banner be damned and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer’s Ford This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped no one is certain but Ser Raymun was killed and most of our men from Winterfell Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad it’s said and now he’s marching north toward Harrenhal burning as he goes
