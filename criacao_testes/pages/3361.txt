211 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men 212 Teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we
should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
213 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ 214 Who gave himself for us
that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a
peculiar people zealous of good works

215 These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority
Let no man despise thee

31 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to
obey magistrates to be ready to every good work 32 To speak evil of
no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all
men

33 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient
deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and
envy hateful and hating one another

34 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared 35 Not by works of righteousness which we have done but
according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration
and renewing of the Holy Ghost 36 Which he shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour 37 That being justified by his
grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life

38 This is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou
affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be
careful to maintain good works These things are good and profitable
unto men

39 But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain

310 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
reject 311 Knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth
being condemned of himself

312 When I shall send Artemas unto thee or Tychicus be diligent to
come unto me to Nicopolis for I have determined there to winter

313 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently
that nothing be wanting unto them

314 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses that they be not unfruitful

315 All that are with me salute thee Greet them that love us in the
faith Grace be with you all Amen




The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon


11 Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother unto
Philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer 12 And to our
beloved Apphia and Archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in
thy house 13 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ

14 I thank my God making mention of thee always in my prayers 15
Hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus
and toward all saints 16 That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in Christ Jesus

17 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother

18 Wherefore though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
that which is convenient 19 Yet for loves sake I rather beseech
thee being such an one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ

110 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus whom I have begotten in my
bonds 111 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now
profitable to thee and to me 112 Whom I have sent again thou
therefore receive him that is mine own bowels 113 Whom I would
have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto
me in the bonds of the gospel 114 But without thy mind would I do
nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but
willingly

115 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou
shouldest receive him for ever 116 Not now as a servant but above a
servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto
thee both in the flesh and in the Lord  117 If thou count me
therefore a partner receive him as myself

118 If he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine
account 119 I Paul have written it with mine own hand I will repay
it albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own
self besides

120 Yea brother let me have joy of thee in the Lord refresh my
bowels in the Lord
