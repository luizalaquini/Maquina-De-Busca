CH 11  COMMERCIAL SPEECH OUTPUT DEVICES
ds RT Commercial speech output devices
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
This chapter takes a look at four speech output peripherals that are
available today
It is risky in a book of this nature to descend so close to the technology
as to discuss particular examples of commercial products
for such information becomes dated very quickly
Nevertheless having covered the principles of various types of speech
synthesizer and the methods of driving them from widely differing utterance
representations it seems worthwhile to see how these principles are
embodied in a few products actually on the market
pp
Developments in electronic speech devices are moving so fast that it is
hard to keep up with them and the newest technology today will undoubtedly
be superseded next year
Hence I have not tried to choose examples from the very latest technology
Instead this chapter discusses synthesizers which exemplify rather different
principles and architectures in order to give an idea of the range of options
which face the system designer
pp
Three of the devices are landmarks in the commercial adoption of speech
technology and have stood the test of time
Votrax was introduced in the early 1970s and has been re-implemented
several times since in an attempt to cover different market sectors
The Computalker appeared in 1976
It was aimed primarily at the burgeoning computer hobbies market
One of its most far-reaching effects was to stimulate the interest of
hobbyists always eager for new low-cost peripherals in speech synthesis
and so provide a useful new source of experimentation and expertise
which will undoubtedly help this heretofore rather esoteric discipline to
mature
Computalker is certainly the longest-lived and probably still the most
popular hobbyists speech synthesizer
The Texas Instruments speech synthesis chip brought speech output technology to the
consumer
It was the first single-chip speech synthesizer and is still the biggest
seller
It forms the heart of the Speak n Spell talking toy which appeared in
toyshops in the summer of 1978
Although talking calculators had existed several years before they were
exotic gadgets rather than household toys
sh 111  Formant synthesizer
pp
The Computalker is a straightforward implementation of a serial formant
synthesizer
A block diagram of it is shown in Figure 111
FC Figure 111
In the centre is the main vocal tract path with three formant filters
whose resonant frequencies can be controlled individually
A separate nasal branch in parallel with the oral one is provided
with a nasal formant of fixed frequency
It is less important to allow for variation of the nasal formant
frequency than it is for the oral ones because the size and
shape of the nasal tract is relatively fixed
However it is essential to control the nasal amplitude in particular to turn
it off during non-nasal sounds
Computalker provides independent oral and nasal amplitude parameters
pp
Unvoiced excitation can be passed through the main vocal tract
through the aspiration amplitude control AH
In practice the voicing amplitudes AV and AN will probably always be zero when AH
is non-zero for physiological constraints prohibit simultaneous voicing
and aspiration
A second unvoiced excitation path passes through a fricative formant filter
whose resonant frequency can be varied and has its amplitude independently
controlled by AF
