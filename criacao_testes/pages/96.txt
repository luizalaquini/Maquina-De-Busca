913 And they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces
thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar

914 And he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the
burnt offering on the altar

915 And he brought the peoples offering and took the goat which
was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for
sin as the first

916 And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to
the manner

917 And he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof
and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the
morning

918 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
offerings which was for the people and Aarons sons presented unto
him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about 919 And
the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which
covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver
920 And they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon
the altar 921 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for
a wave offering before the LORD as Moses commanded

922 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them
and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt
offering and peace offerings

923 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation
and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the LORD
appeared unto all the people

924 And there came a fire out from before the LORD and consumed upon
the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people
saw they shouted and fell on their faces

101 And Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron took either of them his
censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered
strange fire before the LORD which he commanded them not

102 And there went out fire from the LORD and devoured them and
they died before the LORD

103 Then Moses said unto Aaron This is it that the LORD spake
saying I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all
the people I will be glorified And Aaron held his peace

104 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel the
uncle of Aaron and said unto them Come near carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp

105 So they went near and carried them in their coats out of the
camp as Moses had said

106 And Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar his
sons Uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die
and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the
whole house of Israel bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled

107 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon
you And they did according to the word of Moses

108 And the LORD spake unto Aaron saying 109 Do not drink wine nor
strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the
tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for
ever throughout your generations 1010 And that ye may put difference
between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean 1011 And that
ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD
hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses

1012 And Moses spake unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar
his sons that were left Take the meat offering that remaineth of the
offerings of the LORD made by fire and eat it without leaven beside
the altar for it is most holy 1013 And ye shall eat it in the holy
place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of
the LORD made by fire for so I am commanded

1014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be
thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of Israel

1015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering
before the LORD and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a
statute for ever as the LORD hath commanded

1016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and
behold it was burnt and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the
sons of Aaron which were left alive saying 1017 Wherefore have ye
not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy
and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to
make atonement for them before the LORD  1018 Behold the blood of
it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have
eaten it in the holy place as I commanded
