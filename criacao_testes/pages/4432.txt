Strong his own bird said preening Strong strong

If it happens that we’re all butchered out there I mean for my successor to know where and how we died

Talk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness Mormont leaned forward Tarly when I was a lad half your age my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open a weasel was like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat If you have something to say say it Otherwise beware of weasels He waved a brusque dismissal Off with you I’m too busy for folly No doubt the maester has some work you can do

Sam swallowed stepped back and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the rushes

Is that boy as big a fool as he seems the Lord Commander asked when he’d gone Fool the raven complained Mormont did not wait for Jon to answer His lord father stands high in King Renly’s councils and I had half a notion to dispatch him    no best not Renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy I’ll send Ser Arnell He’s a deal steadier and his mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways

If it please my lord what would you have of King Renly

The same things I’d have of all of them lad Men horses swords armor grain cheese wine wool nails    the Night’s Watch is not proud we take what is offered His fingers drummed against the rough-hewn planks of the table If the winds have been kind Ser Alliser should reach King’s Landing by the turn of the moon but whether this boy Joffrey will pay him any heed I do not know House Lannister has never been a friend to the Watch

Thorne has the wight’s hand to show them A grisly pale thing with black fingers it was that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive

Would that we had another hand to send to Renly

Dywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall

Aye Dywen says And the last time he went ranging he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall Mormont snorted My sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover I’d believe that before I’d believe one fifteen feet tall Though in a world where dead come walking    ah even so a man must believe his eyes I have seen the dead walk I’ve not seen any giant bears He gave Jon a long searching look But we were speaking of hands How is yours

Better Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him Scars covered his arm halfway to the elbow and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender but it was healing It itches though Maester Aemon says that’s good He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride

You can wield Longclaw despite the pain

Well enough Jon flexed his fingers opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him I’m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble as Maester Aemon said

Blind he may be but Aemon knows what he’s about I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years Do you know that he might have been king

Jon was taken by surprise He told me his father was king but not    I thought him perhaps a younger son

So he was His father’s father was Daeron Targaryen the Second of His Name who brought Dorne into the realm Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess She gave him four sons Aemon’s father Maekar was the youngest of those and Aemon was his third son Mind you all this happened long before I was born ancient as Smallwood would make me

Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight

So he was Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron’s true father not Aegon the Unworthy Be that as it may our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight’s martial nature He likes to say he had a slow sword but quick wits Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the Citadel He was nine or ten I believe    and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well

Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days Jon knew Frail shrunken wizened and blind it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya

Mormont continued Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles the heir apparent was slain in a tourney mishap He left two sons but they followed him to the grave not long after during the Great Spring Sickness King Daeron was also taken so the crown passed to Daeron’s second son Aerys

The Mad King Jon was confused Aerys had been king before Robert that wasn’t so long ago

No this was Aerys the First The one Robert deposed was the second of that name

How long ago was this

Eighty years or close enough the Old Bear said and no I still hadn’t been born though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester’s chain by then Aerys wed his own sister as the Targaryens were wont to do and reigned for ten or twelve years Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling’s court    until his royal uncle died without issue The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron’s four sons That was Maekar Aemon’s father The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made Aemon part of his councils but he refused saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother another Daeron Well that one died too leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir Some pox he caught from a whore I believe The next brother was Aerion

Aerion the Monstrous Jon knew that name The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon was one of Old Nan’s more gruesome tales His little brother Bran had loved it

The very one though he named himself Aerion Brightflame One night in his cups he drank a jar of wildfire after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse Not quite a year after King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord

Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm his own maester had seen to that That was the year of the Great Council he said The lords passed over Prince Aerion’s infant son and Prince Daeron’s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon

Yes and no First they offered it quietly to Aemon And quietly he refused The gods meant for him to serve not to rule he told them He had sworn a vow and would not break it though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him Well no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion’s on the throne and Daeron’s girl was a lackwit besides being female so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon’s younger brother—Aegon the Fifth of His Name Aegon the Unlikely they called him born the fourth son of a fourth son Aemon knew and rightly that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother’s rule would seek to use him so he came to the Wall And here he has remained while his brother and his brother’s son and his son each reigned and died in turn until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings

King croaked the raven The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont’s shoulder King it said again strutting back and forth

He likes that word Jon said smiling

An easy word to say An easy word to like

King the bird said again

I think he means for you to have a crown my lord

The realm has three kings already and that’s two too many for my liking Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow

It made him feel odd My lord why have you told me this about Maester Aemon

Must I have a reason Mormont shifted in his seat frowning Your brother Robb has been crowned King in the North You and Aemon have that in common A king for a brother

And this too said Jon A vow

The Old Bear gave a loud snort and the raven took flight flapping in a circle about the room Give me a man for every vow I’ve seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders

I’ve always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell

Mormont gave a whistle and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm A lord’s one thing a king’s another He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket They will garb your brother Robb in silks satins and velvets of a hundred different colors while you live and die in black ringmail He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her You’ll have no wife nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms Robb will rule you will serve Men will call you a crow Him they’ll call Your Grace Singers will praise every little thing he does while your greatest deeds all go unsung Tell me that none of this troubles you Jon    and I’ll name you a liar and know I have the truth of it

Jon drew himself up taut as a bowstring And if it did trouble me what might I do bastard as I am

What will you do Mormont asked Bastard as you are

Be troubled said Jon and keep my vows





CATELYN

Her son’s crown was fresh from the forge and it seemed to Catelyn Stark that the weight of it pressed heavy on Robb’s head

The ancient crown of the Kings of Winter had been lost three centuries ago yielded up to Aegon the Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission What Aegon had done with it no man could say Lord Hoster’s smith had done his work well and Robb’s crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords Of gold and silver and gemstones it had none bronze and iron were the metals of winter dark and strong to fight against the cold

As they waited in Riverrun’s Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them she saw Robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair moments later he moved it forward again later he gave it a quarter turn as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow It is no easy thing to wear a crown Catelyn thought watching especially for a boy of fifteen years
