2143 Therefore say I unto you The kingdom of God shall be taken from
you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof

2144 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on
whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder

2145 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables
they perceived that he spake of them

2146 But when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the
multitude because they took him for a prophet

221 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and
said 222 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which
made a marriage for his son 223 And sent forth his servants to call
them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come

224 Again he sent forth other servants saying Tell them which are
bidden Behold I have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage

225 But they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm
another to his merchandise 226 And the remnant took his servants
and entreated them spitefully and slew them

227 But when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth
his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city

228 Then saith he to his servants The wedding is ready but they
which were bidden were not worthy

229 Go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find
bid to the marriage

2210 So those servants went out into the highways and gathered
together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding
was furnished with guests

2211 And when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man
which had not on a wedding garment 2212 And he saith unto him
Friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment And he
was speechless

2213 Then said the king to the servants Bind him hand and foot and
take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth

2214 For many are called but few are chosen

2215 Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might
entangle him in his talk

2216 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians
saying Master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of
God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not
the person of men

2217 Tell us therefore What thinkest thou Is it lawful to give
tribute unto Caesar or not  2218 But Jesus perceived their
wickedness and said Why tempt ye me ye hypocrites  2219 Shew me
the tribute money And they brought unto him a penny

2220 And he saith unto them Whose is this image and superscription
2221 They say unto him Caesars Then saith he unto them Render
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the
things that are Gods

2222 When they had heard these words they marvelled and left him
and went their way

2223 The same day came to him the Sadducees which say that there is
no resurrection and asked him 2224 Saying Master Moses said If a
man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and
raise up seed unto his brother

2225 Now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he
had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto
his brother 2226 Likewise the second also and the third unto the
seventh

2227 And last of all the woman died also

2228 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
seven  for they all had her

2229 Jesus answered and said unto them Ye do err not knowing the
scriptures nor the power of God

2230 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven

2231 But as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God saying 2232 I am the God of
Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob  God is not the
God of the dead but of the living

2233 And when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his
doctrine

2234 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
