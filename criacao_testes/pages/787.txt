Why would you think that asked Lord Beric

Well Arya said my hair’s messy and my nails are dirty and my feet are all hard Robb wouldn’t care about that probably but her mother would Lady Catelyn always wanted her to be like Sansa to sing and dance and sew and mind her courtesies Just thinking of it made Arya try to comb her hair with her fingers but it was all tangles and mats and all she did was tear some out I ruined that gown that Lady Smallwood gave me and I don’t sew so good She chewed her lip I don’t sew very well I mean Septa Mordane used to say I had a blacksmith’s hands

Gendry hooted Those soft little things he called out You couldn’t even hold a hammer

I could if I wanted she snapped at him

Thoros chuckled Your brother will pay child Have no fear on that count

Yes but what if he won’t she insisted

Lord Beric sighed Then I will send you to Lady Smallwood for a time or perhaps to mine own castle of Blackhaven But that will not be necessary I’m certain I do not have the power to give you back your father no more than Thoros does but I can at least see that you are returned safely to your mother’s arms

Do you swear she asked him Yoren had promised to take her home too only he’d gotten killed instead

On my honor as a knight the lightning lord said solemnly

It was raining when Lem returned to the brewhouse muttering curses as water ran off his yellow cloak to puddle on the floor Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky sat by the door rolling dice but no matter which game they played one-eyed Jack had no luck at all Tom Sevenstrings replaced a string on his woodharp and sang The Mother’s Tears When Willum’s Wife Was Wet Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day and then The Rains of Castamere





And who are you the proud lord said

that I must bow so low

Only a cat of a different coat

that’s all the truth I know

In a coat of gold or a coat of red

a lion still has claws

And mine are long and sharp my lord

as long and sharp as yours

And so he spoke and so he spoke

that lord of Castamere

But now the rains weep o’er his hall

with no one there to hear

Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall

and not a soul to hear
