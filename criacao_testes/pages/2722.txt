318 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD he will
deliver the Moabites also into your hand

319 And ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and
shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every
good piece of land with stones

320 And it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was
offered that behold there came water by the way of Edom and the
country was filled with water

321 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour
and upward and stood in the border

322 And they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the
water and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as
blood 323 And they said This is blood the kings are surely slain
and they have smitten one another now therefore Moab to the spoil

324 And when they came to the camp of Israel the Israelites rose up
and smote the Moabites so that they fled before them but they went
forward smiting the Moabites even in their country

325 And they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land
cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the
wells of water and felled all the good trees only in Kirharaseth
left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and
smote it

326 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break
through even unto the king of Edom but they could not

327 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall And there
was great indignation against Israel and they departed from him and
returned to their own land

41 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto Elisha saying Thy servant my husband is dead and thou
knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD and the creditor is come
to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen

42 And Elisha said unto her What shall I do for thee tell me what
hast thou in the house And she said Thine handmaid hath not any
thing in the house save a pot of oil

43 Then he said Go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few

44 And when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou
shalt set aside that which is full

45 So she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her
sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out

46 And it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said
unto her son Bring me yet a vessel And he said unto her There is
not a vessel more And the oil stayed

47 Then she came and told the man of God And he said Go sell the
oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest

48 And it fell on a day that Elisha passed to Shunem where was a
great woman and she constrained him to eat bread And so it was that
as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread

49 And she said unto her husband Behold now I perceive that this is
an holy man of God which passeth by us continually

410 Let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let
us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a
candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn
in thither

411 And it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into
the chamber and lay there

412 And he said to Gehazi his servant Call this Shunammite And when
he had called her she stood before him

413 And he said unto him Say now unto her Behold thou hast been
careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the
host And she answered I dwell among mine own people

414 And he said What then is to be done for her And Gehazi
answered Verily she hath no child and her husband is old

415 And he said Call her And when he had called her she stood in
the door

416 And he said About this season according to the time of life
thou shalt embrace a son And she said Nay my lord thou man of God
do not lie unto thine handmaid

417 And the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that
Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life
