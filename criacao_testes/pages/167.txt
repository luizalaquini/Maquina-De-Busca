My lord The voice made Jon glance back in surprise Samwell Tarly was on his feet The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic Might I… might I go as well To say my words at this heart tree

Does House Tarly keep the old gods too Mormont asked

No my lord Sam replied in a thin nervous voice The high officers frightened him Jon knew the Old Bear most of all I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill as my father was and his father and all the Tarlys for a thousand years

Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker

The Night’s Watch is my House now Sam said The Seven have never answered my prayers Perhaps the old gods will

As you wish boy Mormont said Sam took his seat again as did Jon We have placed each of you in an order as befits our need and your own strengths and skills Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read Haider to the builders he began Haider gave a stiff nod of approval Grenn to the rangers Albett to the builders Pypar to the rangers Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears Samwell to the stewards Sam sagged with relief mopping at his brow witha scrap of silk Matthar to the rangers Dareon to the stewards Todder to the rangers Jon to the stewards

The stewards For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard Mormont must have read it wrong He started to rise to open his mouth to tell them there had been a mistake… and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian and he knew

The Old Bear rolled up the paper Your firsts will instruct you in your duties May all the gods preserve you brothers The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow and took his leave Ser Alliser went with him a thin smile on his face Jon had never seen the master-at-arms took quite so happy

Rangers with me Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet His ears were red Grenn grinning broadly did not seem to realize that anything was amiss Matt and Toad fell in beside them and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept

Builders announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck Haider and Albett trailed out after him

Jon looked around him in sick disbelief Maester Aemon’s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see The septon was arranging crystals on the altar Only Sam and Darcon remained on the benches a fat boy a singer… and him

Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together Samwell you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library Chett is going to the kennels to help with the hounds You shall have his cell so as to be close to the maester night and day I trust you will take good care of him He is very old and very precious to us

Dareon I am told that you sang at many a high lord’s table and shared their meat and mead We are sending you to Eastwatch It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish and the quality of the olive oil we’re getting has been frightful Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive he will keep you busy between ships

Marsh turned his smile on Jon Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward Jon You’ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers in the Lord Commander’s tower

And what will my duties be Jon asked sharply Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals help him fasten his clothes fetch hot water for his bath

Certainly Marsh frowned at Jon’s tone And you will run his messages keep a fire burning in his chambers change his sheets and blankets daily and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you

Do you take me for a servant

No Maester Aemon said from the back of the sept Clydas helped him stand We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch… but perhaps we were wrong in that

It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days May I go he asked stiffly

As you wish Bowen Marsh responded

Dareon and Sam left with him They descended to the yard in silence Outside Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers Jon’s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant and the world be damned

Jon Samwell Tarly said excitedly Wait Don’t you see what they’re doing

Jon turned on him in a fury I see Ser Alliser’s bloody hand that’s all I see He wanted to shame me and he has

Dareon gave him a look The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me Sam but not for Lord Snow

I’m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you Jon blazed back It’s not fair

Fair Dareon sneered The girl was waiting for me naked as the day she was born She pulled me through the window and you talk to me of fair He walked off

There is no shame in being a steward Sam said
