3417 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the
house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the
overseers and to the hand of the workmen

3418 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king saying Hilkiah the
priest hath given me a book And Shaphan read it before the king

3419 And it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the
law that he rent his clothes

3420 And the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahikam the son of Shaphan
and Abdon the son of Micah and Shaphan the scribe and Asaiah a
servant of the kings saying 3421 Go enquire of the LORD for me
and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the
words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the LORD
that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word
of the LORD to do after all that is written in this book

3422 And Hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to
Huldah the prophetess the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath the son
of Hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the
college and they spake to her to that effect

3423 And she answered them Thus saith the LORD God of Israel Tell
ye the man that sent you to me 3424 Thus saith the LORD Behold I
will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof
even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read
before the king of Judah 3425 Because they have forsaken me and
have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to
anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be
poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched

3426 And as for the king of Judah who sent you to enquire of the
LORD so shall ye say unto him Thus saith the LORD God of Israel
concerning the words which thou hast heard 3427 Because thine heart
was tender and thou didst humble thyself before God when thou
heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants
thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes
and weep before me I have even heard thee also saith the LORD

3428 Behold I will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be
gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the
evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of
the same So they brought the king word again

3429 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah
and Jerusalem

3430 And the king went up into the house of the LORD and all the men
of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the
Levites and all the people great and small and he read in their
ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the
house of the LORD

3431 And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the
LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his
soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this
book

3432 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
stand to it And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the
covenant of God the God of their fathers

3433 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
countries that pertained to the children of Israel and made all that
were present in Israel to serve even to serve the LORD their God And
all his days they departed not from following the LORD the God of
their fathers

351 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem and
they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month

352 And he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to
the service of the house of the LORD 353 And said unto the Levites
that taught all Israel which were holy unto the LORD Put the holy
ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did
build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the
LORD your God and his people Israel 354 And prepare yourselves by
the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the
writing of David king of Israel and according to the writing of
Solomon his son

355 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the
division of the families of the Levites

356 So kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your
brethren that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the
hand of Moses

357 And Josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all
for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number
of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the
kings substance

358 And his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests
and to the Levites Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel rulers of the
house of God gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two
