It is not necessarily at the very beginning of the syllable
For example in straight the tapping point is certainly after the
ul
s
and the stopped part of the
ul
t
pp
Another factor which relates to the division of the syllable duration
amongst phonetic segments is the often-observed fact that the length of the
vocalic nucleus is a strong clue to the degree of voicing of the terminating
cluster Lehiste 1970

Lehiste 1970 Suprasegmentals

If you say in pairs words like cap cab cat cad tack tag
you will find that the vowel in the first word of each pair is significantly
shorter than that in the second
In fact the major difference between such pairs is the vowel length
not the final consonant
pp
Such effects can be taken into account by considering a syllable to comprise
an initial consonant cluster followed by a vocalic nucleus and a final
consonant cluster
Any of these elements can be missing em the most unusual case where the
nucleus is absent occurs for example in so-called syllabic
ul
nc
s
as in renderings of button pudding which might be written
buttn puddn
However it is convenient to modify the definition of the nucleus
so as to rule out the possibility of it being empty
Using the characterization of the syllable given above the clusters can
be defined as
LB
NI
initial cluster	=  obstruentud sonorantud
NI
nucleus	=  vowelud sonorantud
NI
final cluster	=  obstruentud
LE
Sonorants are included in the nucleus so that it is always present
even in the case of a syllabic consonant
pp
Then rules can be used to divide the syllable duration between the
initial cluster nucleus and final cluster
These must distinguish between situations where the terminating cluster
is voiced or unvoiced so that the characteristic differences in vowel lengths
can be accomodated
pp
Finally the cluster durations must be apportioned amongst their constituent
phonetic segments  There is little published data on which to base this
Two simple schemes which have been used in ISP are described in
Witten 1977 and Witten  Smith 1977

Witten 1977 A flexible scheme for assigning timing and pitch to synthetic speech


Witten Smith 1977 Synthesizing British English rhythm

rh Pitch
There are two basically different ways of looking at the pitch of an
utterance
One is to imagine pitch
ul
levels
attached to individual syllables
This has been popular amongst American linguists and some people
have even gone so far as to associate pitch levels with levels of
stress
The second approach is to consider pitch
ul
contours
as we did earlier when examining how to transfer pitch from one utterance
to another
This seems to be easier for the person who transcribes the utterances
to produce for the information required is much less detailed than levels
attached to each syllable  Some indication needs to be given of how
the contour is to be bound to the utterance and in the notation introduced above
the most prominent or tonic syllable is indicated in the transcription
pp
Hallidays 1970 classification identifies five different primary intonation
contours each hinging on the tonic syllable

Halliday 1970 Course in spoken English Intonation

These are sketched in Figure 85 in the style of Halliday
FC Figure 85
Several secondary contours which are variations on the primary ones
are defined as well
However this classification scheme is intended for consumption by people
who bring to the problem a wealth of prior knowledge of speech and years
of experience with it  It captures only the gross features
of the infinite variety of pitch contours found in living speech
In a sense the classification is
ul
phonological
