No Donal Noye roared at three of the Mole’s Town men down below The pitch goes to the hoist the oil up the steps crossbow bolts to the fourth fifth and sixth landings spears to first and second Stack the lard under the stair yes there behind the planks The casks of meat are for the barricade Now you poxy plow pushers NOW

He has a lord’s voice Jon thought His father had always said that in battle a captain’s lungs were as important as his sword arm It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is if his commands cannot be heard Lord Eddard told his sons so Robb and he used to climb the towers of Winterfell to shout at each other across the yard Donal Noye could have drowned out both of them The moles all went in terror of him and rightfully so since he was always threatening to rip their heads off

Three-quarters of the village had taken Jon’s warning to heart and come to Castle Black for refuge Noye had decreed that every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade else they could damn well go home and take their chances with the Thenns He had emptied the armory to put good steel in their hands big double-bladed axes razor-sharp daggers longswords maces spiked morningstars Clad in studded leather jerkins and mail hauberks with greaves for their legs and gorgets to keep their heads on their shoulders a few of them even looked like soldiers In a bad light If you squint

Noye had put the women and children to work as well Those too young to fight would carry water and tend the fires the Mole’s Town midwife would assist Clydas and Maester Aemon with any wounded and Three-Finger Hobb suddenly had more spit boys kettle stirrers and onion choppers than he knew what to do with Two of the whores had even offered to fight and had shown enough skill with the crossbow to be given a place on the steps forty feet up

It’s cold Satin stood with his hands tucked into his armpits under his cloak His cheeks were bright red

Jon made himself smile The Frostfangs are cold This is a brisk autumn day

I hope I never see the Frostfangs then I knew a girl in Oldtown who liked to ice her wine That’s the best place for ice I think In wine Satin glanced south frowned You think the scarecrow sentinels scared them off my lord

We can hope It was possible Jon supposed    but more likely the wildlings had simply paused for a bit of rape and plunder in Mole’s Town Or maybe Styr was waiting for nightfall to move up under cover of darkness

Midday came and went with still no sign of Thenns on the kingsroad Jon heard footsteps inside the tower though and Owen the Oaf popped up out of the trapdoor red-faced from the climb He had a basket of buns under one arm a wheel of cheese under the other a bag of onions dangling from one hand Hobb said to feed you in case you’re stuck up here awhile

That or for our last meal Thank him for us Owen

Dick Follard was deaf as a stone but his nose worked well enough The buns were still warm from the oven when he went digging in the basket and plucked one out He found a crock of butter as well and spread some with his dagger Raisins he announced happily Nuts too His speech was thick but easy enough to understand once you got used to it

You can have mine too said Satin I’m not hungry

Eat Jon told him There’s no knowing when you’ll have another chance He took two buns himself The nuts were pine nuts and besides the raisins there were bits of dried apple

Will the wildlings come today Lord Snow Owen asked

You’ll know if they do said Jon Listen for the horns

Two Two is for wildlings Owen was tall towheaded and amiable a tireless worker and surprisingly deft when it came to working wood and fixing catapults and the like but as he’d gladly tell you his mother had dropped him on his head when he was a baby and half his wits had leaked out through his ear

You remember where to go Jon asked him

I’m to go to the stairs Donal Noye says I’m to go up to the third landing and shoot my crossbow down at the wildlings if they try to climb over the barrier The third landing one two three His head bobbed up and down If the wildlings attack the king will come and help us won’t he He’s a mighty warrior King Robert He’s sure to come Maester Aemon sent him a bird

There was no use telling him that Robert Baratheon was dead He would forget it as he’d forgotten it before Maester Aemon sent him a bird Jon agreed That seemed to make Owen happy

Maester Aemon had sent a lot of birds    not to one king but to four Wildlings at the gate the message ran The realm in danger Send all the help you can to Castle Black Even as far as Oldtown and the Citadel the ravens flew and to half a hundred mighty lords in their castles The northern lords offered their best hope so to them Aemon had sent two birds To the Umbers and the Boltons to Castle Cerwyn and Torrhen’s Square Karhold and Deepwood Motte to Bear Island Oldcastle Widow’s Watch White Harbor Barrowton and the Rills to the mountain fastnesses of the Liddles the Burleys the Norreys the Harclays and the Wulls the black birds brought their plea Wildlings at the gate The north in danger Come with all your strength

Well ravens might have wings but lords and kings do not If help was coming it would not come today

As morning turned to afternoon the smoke of Mole’s Town blew away and the southern sky was clear again No clouds thought Jon That was good Rain or snow could doom them all

Clydas and Maester Aemon rode the winch cage up to safety at the top of the Wall and most of the Mole’s Town wives as well Men in black cloaks paced restlessly on the tower tops and shouted back and forth across the courtyards Septon Cellador led the men on the barricade in a prayer beseeching the Warrior to give them strength Deaf Dick Follard curled up beneath his cloak and went to sleep Satin walked a hundred leagues in circles round and round the crenellations The Wall wept and the sun crept across a hard blue sky Near evenfall Owen the Oaf returned with a loaf of black bread and a pail of Hobb’s best mutton cooked in a thick broth of ale and onions Even Dick woke up for that They ate every bit of it using chunks of bread to wipe the bottom of the pail By the time they were done the sun was low in the west the shadows sharp and black throughout the castle Light the fire Jon told Satin and fill the kettle with oil

He went downstairs himself to bar the door to try and work some of the stiffness from his leg That was a mistake and Jon soon knew it but he clutched the crutch and saw it through all the same The door to the King’s Tower was oak studded with iron It might delay the Thenns but it would not stop them if they wanted to come in Jon slammed the bar down in its notches paid a visit to the privy—it might well be his last chance—and hobbled back up to the roof grimacing at the pain

The west had gone the color of a blood bruise but the sky above was cobalt blue deepening to purple and the stars were coming out Jon sat between two merlons with only a scarecrow for company and watched the Stallion gallop up the sky Or was it the Horned Lord He wondered where Ghost was now He wondered about Ygritte as well and told himself that way lay madness

They came in the night of course Like thieves Jon thought Like murderers

Satin pissed himself when the horns blew but Jon pretended not to notice Go shake Dick by the shoulder he told the Oldtown boy else he’s liable to sleep through the fight

I’m frightened Satin’s face was a ghastly white

So are they Jon leaned his crutch up against a merlon and took up his longbow bending the smooth thick Dornish yew to slip a bowstring through the notches Don’t waste a quarrel unless you know you have a good clean shot he said when Satin returned from waking Dick We have an ample supply up here but ample doesn’t mean inexhaustible And step behind a merlon to reload don’t try and hide in back of a scarecrow They’re made of straw an arrow will punch through them He did not bother telling Dick Follard anything Dick could read your lips if there was enough light and he gave a damn what you were saying but he knew it all already

The three of them took up positions on three sides of the round tower Jon hung a quiver from his belt and pulled an arrow The shaft was black the fletching grey As he notched it to his string he remembered something that Theon Greyjoy had once said after a hunt The boar can keep his tusks and the bear his claws he had declared smiling that way he did There’s nothing half so mortal as a grey goose feather

Jon had never been half the hunter that Theon was but he was no stranger to the longbow either There were dark shapes slipping around the armory backs against the stone but he could not see them well enough to waste an arrow He heard distant shouts and saw the archers on the Tower of Guards loosing shafts at the ground That was too far off to concern Jon But when he glimpsed three shadows detach themselves from the old stables fifty yards away he stepped up to the crenel raised his bow and drew They were running so he led them waiting waiting   

The arrow made a soft hiss as it left his string A moment later there was a grunt and suddenly only two shadows were loping across the yard They ran all the faster but Jon had already pulled a second arrow from his quiver This time he hurried the shot too much and missed The wildlings were gone by the time he nocked again He searched for another target and found four rushing around the empty shell of the Lord Commander’s Keep The moonlight glimmered off their spears and axes and the gruesome devices on their round leathern shields skulls and bones serpents bear claws twisted demonic faces Free folk he knew The Thenns carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses but theirs were plain and unadorned These were the lighter wicker shields of raiders

Jon pulled the goose feather back to his ear aimed and loosed the arrow then nocked and drew and loosed again The first shaft pierced the bearclaw shield the second one a throat The wildling screamed as he went down He heard the deep thrum of Deaf Dick’s crossbow to his left and Satin’s a moment later I got one the boy cried hoarsely I got one in the chest

Get another Jon called

He did not have to search for targets now only choose them He dropped a wildling archer as he was fitting an arrow to his string then sent a shaft toward the axeman hacking at the door of Hardin’s Tower That time he missed but the arrow quivering in the oak made the wildling reconsider It was only as he was running off that Jon recognized Big Boil Half a heartbeat later old Mully put an arrow through his leg from the roof of the Flint Barracks and he crawled off bleeding That will stop him bitching about his boil Jon thought

When his quiver was empty he went to get another and moved to a different crenel side by side with Deaf Dick Follard Jon got off three arrows for every bolt Deaf Dick discharged but that was the advantage of the longbow The crossbow penetrated better some insisted but it was slow and cumbersome to reload He could hear the wildlings shouting to each other and somewhere to the west a warhorn blew The world was moonlight and shadow and time became an endless round of notch and draw and loose A wildling arrow ripped through the throat of the straw sentinel beside him but Jon Snow scarcely noticed Give me one clean shot at the Magnar of Thenn he prayed to his father’s gods The Magnar at least was a foe that he could hate Give me Styr

His fingers were growing stiff and his thumb was bleeding but still Jon notched and drew and loosed A gout of flame caught his eye and he turned to see the door of the common hall afire It was only a few moments before the whole great timbered hall was burning Three-Finger Hobb and his Mole’s Town helpers were safe atop the Wall he knew but it felt like a punch in the belly all the same JON Deaf Dick yelled in his thick voice the armory They were on the roof he saw One had a torch Dick hopped up on the crenel for a better shot jerked his crossbow to his shoulder and sent a quarrel thrumming toward the torch man He missed

The archer down below him didn’t

Follard never made a sound only toppled forward headlong over the parapet It was a hundred feet to the yard below Jon heard the thump as he was peering round a straw soldier trying to see where the arrow had come from Not ten feet from Deaf Dick’s body he glimpsed a leather shield a ragged cloak a mop of thick red hair Kissed by fire he thought lucky He brought his bow up but his fingers would not part and she was gone as suddenly as she’d appeared He swiveled cursing and loosed a shaft at the men on the armory roof instead but he missed them as well

By then the east stables were afire too black smoke and wisps of burning hay pouring from the stalls When the roof collapsed flames rose up roaring so loud they almost drowned out the warhorns of the Thenns Fifty of them were pounding up the kingsroad in tight column their shields held up above their heads Others were swarming through the vegetable garden across the flagstone yard around the old dry well Three had hacked their way through the doors of Maester Aemon’s apartments in the timber keep below the rookery and a desperate fight was going on atop the Silent Tower longswords against bronze axes None of that mattered The dance has moved on he thought

Jon hobbled across to Satin and grabbed him by the shoulder With me he shouted Together they moved to the north parapet where the King’s Tower looked down on the gate and Donal Noye’s makeshift wall of logs and barrels and sacks of corn The Thenns were there before them They wore halfhelms and had thin bronze disks sewn to their long leather shirts Many wielded bronze axes though a few were chipped stone More had short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads that gleamed redly in the light from the burning stables They were screaming in the Old Tongue as they stormed the barricade jabbing with their spears swinging their bronze axes spilling corn and blood with equal abandon while crossbow quarrels and arrows rained down on them from the archers that Donal Noye had posted on the stair

What do we do Satin shouted

We kill them Jon shouted back a black arrow in his hand

No archer could have asked for an easier shot The Thenns had their backs to the King’s Tower as they charged the crescent clambering over bags and barrels to reach the men in black Both Jon and Satin chanced to choose the same target He had just reached the top of the barricade when an arrow sprouted from his neck and a quarrel between his shoulder blades Half a heartbeat later a longsword took him in the belly and he fell back onto the man behind him Jon reached down to his quiver and found it empty again Satin was winding back his crossbow He left him to it and went for more arrows but he hadn’t taken more than three steps before the trap slammed open three feet in front of him Bloody hell I never even heard the door break

There was no time to think or plan or shout for help Jon dropped his bow reached back over his shoulder ripped Longclaw from its sheath and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower Bronze was no match for Valyrian steel The blow sheared right through the Thenn’s helm and deep into his skull and he went crashing back down where he’d come from There were more behind him Jon knew from the shouting He fell back and called to Satin The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through his cheek He vanished too The oil Jon said Satin nodded Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they’d left beside the fire lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil and dumped it down the hole on the Thenns below The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick Jon kicked the trapdoor shut set the heavy iron kettle on top of it and gave the boy with the pretty face a hard shake Retch later Jon yelled Come

They had only been gone from the parapets for a few moments but everything below had changed A dozen black brothers and a few Mole’s Town men still stood atop the crates and barrels but the wildlings were swarming over all along the crescent pushing them back Jon saw one shove his spear up through Rast’s belly so hard he lifted him into the air Young Henly was dead and Old Henly was dying surrounded by foes He could see Easy spinning and slashing laughing like a loon his cloak flapping as he leapt from cask to cask A bronze axe caught him just below the knee and the laughter turned into a bubbling shriek

They’re breaking Satin said

No said Jon they’re broken

It happened quickly One mole fled and then another and suddenly all the villagers were throwing down their weapons and abandoning the barricade The brothers were too few to hold alone Jon watched them try and form a line to fall back in order but the Thenns washed over them with spear and axe and then they were fleeing too Dornish Dilly slipped and went down on his face and a wildling planted a spear between his shoulder blades Kegs slow and short of breath had almost reached the bottom step when a Thenn caught the end of his cloak and yanked him around    but a crossbow quarrel dropped the man before his axe could fall Got him Satin crowed as Kegs staggered to the stair and began to crawl up the steps on hands and knees

The gate is lost Donal Noye had closed and chained it but it was there for the taking the iron bars glimmering red with reflected firelight the cold black tunnel behind No one had fallen back to defend it the only safety was on top of the Wall seven hundred feet up the crooked wooden stairs
