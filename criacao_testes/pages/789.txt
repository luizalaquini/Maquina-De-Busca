Anguy drew an arrow We’re outlaws Outlaws steal It’s in the songs if you ask nice Tom may sing you one Be thankful we didn’t kill you

Come try it Archer I’ll take that quiver off you and shove those arrows up your freckly little arse

Anguy raised his longbow but Lord Beric lifted a hand before he could loose Why did you come here Clegane

To get back what’s mine

Your gold

What else It wasn’t for the pleasure of looking at your face Dondarrion I’ll tell you that You’re uglier than me now And a robber knight besides it seems

I gave you a note for your gold Lord Beric said calmly A promise to pay when the war’s done

I wiped my arse with your paper I want the gold

We don’t have it I sent it south with Greenbeard and the Huntsman to buy grain and seed across the Mander

To feed all them whose crops you burned said Gendry

Is that the tale now Sandor Clegane laughed again As it happens that’s just what I meant to do with it Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and their poxy whelps

You’re lying said Gendry

The boy has a mouth on him I see Why believe them and not me Couldn’t be my face could it Clegane glanced at Arya You going to make her a knight too Dondarrion The first eight-year-old girl knight

I’m twelve Arya lied loudly and I could be a knight if I wanted I could have killed you too only Lem took my knife Remembering that still made her angry

Complain to Lem not me Then tuck your tail between your legs and run Do you know what dogs do to wolves

Next time I will kill you I’ll kill your brother too

No His dark eyes narrowed That you won’t He turned back to Lord Beric Say make my horse a knight He never shits in the hall and doesn’t kick more than most he deserves to be knighted Unless you meant to steal him too

Best climb on that horse and go warned Lem

I’ll go with my gold Your own god said I’m guiltless—

The Lord of Light gave you back your life declared Thoros of Myr He did not proclaim you Baelor the Blessed come again The red priest unsheathed his sword and Arya saw that Jack and Merrit had drawn as well Lord Beric still held the blade he’d used to dub Gendry Maybe this time they’ll kill him

The Hound’s mouth gave another twitch You’re no more than common thieves

Lem glowered Your lion friends ride into some village take all the food and every coin they find and call it foraging The wolves as well so why not us No one robbed you dog You just been good and foraged

Sandor Clegane looked at their faces every one as if he were trying to commit them all to memory Then he walked back out into the darkness and the pouring rain from whence he’d come with never another word The outlaws waited wondering…

I best go see what he did to our sentries Harwin took a wary look out the door before he left to make certain the Hound was not lurking just outside

How’d that bloody bastard get all that gold anyhow Lem Lemoncloak said to break the tension

Anguy shrugged He won the Hand’s tourney In King’s Landing The bowman grinned I won a fair fortune myself but then I met Dancy Jayde and Alayaya They taught me what roast swan tastes like and how to bathe in Arbor wine

Pissed it all away did you laughed Harwin
