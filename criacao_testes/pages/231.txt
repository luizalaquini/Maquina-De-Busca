It’s a summoning the fat man repeated

Two boys close to Arya’s age scampered past splashing through a puddle The old woman cursed them but they kept right on going Other people were moving too heading up the hill to see what the noise was about Arya ran after the slower boy Where you going she shouted when she was right behind him What’s happening

He glanced back without slowing The gold cloaks is carryin’ him to the sept

Who she yelled running hard

The Hand They’ll be taking his head off Buu says

A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street The boy leapt over but Arya never saw it She tripped and fell face first scraping her knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth Needle tangled between her legs She sobbed as she struggled to her knees The thumb of her left hand was covered with blood When she sucked on it she saw that half the thumbnail was gone ripped off in her fall Her hands throbbed and her knee was all bloody too

Make way someone shouted from the cross street Make way for my lords of Redwyne It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down four guardsmen on huge horses pounding past at a gallop They wore checked cloaks blue-and-burgundy Behind them two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod Arya had seen them in the bailey a hundred times the Redwyne twins Ser Horas and Ser Hobber homely youths with orange hair and square freckled faces Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber and giggle whenever they caught sight of them They did not look funny now

Everyone was moving in the same direction all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about The bells seemed louder now clanging calling Arya joined the stream of people Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry She bit her lip as she limped along listening to the excited voices around her

—the King’s Hand Lord Stark They’re carrying him up to Baelor’s Sept

I heard he was dead

Soon enough soon enough Here I got me a silver stag says they lop his head off

Past time the traitor The man spat

Arya struggled to find a voice He never— she started but she was only a child and they talked right over her

Fool They ain’t neither going to lop him Since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the Great Sept

Well they don’t mean to anoint him no knight I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert Slit his throat in the woods and when they found him he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace

Ah that’s not true it was his own brother did him that Renly him with his gold antlers

You shut your lying mouth woman You don’t know what you’re saying his lordship’s a fine true man

By the time they reached the Street of the Sisters they were packed in shoulder to shoulder Arya let the human current carry her along up to the top of Visenya’s Hill The white marble plaza was a solid mass of people all yammering excitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the Great Sept of Baelor The bells were very loud here

Arya squirmed through the press ducking between the legs of horses and clutching tight to her sword stick From the middle of the crowd all she could see were arms and legs and stomachs and the seven slender towers of the sept looming overhead She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where she might be able to see but others had the same idea The teamster cursed at them and drove them off with a crack of his whip

Arya grew frantic Forcing her way to the front of the crowd she was shoved up against the stone of a plinth She looked up at Baelor the Blessed the septon king Sliding her stick sword through her belt Arya began to climb Her broken thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble but she made it up and wedged herself in between the king’s feet

That was when she saw her father

Lord Eddard stood on the High Septon’s pulpit outside the doors of the sept supported between two of the gold cloaks He was dressed in a rich grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur but he was thinner than Arya had ever seen him his long face drawn with pain He was not standing so much as being held up the cast over his broken leg was grey and rotten

The High Septon himself stood behind him a squat man grey with age and ponderously fat wearing long white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows whenever he moved

Clustered around the doors of the sept in front of the raised marble pulpit were a knot of knights and high lords Joffrey was prominent among them his raiment all crimson silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring lions a gold crown on his head His queen mother stood beside him in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson a veil of black diamonds in her hair Arya recognized the Hound wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor with four of the Kingsguard around him She saw Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe and she thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for Mother

And there in their midst was Sansa dressed in sky-blue silk with her long auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists Arya scowled wondering what her sister was doing here why she looked so happy

A long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd commanded by a stout man in elaborate armor all black lacquer and gold filigree His cloak had the metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold

When the bell ceased to toll a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza and her father lifted his head and began to speak his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out People behind her began to shout out What and Louder The man in the black-and-gold armor stepped up behind Father and prodded him sharply You leave him alone Arya wanted to shout but she knew no one would listen She chewed her lip
