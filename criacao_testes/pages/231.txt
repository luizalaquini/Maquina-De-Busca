thousand men

2022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves and set
their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in
array the first day

2023 And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
until even and asked counsel of the LORD saying Shall I go up again
to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother And the LORD
said Go up against him  2024 And the children of Israel came near
against the children of Benjamin the second day

2025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword

2026 Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up
and came unto the house of God and wept and sat there before the
LORD and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and
peace offerings before the LORD

2027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD for the ark of
the covenant of God was there in those days 2028 And Phinehas the
son of Eleazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days
saying Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of
Benjamin my brother or shall I cease And the LORD said Go up for
to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand

2029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah

2030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
Benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against Gibeah
as at other times

2031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people and
were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people
and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to
the house of God and the other to Gibeah in the field about thirty
men of Israel

2032 And the children of Benjamin said They are smitten down before
us as at the first But the children of Israel said Let us flee and
draw them from the city unto the highways

2033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and put
themselves in array at Baaltamar and the liers in wait of Israel came
forth out of their places even out of the meadows of Gibeah

2034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
Israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near
them

2035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel and the children of
Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand
and an hundred men all these drew the sword

2036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten for the
men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites because they trusted unto
the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah

2037 And the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon Gibeah and the
liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the
edge of the sword

2038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise
up out of the city

2039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle Benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons for they
said Surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle

2040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
pillar of smoke the Benjamites looked behind them and behold the
flame of the city ascended up to heaven

2041 And when the men of Israel turned again the men of Benjamin
were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them

2042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto
the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them
which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them

2043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about and chased them
and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the
sunrising

2044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were
men of valour

2045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
Rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men
and pursued hard after them unto Gidom and slew two thousand men of
them

2046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour

2047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
rock Rimmon and abode in the rock Rimmon four months
