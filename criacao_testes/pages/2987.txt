arise Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the
dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead

2620 Come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy
doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until
the indignation be overpast

2621 For behold the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall
disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain

271 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that
crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea

272 In that day sing ye unto her A vineyard of red wine

273 I the LORD do keep it I will water it every moment lest any
hurt it I will keep it night and day

274 Fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me
in battle I would go through them I would burn them together

275 Or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with
me and he shall make peace with me

276 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root Israel shall
blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit

277 Hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he
slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him  278
In measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he
stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind

279 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged and this
is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones
of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and
images shall not stand up

2710 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation
forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and
there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof

2711 When the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off
the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no
understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on
them and he that formed them will shew them no favour

2712 And it shall come to pass in that day that the LORD shall beat
off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt and ye
shall be gathered one by one O ye children of Israel

2713 And it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet
shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the
land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt and shall
worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem

281 Woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of Ephraim whose
glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat
valleys of them that are overcome with wine  282 Behold the Lord
hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a
destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast
down to the earth with the hand

283 The crown of pride the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden
under feet 284 And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the
fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before
the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet
in his hand he eateth it up

285 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory and
for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people 286 And for a
spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength
to them that turn the battle to the gate

287 But they also have erred through wine and through strong drink
are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through
strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way
through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment

288 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is
no place clean

289 Whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn
from the breasts

2810 For precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line
upon line line upon line here a little and there a little 2811
For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this
people

2812 To whom he said This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear

2813 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept
precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little
and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be
broken and snared and taken
