All you have made certain is that I shall never see my daughters again Brienne might have gotten him to King’s Landing safely… so long as no one was hunting for them But now… Catelyn could not go on Leave me Edmure She had no right to command him here in the castle that would soon be his yet her tone would brook no argument Leave me to Father and my grief I have no more to say to you Go Go All she wanted was to lie down to close her eyes and sleep and pray no dreams would come





Arya


The sky was as black as the walls of Harrenhal behind them and the rain fell soft and steady muffling the sound of their horses’ hooves and running down their faces

They rode north away from the lake following a rutted farm road across the torn fields and into the woods and streams Arya took the lead kicking her stolen horse to a brisk heedless trot until the trees closed in around her Hot Pie and Gendry followed as best they could Wolves howled off in the distance and she could hear Hot Pie’s heavy breathing No one spoke From time to time Arya glanced over her shoulder to make sure the two boys had not fallen too far behind and to see if they were being pursued

They would be she knew She had stolen three horses from the stables and a map and a dagger from Roose Bolton’s own solar and killed a guard on the postern gate slitting his throat when he knelt to pick up the worn iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar had given her Someone would find him lying dead in his own blood and then the hue and cry would go up They would wake Lord Bolton and search Harrenhal from crenel to cellar and when they did they would find the map and the dagger missing along with some swords from the armory bread and cheese from the kitchens a baker boy a ’prentice smith and a cupbearer called Nan… or Weasel or Arry depending on who you asked

The Lord of the Dreadfort would not come after them himself Roose Bolton would stay abed his pasty flesh dotted with leeches giving commands in his whispery soft voice His man Walton might lead the hunt the one they called Steelshanks for the greaves he always wore on his long legs Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and his sellswords who named themselves the Brave Companions Others called them Bloody Mummers though never to their faces and sometimes the Footmen for Lord Vargo’s habit of cutting off the hands and feet of men who displeased him

If they catch us he’ll cut off our hands and feet Arya thought and then Roose Bolton will peel the skin off us She was still dressed in her page’s garb and on the breast over her heart was sewn Lord Bolton’s sigil the flayed man of the Dreadfort

Every time she looked back she half expected to see a blaze of torches pouring out the distant gates of Harrenhal or rushing along the tops of its huge high walls but there was nothing Harrenhal slept on until it was lost in darkness and hidden behind the trees

When they crossed the first stream Arya turned her horse aside and led them off the road following the twisting course of the water for a quarter-mile before finally scrambling out and up a stony bank If the hunters brought dogs that might throw them off the scent she hoped They could not stay on the road There is death on the road she told herself death on all the roads

Gendry and Hot Pie did not question her choice She had the map after all and Hot Pie seemed almost as terrified of her as of the men who might be coming after them He had seen the guard she’d killed It’s better if he’s scared of me she told herself That way he’ll do like I say instead of something stupid

She should be more frightened herself she knew She was only ten a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal The rain had washed the guard’s blood off her fingers she wore a sword across her back wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows and Arya Stark was unafraid Fear cuts deeper than swords she whispered under her breath the words that Syrio Forel had taught her and Jaqen’s words too valar morghulis

The rain stopped and started again and stopped once more and started but they had good cloaks to keep the water off Arya kept them moving at a slow steady pace It was too black beneath the trees to ride any faster the boys were no horsemen neither one and the soft broken ground was treacherous with half-buried roots and hidden stones They crossed another road its deep ruts filled with runoff but Arya shunned it Up and down the rolling hills she took them through brambles and briars and tangles of underbrush along the bottoms of narrow gullies where branches heavy with wet leaves slapped at their faces as they passed

Gendry’s mare lost her footing in the mud once going down hard on her hindquarters and spilling him from the saddle but neither horse nor rider was hurt and Gendry got that stubborn look on his face and mounted right up again Not long after they came upon three wolves devouring the corpse of a fawn When Hot Pie’s horse caught the scent he shied and bolted Two of the wolves fled as well but the third raised his head and bared his teeth prepared to defend his kill Back off Arya told Gendry Slow so you don’t spook him They edged their mounts away until the wolf and his feast were no longer in sight Only then did she swing about to ride after Hot Pie who was clinging desperately to the saddle as he crashed through the trees

Later they passed through a burned village threading their way carefully between the shells of blackened hovels and past the bones of a dozen dead men hanging from a row of apple trees When Hot Pie saw them he began to pray a thin whispered plea for the Mother’s mercy repeated over and over Arya looked up at the fleshless dead in their wet rotting clothes and said her own prayer Ser Gregor it went Dunsen Polliver Raff the Sweetling The Tickler and the Hound Ser Ilyn Ser Meryn King Joffrey Queen Cersei She ended it with valar morghulis touched Jaqen’s coin where it nestled under her belt and then reached up and plucked an apple from among the dead men as she rode beneath them It was mushy and overripe but she ate it worms and all

That was the day without a dawn Slowly the sky lightened around them but they never saw the sun Black turned to grey and colors crept timidly back into the world The soldier pines were dressed in somber greens the broadleafs in russets and faded golds already beginning to brown They stopped long enough to water the horses and eat a cold quick breakfast ripping apart a loaf of the bread that Hot Pie had stolen from the kitchens and passing chunks of hard yellow cheese from hand to hand

Do you know where we’re going Gendry asked her

North said Arya

Hot Pie peered around uncertainly Which way is north

She used her cheese to point That way

But there’s no sun How do you know

From the moss See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees That’s south

What do we want with the north Gendry wanted to know

The Trident Arya unrolled the stolen map to show them See Once we reach the Trident all we need to do is follow it upstream till we come to Riverrun here Her finger traced the path It’s a long way but we can’t get lost so long as we keep to the river

Hot Pie blinked at the map Which one is Riverrun

Riverrun was painted as a castle tower in the fork between the flowing blue lines of two rivers the Tumblestone and the Red Fork There She touched it Riverrun it reads

You can read writing he said to her wonderingly as if she’d said she could walk on water

She nodded We’ll be safe once we reach Riverrun

We will Why

Because Riverrun is my grandfather’s castle and my brother Robb will be there she wanted to say She bit her lip and rolled up the map We just will But only if we get there She was the first one back in the saddle It made her feel bad to hide the truth from Hot Pie but she did not trust him with her secret Gendry knew but that was different Gendry had his own secret though even he didn’t seem to know what it was

That day Arya quickened their pace keeping the horses to a trot as long as she dared and sometimes spurring to a gallop when she spied a flat stretch of fleld before them That was seldom enough though the ground was growing hillier as they went The hills were not high nor especially steep but there seemed to be no end of them and they soon grew tired of climbing up one and down the other and found themselves following the lay of the land along streambeds and through a maze of shallow wooded valleys where the trees made a solid canopy overhead

From time to time she sent Hot Pie and Gendry on while she doubled back to try to confuse their trail listening all the while for the first sign of pursuit Too slow she thought to herself chewing her lip we’re going too slow they’ll catch us for certain Once from the crest of a ridge she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton’s riders were on them but when she looked again she realized they were only a pack of wolves She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them Ahooooooooo ahooooooooo When the largest of the wolves lifted its head and howled back the sound made Arya shiver

By midday Hot Pie had begun to complain His arse was sore he told them and the saddle was rubbing him raw inside his legs and besides he had to get some sleep I’m so tired I’m going to fall off the horse

Arya looked at Gendry If he falls off who do you think will find him first the wolves or the Mummers

The wolves said Gendry Better noses

Hot Pie opened his mouth and closed it He did not fall off his horse The rain began again a short time later They still had not seen so much as a glimpse of the sun It was growing colder and pale white mists were threading between the pines and blowing across the bare burned flelds

Gendry was having almost as bad a time of it as Hot Pie though he was too stubborn to complain He sat awkwardly in the saddle a determined look on his face beneath his shaggy black hair but Arya could tell he was no horseman I should have remembered she thought to herself She had been riding as long as she could remember ponies when she was little and later horses but Gendry and Hot Pie were city-born and in the city smallfolk walked Yoren had given them mounts when he took them from King’s Landing but sitting on a donkey and plodding up the kingsroad behind a wagon was one thing Guiding a hunting horse through wild woods and burned fields was something else

She would make much better time on her own Arya knew but she could not leave them They were her pack her friends the only living friends that remained to her and if not for her they would still be safe at Harrenhal Gendry sweating at his forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens If the Mummers catch us I’ll tell them that I’m Ned Stark’s daughter and sister to the King in the North I’ll command them to take me to my brother and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry They might not believe her though and even if they did… Lord Bolton was her brother’s bannerman but he frightened her all the same I won’t let them take us she vowed silently reaching back over her shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for her I won’t

Late that afternoon they emerged from beneath the trees and found themselves on the banks of a river Hot Pie gave a whoop of delight The Trident Now all we have to do is go upstream like you said We’re almost there

Arya chewed her lip I don’t think this is the Trident The river was swollen by the rain but even so it couldn’t be much more than thirty feet across She remembered the Trident as being much wider It’s too little to be the Trident she told them and we didn’t come far enough

Yes we did Hot Pie insisted We rode all day and hardly stopped at all We must have come a long way

Let’s have a look at that map again said Gendry

Arya dismounted took out the map unrolled it The rain pattered against the sheepskin and ran off in rivulets We’re someplace here I think she said pointing as the boys peered over her shoulders

But said Hot Pie that’s hardly any ways at all See Harrenhal’s there by your finger you’re almost touching it And we rode all day

There’s miles and miles before we reach the Trident she said We won’t be there for days This must be some different river one of these see She showed him some of the thinner blue lines the mapmaker had painted in each with a name painted in flne script beneath it The Darry the Greenapple the Maiden… here this one the Little Willow it might be that

Hot Pie looked from the line to the river It doesn’t look so little to me

Gendry was frowning as well The one you’re pointing at runs into that other one see

The Big Willow she read

The Big Willow then See and the Big Willow runs into the Trident so we could follow the one to the other but we’d need to go downstream not up Only if this river isn’t the Little Willow if it’s this other one here…
