The anger burned the grief and fear from her for a few hours at the least Afterward she called her bloodriders to her cabin with Ser Jorah They were the only ones she truly trusted

She meant to sleep afterward to be well rested for the morrow but an hour of restless tossing in the stuffy confines of the cabin soon convinced her that was hopeless Outside her door she found Aggo fitting a new string to his bow by the light of a swinging oil lamp Rakharo sat crosslegged on the deck beside him sharpening his arakh with a whetstone Dany told them both to keep on with what they were doing and went up on deck for a taste of the cool night air The crew left her alone as they went about their business but Ser Jorah soon joined her by the rail He is never far Dany thought He knows my moods too well

Khaleesi You ought to be asleep Tomorrow will be hot and hard I promise you You’ll need your strength

Do you remember Eroeh she asked him

The Lhazareen girl

They were raping her but I stopped them and took her under my protection Only when my sun-and-stars was dead Mago took her back used her again and killed her Aggo said it was her fate

I remember Ser Jorah said

I was alone for a long time Jorah All alone but for my brother I was such a small scared thing Viserys should have protected me but instead he hurt me and scared me worse He shouldn’t have done that He wasn’t just my brother he was my king Why do the gods make kings and queens if not to protect the ones who can’t protect themselves

Some kings make themselves Robert did

He was no true king Dany said scornfully He did no justice Justice… that’s what kings are for

Ser Jorah had no answer He only smiled and touched her hair so lightly It was enough

That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar riding to the Trident But she was mounted on a dragon not a horse When she saw the Usurper’s rebel host across the river they were armored all in ice but she bathed them in dragonfire and they melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming but another part exulted This is how it was meant to be The other was a nightmare and I have only now awakened

She woke suddenly in the darkness of her cabin still flush with triumph Balerion seemed to wake with her and she heard the faint creak of wood water lapping against the hull a footfall on the deck above her head And something else

Someone was in the cabin with her

Irri Jhiqui Where are you Her handmaids did not respond It was too black to see but she could hear them breathing Jorah is that you

They sleep a woman said They all sleep The voice was very close Even dragons must sleep

She is standing over me Who’s there Dany peered into the darkness She thought she could see a shadow the faintest outline of a shape What do you want of me

Remember To go north you must journey south To reach the west you must go east To go forward you must go back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow

Quaithe Dany sprung from the bed and threw open the door Pale yellow lantern light flooded the cabin and Irri and Jhiqui sat up sleepily Khaleesi murmured Jhiqui rubbing her eyes Viserion woke and opened his jaws and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest corners There was no sign of a woman in a red lacquer mask Khaleesi are you unwell asked Jhiqui

A dream Dany shook her head I dreamed a dream no more Go back to sleep All of us go back to sleep Yet try as she might sleep would not come again

If I look back I am lost Dany told herself the next morning as she entered Astapor through the harbor gates She dared not remind herself how small and insignificant her following truly was or she would lose all courage Today she rode her silver clad in horsehair pants and painted leather vest a bronze medallion belt about her waist and two more crossed between her breasts Irri and Jhiqui had braided her hair and hung it with a tiny silver bell whose chime sang of the Undying of Qarth burned in their Palace of Dust

The red brick streets of Astapor were almost crowded this morning Slaves and servants lined the ways while the slavers and their women donned their tokars to look down from their stepped pyramids They are not so different from Qartheen after all she thought They want a glimpse of dragons to tell their children of and their children’s children It made her wonder how many of them would ever have children

Aggo went before her with his great Dothraki bow Strong Belwas walked to the right of her mare the girl Missandei to her left Ser Jorah Mormont was behind in mail and surcoat glowering at anyone who came too near Rakharo and Jhogo protected the litter Dany had commanded that the top be removed so her three dragons might be chained to the platform Irri and Jhiqui rode with them to try and keep them calm Yet Viserion’s tail lashed back and forth and smoke rose angry from his nostrils Rhaegal could sense something wrong as well Thrice he tried to take wing only to be pulled down by the heavy chain in Jhiqui’s hand Drogon coiled into a ball wings and tail tucked tight Only his eyes remained to tell that he was not asleep

The rest of her people followed Groleo and the other captains and their crews and the eighty-three Dothraki who remained to her of the hundred thousand who had once ridden in Drogo’s khalasar She put the oldest and weakest on the inside of the column with the nursing women and those with child and the little girls and the boys too young to braid their hair The rest—her warriors such as they were—rode outside and moved their dismal herd along the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived both red waste and black salt sea

I ought to have a banner sewn she thought as she led her tattered band up along Astapor’s meandering river She closed her eyes to imagine how it would look all flowing black silk and on it the red three-headed dragon of Targaryen breathing golden flames A banner such as Rhaegar might have borne The river’s banks were strangely tranquil The Worm the Astapori called the stream It was wide and slow and crooked dotted with tiny wooded islands She glimpsed children playing on one of them darting amongst elegant marble statues On another island two lovers kissed in the shade of tall green trees with no more shame than Dothraki at a wedding Without clothing she could not tell if they were slave or free

The Plaza of Pride with its great bronze harpy was too small to hold all the Unsullied she had bought Instead they had been assembled in the Plaza of Punishment fronting on Astapor’s main gate so they might be marched directly from the city once Daenerys had taken them in hand There were no bronze statues here only a wooden platform where rebellious slaves were racked and flayed and hanged The Good Masters place them so they will be the first thing a new slave sees upon entering the city Missandei told her as they came to the plaza

At first glimpse Dany thought their skin was striped like the zorses of the Jogos Nhai Then she rode her silver nearer and saw the raw red flesh beneath the crawling black stripes Flies Flies and maggots The rebellious slaves had been peeled like a man might peel an apple in a long curling strip One man had an arm black with flies from fingers to elbow and red and white beneath Dany reined in beneath him What did this one do
