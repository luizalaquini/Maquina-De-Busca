94 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD neither shall
they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the
bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their
bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD

95 What will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of
the LORD  96 For lo they are gone because of destruction Egypt
shall gather them up Memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for
their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their
tabernacles

97 The days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come
Israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad
for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred

98 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God but the prophet is a
snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his God

99 They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah
therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins

910 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness I saw your fathers
as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to
Baalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and their
abominations were according as they loved

911 As for Ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the
birth and from the womb and from the conception

912 Though they bring up their children yet will I bereave them
that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when I
depart from them  913 Ephraim as I saw Tyrus is planted in a
pleasant place but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the
murderer

914 Give them O LORD what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying
womb and dry breasts

915 All their wickedness is in Gilgal for there I hated them for
the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house I
will love them no more all their princes are revolters

916 Ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no
fruit yea though they bring forth yet will I slay even the beloved
fruit of their womb

917 My God will cast them away because they did not hearken unto
him and they shall be wanderers among the nations

101 Israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself
according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars
according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images

102 Their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall
break down their altars he shall spoil their images

103 For now they shall say We have no king because we feared not
the LORD what then should a king do to us  104 They have spoken
words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth
up as hemlock in the furrows of the field

105 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
Bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests
thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is
departed from it

106 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
Jareb Ephraim shall receive shame and Israel shall be ashamed of his
own counsel

107 As for Samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water

108 The high places also of Aven the sin of Israel shall be
destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars
and they shall say to the mountains Cover us and to the hills Fall
on us

109 O Israel thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah there they
stood the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not
overtake them

1010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them and the people
shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in
their two furrows

1011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread
out the corn but I passed over upon her fair neck I will make
Ephraim to ride Judah shall plow and Jacob shall break his clods

1012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your
fallow ground for it is time to seek the LORD till he come and rain
righteousness upon you

1013 Ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have
eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the
multitude of thy mighty men

1014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy
fortresses shall be spoiled as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day
of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children
