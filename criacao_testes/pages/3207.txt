933 And he came to Capernaum and being in the house he asked them
What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way  934 But
they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among
themselves who should be the greatest

935 And he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them If
any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant
of all

936 And he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when
he had taken him in his arms he said unto them 937 Whosoever shall
receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever
shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me

938 And John answered him saying Master we saw one casting out
devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him
because he followeth not us

939 But Jesus said Forbid him not for there is no man which shall
do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me

940 For he that is not against us is on our part

941 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name
because ye belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose
his reward

942 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck and he were cast into the sea

943 And if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to
enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched 944 Where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched

945 And if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to
enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched 946 Where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched

947 And if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to
be cast into hell fire 948 Where their worm dieth not and the fire
is not quenched

949 For every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice
shall be salted with salt

950 Salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith
will ye season it Have salt in yourselves and have peace one with
another

101 And he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by
the farther side of Jordan and the people resort unto him again and
as he was wont he taught them again

102 And the Pharisees came to him and asked him Is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife tempting him

103 And he answered and said unto them What did Moses command you
104 And they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and
to put her away

105 And Jesus answered and said unto them For the hardness of your
heart he wrote you this precept

106 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
female

107 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and
cleave to his wife 108 And they twain shall be one flesh so then
they are no more twain but one flesh

109 What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder

1010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
matter

1011 And he saith unto them Whosoever shall put away his wife and
marry another committeth adultery against her

1012 And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to
another she committeth adultery

1013 And they brought young children to him that he should touch
them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them

1014 But when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto
them Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not
for of such is the kingdom of God

1015 Verily I say unto you Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of God as a little child he shall not enter therein

1016 And he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and
blessed them

1017 And when he was gone forth into the way there came one running
