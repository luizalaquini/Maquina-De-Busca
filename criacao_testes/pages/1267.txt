When you come to the chamber of the Undying be patient Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth’s wing to them Listen well and write each word upon your heart

When they reached the door—a tall oval mouth set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face—the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold He stood no higher than her knee his faced pinched and pointed snoutish but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid shade of the evening the wine of warlocks Take and drink urged Pyat Pree

Will it turn my lips blue

One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you

Dany raised the glass to her lips The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat foul but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest like fingers of fire coiling around her heart and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream like mother’s milk and Drogo’s seed like red meat and hot blood and molten gold It was all the tastes she had ever known and none of them… and then the glass was empty

Now you may enter said the warlock Dany put the glass back on the servitor’s tray and went inside

She found herself in a stone anteroom with four doors one on each wall With never a hesitation she went to the door on her right and stepped through The second room was a twin to the first Again she turned to the right-hand door When she pushed it open she faced yet another small antechamber with four doors I am in the presence of sorcery

The fourth room was oval rather than square and walled in worm-eaten wood in place of stone Six passages led out from it in place of four Dany chose the rightmost and entered a long dim high-ceilinged hall Along the right hand was a row of torches burning with a smoky orange light but the only doors were to her left Drogon unfolded wide black wings and beat the stale air He flew twenty feet before thudding to an undignified crash Dany strode after him

The mold-eaten carpet under her feet had once been gorgeously colored and whorls of gold could still be seen in the fabric glinting broken amidst the faded grey and mottled green What remained served to muffle her footfalls but that was not all to the good Dany could hear sounds within the walls a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats Drogon heard them too His head moved as he followed the sounds and when they stopped he gave an angry scream Other sounds even more disturbing came through some of the closed doors One shook and thumped as if someone were trying to break through From another came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side Dany hurried quickly past

Not all the doors were closed I will not look Dany told herself but the temptation was too strong

In one room a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade One was pumping between her thighs Another savaged her breasts worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth tearing and chewing

Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses Savagely slaughtered the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables asprawl in pools of congealing blood Some had lost limbs even heads Severed hands clutched bloody cups wooden spoons roast fowl heels of bread In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal

She fled from him but only as far as the next open door I know this room she thought She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them And there outside the window a lemon tree The sight of it made her heart ache with longing It is the house with the red door the house in Braavos No sooner had she thought it than old Ser Willem came into the room leaning heavily on his stick Little princess there you are he said in his gruff kind voice Come he said come to me my lady you’re home now you’re safe now His big wrinkled hand reached for her soft as old leather and Dany wanted to take it and hold it and kiss it she wanted that as much as she had ever wanted anything Her foot edged forward and then she thought He’s dead he’s dead the sweet old bear he died a long time ago She backed away and ran

The long hall went on and on and on with endless doors to her left and only torches to her right She ran past more doors than she could count closed doors and open ones doors of wood and doors of iron carved doors and plain ones doors with pulls and doors with locks and doors with knockers Drogon lashed against her back urging her on and Dany ran until she could run no more

Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left grander than the rest They swung open as she neared and she had to stop and look Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall the largest she had ever seen The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat he said to a man below him Let him be the king of ashes Drogon shrieked his claws digging through silk and skin but the king on his throne never heard and Dany moved on

Viserys was her first thought the next time she paused but a second glance told her otherwise The man had her brother’s hair but he was taller and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac Aegon he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed What better name for a king

Will you make a song for him the woman asked

He has a song the man replied He is the prince that was promised and his is the song of ice and fire He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany’s and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door There must be one more he said though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say The dragon has three heads He went to the window seat picked up a harp and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way

It seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a steep stone stair descending into darkness Every door open or closed had been to her left Dany looked back behind her The torches were going out she realized with a start of fear Perhaps twenty still burned Thirty at most One more guttered out even as she watched and the darkness came a little farther down the hall creeping toward her And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the faded carpet Terror filled her She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here but how could she go on There was no door on her right and the steps went down not up

Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering and the sounds grew faintly louder Drogon’s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream steam rising from between his teeth He hears it too Dany turned to the blank wall once more but there was nothing Could there be a secret door a door I cannot see Another torch went out Another The first door on the right he said always the first door on the right The first door on the right…

It came to her suddenly… is the last door on the left

She flung herself through Beyond was another small room with four doors To the right she went and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right and to the right until she was dizzy and out of breath once more

When she stopped she found herself in yet another dank stone chamber… but this time the door opposite was round shaped like an open mouth and Pyat Pree stood outside in the grass beneath the trees Can it be that the Undying are done with you so soon he asked in disbelief when he saw her

So soon she said confused I’ve walked for hours and still not found them

You have taken a wrong turning Come I will lead you Pyat Pree held out his hand

Dany hesitated There was a door to her right still closed…

That’s not the way Pyat Pree said firmly his blue lips prim with disapproval The Undying Ones will not wait forever

Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth’s wing to them Dany said remembering

Stubborn child You will be lost and never found

She walked away from him to the door on the right

No Pyat screeched No to me come to me to meeeeeee His face crumbled inward changing to something pale and wormlike

Dany left him behind entering a stairwell She began to climb Before long her legs were aching She recalled that the House of the Undying Ones had seemed to have no towers

Finally the stair opened To her right a set of wide wooden doors had been thrown open They were fashioned of ebony and weirwood the black and white grains swirling and twisting in strange interwoven patterns They were very beautiful yet somehow frightening The blood of the dragon must not be afraid Dany said a quick prayer begging the Warrior for courage and the Dothraki horse god for strength She made herself walk forward

Beyond the doors was a great hall and a splendor of wizards Some wore sumptuous robes of ermine ruby velvet and cloth of gold Others fancied elaborate armor studded with gemstones or tall pointed hats speckled with stars There were women among them dressed in gowns of surpassing loveliness Shafts of sunlight slanted through windows of stained glass and the air was alive with the most beautiful music she had ever heard

A kingly man in rich robes rose when he saw her and smiled Daenerys of House Targaryen be welcome Come and share the food of forever We are the Undying of Qarth

Long have we awaited you said a woman beside him clad in rose and silver The breast she had left bare in the Qartheen fashion was as perfect as a breast could be

We knew you were to come to us the wizard king said A thousand years ago we knew and have been waiting all this time We sent the comet to show you the way

We have knowledge to share with you said a warrior in shining emerald armor and magic weapons to arm you with You have passed every trial Now come and sit with us and all your questions shall be answered

She took a step forward But then Drogon leapt from her shoulder He flew to the top of the ebony-and-weirwood door perched there and began to bite at the carved wood

A willful beast laughed a handsome young man Shall we teach you the secret speech of dragonkind Come come

Doubt seized her The great door was so heavy it took all of Dany’s strength to budge it but finally it began to move Behind was another door hidden It was old grey wood splintery and plain… but it stood to the right of the door through which she’d entered The wizards were beckoning her with voices sweeter than song She ran from them Drogon flying back down to her Through the narrow door she passed into a chamber awash in gloom

A long stone table filled this room Above it floated a human heart swollen and blue with corruption yet still alive It beat a deep ponderous throb of sound and each pulse sent out a wash of indigo light The figures around the table were no more than blue shadows As Dany walked to the empty chair at the foot of the table they did not stir nor speak nor turn to face her There was no sound but the slow deep beat of the rotting heart

…mother of dragons… came a voice part whisper and part moan… dragons… dragons… dragons… other voices echoed in the gloom Some were male and some female One spoke with the timbre of a child The floating heart pulsed from dimness to darkness It was hard to summon the will to speak to recall the words she had practiced so assiduously I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros Do they hear me Why don’t they move She sat folding her hands in her lap Grant me your counsel and speak to me with the wisdom of those who have conquered death

Through the indigo murk she could make out the wizened features of the Undying One to her right an old old man wrinkled and hairless His flesh was a ripe violet-blue his lips and nails bluer still so dark they were almost black Even the whites of his eyes were blue They stared unseeing at the ancient woman on the opposite side of the table whose gown of pale silk had rotted on her body One withered breast was left bare in the Qartheen manner to show a pointed blue nipple hard as leather

She is not breathing Dany listened to the silence None of them are breathing and they do not move and those eyes see nothing Could it be that the Undying Ones were dead

Her answer was a whisper as thin as a mouse’s whisker… we live… live… live… it sounded Myriad other voices whispered echoes… And know… know… know… know…

I have come for the gift of truth Dany said In the long hall the things I saw… were they true visions or lies Past things or things to come What did they mean

…the shape of shadows… morrows not yet made… drink from the cup of ice… drink from the cup of fire…

…mother of dragons… child of three…

Three She did not understand
