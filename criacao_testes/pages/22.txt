ARYA

Arya’s stitches were crooked again

She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls Sansa’s needlework was exquisite Everyone said so Sansa’s work is as pretty as she is Septa Mordane told their lady mother once She has such fine delicate hands When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya the septa had sniffed Arya has the hands of a blacksmith

Arya glanced furtively across the room worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts but the septa was paying her no attention today She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella all smiles and admiration It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them Arya thought that Myrcella’s stitches looked a little crooked too but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing

She studied her own work again looking for some way to salvage it then sighed and put down the needle She looked glumly at her sister Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked Beth Cassel Ser Rodrik’s little girl was sitting by her feet listening to every word she said and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear

What are you talking about Arya asked suddenly

Jeyne gave her a startled look then giggled Sansa looked abashed Beth blushed No one answered

Tell me Arya said

Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening Myrcella said something then and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies

We were talking about the prince Sansa said her voice soft as a kiss

Arya knew which prince she meant Jofftey of course The tall handsome one Sansa got to sit with him at the feast Arya had to sit with the little fat one Naturally

Joffrey likes your sister Jeyne whispered proud as if she had something to do with it She was the daughter of Winterfell’s steward and Sansa’s dearest friend He told her she was very beautiful

He’s going to marry her little Beth said dreamily hugging herself Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm

Sansa had the grace to blush She blushed prettily She did everything prettily Arya thought with dull resentment Beth you shouldn’t make up stories Sansa corrected the younger girl gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words She looked at Arya What did you think of Prince Joff sister He’s very gallant don’t you think

Jon says he looks like a girl Arya said

Sansa sighed as she stitched Poor Jon she said He gets jealous because he’s a bastard

He’s our brother Arya said much too loudly Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room

Septa Mordane raised her eyes She had a bony face sharp eyes and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning It was frowning now What are you talking about children

Our half brother Sansa corrected soft and precise She smiled for the septa Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today she said

Septa Mordane nodded Indeed A great honor for us all Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment Arya why aren’t you at work the septa asked She rose to her feet starched skirts rustling as she started across the room Let me see your stitches

Arya wanted to scream It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa’s attention Here she said surrendering up her work

The septa examined the fabric Arya Arya Arya she said This will not do This will not do at all

Everyone was looking at her It was too much Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister’s disgrace but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her Arya felt tears filling her eyes She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door

Septa Mordane called after her Arya come back here Don’t you take another step Your lady mother will hear of this In front of our royal princess too You’ll shame us all

Arya stopped at the door and turned back biting her lip The tears were running down her cheeks now She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella By your leave my lady

Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance But if she was uncertain Septa Mordane was not Just where do you think you are going Arya the septa demanded

Arya glared at her I have to go shoe a horse she said sweetly taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa’s face Then she whirled and made her exit running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her
