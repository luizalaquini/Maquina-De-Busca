Am I Ah Varys giggled It seemed strangely out of place in this place of cold stone and echoing darkness Your brother can be most persuasive

Varys you are as cold and slimy as a slug has anyone ever told you You did your best to kill me Perhaps I ought to return the favor

The eunuch sighed The faithful dog is kicked and no matter how the spider weaves he is never loved But if you slay me here I fear for you my lord You may never find your way back to daylight His eyes glittered in the shifting torchlight dark and wet These tunnels are full of traps for the unwary

Tyrion snorted Unwary I’m the wariest man who ever lived you helped see to that He rubbed at his nose So tell me wizard where is my innocent maiden wife

I have found no trace of Lady Sansa in King’s Landing sad to say Nor of Ser Dontos Hollard who by rights should have turned up somewhere drunk by now They were seen together on the serpentine steps the night she vanished After that nothing There was much confusion that night My little birds are silent Varys gave a gentle tug at the dwarf’s sleeve and pulled him into the stair My lord we must away Your path is down

That’s no lie at least Tyrion waddled along in the eunuch’s wake his heels scraping against the rough stone as they descended It was very cold within the stairwell a damp bone-chilling cold that set him to shivering at once What part of the dungeons are these he asked

Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle Varys replied On the upper level there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together They have narrow windows set high in the walls The second level has the smaller cells where highborn captives are held They have no windows but torches in the halls cast light through the bars On the third level the cells are smaller and the doors are wood The black cells men call them That was where you were kept and Eddard Stark before you But there is a level lower still Once a man is taken down to the fourth level he never sees the sun again nor hears a human voice nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain Maegor had the cells on the fourth level built for torment They had reached the bottom of the steps An unlighted door opened before them This is the fourth level Give me your hand my lord It is safer to walk in darkness here There are things you would not wish to see

Tyrion hung back a moment Varys had already betrayed him once Who knew what game the eunuch was playing And what better place to murder a man than down in the darkness in a place that no one knew existed His body might never be found

On the other hand what choice did he have To go back up the steps and walk out the main gate No that would not serve

Jaime would not be afraid he thought before he remembered what Jaime had done to him He took the eunuch by the hand and let himself be led through the black following the soft scrape of leather on stone Varys walked quickly from time to time whispering Careful there are three steps ahead or The tunnel slopes downward here my lord I arrived here a King’s Hand riding through the gates at the head of my own sworn men Tyrion reflected and I leave like a rat scuttling through the dark holding hands with a spider

A light appeared ahead of them too dim to be daylight and grew as they hurried toward it After a while he could see it was an arched doorway closed off by another iron gate Varys produced a key They stepped through into a small round chamber Five other doors opened off the room each barred in iron There was an opening in the ceiling as well and a series of rungs set in the wall below leading upward An ornate brazier stood to one side fashioned in the shape of a dragon’s head The coals in the beast’s yawning mouth had burnt down to embers but they still glowed with a sullen orange light Dim as it was the light was welcome after the blackness of the tunnel

The juncture was otherwise empty but on the floor was a mosaic of a three-headed dragon wrought in red and black tiles Something niggled at Tyrion for a moment Then it came to him This is the place Shae told me of when Varys first led her to my bed We are below the Tower of the Hand

Yes Frozen hinges screamed in protest as Varys pulled open a long-closed door Flakes of rust drifted to the floor This will take us out to the river

Tyrion walked slowly to the ladder ran his hand across the lowest rung This will take me up to my bedchamber

Your lord father’s bedchamber now

He looked up the shaft How far must I climb

My lord you are too weak for such follies and there is besides no time We must go

I have business above How far

Two hundred and thirty rungs but whatever you intend—

Two hundred and thirty rungs and then

The tunnel to the left but hear me—

How far along to the bedchamber Tyrion lifted a foot to the lowest rung of the ladder

No more than sixty feet Keep one hand on the wall as you go You will feel the doors The bedchamber is the third He sighed This is folly my lord Your brother has given you your life back Would you cast it away and mine with it

Varys the only thing I value less than my life just now is yours Wait for me here He turned his back on the eunuch and began to climb counting silently as he went

Rung by rung he ascended into darkness At first he could see the dim outline of each rung as he grasped it and the rough grey texture of the stone behind but as he climbed the black grew thicker Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen By thirty his arms trembled with the strain of pulling He paused a moment to catch his breath and glanced down A circle of faint light shone far below half obscured by his own feet Tyrion resumed his ascent Thirty-nine forty forty-one By fifty his legs burned The ladder was endless numbing Sixty-eight sixty-nine seventy By eighty his back was a dull agony Yet still he climbed He could not have said why One thirteen one fourteen one fifteen

At two hundred and thirty the shaft was black as pitch but he could feel the warm air flowing from the tunnel to his left like the breath of some great beast He poked about awkwardly with a foot and edged off the ladder The tunnel was even more cramped than the shaft Any man of normal size would have had to crawl on hands and knees but Tyrion was short enough to walk upright At last a place made for dwarfs His boots scuffed softly against the stone He walked slowly counting steps feeling for gaps in the walls Soon he began to hear voices muffled and indistinct at first then clearer He listened more closely Two of his father’s guardsmen were joking about the Imp’s whore saying how sweet it would be to fuck her and how bad she must want a real cock in place of the dwarf’s stunted little thing Most like it’s got a crook in it said Lum That led him into a discussion of how Tyrion would die on the morrow He’ll weep like a woman and beg for mercy you’ll see Lum insisted Lester figured he’d face the axe brave as a lion being a Lannister and he was willing to bet his new boots on it Ah shit in your boots said Lum you know they’d never fit these feet o’ mine Tell you what if I win you can scour my bloody mail for a fortnight

For the space of a few feet Tyrion could hear every word of their haggling but when he moved on the voices faded quickly Small wonder Varys did not want me to climb the bloody ladder Tyrion thought smiling in the dark Little birds indeed
