Bran could hear the distant clash of arms through the windows He cared nothing about marriages I wish I was down in the yard

His lordship waited until the table had been cleared before he raised the matter of a letter he had received from Lord Tywin Lannister who held his elder son Ser Wylis taken captive on the Green Fork He offers him back to me without ransom provided I withdraw my levies from His Grace and vow to fight no more

You will refuse him of course said Ser Rodrik

Have no fear on that count the lord assured them King Robb has no more loyal servant than Wyman Manderly I would be loath to see my son languish at Harrenhal any longer than he must however That is an ill place Cursed they say Not that I am the sort to swallow such tales but still there it is Look at what’s befallen this Janos Slynt Raised up to Lord of Harrenhal by the queen and cast down by her brother Shipped off to the Wall they say I pray some equitable exchange of captives can be arranged before too very long I know Wylis would not want to sit out the rest of the war Gallant that son of mine and fierce as a mastiff

Bran’s shoulders were stiff from sitting in the same chair by the time the audience drew to a close And that night as he sat to supper a horn sounded to herald the arrival of another guest Lady Donella Hornwood brought no tail of knights and retainers only herself and six tired men-at-arms with a moosehead badge on their dusty orange livery We are very sorry for all you have suffered my lady Bran said when she came before him to speak her words of greetings Lord Hornwood had been killed in the battle on the Green Fork their only son cut down in the Whispering Wood Winterfell will remember

That is good to know She was a pale husk of a woman every line of her face etched with grief I am very weary my lord If I might have leave to rest I should be thankful

To be sure Ser Rodrik said There is time enough for talk on the morrow

When the morrow came most of the morning was given over to talk of grains and greens and salting meat Once the maesters in their Citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn wise men put away a portion of each harvest… though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to require much talk Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest At Maester Luwin’s suggestion she vowed to increase that to a quarter

Bolton’s bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort she warned them I hope he means to take them south to join his father at the Twins but when I sent to ask his intent he told me that no Bolton would be questioned by a woman As if he were trueborn and had a right to that name

Lord Bolton has never acknowledged the boy so far as I know Ser Rodrik said I confess I do not know him

Few do she replied He lived with his mother until two years past when young Domeric died and left Bolton without an heir That was when he brought his bastard to the Dreadfort The boy is a sly creature by all accounts and he has a servant who is almost as cruel as he is Reek they call the man It’s said he never bathes They hunt together the Bastard and this Reek and not for deer I’ve heard tales things I can scarce believe even of a Bolton And now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the gods the Bastard looks at my lands hungrily

Bran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend her rights but Ser Rodrik only said He may look but should he do more I promise you there will be dire retribution You will be safe enough my lady… though perhaps in time when your grief is passed you may find it prudent to wed again

I am past my childbearing years what beauty I had long fled she replied with a tired half smile yet men come sniffing after me as they never did when I was a maid

You do not look favorably on these suitors asked Luwin

I shall wed again if His Grace commands it Lady Hornwood replied but Mors Crowfood is a drunken brute and older than my father As for my noble cousin of Manderly my lord’s bed is not large enough to hold one of his majesty and I am surely too small and frail to lie beneath him

Bran knew that men slept on top of women when they shared a bed Sleeping under Lord Manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse he imagined Ser Rodrik gave the widow a sympathetic nod You will have other suitors my lady We shall try and find you a prospect more to your taste

Perhaps you need not look very far ser

After she had taken her leave Maester Luwin smiled Ser Rodrik I do believe my lady fancies you

Ser Rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable

She was very sad said Bran

Ser Rodrik nodded Sad and gentle and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years for all her modesty Yet a danger to the peace of your brother’s realm nonetheless

Her Bran said astonished

Maester Luwin answered With no direct heir there are sure to be many claimants contending for the Hornwood lands The Tallharts Flints and Karstarks all have ties to House Hornwood through the female line and the Glovers are fostering Lord Harys’s bastard at Deepwood Motte The Dreadfort has no claim that I know but the lands adjoin and Roose Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance

Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers In such cases her liege lord must find her a suitable match

Why can’t you marry her Bran asked You said she was comely and Beth would have a mother

The old knight put a hand on Bran’s arm A kindly thought my prince but I am only a knight and besides too old I might hold her lands for a few years but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find herself back in the same mire and Beth’s prospects might be perilous as well

Then let Lord Hornwood’s bastard be the heir Bran said thinking of his half brother Jon
