And then I went into Griffins to hae my boots
hobbed and then I went to Riggss batty-cake shop
and asked em for a penneth of the cheapest and nicest
stales that were all but blue-mouldy but not quite
And whilst I was chawing em down I walked on and
seed a clock with a face as big as a baking trendle --  -- 
But thats nothing to do with mistress  
Im coming to that if youll leave me alone Mister
Oak   remonstrated Cainy If you excites me
perhaps youll bring on my cough and then I shant be
able to tell ye nothing
 Yes-iet him tell it his own way said Coggan
Gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience
and Cainy went on  --
And there were great large houses and more
people all the week long than at Weatherbury club+
walking on White Tuesdays And I went to grand
churches and chapels And how the parson would pray 
Yes he would kneel down and put up his hands
together and make the holy gold rings on his fingers
gleam and twinkle in yer eyes that hed earned
by praying so excellent well  -- Ah yes I wish I lived
there
P 280
Our poor Parson Thirdly cant get no money to
buy such rings said  Matthew Moon thoughtfully
And as good a man as ever walked I dont believe
poor Thirdly have a single one even of humblest tin or
copper Such a great ornament as theyd be to him on
a dull aternoon when hes up in the pulpit lighted by
the wax candles  But tis impossible poor man Ah
to think how unequal things be
Perhaps hes made of different stuff than to wear
em said Gabriel grimly  Well thats enough of this
Go on Cainy -- quick
 Oh -- and the new style of pasons wear moustaches
and long beards continued the illustrious traveller
and look like Moses and Aaron complete and make
we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the
children of Israel
A very right feeling -- very said Joseph Poorgrass
And theres two religions going on in the nation
now -- High Church and High Chapel And thinks I
Ill play fair so I went to High Church in the morning
and High Chapel in the afternoon
 A right and proper boy said Joseph Poorgrass
Well at High Church they pray singing and worship
all the colours of the rainbow and at High Chapel they
pray preaching and worship drab and whitewash only
And then-i didnt see no more of Miss Everdene at
all
Why didnt you say so afore then   exclaimed Oak
with much disappointment
 Ah said Matthew Moon shell wish her cake
dough if so be shes over intimate with that man
Shes not over intimate with him said Gabriel
indignantly
She would know better said Coggan Our
misess has too much sense under they knots of black
hair to do such a mad thing
You see hes not a coarse ignorant man for he
was well brought up said Matthew dubiously  Twas
only wildness that made him a soldier and maids rather
like your man of sin
Now Cain Ball said Gabriel restlessly can you
swear in the most
P 281
awful form that the woman you saw
was Miss Everdene  
Cain Ball you be no longer a babe and suckling
said Joseph in the sepulchral tone the circumstances
demanded and you know what taking an oath is
Tis a horrible testament mind ye which you say and
seal with your blood-stone and the prophet Matthew
tells us that on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind
him to powder Now before all the work-folk here
assembled can you swear to your words as the shep+
herd asks ye 
 Please no Mister Oak   said Cainy looking from
one to the other with great uneasiness at the spiritual
magnitude of the position I dont mind saying tis
true but I dont like to say tis damn true if thats
what you mane
Cain Cain how can you   asked Joseph sternly
You be asked to swear in a holy manner and you
swear like wicked Shimei the son of Gera who cursed
as he came Young man fie  
No I dont  Tis you want to squander a pore
boys soul Joseph Poorgrass -- thats what tis   said
Cain beginning to cry All I mane is that in common
truth twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy but in
the horrible so-help-me truth that ye want to make of
it perhaps twas somebody else  
Theres no getting at the rights of it said Gabriel
turning to his work
Cain Ball youll come to a bit of bread   groaned
Joseph Poorgrass
Then the reapers hooks were flourished again and
the old sounds went on Gabriel without making any
pretence of being lively did nothing to show that he
