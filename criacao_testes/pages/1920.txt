treating it as a fricative and although it will not sound completely realistic
because there will be no variation with the formant positions of adjacent phonemes
this can be tolerated because
ul
h
is not too important for speech intelligibility
A bigger disadvantage is the lack of proper aspiration control for producing
unvoiced stops which as mentioned in Chapter 2 consist of an silent phase
followed by a burst of aspiration
Experience has shown that although it is difficult to drive such a synthesizer
from a software synthesis-by-rule system quite intelligible output can
be obtained if parameters are derived from real speech and tweaked by hand
Then for each aspiration burst the most closely-matching fricative sound
can be used
sh 54  Aspiration and frication
pp
The model of the vocal tract as a filter which affects the frequency spectrum
of the basic voiced excitation breaks down if there are constrictions in it
for these introduce new sound sources caused by turbulent air
The generation of unvoiced excitation has been discussed earlier in this
chapter  now we must consider how to simulate the filtering action of
the vocal tract for unvoiced sounds
pp
Aspiration and frication need to be dealt with separately  The former
is caused by excitation at the vocal cords em the cords are held
so close together that turbulent noise is produced
This noise passes through the same vocal tract filter that modifies voiced
sounds and the same kind of formant structure can be observed
All that is needed to simulate it is to replace the voiced excitation
source by white noise as shown in the upper part of Figure 515

pp
Speech can be whispered by substituting aspiration for voicing throughout
Of course there is no fundamental frequency associated with aspiration
An interesting way of assessing informally the degradation caused by inadequate
pitch control in a speech synthesis-by-rule system is to listen to
whispered speech in which pitch variations play no part
pp
Voiced and aspirative excitation are rarely produced at the same time
in natural speech but see the discussion in Chapter 2 about breathy voice
However the excitation can change from one to the other quite quickly and
when this happens there is no discontinuity in the formant structure
pp
Fricative or sibilant excitation is quite different from aspiration
because it introduces a new sound source at a different place from the vocal
cords  The constriction which produces the sound may be at the lips
the teeth the hard ridge just behind the top front teeth or further
back along the palate
These positions each produce a different sound

and

respectively  However smooth transitions from one of these sounds to another
do not occur in natural speech and dynamical movement of the frequency
spectrum during a fricative is unnecessary for speech synthesis
pp
It is necessary however to be able to produce an approximation to the
noise spectrum for each of these sound types  This is commonly achieved
by a single high-pass resonance whose centre frequency can be controlled
This is the purpose of the secondary output
of the formant filter of Figure 512
Taking the output from this point gives a high-pass instead of a low-pass
resonance and this same filter configuration is quite acceptable for
fricatives  Figure 515 shows the fricative sound path as a noise generator
followed by such a filter
pp
Unlike aspiration fricative excitation is frequently combined with voicing
This gives the voiced fricative sounds

It is possible to produce frication and aspiration together and although
there are no examples of this in English speech synthesis-by-rule
programs often use a short burst of aspiration
ul
and
frication when simulating the opening of unvoiced stops
Separate amplitude controls are therefore needed for voicing and frication
but the former can be used for aspiration as well with a glottal excitation
type switch to indicate aspiration rather than voicing
sh 55  Summary
pp
A resonance speech synthesizer consists of a vocal tract filter excited by
either a periodic pitch pulse or aspiration noise  In addition a set of
sibilant sounds must be provided  The vocal tract filter is dynamic with
three controllable resonances  These coupled with some fixed spectral
compensation give it a fairly high order em about 10 complex poles are
