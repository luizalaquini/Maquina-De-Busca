after God is created in righteousness and true holiness

425 Wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his
neighbour for we are members one of another

426 Be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your
wrath 427 Neither give place to the devil

428 Let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour
working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to
give to him that needeth

429 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that
which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto
the hearers

430 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption

431 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil
speaking be put away from you with all malice 432 And be ye kind
one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for
Christs sake hath forgiven you

51 Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children 52 And walk
in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us
an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour

53 But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not
be once named among you as becometh saints 54 Neither filthiness
nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather
giving of thanks

55 For this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor
covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ and of God

56 Let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience

57 Be not ye therefore partakers with them

58 For ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord
walk as children of light 59 For the fruit of the Spirit is in all
goodness and righteousness and truth 510 Proving what is acceptable
unto the Lord

511 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but
rather reprove them

512 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
them in secret

513 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light

514 Wherefore he saith Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the
dead and Christ shall give thee light

515 See then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise
516 Redeeming the time because the days are evil

517 Wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of
the Lord is

518 And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with
the Spirit 519 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord
520 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ 521 Submitting yourselves one to
another in the fear of God

522 Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the
Lord

523 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the
head of the church and he is the saviour of the body

524 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives
be to their own husbands in every thing

525 Husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church
and gave himself for it 526 That he might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word 527 That he might present it
to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing but that it should be holy and without blemish

528 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies He that
loveth his wife loveth himself

529 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
cherisheth it even as the Lord the church 530 For we are members of
his body of his flesh and of his bones

531 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall
be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh

532 This is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the
church
