So Gregor can finish me himself

The Tickler said Maybe he’ll give you to me

If you want me come get me Sandor pushed away from the wall and stood in a half-crouch behind the bench his sword held across his body

You think we won’t said Polliver You’re drunk

Might be said the Hound but you’re dead His foot lashed out and caught the bench driving it hard into Polliver’s shins Somehow the bearded man kept his feet but the Hound ducked under his wild slash and brought his own sword up in a vicious backhand cut Blood spattered on the ceiling and walls The blade caught in the middle of Polliver’s face and when the Hound wrenched it loose half his head came with it

The Tickler backed away Arya could smell his fear The shortsword in his hand suddenly seemed almost a toy against the long blade the Hound was holding and he wasn’t armored either He moved swiftly light on his feet never taking his eyes off Sandor Clegane It was the easiest thing in the world for Arya to step up behind him and stab him

Is there gold hidden in the village she shouted as she drove the blade up through his back Is there silver Gems She stabbed twice more Is there food Where is Lord Beric She was on top of him by then still stabbing Where did he go How many men were with him How many knights How many bowmen How many how many how many how many how many how many Is there gold in the village

Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged her off him Enough was all he said He was bleeding like a butchered pig himself and dragging one leg when he walked

There’s one more Arya reminded him

The squire had pulled the knife out of his belly and was trying to stop the blood with his hands When the Hound yanked him upright he screamed and started to blubber like a baby Mercy he wept please Don’t kill me Mother have mercy

Do I look like your bloody mother The Hound looked like nothing human You killed this one too he told Arya Pricked him in his bowels that’s the end of him He’ll be a long time dying though

The boy didn’t seemed to hear him I came for the girls he whimpered …make me a man Polly said… oh gods please take me to a castle… a maester take me to a maester my father’s got gold… it was only for the girls… mercy ser

The Hound gave him a crack across the face that made him scream again Don’t call me ser He turned back to Arya This one is yours she-wolf You do it

She knew what he meant Arya went to Polliver and knelt in his blood long enough to undo his swordbelt Hanging beside his dagger was a slimmer blade too long to be a dirk too short to be a man’s sword… but it felt just right in her hand

You remember where the heart is the Hound asked

She nodded The squire rolled his eyes Mercy

Needle slipped between his ribs and gave it to him

Good Sandor’s voice was thick with pain If these three were whoring here Gregor must hold the ford as well as Harrenhal More of his pets could ride up any moment and we’ve killed enough of the bloody buggers for one day

Where will we go she asked

Saltpans He put a big hand on her shoulder to keep from falling Get some wine she-wolf And take whatever coin they have as well we’ll need it If there’s ships at Saltpans we can reach the Vale by sea His mouth twitched at her as more blood ran down from where his ear had been Maybe Lady Lysa will marry you to her little Robert There’s a match I’d like to see He started to laugh then groaned instead

When the time came to leave he needed Arya’s help to get back up on Stranger He had tied a strip of cloth about his neck and another around his thigh and taken the squire’s cloak off its peg by the door The cloak was green with a green arrow on a white bend but when the Hound wadded it up and pressed it to his ear it soon turned red Arya was afraid he would collapse the moment they set out but somehow he stayed in the saddle

They could not risk meeting whoever held the ruby ford so instead of following the kingsroad they angled south by east through weedy fields woods and marshes It was hours before they reached the banks of the Trident The river had returned meekly to its accustomed channel Arya saw all its wet brown rage vanished with the rains It’s tired too she thought

Close by the water’s edge they found some willows rising from a jumble of weathered rocks Together the rocks and trees formed a sort of natural fort where they could hide from both river and trail Here will do the Hound said Water the horses and gather some deadwood for a fire When he dismounted he had to catch himself on a tree limb to keep from falling

Won’t the smoke be seen

Anyone wants to find us all they need to do is follow my blood Water and wood But bring me that wineskin first

When he got the fire going Sandor propped up his helm in the flames emptied half the wineskin into it and collapsed back against a jut of moss-covered stone as if he never meant to rise again He made Arya wash out the squire’s cloak and cut it into strips Those went into his helm as well If I had more wine I’d drink till I was dead to the world Maybe I ought to send you back to that bloody inn for another skin or three 

No Arya said He wouldn’t would he If he does I’ll just leave him and ride off
