windows Shallow and wide Probably just a strip between
two real basements A place whose existence could go
unnoticed unless you had a very keen eye for dimensions
Its cold and dank with piles of pelts that Im guessing
havent seen the light of day in years Unless Tigris gives us
up I dont believe anyone will find us here By the time I
reach the concrete floor my companions are on the steps
The panel slides back in place I hear the underwear rack
being adjusted on squeaky wheels Tigris padding back to
her stool We have been swallowed up by her store
Just in time too because Gale looks on the verge of
collapse We make a bed of pelts strip off his layers of
weapons and help him onto his back At the end of the
cellar theres a faucet about a foot from the floor with a
drain under it I turn the tap and after much sputtering and a
lot of rust clear water begins to flow We clean Gales neck
wound and I realize bandages wont be enough Hes going
to need a few stitches Theres a needle and sterile thread
in the first-aid supplies but what we lack is a healer It
crosses my mind to enlist Tigris As a stylist she must
know how to work a needle But that would leave no one
manning the shop and shes doing enough already I
accept that Im probably the most qualified for the job grit
my teeth and put in a row of jagged sutures Its not pretty
but its functional I smear it with medicine and wrap it up
Give him some painkillers You can rest now Its safe
here I tell him He goes out like a light
While Cressida and Pollux make fur nests for each of
us I attend to Peetas wrists Gently rinsing away the blood
putting on an antiseptic and bandaging them beneath the
cuffs Youve got to keep them clean otherwise the
infection could spread and--
I know what blood poisoning is Katniss says Peeta
Even if my mother isnt a healer
Im jolted back in time to another wound another set of
bandages You said that same thing to me in the first
Hunger Games Real or not real
Real he says And you risked your life getting the
medicine that saved me
Real I shrug You were the reason I was alive to do
it
Was I The comment throws him into confusion
Some shiny memory must be fighting for his attention
because his body tenses and his newly bandaged wrists
strain against the metal cuffs Then all the energy saps from
his body Im so tired Katniss
Go to sleep I say He wont until Ive rearranged his
handcuffs and shackled him to one of the stair supports It
cant be comfortable lying there with his arms above his
head But in a few minutes he drifts off too
Cressida and Pollux have made beds for us arranged
our food and medical supplies and now ask what I want to
do about setting up a guard I look at Gales pallor Peetas
restraints Pollux hasnt slept for days and Cressida and I
only napped for a few hours If a troop of Peacekeepers
were to come through that door wed be trapped like rats
We are completely at the mercy of a decrepit tiger-woman
with what I can only hope is an all-consuming passion for
Snows death
I dont honestly think theres any point in setting up a
guard Lets just try to get some sleep I say They nod
numbly and we all burrow into our pelts The fire inside me
has flickered out and with it my strength I surrender to the
soft musty fur and oblivion
I have only one dream I remember A long and
wearying thing in which Im trying to get to District 12 The
home Im seeking is intact the people alive Effie Trinket
conspicuous in a bright pink wig and tailored outfit travels
with me I keep trying to ditch her in places but she
inexplicably reappears at my side insisting that as my
escort shes responsible for my staying on schedule Only
the schedule is constantly shifting derailed by our lack of a
stamp from an official or delayed when Effie breaks one of
her high heels We camp for days on a bench in a gray
station in District 7 awaiting a train that never comes
When I wake somehow I feel even more drained by this
than my usual nighttime forays into blood and terror
Cressida the only person awake tells me its late
afternoon I eat a can of beef stew and wash it down with a
lot of water Then I lean against the cellar wall retracing the
events of the last day Moving death by death Counting
them up on my fingers One two--Mitchell and Boggs lost
on the block Three--Messalla melted by the pod Four five-
-Leeg 1 and Jackson sacrificing themselves at the Meat
Grinder Six seven eight--Castor Homes and Finnick
being decapitated by the rose-scented lizard mutts Eight
dead in twenty-four hours I know it happened and yet it
doesnt seem real Surely Castor is asleep under that pile
of furs Finnick will come bounding down the steps in a
minute Boggs will tell me his plan for our escape
To believe them dead is to accept I killed them Okay
maybe not Mitchell and Boggs--they died on an actual
assignment But the others lost their lives defending me on
a mission I fabricated My plot to assassinate Snow seems
so stupid now So stupid as I sit shivering here in this cellar
tallying up our losses fingering the tassels on the silver
knee-high boots I stole from the womans home Oh yeah--I
forgot about that I killed her too Im taking out unarmed
citizens now
I think its time I give myself up
