And at home they’ll know you for deserters and lop off your fool heads thought Chett There was no leaving the Night’s Watch once you said your words Anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms they’d take you and kill you

Ollo Lophand now he was talking about sailing back to Tyrosh where he claimed men didn’t lose their hands for a bit of honest thievery nor get sent off to freeze their life away for being found in bed with some knight’s wife Chett had weighed going with him but he didn’t speak their wet girly tongue And what could he do in Tyrosh He had no trade to speak of growing up in Hag’s Mire His father had spent his life grubbing in other men’s fields and collecting leeches He’d strip down bare but for a thick leather clout and go wading in the murky waters When he climbed out he’d be covered from nipple to ankle Sometimes he made Chett help pull the leeches off One had attached itself to his palm once and he’d smashed it against a wall in revulsion His father beat him bloody for that The maesters bought the leeches at twelve-for-a-penny

Lark could go home if he liked and the damn Tyroshi too but not Chett If he never saw Hag’s Mire again it would be too bloody soon He had liked the look of Craster’s Keep himself Craster lived high as a lord there so why shouldn’t he do the same That would be a laugh Chett the leechman’s son a lord with a keep His banner could be a dozen leeches on a field of pink But why stop at lord Maybe he should be a king Mance Rayder started out a crow I could be a king same as him and have me some wives Craster had nineteen not even counting the young ones the daughters he hadn’t gotten around to bedding yet Half them wives were as old and ugly as Craster but that didn’t matter The old ones Chett could put to work cooking and cleaning for him pulling carrots and slopping pigs while the young ones warmed his bed and bore his children Craster wouldn’t object not once Small Paul gave him a hug

The only women Chett had ever known were the whores he’d bought in Mole’s Town When he’d been younger the village girls took one look at his face with its boils and its wen and turned away sickened The worst was that slattern Bessa She’d spread her legs for every boy in Hag’s Mire so he’d figured why not him too He even spent a morning picking wildflowers when he heard she liked them but she’d just laughed in his face and told him she’d crawl in a bed with his father’s leeches before she’d crawl in one with him She stopped laughing when he put his knife in her That was sweet the look on her face so he pulled the knife out and put it in her again When they caught him down near Sevenstreams old Lord Walder Frey hadn’t even bothered to come himself to do the judging He’d sent one of his bastards that Walder Rivers and the next thing Chett had known he was walking to the Wall with that foul-smelling black devil Yoren To pay for his one sweet moment they took his whole life

But now he meant to take it back and Craster’s women too That twisted old wildling has the right of it If you want a woman to wife you take her and none of this giving her flowers so that maybe she don’t notice your bloody boils Chett didn’t mean to make that mistake again

It would work he promised himself for the hundredth time So long as we get away clean Ser Ottyn would strike south for the Shadow Tower the shortest way to the Wall He won’t bother with us not Wythers all he’ll want is to get back whole Thoren Smallwood now he’d want to press on with the attack but Ser Ottyn’s caution ran too deep and he was senior It won’t matter anyhow Once we’re gone Smallwood can attack anyone he likes What do we care If none of them ever returns to the Wall no one will ever come looking for us they’ll think we died with the rest That was a new thought and for a moment it tempted him But they would need to kill Ser Ottyn and Ser Mallador Locke as well to give Smallwood the command and both of them were well-attended day and night    no the risk was too great

Chett said Small Paul as they trudged along a stony game trail through sentinels and soldier pines what about the bird

What bloody bird The last thing he needed now was some mutton-head going on about a bird

The Old Bear’s raven Small Paul said If we kill him who’s going to feed his bird

Who bloody well cares Kill the bird too if you like

I don’t want to hurt no bird the big man said But that’s a talking bird What if it tells what we did

Lark the Sisterman laughed Small Paul thick as a castle wall he mocked

You shut up with that said Small Paul dangerously

Paul said Chett before the big man got too angry when they find the old man lying in a pool of blood with his throat slit they won’t need no bird to tell them someone killed him

Small Paul chewed on that a moment That’s true he allowed Can I keep the bird then I like that bird

He’s yours said Chett just to shut him up

We can always eat him if we get hungry offered Lark

Small Paul clouded up again Best not try and eat my bird Lark Best not

Chett could hear voices drifting through the trees Close your bloody mouths both of you We’re almost to the Fist

They emerged near the west face of the hill and walked around south where the slope was gentler Near the edge of the forest a dozen men were taking archery practice They had carved outlines on the trunks of trees and were loosing shafts at them Look said Lark A pig with a bow

Sure enough the nearest bowman was Ser Piggy himself the fat boy who had stolen his place with Maester Aemon Just the sight of Samwell Tarly filled him with anger Stewarding for Maester Aemon had been as good a life as he’d ever known The old blind man was undemanding and Clydas had taken care of most of his wants anyway Chett’s duties were easy cleaning the rookery a few fires to build a few meals to fetch    and Aemon never once hit him Thinks he can just walk in and shove me out on account of being highborn and knowing how to read Might be I’ll ask him to read my knife before I open his throat with it You go on he told the others I want to watch this The dogs were pulling anxious to go with them to the food they thought would be waiting at the top Chett kicked the bitch with the toe of his boot and that settled them down some

He watched from the trees as the fat boy wrestled with a longbow as tall as he was his red moon face screwed up with concentration Three arrows stood in the ground before him Tarly nocked and drew held the draw a long moment as he tried to aim and let fly The shaft vanished into the greenery Chett laughed loudly a snort of sweet disgust

We’ll never find that one and I’ll be blamed announced Edd Tollett the dour grey-haired squire everyone called Dolorous Edd Nothing ever goes missing that they don’t look at me ever since that time I lost my horse As if that could be helped He was white and it was snowing what did they expect

The wind took that one said Grenn another friend of Lord Snow’s Try to hold the bow steady Sam

It’s heavy the fat boy complained but he pulled the second arrow all the same This one went high sailing through the branches ten feet above the target

I believe you knocked a leaf off that tree said Dolorous Edd Fall is falling fast enough there’s no need to help it He sighed And we all know what follows fall Gods but I am cold Shoot the last arrow Samwell I believe my tongue is freezing to the roof of my mouth

Ser Piggy lowered the bow and Chett thought he was going to start bawling It’s too hard

Notch draw and loose said Grenn Go on

Dutifully the fat boy plucked his final arrow from the earth notched it to his longbow drew and released He did it quickly without squinting along the shaft painstakingly as he had the first two times The arrow struck the charcoal outline low in the chest and hung quivering I hit him Ser Piggy sounded shocked Grenn did you see Edd look I hit him

Put it between his ribs I’d say said Grenn

Did I kill him the fat boy wanted to know

Tollett shrugged Might have punctured a lung if he had a lung Most trees don’t as a rule He took the bow from Sam’s hand I’ve seen worse shots though Aye and made a few

Ser Piggy was beaming To look at him you’d think he’d actually done something But when he saw Chett and the dogs his smile curled up and died squeaking

You hit a tree Chett said Let’s see how you shoot when it’s Mance Rayder’s lads They won’t stand there with their arms out and their leaves rustling oh no They’ll come right at you screaming in your face and I bet you’ll piss those breeches One o’ them will plant his axe right between those little pig eyes The last thing you’ll hear will be the thunk it makes when it bites into your skull

The fat boy was shaking Dolorous Edd put a hand on his shoulder Brother he said solemnly just because it happened that way for you doesn’t mean Samwell will suffer the same

What are you talking about Tollett

The axe that split your skull Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate them

The big lout Grenn laughed and even Samwell Tarly managed a weak little smile Chett kicked the nearest dog yanked on their leashes and started up the hill Smile all you want Ser Piggy We’ll see who laughs tonight He only wished he had time to kill Tollett as well Gloomy horsefaced fool that’s what he is

The climb was steep even on this side of the Fist which had the gentlest slope Partway up the dogs started barking and pulling at him figuring that they’d get fed soon He gave them a taste of his boot instead and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that snapped at him Once they were tied up he went to report The prints were there like Giant said but the dogs wouldn’t track he told Mormont in front of his big black tent Down by the river like that could be old prints

A pity Lord Commander Mormont had a bald head and a great shaggy grey beard and sounded as tired as he looked We might all have been better for a bit of fresh meat The raven on his shoulder bobbed its head and echoed Meat Meat Meat

We could cook the bloody dogs Chett thought but he kept his mouth shut until the Old Bear sent him on his way And that’s the last time I’ll need to bow my head to that one he thought to himself with satisfaction It seemed to him that it was growing even colder which he would have sworn wasn’t possible The dogs huddled together miserably in the hard frozen mud and Chett was half tempted to crawl in with them Instead he wrapped a black wool scarf round the lower part of his face leaving a slit for his mouth between the winds It was warmer if he kept moving he found so he made a slow circuit of the perimeter with a wad of sourleaf sharing a chew or two with the black brothers on guard and hearing what they had to say None of the men on the day watch were part of his scheme even so he figured it was good to have some sense of what they were thinking

Mostly what they were thinking was that it was bloody cold

The wind was rising as the shadows lengthened It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall I hate that sound little Giant said It sounds like a babe in the brush wailing away for milk

When he finished the circuit and returned to the dogs he found Lark waiting for him The officers are in the Old Bear’s tent again talking something fierce

That’s what they do said Chett They’re highborn all but Blane they get drunk on words instead of wine

Lark sidled closer Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird he warned glancing about to make certain no one was close Now he’s asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing

It’s a raven said Chett It eats corpses

Lark grinned His might be

Or yours It seemed to Chett that they needed the big man more than they needed Lark Stop fretting about Small Paul You do your part he’ll do his

Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid himself of the Sisterman and sat down to edge his sword It was bloody hard work with his gloves on but he wasn’t about to take them off Cold as it was any fool that touched steel with a bare hand was going to lose a patch of skin
