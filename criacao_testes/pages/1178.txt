Tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose the priest was garbed in mottled robes of green and grey and blue the swirling colors of the Drowned God A waterskin hung under his arm on a leather strap and ropes of dried seaweed were braided through his waist-long black hair and untrimmed beard

A memory prodded at Theon in one of his rare curt letters Lord Balon had written of his youngest brother going down in a storm and turning holy when he washed up safe on shore Uncle Aeron he said doubtfully

Nephew Theon the priest replied Your lord father bid me fetch you Come

In a moment Uncle He turned back to the Myraham My things he commanded the captain

A sailor fetched him down his tall yew bow and quiver of arrows but it was the captain’s daughter who brought the pack with his good clothing Milord Her eyes were red When he took the pack she made as if to embrace him there in front of her own father and his priestly uncle and half the island

Theon turned deftly aside You have my thanks

Please she said I do love you well milord

I must go He hurried after his uncle who was already well down the pier Theon caught him with a dozen long strides I had not looked for you Uncle After ten years I thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come themselves or send Dagmer with an honor guard

It is not for you to question the commands of the Lord Reaper of Pyke The priest’s manner was chilly most unlike the man Theon remembered Aeron Greyjoy had been the most amiable of his uncles feckless and quick to laugh fond of songs ale and women As to Dagmer the Cleftjaw is gone to Old Wyk at your father’s behest to roust the Stonehouses and the Drumms

To what purpose Why are the longships hosting

Why have longships ever hosted His uncle had left the horses tied up in front of the waterside inn When they reached them he turned to Theon Tell me true nephew Do you pray to the wolf gods now

Theon seldom prayed at all but that was not something you confessed to a priest even your father’s own brother Ned Stark prayed to a tree No I care nothing for Stark’s gods

Good Kneel

The ground was all stones and mud Uncle I—

Kneel Or are you too proud now a lordling of the green lands come among us

Theon knelt He had a purpose here and might need Aeron’s help to achieve it A crown was worth a little mud and horseshit on his breeches he supposed

Bow your head Lifting the skin his uncle pulled the cork and directed a thin stream of seawater down upon Theon’s head It drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his eyes Sheets washed down his cheeks and a finger crept under his cloak and doublet and down his back a cold rivulet along his spine The salt made his eyes burn until it was all he could do not to cry out He could taste the ocean on his lips Let Theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were Aeron Greyjoy intoned Bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel Nephew do you still know the words

What is dead may never die Theon said remembering

What is dead may never die his uncle echoed but rises again harder and stronger Stand

Theon stood blinking back tears from the salt in his eyes Wordless his uncle corked the waterskin untied his horse and mounted Theon did the same They set off together leaving the inn and the harbor behind them up past the castle of Lord Botley into the stony hills The priest ventured no further word

I have been half my life away from home Theon ventured at last Will I find the islands changed

Men fish the sea dig in the earth and die Women birth children in blood and pain and die Night follows day The winds and tides remain The islands are as our god made them

Gods he has grown grim Theon thought Will I find my sister and my lady mother at Pyke

You will not Your mother dwells on Harlaw with her own sister It is less raw there and her cough troubles her Your sister has taken Black Wind to Great Wyk with messages from your lord father She will return e’er long you may be sure

Theon did not need to be told that Black Wind was Asha’s longship He had not seen his sister in ten years but that much he knew of her Odd that she would call it that when Robb Stark had a wolf named Grey Wind Stark is grey and Greyjoy’s black he murmured smiling but it seems we’re both windy

The priest had nothing to say to that

And what of you Uncle Theon asked You were no priest when I was taken from Pyke I remember how you would sing the old reaving songs standing on the table with a horn of ale in hand

Young I was and vain Aeron Greyjoy said but the sea washed my follies and my vanities away That man drowned nephew His lungs filled with seawater and the fish ate the scales off his eyes When I rose again I saw clearly

He is as mad as he is sour Theon had liked what he remembered of the old Aeron Greyjoy Uncle why has my father called his swords and sails

Doubtless he will tell you at Pyke

I would know his plans now

From me you shall not We are commanded not to speak of this to any man

Even to me Theon’s anger flared He’d led men in war hunted with a king won honor in tourney melees ridden with Brynden Blackfish and Greatjon Umber fought in the Whispering Wood bedded more girls than he could name and yet this uncle was treating him as though he were still a child of ten If my father makes plans for war I must know of them I am not ‘any man’ I am heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands

As to that his uncle said we shall see

The words were a slap in the face We shall see My brothers are both dead I am my lord father’s only living son

Your sister lives

Asha he thought confounded She was three years older than Theon yet still…A woman may inherit only if there is no male heir in the direct line he insisted loudly I will not be cheated of my rights I warn you

His uncle grunted You warn a servant of the Drowned God boy You have forgotten more than you know And you are a great fool if you believe your lord father will ever hand these holy islands over to a Stark Now be silent The ride is long enough without your magpie chatterings

Theon held his tongue though not without struggle So that is the way of it he thought As if ten years in Winterfell could make a Stark Lord Eddard had raised him among his own children but Theon had never been one of them The whole castle from Lady Stark to the lowliest kitchen scullion knew he was hostage to his father’s good behavior and treated him accordingly Even the bastard Jon Snow had been accorded more honor than he had

Lord Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time but to Theon he had always remained the man who’d brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home As a boy he had lived in fear of Stark’s stern face and great dark sword His wife was if anything even more distant and suspicious

As for their children the younger ones had been mewling babes for most of his years at Winterfell Only Robb and his baseborn half brother Jon Snow had been old enough to be worth his notice The bastard was a sullen boy quick to sense a slight jealous of Theon’s high birth and Robb’s regard for him For Robb himself Theon did have a certain affection as for a younger brother… but it would be best not to mention that In Pyke it would seem the old wars were still being fought That ought not surprise him The Iron Islands lived in the past the present was too hard and bitter to be borne Besides his father and uncles were old and the old lords were like that they took their dusty feuds to the grave forgetting nothing and forgiving less

It had been the same with the Mallisters his companions on the ride from Riverrun to Seagard Patrek Mallister was not too ill a fellow they shared a taste for wenches wine and hawking But when old Lord Jason saw his heir growing overly fond of Theon’s company he had taken Patrek aside to remind him that Seagard had been built to defend the coast against reavers from the Iron islands the Greyjoys of Pyke chief among them Their Booming Tower was named for its immense bronze bell rung of old to call the townsfolk and farmhands into the castle when longships were sighted on the western horizon

Never mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years Patrek had told Theon the day after as he shared his father’s cautions and a jug of green-apple wine

When my brother stormed Seagard Theon said Lord Jason had slain Rodrik Greyjoy under the walls of the castle and thrown the ironmen back into the bay If your father supposes I bear him some enmity for that it’s only because he never knew Rodrik

They had a laugh over that as they raced ahead to an amorous young miller’s wife that Patrek knew Would that Patrek were with me now Mallister or no he was a more amiable riding companion than this sour old priest that his uncle Aeron had turned into

The path they rode wound up and up into bare and stony hills Soon they were out of sight of the sea though the smell of salt still hung sharp in the damp air They kept a steady plodding pace past a shepherd’s croft and the abandoned workings of a mine This new holy Aeron Greyjoy was not much for talk They rode in a gloom of silence Finally Theon could suffer it no longer Robb Stark is Lord of Winterfell now he said

Aeron rode on One wolf is much like the other

Robb has broken fealty with the Iron Throne and crowned himself King in the North There’s war

The maester’s ravens fly over salt as soon as rock This news is old and cold

It means a new day Uncle
