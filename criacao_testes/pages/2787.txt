1829 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat I will disguise
myself and I will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes So the
king of Israel disguised himself and they went to the battle

1830 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
that were with him saying Fight ye not with small or great save
only with the king of Israel

1831 And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat that they said It is the king of Israel Therefore they
compassed about him to fight but Jehoshaphat cried out and the LORD
helped him and God moved them to depart from him

1832 For it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots
perceived that it was not the king of Israel they turned back again
from pursuing him

1833 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of
Israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his
chariot man Turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the
host for I am wounded

1834 And the battle increased that day howbeit the king of Israel
stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even
and about the time of the sun going down he died

191 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
to Jerusalem

192 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and
said to king Jehoshaphat Shouldest thou help the ungodly and love
them that hate the LORD therefore is wrath upon thee from before the
LORD

193 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine
heart to seek God

194 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem and he went out again through
the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim and brought them back unto
the LORD God of their fathers

195 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
Judah city by city 196 And said to the judges Take heed what ye
do for ye judge not for man but for the LORD who is with you in the
judgment

197 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you take heed and
do it for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God nor respect of
persons nor taking of gifts

198 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and of
the priests and of the chief of the fathers of Israel for the
judgment of the LORD and for controversies when they returned to
Jerusalem

199 And he charged them saying Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
LORD faithfully and with a perfect heart

1910 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
dwell in your cities between blood and blood between law and
commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they
trespass not against the LORD and so wrath come upon you and upon
your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass

1911 And behold Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
of the LORD and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the ruler of the house
of Judah for all the kings matters also the Levites shall be
officers before you Deal courageously and the LORD shall be with the
good

201 It came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and
the children of Ammon and with them other beside the Ammonites came
against Jehoshaphat to battle

202 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat saying There cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria
and behold they be in Hazazontamar which is Engedi

203 And Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the LORD and
proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah

204 And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the LORD
even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD

205 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem
in the house of the LORD before the new court 206 And said O LORD
God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou
over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not
power and might so that none is able to withstand thee  207 Art not
thou our God who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before
thy people Israel and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for
ever  208 And they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary
therein for thy name saying 209 If when evil cometh upon us as
the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this
house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry
unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help

2010 And now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir
