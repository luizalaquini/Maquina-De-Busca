Did I say we could The best we can hope for is to die with swords in our hands He was perfectly sincere Jaime Lannister had never been afraid of death

Brienne broke off rowing Sweat had stuck strands of her flax-colored hair to her forehead and her grimace made her look homelier than ever You are under my protection she said her voice so thick with anger that it was almost a growl

He had to laugh at such fierceness She’s the Hound with teats he thought Or would be if she had any teats to speak of Then protect me wench Or free me to protect myself

The galley was skimming downriver a great wooden dragonfly The water around her was churned white by the furious action of her oars She was gaining visibly the men on her deck crowding forward as she came on Metal glinted in their hands and Jaime could see bows as well Archers He hated archers

At the prow of the onrushing galley stood a stocky man with a bald head bushy grey eyebrows and brawny arms Over his mail he wore a soiled white surcoat with a weeping willow embroidered in pale green but his cloak was fastened with a silver trout Riverrun’s captain of guards In his day Ser Robin Ryger had been a notably tenacious fighter but his day was done he was of an age with Hoster Tully and had grown old with his lord

When the boats were fifty yards apart Jaime cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted back over the water Come to wish me godspeed Ser Robin

Come to take you back Kingslayer Ser Robin Ryger bellowed How is it that you’ve lost your golden hair

I hope to blind my enemies with the sheen off my head It’s worked well enough for you

Ser Robin was unamused The distance between skiff and galley had shrunk to forty yards Throw your oars and your weapons into the river and no one need be harmed

Ser Cleos twisted around Jaime tell him we were freed by Lady Catelyn… An exchange of captives lawful…

Jaime told him for all the good it did Catelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun Ser Robin shouted back Four archers crowded into position on either side of him two standing and two kneeling Cast your swords into the water

I have no sword he returned but if I did I’d stick it through your belly and hack the balls off those four cravens

A flight of arrows answered him One thudded into the mast two pierced the sail and the fourth missed Jaime by a foot

Another of the Red Fork’s broad loops loomed before them Brienne angled the skiff across the bend The yard swung as they turned their sail cracking as it filled with wind Ahead a large island sat in midstream The main channel flowed right To the left a cutoff ran between the island and the high bluffs of the north shore Brienne moved the tiller and the skiff sheared left sail rippling Jaime watched her eyes Pretty eyes he thought and calm He knew how to read a man’s eyes He knew what fear looked like She is determined not desperate

Thirty yards behind the galley was entering the bend Ser Cleos take the tiller the wench commanded Kingslayer take an oar and keep us off the rocks

As my lady commands An oar was not a sword but the blade could break a man’s face if well swung and the shaft could be used to parry

Ser Cleos shoved the oar into Jaime’s hand and scrambled aft They crossed the head of the island and turned sharply down the cutoff sending a wash of water against the face of the bluff as the boat tilted The island was densely wooded a tangle of willows oaks and tall pines that cast deep shadows across the rushing water hiding snags and the rotted trunks of drowned trees To their left the bluff rose sheer and rocky and at its foot the river foamed whitely around broken boulders and tumbles of rock fallen from the cliff face

They passed from sunlight into shadow hidden from the galley’s view between the green wall of the trees and the stony grey-brown bluff A few moments’ respite from the arrows Jaime thought pushing them off a half-submerged boulder

The skiff rocked He heard a soft splash and when he glanced around Brienne was gone A moment later he spied her again pulling herself from the water at the base of the bluff She waded through a shallow pool scrambled over some rocks and began to climb Ser Cleos goggled mouth open Fool thought Jaime Ignore the wench he snapped at his cousin Steer

They could see the sail moving behind the trees The river galley came into full view at the top of the cutoff twenty-five yards behind Her bow swung hard as she came around and a half-dozen arrows took flight but all went well wide The motion of the two boats was giving the archers difficulty but Jaime knew they’d soon enough learn to compensate Brienne was halfway up the cliff face pulling herself from handhold to handhold Ryger’s sure to see her and once he does he’ll have those bowmen bring her down Jaime decided to see if the old man’s pride would make him stupid Ser Robin he shouted hear me for a moment

Ser Robin raised a hand and his archers lowered their bows Say what you will Kingslayer but say it quickly

The skiff swung through a litter of broken stones as Jaime called out I know a better way to settle this—single combat You and I

I was not born this morning Lannister

No but you’re like to die this afternoon Jaime raised his hands so the other could see the manacles I’ll fight you in chains What could you fear

Not you ser If the choice were mine I’d like nothing better but I am commanded to bring you back alive if possible Bowmen He signaled them on Notch Draw Loo—

The range was less than twenty yards The archers could scarcely have missed but as they pulled on their longbows a rain of pebbles cascaded down around them Small stones rattled on their deck bounced off their helms and made splashes on both sides of the bow Those who had wits enough to understand raised their eyes just as a boulder the size of a cow detached itself from the top of the bluff Ser Robin shouted in dismay The stone tumbled through the air struck the face of the cliff cracked in two and smashed down on them The larger piece snapped the mast tore through the sail sent two of the archers flying into the river and crushed the leg of a rower as he bent over his oar The rapidity with which the galley began to fill with water suggested that the smaller fragment had punched right through her hull The oarsman’s screams echoed off the bluff while the archers flailed wildly in the current From the way they were splashing neither man could swim Jaime laughed

By the time they emerged from the cutoff the galley was foundering amongst pools eddies and snags and Jaime Lannister had decided that the gods were good Ser Robin and his thrice-damned archers would have a long wet walk back to Riverrun and he was rid of the big homely wench as well I could not have planned it better myself Once I’m free of these irons…
