Wisps of pale mist threaded between the trees Sentinels and soldier pines grew thick about here and there was nothing as dark and gloomy as an evergreen forest The ground was uneven and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing treacherous for the horses so they had to go slowly Not as slowly as a man carrying a cripple though or a bony harridan with a four-year-old on her back He told himself to be patient He’d have them before the day was out

Maester Luwin trotted up to him as they were following a game trail along the lip of a ravine Thus far hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods my lord

Theon smiled There are similarities But with hunting there’s blood at the end

Must it be so This flight was great folly but will you not be merciful These are your foster brothers we seek

No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living than dead

The same is true of the Reeds Moat Cailin sits on the edge of the bogs Lord Howland can make your uncle’s occupation a visit to hell if he chooses but so long as you hold his heirs he must stay his hand

Theon had not considered that In truth he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if she was still a maiden You may be right We will spare them if we can

And Hodor too I hope The boy is simple you know that He does as he is told How many times has he groomed your horse soaped your saddle scoured your mail

Hodor was nothing to him if he does not fight us we will let him live Theon pointed a finger But say one word about sparing the wildling and you can die with her She swore me an oath and pissed on it

The maester inclined his head I make no apologies for oathbreakers Do what you must I thank you for your mercy

Mercy thought Theon as Luwin dropped back There’s a bloody trap Too much and they call you weak too little and you’re monstrous Yet the maester had given him good counsel he knew His father thought only in terms of conquest but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it Force and fear could carry you only so far A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south elsewise Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them Sansa was a pretty little thing too and by now likely even ripe for bedding But she was a thousand leagues away in the clutches of the Lannisters A shame

The wood grew ever wilder The pines and sentinels gave way to huge dark oaks Tangles of hawthorn concealed treacherous gullies and cuts Stony hills rose and fell They passed a crofter’s cottage deserted and overgown and skirted a flooded quarry where the still water had a sheen as grey as steel When the dogs began to bay Theon figured the fugitives were near at hand He spurred Smiler and followed at a trot but what he found was only the carcass of a young elk… or what remained of it

He dismounted for a closer look The kill was still fresh and plainly the work of wolves The dogs sniffed round it eagerly and one of the mastiffs buried his teeth in a haunch until Farlen shouted him off No part of this animal has been butchered Theon realized The wolves ate but not the men Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire she ought to have cut them a few steaks It made no sense to leave so much good meat to rot Farlen are you certain we’re on the right trail he demanded Could your dogs be chasing the wrong wolves

My bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough

I hope so For your sake

Less than an hour later the trail led down a slope toward a muddy brook swollen by the recent rains It was there the dogs lost the scent Farlen and Wex waded across with the hounds and came back shaking their heads while the animals ranged up and down the far bank sniffing They went in here m’lord but I can’t see where they come out the kennelmaster said

Theon dismounted and knelt beside the stream He dipped a hand in it The water was cold They won’t have stayed long in this he said Take half the dogs downstream I’ll go up—

Wex clapped his hands together loudly

What is it Theon said

The mute boy pointed

The ground near the water was sodden and muddy The tracks the wolves had left were plain enough Pawprints yes So

Wex drove his heel into the mud and pivoted his foot this way and that It left a deep gouge

Joseth understood A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud he said More so with the weight of a boy on his back Yet the only boot prints here are our own See for yourself

Appalled Theon saw it was true The wolves had gone into the turgid brown water alone Osha must have turned aside back of us Before the elk most likely She sent the wolves on by themselves hoping we’d chase after them He rounded on his huntsmen If you two have played me false—

There’s been only the one trail my lord I swear it said Gariss defensively And the direwolves would never have parted from them boys Not for long

That’s so Theon thought Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt but soon or late they would return to Bran and Rickon Gariss Murch take four dogs and double back find where we lost them Aggar you watch them I’ll have no trickery Farlen and I will follow the direwolves Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail Two blasts if you catch sight of the beasts themselves Once we find where they went they’ll lead us back to their masters

He took Wex the Frey boy and Gynir Rednose to search upstream He and Wex rode on one side of the brook Rednose and Walder Frey on the other each with a pair of hounds The wolves might have come out on either bank Theon kept an eye out for tracks spoor broken branches any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water He spied the prints of deer elk and badger easily enough Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream and Walder flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one They saw the claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch But of the direwolves there was no sign

A little farther Theon told himself Past that oak over that rise past the next bend of the stream we’ll find something there He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly It was midday when he wrenched Smiler’s head round in disgust and gave up

Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him It should not have been possible not on foot burdened with a cripple and a young child Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good their escape If they reach a village… The people of the north would never deny Ned Stark’s sons Robb’s brothers They’d have mounts to speed them on their way food Men would fight for the honor of protecting them The whole bloody north would rally around them

The wolves went downstream that’s all He clung to that thought That red bitch will sniff where they came out of the water and we’ll be after them again

But when they joined up with Farlen’s party one look at the kennelmaster’s face smashed all of Theon’s hopes to shards The only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear baiting he said angrily Would that I had a bear

The dogs are not at fault Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch a hand on each Running water don’t hold no scents m’lord

The wolves had to come out of the stream somewhere

No doubt they did Upstream or down We keep on we’ll find the place but which way

I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles said Reek A man might If he knew he was being hunted he might But a wolf

Yet Theon wondered These beasts were not as other wolves I should have skinned the cursed things

It was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss Murch and Aggar The huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the Starks might have parted company with the direwolves Farlen’s hounds seemed as frustrated as their masters sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other

Theon dared not admit defeat We’ll return to the brook Search again This time we’ll go as far as we must

We won’t find them the Frey boy said suddenly Not so long as the frogeaters are with them Mudmen are sneaks they won’t fight like decent folks they skulk and use poison arrows You never see them but they see you Those who go into the bogs after them get lost and never come out Their houses move even the castles like Greywater Watch He glanced nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides They might be out there right now listening to everything we say

Farlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion My dogs would smell anything in them bushes Be all over them before you could break wind boy

Frogeaters don’t smell like men Frey insisted They have a boggy stink like frogs and trees and scummy water Moss grows under their arms in place of hair and they can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water

Theon was about to tell him what he ought to do with his wet nurse’s fable when Maester Luwin spoke up The histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck It may be that they have secret knowledge

Suddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than it had a moment before as if a cloud had passed before the sun It was one thing to have some fool boy spouting folly but maesters were supposed to be wise The only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon Theon said Back to the stream Now

For a moment he did not think they were going to obey but in the end old habit asserted itself They followed sullenly but they followed The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits he’d flushed earlier Theon put men on either bank and followed the current They rode for miles going slow and careful dismounting to lead the horses over treacherous ground letting the good-for-bear-bait hounds sniff at every bush Where a fallen tree dammed the flow the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool but if the direwolves had done the same they’d left neither print nor spoor The beasts had taken to swimming it seemed When I catch them they’ll have all the swimming they can stomach I’ll give them both to the Drowned God

When the woods began to darken Theon Greyjoy knew he was beaten Either the crannogmen did know the magic of the children of the forest or else Osha had deceived them with some wildling trick He made them press on through the dusk but when the last light faded Joseth finally worked up the courage to say This is fruitless my lord We will lame a horse break a leg

Joseth has the right of it said Maester Luwin Groping through the woods by torchlight will avail us nothing

Theon could taste bile at the back of his throat and his stomach was a nest of snakes twining and snapping at each other If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed he might as well dress in motley henceforth and wear a pointed hat the whole north would know him for a fool And when my father hears and Asha…

M’lord prince Reek urged his horse near Might be them Starks never came this way If I was them I would have gone north and east maybe To the Umbers Good Stark men they are But their lands are a long way The boys will shelter someplace nearer Might be I know where

Theon looked at him suspiciously Tell me

You know that old mill sitting lonely on the Acorn Water We stopped there when I was being dragged to Winterfell a captive The miller’s wife sold us hay for our horses while that old knight clucked over her brats Might be the Starks are hiding there
