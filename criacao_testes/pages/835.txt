Lord Walder wants his grandson to inherit Riverrun How would it serve him to give you a barren wife

It rids him of a daughter no one else would take

Small good that will do him Walder Frey is a peevish man not a stupid one

Still… it is possible

Yes Catelyn conceded reluctantly There are illnesses a girl can have in childhood that leave her unable to conceive There’s no reason to believe that Lady Roslin was so afflicted though She looked round the room The Freys have received us more kindly than I had anticipated if truth be told

Edmure laughed A few barbed words and some unseemly gloating From him that’s courtesy I expected the old weasel to piss in our wine and make us praise the vintage

The jest left Catelyn strangely disquieted If you will excuse me I should change from these wet clothes

As you wish Edmure yawned I may nap an hour

She retreated to her own room The chest of clothes she’d brought from Riverrun had been carried up and laid at the foot of the bed After she’d undressed and hung her wet clothing by the fire she donned a warm wool dress of Tully red and blue washed and brushed her hair and let it dry and went in search of Freys

Lord Walder’s black oak throne was empty when she entered the hall but some of his sons were drinking by the fire Lame Lothar rose clumsily when he saw her Lady Catelyn I thought you would be resting How may I be of service

Are these your brothers she asked

Brothers half-brothers good brothers and nephews Raymund and I shared a mother Lord Lucias Vypren is my half-sister Lythene’s husband and Ser Damon is their son My half-brother Ser Hosteen I believe you know And this is Ser Leslyn Haigh and his sons Ser Harys and Ser Donnel

Well met sers Is Ser Perwyn about He helped escort me to Storm’s End and back when Robb sent me to speak with Lord Renly I was looking forward to seeing him again

Perwyn is away Lame Lothar said I shall give him your regards I know he will regret having missed you

Surely he will return in time for Lady Roslin’s wedding

He had hoped to said Lame Lothar but with this rain… you saw how the rivers ran my lady

I did indeed said Catelyn I wonder if you would be so good as to direct me to your maester

Are you unwell my lady asked Ser Hosteen a powerful man with a square strong jaw

A woman’s complaint Nothing to concern you ser

Lothar ever gracious escorted her from the hall up some steps and across a covered bridge to another stair You should find Maester Brenett in the turret on the top my lady

Catelyn half expected that the maester would be yet another son of Walder Frey’s but Brenett did not have the look He was a great fat man bald and double-chinned and none too clean to judge from the raven droppings that stained the sleeves of his robes yet he seemed amiable enough When she told him of Edmure’s concerns about Lady Roslin’s fertility he chuckled Your lord brother need have no fear Lady Catelyn She’s small I’ll grant you and narrow in the hips but her mother was the same and Lady Bethany gave Lord Walder a child every year

How many lived past infancy she asked bluntly

Five He ticked them off on fingers plump as sausages Ser Perwyn Ser Benfrey Maester Willamen who took his vows last year and now serves Lord Hunter in the Vale Olyvar who squired for your son And Lady Roslin the youngest Four boys to one girl Lord Edmure will have more sons than he knows what to do with

I am sure that will please him So the girl was like to be fertile as well as fair of face That should put Edmure’s mind at ease Lord Walder had left her brother no cause for complaint so far as she could see

Catelyn did not return to her own room after leaving the maester instead she went to Robb She found Robin Flint and Ser Wendel Manderly with him along with the Greatjon and his son who was still called the Smalljon though he threatened to overtop his father They were all damp Another man still wetter stood before the fire in a pale pink cloak trimmed with white fur Lord Bolton she said

Lady Catelyn he replied his voice faint it is a pleasure to look on you again even in such trying times

You are kind to say so Catelyn could feel gloom in the room Even the Greatjon seemed somber and subdued She looked at their grim faces and said What’s happened
