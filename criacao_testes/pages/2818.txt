I had not set up the doors upon the gates 62 That Sanballat and
Geshem sent unto me saying Come let us meet together in some one of
the villages in the plain of Ono But they thought to do me mischief

63 And I sent messengers unto them saying I am doing a great work
so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I leave
it and come down to you  64 Yet they sent unto me four times after
this sort and I answered them after the same manner

65 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in his hand 66 Wherein was written It is
reported among the heathen and Gashmu saith it that thou and the
Jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou
mayest be their king according to these words

67 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
Jerusalem saying There is a king in Judah and now shall it be
reported to the king according to these words Come now therefore and
let us take counsel together

68 Then I sent unto him saying There are no such things done as
thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart

69 For they all made us afraid saying Their hands shall be weakened
from the work that it be not done Now therefore O God strengthen
my hands

610 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
the son of Mehetabeel who was shut up and he said Let us meet
together in the house of God within the temple and let us shut the
doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the
night will they come to slay thee

611 And I said Should such a man as I flee and who is there that
being as I am would go into the temple to save his life I will not
go in

612 And lo I perceived that God had not sent him but that he
pronounced this prophecy against me for Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him

613 Therefore was he hired that I should be afraid and do so and
sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they
might reproach me

614 My God think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the
prophets that would have put me in fear

615 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
Elul in fifty and two days

616 And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and
all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much
cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was
wrought of our God

617 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
Tobiah and the letters of Tobiah came unto them

618 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him because he was the
son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah and his son Johanan had
taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah

619 Also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words
to him And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear

71 Now it came to pass when the wall was built and I had set up the
doors and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed
72 That I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the ruler of the
palace charge over Jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared
God above many

73 And I said unto them Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the
doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against
his house

74 Now the city was large and great but the people were few therein
and the houses were not builded

75 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and
the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy
And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the
first and found written therein 76 These are the children of the
province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been
carried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried
away and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah every one unto his
city 77 Who came with Zerubbabel Jeshua Nehemiah Azariah
Raamiah Nahamani Mordecai Bilshan Mispereth Bigvai Nehum
Baanah The number I say of the men of the people of Israel was
this 78 The children of Parosh two thousand an hundred seventy and
two

79 The children of Shephatiah three hundred seventy and two

710 The children of Arah six hundred fifty and two

711 The children of Pahathmoab of the children of Jeshua and Joab
