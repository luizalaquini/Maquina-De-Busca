followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of
trumpets in the front of the house
There said Oak laughing I knew those fellows
were up to something by the look on their face 
Oak took up the light and went into the porch
followed by Bathsheba with a shawl over her head The
rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the
gravel in front who when they saw the newly-married
couple in the porch set up a loud Hurrah and at
the same moment bang again went the cannon in the
background followed by a hideous clang of music from
a drum tambourine clarionet serpent hautboy tenor+
viol and double-bass -- the only remaining relics of the
true and original Weatherbury band -- venerable worm+
eaten instruments which had celebrated in their own
persons the victories of Marlhorough under the fingers
of the forefathers of those who played them now The
performers came forward and marched up to the
front
Those bright boys Mark Clark and Jan are at the
bottom of all this said Oak  Come in souls and
have something to eat and drink wi me and my wife
Not to-night said Mr Clark with evident self+
denial Thank ye all the same but well call at a
more seemly time However we couldnt think of
letting the day pass without a note of admiration of
some sort If ye could send a drop of somat down to
Warrens why so it is Heres long life and happiness
to neighbour Oak and his comely bride
Thank ye thank ye all said Gabriel A bit and
a drop shall be sent to Warrens for ye at once I had
a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some
sort from our old friends and I was saying so to my
wife but now
Faith said Coggan in a critical tone turning to his
companions the man hev learnt to say my wife
in a wonderful 
P 465
naterel way considering how very youth+
ful he is in wedlock as yet -- hey neighbours all
I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty
years standing pipe my wife in a more used note
than a did said Jacob Smallbury It might have been
a little more true to nater ift had been spoke a little
chillier but that wasnt to be expected just now
That improvement will come wi time said Jan
twirling his eye
Then Oak laughed and Bathsheba smiled for she
never laughed readily now and their friends turned to
go
Yes I suppose thats the size ot said Joseph
Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away
and I wish him joy o her though I were once or
twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea in my
scripture manner which is my second nature Ephraim
is joined to idols let him alone But since tis as tis
why it might have been worse and I feel my thanks
accordingly

CH 1  WHY SPEECH OUTPUT
ds RT Why speech output
ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
Speech is our everyday informal communication medium  But although we use
it a lot we probably dont assimilate as much information through our
ears as we do through our eyes by reading or looking at pictures and diagrams
You go to a technical lecture to get the feel of a subject em the overall
arrangement of ideas and the motivation behind them em and fill in the details
if you still want to know them from a book  You probably find out more about
the news from ten minutes with a newspaper than from a ten-minute news broadcast
So it should be emphasized from the start that speech output from computers is
not a panacea  It doesnt solve the problems of communicating with computers
it simply enriches the possibilities for communication
pp
What then are the advantages of speech output  One good reason for listening
to a radio news broadcast instead of spending the time with a newspaper
is that you can listen while shaving doing the housework or driving the car
Speech leaves hands and eyes free for other tasks
Moreover it is omnidirectional and does not require a free line of sight
Related to this is the
use of speech as a secondary medium for status reports and warning messages
Occasional interruptions by voice do not interfere with other activities
unless they demand unusual concentration and people can assimilate spoken messages
and queue them for later action quite easily and naturally
pp
The second key feature of speech communication stems from the telephone
It is the universality of the telephone receiver itself that is important
here rather than the existence of a world-wide distribution network
for with special equipment a modem and a VDU one does not need speech to take advantage of
the telephone network for information transfer
But speech needs no tools other than the telephone and this gives
it a substantial advantage  You can go into a phone booth anywhere in the world
carrying no special equipment and have access to your computer within seconds
The problem of data input is still there  perhaps your computer
system has a limited word recognizer or you use the touchtone telephone
keypad or a portable calculator-sized tone generator  Easy remote access
without special equipment is a great and unique asset to speech communication
