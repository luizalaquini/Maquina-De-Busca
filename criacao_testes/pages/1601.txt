asks a man weighed down with a small safe
To the presidents mansion Theyll assign us a new
place to live puffs the man
We turn off the alley and spill out onto one of the main
avenues Stay to the right a voice orders and I see the
Peacekeepers interspersed throughout the crowd
directing the flow of human traffic Scared faces peer out of
the plate-glass windows of the shops which are already
becoming overrun with refugees At this rate Tigris may
have new houseguests by lunch It was good for everybody
that we got out when we did
Its brighter now even with the snow picking up I catch
sight of Cressida and Pollux about thirty yards ahead of us
plodding along with the crowd I crane my head around to
see if I can locate Peeta I cant but Ive caught the eye of
an inquisitive-looking little girl in a lemon yellow coat I
nudge Gale and slow my pace ever so slightly to allow a
wall of people to form between us
We might need to split up I say under my breath
Theres a girl--
Gunfire rips through the crowd and several people
near me slump to the ground Screams pierce the air as a
second round mows down another group behind us Gale
and I drop to the street scuttle the ten yards to the shops
and take cover behind a display of spike-heeled boots
outside a shoe sellers
A row of feathery footwear blocks Gales view Who is
it Can you see he asks me What I can see between
alternating pairs of lavender and mint green leather boots
is a street full of bodies The little girl who was watching me
kneels beside a motionless woman screeching and trying
to rouse her Another wave of bullets slices across the
chest of her yellow coat staining it with red knocking the
girl onto her back For a moment looking at her tiny
crumpled form I lose my ability to form words Gale prods
me with his elbow Katniss
Theyre shooting from the roof above us I tell Gale I
watch a few more rounds see the white uniforms dropping
into the snowy streets Trying to take out the
Peacekeepers but theyre not exactly crack shots It must
be the rebels I dont feel a rush of joy although
theoretically my allies have broken through I am transfixed
by that lemon yellow coat
If we start shooting thats it Gale says The whole
world will know its us
Its true Were armed only with our fabulous bows To
release an arrow would be like announcing to both sides
that were here
No I say forcefully Weve got to get to Snow
Then we better start moving before the whole block
goes up says Gale Hugging the wall we continue along
the street Only the wall is mostly shopwindows A pattern of
sweaty palms and gaping faces presses against the glass
I yank my scarf up higher over my cheekbones as we dart
between outdoor displays Behind a rack of framed photos
of Snow we encounter a wounded Peacekeeper propped
against a strip of brick wall He asks us for help Gale
knees him in the side of the head and takes his gun At the
intersection he shoots a second Peacekeeper and we
both have firearms
So who are we supposed to be now I ask
Desperate citizens of the Capitol says Gale The
Peacekeepers will think were on their side and hopefully
the rebels have more interesting targets
Im mulling over the wisdom of this latest role as we
sprint across the intersection but by the time we reach the
next block it no longer matters who we are Who anyone is
Because no one is looking at faces The rebels are here all
right Pouring onto the avenue taking cover in doorways
behind vehicles guns blazing hoarse voices shouting
commands as they prepare to meet an army of
Peacekeepers marching toward us Caught in the cross
fire are the refugees unarmed disoriented many
wounded
A pods activated ahead of us releasing a gush of
steam that parboils everyone in its path leaving the victims
intestine-pink and very dead After that what little sense of
order there was unravels As the remaining curlicues of
steam intertwine with the snow visibility extends just to the
end of my barrel Peacekeeper rebel citizen who knows
Everything that moves is a target People shoot reflexively
and Im no exception Heart pounding adrenaline burning
through me everyone is my enemy Except Gale My
hunting partner the one person who has my back Theres
nothing to do but move forward killing whoever comes into
our path Screaming people bleeding people dead people
everywhere As we reach the next corner the entire block
ahead of us lights up with a rich purple glow We
backpedal hunker down in a stairwell and squint into the
light Somethings happening to those illuminated by it
Theyre assaulted bywhat A sound A wave A laser
Weapons fall from their hands fingers clutch their faces as
blood sprays from all visible orifices--eyes noses mouths
ears In less than a minute everyones dead and the glow
vanishes I grit my teeth and run leaping over the bodies
feet slipping in the gore The wind whips the snow into
blinding swirls but doesnt block out the sound of another
wave of boots headed our way
Get down I hiss at Gale We drop where we are My
face lands in a still-warm pool of someones blood but I
