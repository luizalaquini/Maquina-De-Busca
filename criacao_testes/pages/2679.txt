he would not come

1430 Therefore he said unto his servants See Joabs field is near
mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire And Absaloms
servants set the field on fire

1431 Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto his house and said
unto him Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire  1432 And
Absalom answered Joab Behold I sent unto thee saying Come hither
that I may send thee to the king to say Wherefore am I come from
Geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now
therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in
me let him kill me

1433 So Joab came to the king and told him and when he had called
for Absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the king and the king kissed Absalom

151 And it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared him
chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him

152 And Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate
and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment then Absalom called unto him and said Of what
city art thou And he said Thy servant is of one of the tribes of
Israel

153 And Absalom said unto him See thy matters are good and right
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee

154 Absalom said moreover Oh that I were made judge in the land
that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and I
would do him justice  155 And it was so that when any man came nigh
to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and
kissed him

156 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
king for judgment so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel

157 And it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said unto the
king I pray thee let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto
the LORD in Hebron

158 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria
saying If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then I
will serve the LORD

159 And the king said unto him Go in peace So he arose and went to
Hebron

1510 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel
saying As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall
say Absalom reigneth in Hebron

1511 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem that
were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any
thing

1512 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Davids
counsellor from his city even from Giloh while he offered
sacrifices And the conspiracy was strong for the people increased
continually with Absalom

1513 And there came a messenger to David saying The hearts of the
men of Israel are after Absalom

1514 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
Jerusalem Arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from
Absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring
evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword

1515 And the kings servants said unto the king Behold thy servants
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint

1516 And the king went forth and all his household after him And
the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house

1517 And the king went forth and all the people after him and
tarried in a place that was far off

1518 And all his servants passed on beside him and all the
Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites six hundred
men which came after him from Gath passed on before the king

1519 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite Wherefore goest thou
also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou
art a stranger and also an exile

1520 Whereas thou camest but yesterday should I this day make thee
go up and down with us seeing I go whither I may return thou and
take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee

1521 And Ittai answered the king and said As the LORD liveth and
as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king
shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant
be

1522 And David said to Ittai Go and pass over And Ittai the Gittite
passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with
him
