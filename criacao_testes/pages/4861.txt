made the sea dry land and the waters were divided

1422 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand and on their left

1423 And the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst
of the sea even all Pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen

1424 And it came to pass that in the morning watch the LORD looked
unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the
cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians 1425 And took off
their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the
Egyptians said Let us flee from the face of Israel for the LORD
fighteth for them against the Egyptians

1426 And the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand over the
sea that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians upon their
chariots and upon their horsemen

1427 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea
returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians
fled against it and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
the sea

1428 And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the
horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after
them there remained not so much as one of them

1429 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and
on their left

1430 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore

1431 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
Egyptians and the people feared the LORD and believed the LORD and
his servant Moses

151 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
LORD and spake saying I will sing unto the LORD for he hath
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea

152 The LORD is my strength and song and he is become my salvation
he is my God and I will prepare him an habitation my fathers God
and I will exalt him

153 The LORD is a man of war the LORD is his name

154 Pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his
chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea

155 The depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a
stone

156 Thy right hand O LORD is become glorious in power thy right
hand O LORD hath dashed in pieces the enemy

157 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which
consumed them as stubble

158 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were
congealed in the heart of the sea

159 The enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the
spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my
hand shall destroy them

1510 Thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank
as lead in the mighty waters

1511 Who is like unto thee O LORD among the gods who is like thee
glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders  1512 Thou
stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them

1513 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation

1514 The people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on
the inhabitants of Palestina

1515 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed the mighty men of Moab
trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away

1516 Fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine
arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over O
LORD till the people pass over which thou hast purchased

1517 Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of
thine inheritance in the place O LORD which thou hast made for thee
to dwell in in the Sanctuary O LORD which thy hands have
established

1518 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever
