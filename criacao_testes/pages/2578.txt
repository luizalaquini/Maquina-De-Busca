house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife

shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee

it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God

2414 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy
whether he be of thy brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy

heart upon it lest he cry against thee unto the LORD and it be sin
unto thee

fatherless nor take a widows raiment to pledge 2418 But thou shalt
remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt and the LORD thy God
