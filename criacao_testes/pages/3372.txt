give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it
profit  217 Even so faith if it hath not works is dead being
alone

218 Yea a man may say Thou hast faith and I have works shew me
thy faith without thy works and I will shew thee my faith by my
works

219 Thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the devils
also believe and tremble

220 But wilt thou know O vain man that faith without works is dead
221 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had
offered Isaac his son upon the altar  222 Seest thou how faith
wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect  223 And
the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it
was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the Friend
of God

224 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by
faith only

225 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works when
she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way
226 For as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without
works is dead also

31 My brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive
the greater condemnation

32 For in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word
the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body

33 Behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us
and we turn about their whole body

34 Behold also the ships which though they be so great and are
driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small
helm whithersoever the governor listeth

35 Even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things

Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth  36 And the tongue
is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members
that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of
nature and it is set on fire of hell

37 For every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of
things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind 38 But
the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly
poison

39 Therewith bless we God even the Father and therewith curse we
men which are made after the similitude of God

310 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing My
brethren these things ought not so to be

311 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
bitter  312 Can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries
either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and
fresh

313 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him
shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom

314 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory
not and lie not against the truth

315 This wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual
devilish

316 For where envying and strife is there is confusion and every
evil work

317 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable
gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits
without partiality and without hypocrisy

318 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
peace

41 From whence come wars and fightings among you come they not
hence even of your lusts that war in your members  42 Ye lust and
have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and
war yet ye have not because ye ask not

43 Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume
it upon your lusts

44 Ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of God

45 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain The spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy  46 But he giveth more grace
Wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the
humble

47 Submit yourselves therefore to God Resist the devil and he will
