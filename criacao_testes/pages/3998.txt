up the food among the rest of us
While we eat we watch the latest Capitol news
coverage The government has the rebel survivors
narrowed down to the five of us Huge bounties are offered
for information leading to our capture They emphasize how
dangerous we are Show us exchanging gunfire with the
Peacekeepers although not the mutts ripping off their
heads Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we left
her with my arrow still in her heart Someone has redone
her makeup for the cameras
The rebels let the Capitol broadcast run on
uninterrupted Have the rebels made a statement today I
ask Tigris She shakes her head I doubt Coin knows what
to do with me now that Im still alive
Tigris gives a throaty cackle No one knows what to
do with you girlie Then she makes me take a pair of the
fur leggings even though I cant pay her for them Its the
kind of gift you have to accept And anyway its cold in that
cellarDownstairs after supper we continue to rack our
brains for a plan Nothing good comes up but we do agree
that we can no longer go out as a group of five and that we
should try to infiltrate the presidents mansion before I turn
myself into bait I consent to that second point to avoid
further argument If I do decide to give myself up it wont
require anyone elses permission or participation
We change bandages handcuff Peeta back to his
support and settle down to sleep A few hours later I slip
back into consciousness and become aware of a quiet
conversation Peeta and Gale I cant stop myself from
eavesdropping
Thanks for the water Peeta says
No problem Gale replies I wake up ten times a
night anyway
To make sure Katniss is still here asks Peeta
Something like that Gale admits
Theres a long pause before Peeta speaks again
That was funny what Tigris said About no one knowing
what to do with her
Well we never have Gale says
They both laugh Its so strange to hear them talking
like this Almost like friends Which theyre not Never have
been Although theyre not exactly enemies
She loves you you know says Peeta She as good
as told me after they whipped you
Dont believe it Gale answers The way she kissed
you in the Quarter Quellwell she never kissed me like
that
It was just part of the show Peeta tells him although
theres an edge of doubt in his voice
No you won her over Gave up everything for her
Maybe thats the only way to convince her you love her
Theres a long pause I should have volunteered to take
your place in the first Games Protected her then
You couldnt says Peeta Shed never have forgiven
you You had to take care of her family They matter more to
her than her life
Well it wont be an issue much longer I think its
unlikely all three of us will be alive at the end of the war And
if we are I guess its Katnisss problem Who to choose
Gale yawns We should get some sleep
Yeah I hear Peetas handcuffs slide down the
support as he settles in I wonder how shell make up her
mind
Oh that I do know I can just catch Gales last words
through the layer of fur Katniss will pick whoever she
thinks she cant survive without
24
A chill runs through me Am I really that cold and
calculating Gale didnt say Katniss will pick whoever it
will break her heart to give up or even whoever she cant
live without Those would have implied I was motivated by
a kind of passion But my best friend predicts I will choose
the person who I think I cant survive without Theres not
the least indication that love or desire or even
compatibility will sway me Ill just conduct an unfeeling
assessment of what my potential mates can offer me As if
in the end it will be the question of whether a baker or a
hunter will extend my longevity the most Its a horrible thing
for Gale to say for Peeta not to refute Especially when
every emotion I have has been taken and exploited by the
Capitol or the rebels At the moment the choice would be
simple I can survive just fine without either of them
In the morning I have no time or energy to nurse
wounded feelings During a predawn breakfast of liver pate
and fig cookies we gather around Tigriss television for
one of Beetees break-ins Theres been a new
development in the war Apparently inspired by the black
wave some enterprising rebel commander came up with
the idea of confiscating peoples abandoned automobiles
and sending them unmanned down the streets The cars
dont trigger every pod but they certainly get the majority At
around four in the morning the rebels began carving three
separate paths--simply referred to as the A B and C lines-
-to the Capitols heart As a result theyve secured block
after block with very few casualties
This cant last says Gale In fact Im surprised
theyve kept it going so long The Capitol will adjust by
deactivating specific pods and then manually triggering
them when their targets come in range Almost within
minutes of his prediction we see this very thing happen onscreen
