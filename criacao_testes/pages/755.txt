For all the heat and smoke in Craster’s hall Sam felt cold himself And tired so tired He needed sleep but whenever he closed his eyes he dreamed of blowing snow and dead men shambling toward him with black hands and bright blue eyes

Up in the loft Gilly let out a shuddering sob that echoed down the long low windowless hall Push he heard one of Craster’s older wives tell her Harder Harder Scream if it helps She did so loud it made Sam wince

Craster turned his head to glare I’ve had a bellyful o’ that shrieking he shouted up Give her a rag to bite down on or I’ll come up there and give her a taste o’ my hand

He would too Sam knew Craster had nineteen wives but none who’d dare interfere once he started up that ladder No more than the black brothers had two nights past when he was beating one of the younger girls There had been mutterings to be sure He’s killing her Garth of Greenaway had said and Clubfoot Karl laughed and said If he don’t want the little sweetmeat he could give her to me Black Bernarr cursed in a low angry voice and Alan of Rosby got up and went outside so he wouldn’t have to hear His roof his rule the ranger Ronnel Harclay had reminded them Craster’s a friend to the Watch

A friend thought Sam as he listened to Gilly’s muffled shrieks Craster was a brutal man who ruled his wives and daughters with an iron hand but his keep was a refuge all the same Frozen crows Craster sneered when they straggled in those few who had survived the snow the wights and the bitter cold And not so big a flock as went north neither Yet he had given them space on his floor a roof to keep the snow off a fire to dry them out and his wives had brought them cups of hot wine to put some warmth in their bellies Bloody crows he called them but he’d fed them too meager though the fare might be

We are guests Sam reminded himself Gilly is his His daughter his wife His roof his rule

The first time he’d seen Craster’s Keep Gilly had come begging for help and Sam had lent her his black cloak to conceal her belly when she went to find Jon Snow Knights are supposed to defend women and children Only a few of the black brothers were knights but even so… We all say the words Sam thought I am the shield that guards the realms of men A woman was a woman even a wildling woman We should help her We should It was her child Gilly feared for she was frightened that it might be a boy Craster raised up his daughters to be his wives but there were neither men nor boys to be seen about his compound Gilly had told Jon that Craster gave his sons to the gods If the gods are good they will send her a daughter Sam prayed

Up in the loft Gilly choked back a scream That’s it a woman said Another push now Oh I see his head

Hers Sam thought miserably Her head hers

Cold said Bannen weakly Please I’m so cold Sam put the bowl and spoon aside tossed another fur across the dying man put another stick on the fire Gilly gave a shriek and began to pant Craster gnawed on his hard black sausage He had sausages for himself and his wives he said but none for the Watch Women he complained The way they wail… I had me a fat sow once birthed a litter of eight with no more’n a grunt Chewing he turned his head to squint contemptuously at Sam She was near as fat as you boy Slayer He laughed

It was more than Sam could stand He stumbled away from the firepit stepping awkwardly over and around the men sleeping and squatting and dying upon the hard-packed earthen floor The smoke and screams and moans were making him feel faint Bending his head he pushed through the hanging deerhide flaps that served Craster for a door and stepped out into the afternoon

The day was cloudy but still bright enough to blind him after the gloom of the hall Some patches of snow weighed down the limbs of surrounding trees and blanketed the gold and russet hills but fewer than there had been The storm had passed on and the days at Craster’s Keep had been… well not warm perhaps but not so bitter cold Sam could hear the soft drip-drip-drip of water melting off the icicles that bearded the edge of the thick sod roof He took a deep shuddering breath and looked around

To the west Ollo Lophand and Tim Stone were moving through the horselines feeding and watering the remaining garrons

Downwind other brothers were skinning and butchering the animals deemed too weak to go on Spearmen and archers walked sentry behind the earthen dikes that were Craster’s only defense against whatever hid in the wood beyond while a dozen firepits sent up thick fingers of blue-grey smoke Sam could hear the distant echoes of axes at work in the forest where a work detail was harvesting enough wood to keep the blazes burning all through the night Nights were the bad time When it got dark And cold

There had been no attacks while they had been at Craster’s neither wights nor Others Nor would there be Craster said A godly man got no cause to fear such I said as much to that Mance Rayder once when he come sniffing round He never listened no more’n you crows with your swords and your bloody fires That won’t help you none when the white cold comes Only the gods will help you then You best get right with the gods

Gilly had spoken of the white cold as well and she’d told them what sort of offerings Craster made to his gods Sam had wanted to kill him when he heard There are no laws beyond the Wall he reminded himself and Craster’s a friend to the Watch

A ragged shout went up from behind the daub-and-wattle hall Sam went to take a look The ground beneath his feet was a slush of melting snow and soft mud that Dolorous Edd insisted was made of Craster’s shit It was thicker than shit though it sucked at Sam’s boots so hard he felt one pull loose

Back of a vegetable garden and empty sheepfold a dozen black brothers were loosing arrows at a butt they’d built of hay and straw The slender blond steward they called Sweet Donnel had laid a shaft just off the bull’s eye at fifty yards Best that old man he said

Aye I will Ulmer stooped and grey-bearded and loose of skin and limb stepped to the mark and pulled an arrow from the quiver at his waist In his youth he had been an outlaw a member of the infamous Kingswood Brotherhood He claimed he’d once put an arrow through the hand of the White Bull of the Kingsguard to steal a kiss from the lips of a Dornish princess He had stolen her jewels too and a chest of golden dragons but it was the kiss he liked to boast of in his cups

He notched and drew all smooth as summer silk then let fly His shaft struck the butt an inch inside of Donnel Hill’s Will that do lad he asked stepping back

Well enough said the younger man grudgingly The crosswind helped you It blew more strongly when I loosed

You ought to have allowed for it then You have a good eye and a steady hand but you’ll need a deal more to best a man of the kingswood Fletcher Dick it was who showed me how to bend the bow and no finer archer ever lived Have I told you about old Dick now

Only three hundred times Every man at Castle Black had heard Ulmer’s tales of the great outlaw band of yore of Simon Toyne and the Smiling Knight Oswyn Longneck the Thrice-Hanged Wenda the White Fawn Fletcher Dick Big Belly Ben and all the rest Searching for escape Sweet Donnel looked about and spied Sam standing in the muck Slayer he called Come show us how you slew the Other He held out the tall yew longbow

Sam turned red It wasn’t an arrow it was a dagger dragonglass… He knew what would happen if he took the bow He would miss the butt and send the arrow sailing over the dike off into the trees Then he’d hear the laughter

No matter said Alan of Rosby another fine bowman We’re all keen to see the Slayer shoot Aren’t we lads

He could not face them the mocking smiles the mean little jests the contempt in their eyes Sam turned to go back the way he’d come but his right foot sank deep in the muck and when he tried to pull it out his boot came off He had to kneel to wrench it free laughter ringing in his ears Despite all his socks the snowmelt had soaked through to his toes by the time he made his escape Useless he thought miserably My father saw me true I have no right to be alive when so many brave men are dead

Grenn was tending the firepit south of the compound gate stripped to the waist as he split logs His face was red with exertion the sweat steaming off his skin But he grinned as Sam came chuffing up The Others get your boot Slayer
