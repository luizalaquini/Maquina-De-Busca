of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes
saith the LORD




Haggai


11 In the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month in the
first day of the month came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and
to Joshua the son of Josedech the high priest saying 12 Thus
speaketh the LORD of hosts saying This people say The time is not
come the time that the LORDs house should be built

13 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet saying 14
Is it time for you O ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this
house lie waste  15 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts
Consider your ways

16 Ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not
enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but
there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it
into a bag with holes

17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Consider your ways

18 Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and I
will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified saith the LORD

19 Ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought
it home I did blow upon it Why saith the LORD of hosts Because of
mine house that is waste and ye run every man unto his own house

110 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth
is stayed from her fruit

111 And I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains
and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon
that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle
and upon all the labour of the hands

112 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of
Josedech the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed
the voice of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet
as the LORD their God had sent him and the people did fear before the
LORD

113 Then spake Haggai the LORDs messenger in the LORDs message unto
the people saying I am with you saith the LORD

114 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of
Josedech the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the
people and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts
their God 115 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in
the second year of Darius the king

21 In the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month
came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai saying 22 Speak now
to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua
the son of Josedech the high priest and to the residue of the
people saying 23 Who is left among you that saw this house in her
first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in
comparison of it as nothing  24 Yet now be strong O Zerubbabel
saith the LORD and be strong O Joshua son of Josedech the high
priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the LORD and
work for I am with you saith the LORD of hosts 25 According to the
word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt so my
spirit remaineth among you fear ye not

26 For thus saith the LORD of hosts Yet once it is a little while
and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry
land 27 And I will shake all nations and the desire of all nations
shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the LORD of
hosts

28 The silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the LORD of hosts

29 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
former saith the LORD of hosts and in this place will I give peace
saith the LORD of hosts

210 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second
year of Darius came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet
saying 211 Thus saith the LORD of hosts Ask now the priests
concerning the law saying 212 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt
of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or
wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy And the priests answered
and said No

213 Then said Haggai If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
of these shall it be unclean And the priests answered and said It
shall be unclean

214 Then answered Haggai and said So is this people and so is this
nation before me saith the LORD and so is every work of their hands
and that which they offer there is unclean
