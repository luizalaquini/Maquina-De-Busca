There was a pounding at her door louder than before Arya Stark you open this door at once do you hear me

Arya spun around with Needle in her hand You better not come in here she warned She slashed at the air savagely

The Hand will hear of this Septa Mordane raged

I don’t care Arya screamed Go away

You will rue this insolent behavior young lady I promise you that Arya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa’s receding footsteps

She went back to the window Needle in hand and looked down into the courtyard below If only she could climb like Bran she thought she would go out the window and down the tower run away from this horrible place away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey from all of them Steal some food from the kitchens take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident and together they’d return to Winterfell or run to Jon on the Wall She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now Then maybe she wouldn’t feel so alone

A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape Arya her father’s voice called out Open the door We need to talk

Arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar Father was alone He seemed more sad than angry That made Arya feel even worse May I come in Arya nodded then dropped her eyes ashamed Father closed the door Whose sword is that

Mine Arya had almost forgotten Needle in her hand

Give it to me

Reluctantly Arya surrendered her sword wondering if she would ever hold it again Her father turned it in the light examining both sides of the blade He tested the point with his thumb A bravo’s blade he said Yet it seems to me that I know this maker’s mark This is Mikken’s work

Arya could not lie to him She lowered her eyes

Lord Eddard Stark sighed My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge and I know nothing of it The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household How is it that you come to own a sword Arya Where did you get this

Arya chewed her lip and said nothing She would not betray Jon not even to their father

After a while Father said I don’t suppose it matters truly He looked down gravely at the sword in his hands This is no toy for children least of all for a girl What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords

I wasn’t playing Arya insisted I hate Septa Mordane

That’s enough Her father’s voice was curt and hard The septa is doing no more than is her duty though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady

I don’t want to be a lady Arya flared

I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now and put an end to this nonsense

Needle wouldn’t break Arya said defiantly but her voice betrayed her words

It has a name does it Her father sighed Ah Arya You have a wildness in you child ‘The wolf blood’ my father used to call it Lyanna had a touch of it and my brother Brandon more than a touch It brought them both to an early grave Arya heard sadness in his voice he did not often speak of his father or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born Lyanna might have carried a sword if my lord father had allowed it You remind me of her sometimes You even look like her

Lyanna was beautiful Arya said startled Everybody said so It was not a thing that was ever said of Arya

She was Eddard Stark agreed beautiful and willful and dead before her time He lifted the sword held it out between them Arya what did you think to do with this… Needle Who did you hope to skewer Your sister Septa Mordane Do you know the first thing about sword fighting

All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her Stick them with the pointy end she blurted out

Her father snorted back laughter That is the essence of it I suppose

Arya desperately wanted to explain to make him see I was trying to learn but… Her eyes filled with tears I asked Mycah to practice with me The grief came on her all at once She turned away shaking I asked him she cried It was my fault it was me…

Suddenly her father’s arms were around her He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest No sweet one he murmured Grieve for your friend but never blame yourself You did not kill the butcher’s boy That murder lies at the Hound’s door him and the cruel woman he serves
