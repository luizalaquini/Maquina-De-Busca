From a speech point of view the resulting utterances can never be made
convincingly fluent
We discussed the early experiments of Stowe and Hampton 1961
at the beginning of Chapter 3

Stowe Hampton 1961

A major drawback to word concatenation in the
analogue domain is the introduction of clicks and other interference
between words  it is difficult to prevent the time waveform transitions
from adding extraneous sounds
This poses no problem with digital storage however for the waveforms
can be edited accurately prior to storage so that they start
and finish at an exactly
zero level
Rather the lack of fluency stems from the absence of proper control
of coarticulation and prosody
pp
But this is not necessarily a serious drawback if the application is
a sufficiently limited one  Complete invariant utterances can be
stored as one unit  Often they must contain data-dependent
slot-fillers as in
LB
This flight makes em stops
LE
and
LB
Flight number em leaves em at em  arrives in em at em
LE

Then each slot-filling word is recorded in an intonation consistent
both with its position in the template utterance and with the
intonation of that utterance
This could be done by embedding the word in the utterance
for recording and excising it by digital editing before storage
It would be dangerous to try to take into account coarticulation effects
for the coarticulation could not be made consistent with both the
several slot-fillers and the single template
This could be overcome if several versions of the template were stored
but then the scheme becomes subject to combinatorial explosion
if there is more than one slot in a single utterance
But it is not really necessary for the lack of fluency will probably
be interpreted by a benevolent listener as an attempt to convey the
information as clearly as possible
pp
Difficulties will occur if the same slot-filler is used in different
contexts  For instance the first gap in each of the sentences above
contains a number yet the intonation of that number is different
Many systems simply ignore this problem
Then one does notice anomalies if one is attentive  the words come
as it were from different mouths without fluency
However the problem is not necessarily acute  If it is two or more
versions of each slot-filler can be recorded one for each context
pp
As an example consider the synthesis of 7-digit telephone numbers
like 289-5371  If one version only of each digit is stored
it should be recorded in a level tone of voice  A pause should be
inserted after the third digit of the synthetic number to accord
with common elocution  The result will certainly be unnatural although
it should be clear and intelligible
Any pitch errors in the recordings will make certain numbers
audibly anomalous
At the other extreme 70 single digits could be stored one version of
each digit for each position in the number  The recording will be
tedious and error-prone and the synthetic utterances will still not
be fluent em for coarticulation is ignored em but instead
unnaturally clearly enunciated  A compromise is to record only
three versions of each digit one for any of the
five positions
nr x1 wul
nr x2 8nx1
nr x3 02m
zxhnx1uzxhnx1uhnx1uz-hnx1uzxhnx1uzxhnx1uc
zxhnx1uhnx1uvnx3ul-nx2uulv-nx3u 
another one for the third position
hnx1uhnx1uzxhnx1uz-hnx1uhnx1uc
hnx1uhnx1uhnx1uvnx3ul-nx2uulv-nx3u 
and the last for the final position
hnx1uhnx1uhnx1uz-hnx1uhnx1uc
hnx1uhnx1uzxhnx1uvnx3ul-nx2uulv-nx3u 
The first version will be in a level voice the second an
incomplete rising tone and the third a final dropping pitch
rh Joining formant-coded words
The limitations of the time-domain method are lack of
fluency caused by unnatural transitions between words and the
combinatorial explosion created by recording slot-fillers several times
in different contexts
Both of these problems can be alleviated by storing formant tracks
concatenating them with suitable interpolation and applying a complete
pitch contour suitable for the whole utterance
But one can still not generate conversational speech for natural speech
rhythms cause non-linear warpings of the time axis which cannot reasonably
be imitated by this method
pp
Solving problems often creates others
As we saw in Chapter 4 it is not easy to obtain reliable formant tracks
