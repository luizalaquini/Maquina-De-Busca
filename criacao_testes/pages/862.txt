shall go in and out and find pasture

1010 The thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to
destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have
it more abundantly

1011 I am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep

1012 But he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the
sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and
fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep

1013 The hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not
for the sheep

1014 I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine

1015 As the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father and I lay
down my life for the sheep

1016 And other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I
must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold
and one shepherd

1017 Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life
that I might take it again

1018 No man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have
power to lay it down and I have power to take it again This
commandment have I received of my Father

1019 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
sayings

1020 And many of them said He hath a devil and is mad why hear ye
him  1021 Others said These are not the words of him that hath a
devil Can a devil open the eyes of the blind  1022 And it was at
Jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter

1023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch

1024 Then came the Jews round about him and said unto him How long
dost thou make us to doubt If thou be the Christ tell us plainly

1025 Jesus answered them I told you and ye believed not the works
that I do in my Fathers name they bear witness of me

1026 But ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I said
unto you

1027 My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me
1028 And I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand

1029 My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man
is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand

1030 I and my Father are one

1031 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him

1032 Jesus answered them Many good works have I shewed you from my
Father for which of those works do ye stone me  1033 The Jews
answered him saying For a good work we stone thee not but for
blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself God

1034 Jesus answered them Is it not written in your law I said Ye
are gods  1035 If he called them gods unto whom the word of God
came and the scripture cannot be broken 1036 Say ye of him whom
the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world Thou blasphemest
because I said I am the Son of God  1037 If I do not the works of
my Father believe me not

1038 But if I do though ye believe not me believe the works that
ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him

1039 Therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of
their hand 1040 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place
where John at first baptized and there he abode

1041 And many resorted unto him and said John did no miracle but
all things that John spake of this man were true

1042 And many believed on him there

111 Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town
of Mary and her sister Martha

112 It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and
wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick  113
Therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom
thou lovest is sick

114 When Jesus heard that he said This sickness is not unto death
but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified
thereby

115 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus
