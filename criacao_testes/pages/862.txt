It’s his city I want not his meager manhood She was growing angry however If I ignore this any longer my own people will think me weak Yet who could she send She needed Daario as much as she did her bloodriders Without the flamboyant Tyroshi she had no hold on the Stormcrows many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald

High on the walls of Meereen the jeers had grown louder and now hundreds of the defenders were taking their lead from the hero and pissing down through the ramparts to show their contempt for the besiegers They are pissing on slaves to show how little they fear us she thought They would never dare such a thing if it were a Dothraki khalasar outside their gates

This challenge must be met Arstan said again

It will be Dany said as the hero tucked his penis away again Tell Strong Belwas I have need of him

They found the huge brown eunuch sitting in the shade of her pavilion eating a sausage He finished it in three bites wiped his greasy hands clean on his trousers and sent Arstan Whitebeard to fetch him his steel The aged squire honed Belwas’s arakh every evening and rubbed it down with bright red oil

When Whitebeard brought the sword Strong Belwas squinted down the edge grunted slid the blade back into its leather sheath and tied the swordbelt about his vast waist Arstan had brought his shield as well a round steel disk no larger than a pie plate which the eunuch grasped with his off hand rather than strapping to his forearm in the manner of Westeros Find liver and onions Whitebeard Belwas said Not for now for after Killing makes Strong Belwas hungry He did not wait for a reply but lumbered from the olive grove toward Oznak zo Pahl

Why that one Khaleesi Rakharo demanded of her He is fat and stupid

Strong Belwas was a slave here in the fighting pits If this highborn Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed while if he wins… well it is a poor victory for one so noble one that Meereen can take no pride in And unlike Ser Jorah Daario Brown Ben and her three bloodriders the eunuch did not lead troops plan battles or give her counsel He does nothing but eat and boast and bellow at Arstan Belwas was the man she could most easily spare And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had sent her

A thrum of excitement went through the siege lines when Belwas was seen plodding toward the city and from the walls and towers of Meereen came shouts and jeers Oznak zo Pahl mounted up again and waited his striped lance held upright The charger tossed his head impatiently and pawed the sandy earth As massive as he was the eunuch looked small beside the hero on his horse

A chivalrous man would dismount said Arstan

Oznak zo Pahl lowered his lance and charged

Belwas stopped with legs spread wide In one hand was his small round shield in the other the curved arakh that Arstan tended with such care His great brown stomach and sagging chest were bare above the yellow silk sash knotted about his waist and he wore no armor but his studded leather vest so absurdly small that it did not even cover his nipples We should have given him chainmail Dany said suddenly anxious

Mail would only slow him said Ser Jorah They wear no armor in the fighting pits It’s blood the crowds come to see

Dust flew from the hooves of the white charger Oznak thundered toward Strong Belwas his striped cloak streaming from his shoulders The whole city of Meereen seemed to be screaming him on The besiegers’ cheers seemed few and thin by comparison her Unsullied stood in silent ranks watching with stone faces Belwas might have been made of stone as well He stood in the horse’s path his vest stretched tight across his broad back Oznak’s lance was leveled at the center of his chest Its bright steel point winked in the sunlight He’s going to be impaled she thought… as the eunuch spun sideways And quick as the blink of an eye the horseman was beyond him wheeling raising the lance Belwas made no move to strike at him The Meereenese on the walls screamed even louder What is he doing Dany demanded

Giving the mob a show Ser Jorah said

Oznak brought the horse around Belwas in a wide circle then dug in with his spurs and charged again Again Belwas waited then spun and knocked the point of the lance aside She could hear the eunuch’s booming laughter echoing across the plain as the hero went past him The lance is too long Ser Jorah said All Belwas needs do is avoid the point Instead of trying to spit him so prettily the fool should ride right over him

Oznak zo Pahl charged a third time and now Dany could see plainly that he was riding past Belwas the way a Westerosi knight might ride at an opponent in a tilt rather than at him like a Dothraki riding down a foe The flat level ground allowed the charger to get up a good speed but it also made it easy for the eunuch to dodge the cumbersome fourteen-foot lance

Meereen’s pink-and-white hero tried to anticipate this time and swung his lance sideways at the last second to catch Strong Belwas when he dodged But the eunuch had anticipated too and this time he dropped down instead of spinning sideways The lance passed harmlessly over his head And suddenly Belwas was rolling and bringing the razor-sharp arakh around in a silver arc They heard the charger scream as the blade bit into his legs and then the horse was falling the hero tumbling from the saddle

A sudden silence swept along the brick parapets of Meereen Now it was Dany’s people who were screaming and cheering

Oznak leapt clear of his horse and managed to draw his sword before Strong Belwas was on him Steel sang against steel too fast and furious for Dany to follow the blows It could not have been a dozen heartbeats before Belwas’s chest was awash in blood from a slice below his breasts and Oznak zo Pahl had an arakh planted right between his ram’s horns The eunuch wrenched the blade loose and parted the hero’s head from his body with three savage blows to the neck He held it up high for the Meereenese to see then flung it toward the city gates and let it bounce and roll across the sand

So much for the hero of Meereen said Daario laughing

A victory without meaning Ser Jorah cautioned We will not win Meereen by killing its defenders one at a time

No Dany agreed but I’m pleased we killed this one

The defenders on the walls began firing their crossbows at Belwas but the bolts fell short or skittered harmlessly along the ground The eunuch turned his back on the steel-tipped rain lowered his trousers squatted and shat in the direction of the city He wiped himself with Oznak’s striped cloak and paused long enough to loot the hero’s corpse and put the dying horse out of his agony before trudging back to the olive grove

The besiegers gave him a raucous welcome as soon as he reached the camp Her Dothraki hooted and screamed and the Unsullied sent up a great clangor by banging their spears against their shields Well done Ser Jorah told him and Brown Ben tossed the eunuch a ripe plum and said A sweet fruit for a sweet fight Even her Dothraki handmaids had words of praise We would braid your hair and hang a bell in it Strong Belwas said Jhiqui but you have no hair to braid

Strong Belwas needs no tinkly bells The eunuch ate Brown Ben’s plum in four big bites and tossed aside the stone Strong Belwas needs liver and onions

You shall have it said Dany Strong Belwas is hurt His stomach was red with the blood sheeting down from the meaty gash beneath his breasts
