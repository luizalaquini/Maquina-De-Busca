He considered fondling Esgred’s breast again but she would probably only take his hand away and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat Time enough for such play at the castle in the privacy of his chambers I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke and see that you have an honored place at the feast he said I must sit on the dais at my father’s right hand but I will come down and join you when he leaves the hall He seldom lingers long He has no belly for drink these days

A grievous thing when a great man grows old

Lord Balon is but the father of a great man

A modest lordling

Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him He kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck

What shall I wear to this great feast She reached back and pushed his face away

I’ll ask Helya to garb you One of my lady mother’s gowns might do She is off on Harlaw and not expected to return

The cold winds have worn her away I hear Will you not go see her Harlaw is only a day’s sail and surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son

Would that I could I am kept too busy here My father relies on me now that I am returned Come peace perhaps…

Your coming might bring her peace

Now you sound a woman Theon complained

I confess I am… and new with child

Somehow that thought excited him So you say but your body shows no signs of it How shall it be proven Before I believe you I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe and taste your mother’s milk

And what will my husband say to this Your father’s own sworn man and servant

We’ll give him so many ships to build he’ll never know you’ve left him

She laughed It’s a cruel lordling who’s seized me If I promise you that one day you may watch my babe get suck will you tell me more of your war Theon of House Greyjoy There are miles and mountains still ahead of us and I would hear of this wolf king you served and the golden lions he fights

Ever anxious to please her Theon obliged The rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he filled her pretty head with tales of Winterfell and war Some of the things he said astonished him She is easy to talk to gods praise her he reflected I feel as though I’ve known her for years If the wench’s pillow play is half the equal of her wit I’ll need to keep her… He thought of Sigrin the Shipwright a thick-bodied thick-witted man flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow and shook his head A waste A most tragic waste

It seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before them

The gates were open Theon put his heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot The hounds were barking wildly as he helped Esgred dismount Several came bounding up tails wagging They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over leaping all around her yapping and licking Off Theon shouted aiming an ineffectual kick at one big brown bitch but Esgred was laughing and wrestling with them

A stableman came pounding up after the dogs Take the horse Theon commanded him and get these damn dogs away—

The lout paid him no mind His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and he said Lady Asha You’re back

Last night she said I sailed from Great Wyk with Lord Goodbrother and spent the night at the inn My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from Lordsport She kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at Theon

All he could do was stand and gape at her Asha No She cannot be Asha He realized suddenly that there were two Ashas in his head One was the little girl he had known The other more vaguely imagined looked something like her mother Neither looked a bit like this… this… this…

The pimples went when the breasts came she explained while she tussled with a dog but I kept the vulture’s beak

Theon found his voice Why didn’t you tell me

Asha let go of the hound and straightened I wanted to see who you were first And I did She gave him a mocking half bow And now little brother pray excuse me I need to bathe and dress for the feast I wonder if I still have that chainmail gown I like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes She gave him that evil grin and crossed the bridge with that walk he’d liked so well half saunter and half sway

When Theon turned away Wex was smirking at him He gave the boy a clout on the ear That’s for enjoying this so much And another harder And that’s for not warning me Next time grow a tongue

His own chambers in the Guest Keep had never seemed so chilly though the thralls had left a brazier burning Theon kicked his boots off let his cloak fall to the floor and poured himself a cup of wine remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples She unlaced my breeches he thought outraged and she said… oh gods and I said… He groaned He could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself

No he thought then She was the one who made me a fool The evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of it And the way she kept reaching for my cock…

He took his cup and went to the window seat where he sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over Pyke I have no place here he thought and Asha is the reason may the Others take her The water below turned from green to grey to black By then he could hear distant music and he knew it was time to change for the feast

Theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes somber shades of black and grey to fit his mood No ornament he had nothing bought with iron I might have taken something off that wildling I killed to save Bran Stark but he had nothing worth the taking That’s my cursed luck I kill the poor

The long smoky hall was crowded with his father’s lords and captains when Theon entered near four hundred of them Dagmer Cleftjaw had not yet returned from Old Wyk with the Stonehouses and Drumms but all the rest were there—Harlaws from Harlaw Blacktydes from Blacktyde Sparrs Merlyns and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk Saltcliffes and Sunderlies from Saltcliffe and Botleys and Wynches from the other side of Pyke The thralls were pouring ale and there was music fiddles and skins and drums Three burly men were doing the finger dance spinning short-hafted axes at each other The trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step It was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one… or two or five

Neither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of Theon Greyjoy as he strode to the dais Lord Balon occupied the Seastone Chair carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when they came to the Iron Islands To the left of the high seat were Theon’s uncles Asha was ensconced at his right hand in the place of honor You come late Theon Lord Balon observed

I ask your pardon Theon took the empty seat beside Asha Leaning close he hissed in her ear You’re in my place

She turned to him with innocent eyes Brother surely you are mistaken Your place is at Winterfell Her smile cut And where are all your pretty clothes I heard you fancied silk and velvet against your skin She was in soft green wool herself simply cut the fabric clinging to the slender lines of her body

Your hauberk must have rusted away sister he threw back A great pity I’d like to see you all in iron

Asha only laughed You may yet little brother… if you think your Sea Bitch can keep up with my Black Wind One of their father’s thralls came near bearing a flagon of wine Are you drinking ale or wine tonight Theon She leaned over close Or is it still a taste of my mother’s milk you thirst for

He flushed Wine he told the thrall Asha turned away and banged on the table shouting for ale

Theon hacked a loaf of bread in half hollowed out a trencher and summoned a cook to fill it with fish stew The smell of the thick cream made him a little ill but he forced himself to eat some He’d drunk enough wine to float him through two meals If I retch it will be on her Does Father know that you’ve married his shipwright he asked his sister

No more than Sigrin does She gave a shrug Esgred was the first ship he built He named her after his mother I would be hard-pressed to say which he loves best

Every word you spoke to me was a lie

Not every word Remember when I told you I like to be on top Asha grinned

That only made him angrier All that about being a woman wed and new with child…

Oh that part was true enough Asha leapt to her feet Rolfe here she shouted down at one of the finger dancers holding up a hand He saw her spun and suddenly an axe came flying from his hand the blade gleaming as it tumbled end over end through the torchlight Theon had time for a choked gasp before Asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed it down into the table splitting his trencher in two and splattering his mantle with drippings There’s my lord husband His sister reached down inside her gown and drew a dirk from between her breasts And here’s my sweet suckling babe

He could not imagine how he looked at that moment but suddenly Theon Greyjoy realized that the Great Hall was ringing with laughter all of it at him Even his father was smiling gods be damned and his uncle Victarion chuckled aloud The best response he could summon was a queasy grin We shall see who is laughing when all this is done bitch

Asha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung it back down at the dancers to whistles and loud cheers You’d do well to heed what I told you about choosing a crew A thrall offered them a platter and she stabbed a salted fish and ate it off the end of her dirk If you had troubled to learn the first thing of Sigrin I could never have fooled you Ten years a wolf and you land here and think to prince about the islands but you know nothing and no one Why should men fight and die for you 

I am their lawful prince Theon said stiffly

By the laws of the green lands you might be But we make our own laws here or have you forgotten

Scowling Theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before him He would have stew in his lap before long He shouted for a thrall to clean it up Half my life I have waited to come home and for what Mockery and disregard This was not the Pyke he remembered Or did he remember He had been so young when they took him away to hold hostage

The feast was a meager enough thing a succession of fish stews black bread and spiceless goat The tastiest thing Theon found to eat was an onion pie Ale and wine continued to flow well after the last of the courses had been cleared away
