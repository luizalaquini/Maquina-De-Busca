Tyrion reached for his wine cup buying a moment to gather his thoughts I thought men were more to your taste

You’re such a droll little fellow Tell me have you married this one yet When he gave her no answer she laughed and said Father will be ever so relieved

His belly felt as if it were full of eels How had she found Shae Had Varys betrayed him Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to the manse Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed

A Lannister always pays his debts she said You’ve been scheming against me since the day you came to King’s Landing You sold Myrcella stole Tommen and now you plot to have Joff killed You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen

Well I can’t say the notion isn’t tempting This is madness Cersei Stannis will be here in days You need me

For what Your great prowess in battle

Bronn’s sellswords will never fight without me he lied

Oh I think they will It’s your gold they love not your impish wit Have no fear though they won’t be without you I won’t say I haven’t thought of slitting your throat from time to time but Jaime would never forgive me if I did

And the whore He would not call her by name If I can convince her Shae means nothing to me perhaps…

She’ll be treated gently enough so long as no harm comes to my sons If Joff should be killed however or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies your little cunt will die more painfully than you can possibly imagine

She truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew The boys are safe he promised her wearily Gods be good Cersei they’re my own blood What sort of man do you take me for

A small and twisted one

Tyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of his wine cup What would Jaime do in my place Kill the bitch most likely and worry about the consequences afterward But Tyrion did not have a golden sword nor the skill to wield one He loved his brother’s reckless wrath but it was their lord father he must try and emulate Stone I must be stone I must be Casterly Rock hard and unmovable If I fail this test I had as lief seek out the nearest grotesquerie For all I know you’ve killed her already he said

Would you like to see her I thought you might Cersei crossed the room and threw open the heavy oaken door Bring in my brother’s whore

Ser Osmund’s brothers Osney and Osfryd were peas from the same pod tall men with hooked noses dark hair and cruel smiles She hung between them eyes wide and white in her dark face Blood trickled from her broken lip and he could see bruises through her torn clothing Her hands were bound with rope and they’d gagged her so she could not speak

You said she wouldn’t be hurt

She fought Unlike his brothers Osney Kettleblack was clean-shaven so the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks Got claws like a shadowcat this one

Bruises heal said Cersei in a bored tone The whore will live So long as Joff does

Tyrion wanted to laugh at her It would have been so sweet so very very sweet but it would have given the game away You’ve lost Cersei and the Kettleblacks are even bigger fools than Bronn claimed All he needed to do was say the words

Instead he looked at the girl’s face and said You swear you’ll release her after the battle

If you release Tommen yes

He pushed himself to his feet Keep her then but keep her safe If these animals think they can use her… well sweet sister let me point out that a scale tips two ways His tone was calm flat uncaring he’d reached for his father’s voice and found it Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well and that includes the beatings and rapes If she thinks me such a monster I’ll play the part for her

Cersei had not expected that You would not dare

Tyrion made himself smile slow and cold Green and black his eyes laughed at her Dare I’ll do it myself

His sister’s hand flashed at his face but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she cried out Osfryd moved to her rescue One more step and I’ll break her arm the dwarf warned him The man stopped You remember when I said you’d never hit me again Cersei He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks Untie her and remove that gag

The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands She cried out in pain as the circulation returned Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned Sweetling he said you must be brave I am sorry they hurt you

I know you’ll free me my lord

I will he promised and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow Her broken lips left a smear of blood on his forehead A bloody kiss is more than I deserve Tyrion thought She would never have been hurt but for me

Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen I have never liked you Cersei but you were my own sister so I never did you harm You’ve ended that I will hurt you for this I don’t know how yet but give me time A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you’ll know the debt is paid In war his father had told him once the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees No matter that they’re as numerous as they were a moment before still armed and armored once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again So it was with Cersei Get out was all the answer she could summon Get out of my sight

Tyrion bowed Good night then And pleasant dreams

He made his way back to the Tower of the Hand with a thousand armored feet marching through his skull I ought to have seen this coming the first time I slipped through the back of Chataya’s wardrobe Perhaps he had not wanted to see His legs were aching badly by the time he had made the climb He sent Pod for a flagon of wine and pushed his way into his bedchamber

Shae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of her breasts a chain of linked golden hands each clasping the next

Tyrion had not expected her What are you doing here

Laughing she stroked the chain I wanted some hands on my titties… but these little gold ones are cold

For a moment he did know what to say How could he tell her that another woman had taken the beating meant for her and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey He wiped Alayaya’s blood from his brow with the heel of his hand The Lady Lollys—

She’s asleep Sleep’s all she ever wants to do the great cow She sleeps and she eats Sometimes she falls asleep while she’s eating The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in it and I have to clean her She made a disgusted face All they did was fuck her

Her mother says she’s sick

She has a baby in her belly that’s all

Tyrion gazed around the room Everything seemed much as he left it How did you enter Show me the hidden door

She gave a shrug Lord Varys made me wear a hood I couldn’t see except… there was one place I got a peep at the floor out the bottom of the hood It was all tiles you know the kind that make a picture

A mosaic

Shae nodded They were colored red and black I think the picture was a dragon Otherwise everything was dark We went down a ladder and walked a long ways until I was all twisted around Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate I brushed against it when we went through The dragon was past the gate Then we went up another ladder with a tunnel at the top I had to stoop and I think Lord Varys was crawling

Tyrion made a round of the bedchamber One of the sconces looked loose He stood on his toes and tried to turn it It revolved slowly scraping against the stone wall When it was upside down the stub of the candle fell out The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor did not show any particular disturbance Doesn’t m’lord want to bed me asked Shae

In a moment Tyrion threw open his wardrobe shoved the clothing aside and pushed against the rear panel What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well… but no the wood was solid unyielding A stone beside the window seat drew his eye but all his tugging and prodding went for naught He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed

Shae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck Your shoulders feel as hard as rocks she murmured Hurry I want to feel you inside me Yet as her legs locked around his waist his manhood left him When she felt him go soft Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in her mouth but even that could not rouse him

After a few moments he stopped her What’s wrong she asked All the sweet innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face

Innocence Fool she’s a whore Cersei was right you think with your cock fool fool

Just go to sleep sweetling he urged stroking her hair Yet long after Shae had taken his advice Tyrion himself still lay awake his fingers cupped over one small breast as he listened to her breathing
