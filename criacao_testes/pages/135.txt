Behold the king’s justice Lysa Arryn said Torch flames fluttered like pennons along the walls and here and there the odd torch guttered out

Lysa I think this unwise Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall

Her sister ignored her You want a trial my lord of Lannister Very well a trial you shall have My son will listen to whatever you care to say and you shall hear his judgment Then you may leave… by one door or the other

She looked so pleased with herself Tyrion thought and small wonder How could a trial threaten her when her weakling son was the lord judge Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door Mother I want to see him fly the boy had said How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already

I thank you my good lady but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert Tyrion said politely The gods know the truth of my innocence I will have their verdict not the judgment of men I demand trial by combat

A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns Lord Nestor Royce snorted Ser Willis chuckled Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door

Lysa Arryn’s watery blue eyes looked uncertain He had caught her off balance You have that right to be sure

The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one knee My lady I beg the boon of championing your cause

The honor should be mine old Lord Hunter said For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death

My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale Ser Albar Royce boomed Let me serve his son in this

The gods favor the man with the just cause said Ser Lyn Corbray yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword We all know who that is He smiled modestly

A dozen other men all spoke at once clamoring to be heard Tyrion found it disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill him Perhaps this had not been such a clever plan after all

Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence I thank you my lords as I know my son would thank you if he were among us No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale Would that I could grant you all this honor Yet I can choose only one She gestured Ser Vardis Egen you were ever my lord husband’s good right hand You shall be our champion

Ser Vardis had been singularly silent My lady he said gravely sinking to one knee pray give this burden to another I have no taste for it The man is no warrior Look at him A dwarf half my size and lame in the legs It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice

Oh excellent Tyrion thought I agree

Lysa glared at him You demanded a trial by combat

And now I demand a champion such as you have chosen for yourself My brother Jaime will gladly take my part I know

Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here snapped Lysa Arryn

Send a bird for him I will gladly await his arrival

You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow

Singer Tyrion said turning to Marillion when you make a ballad of this be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight

I deny you nothing Lysa Arryn said her voice peeved and shrill with irritation Name your champion Imp… if you think you can find a man to die for you

If it is all the same to you I’d sooner find one to kill for me Tyrion looked over the long hall No one moved For a long moment he wondered if it had all been a colossal blunder

Then there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber I’ll stand for the dwarf Bronn called out
