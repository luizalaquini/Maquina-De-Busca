The Gates of the Moon her uncle said as the party drew rein His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse Lord Nestor’s seat He should be expecting us Look up

Catelyn raised her eyes up and up and up At first all she saw was stone and trees the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night as black as a starless sky Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them a tower keep built upon the steep side of the mountain its lights like orange eyes staring down from above Above that was another higher and more distant and still higher a third no more than a flickering spark in the sky And finally up where the falcons soared a flash of white in the moonlight Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers so far above

The Eyrie she heard Marillion murmur awed

The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in The Arryns must not be overfond of company If you’re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark I’d rather you kill me here

We’ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow Brynden told him

I can scarcely wait the dwarf replied How do we get up there I’ve no experience at riding goats

Mules Brynden said smiling

There are steps carved into the mountain Catelyn said Ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn

Her uncle nodded It is too dark to see them but the steps are there Too steep and narrow for horses but mules can manage them most of the way The path is guarded by three waycastles Stone and Snow and Sky The mules will take us as far up as Sky

Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully And beyond that

Brynden smiled Beyond that the path is too steep even for mules We ascend on foot the rest of the way Or perchance you’d prefer to ride a basket The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below If you prefer my lord of Lannister I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples

The dwarf gave a bark of laughter Would that I were a pumpkin he said Alas my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips If you ascend on foot I fear I must do the same We Lannisters do have a certain pride

Pride Catelyn snapped His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry Arrogance some might call it Arrogance and avarice and lust for power

My brother is undoubtedly arrogant Tyrion Lannister replied My father is the soul of avarice and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath I however am innocent as a little lamb Shall I bleat for you He grinned

The drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply and they heard the sound of oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to light their way and her uncle led them across the moat Lord Nestor Royce High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon was waiting in the yard to greet them surrounded by his knights Lady Stark he said bowing He was a massive barrel-chested man and his bow was clumsy

Catelyn dismounted to stand before him Lord Nestor she said She knew the man only by reputation Bronze Yohn’s cousin from a lesser branch of House Royce yet still a formidable lord in his own right We have had a long and tiring journey I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight if I might

My roof is yours my lady Lord Nestor returned gruffly but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie She wishes to see you at once The rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light

Her uncle swung off his horse What madness is this he said bluntly Brynden Tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words A night ascent with the moon not even full Even Lysa should know that’s an invitation to a broken neck

The mules know the way Ser Brynden A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years stepped up beside Lord Nestor Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail She bowed to Catelyn more gracefully than her lord I promise you my lady no harm will come to you It would be my honor to take you up I’ve made the dark climb a hundred times Mychel says my father must have been a goat

She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile Do you have a name child

Mya Stone if it please you my lady the girl said

It did not please her it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face Stone was a bastard’s name in the Vale as Snow was in the north and Flowers in Highgarden in each of the Seven Kingdoms custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no names of their own Catelyn had nothing against this girl but suddenly she could not help but think of Ned’s bastard on the Wall and the thought made her angry and guilty both at once She struggled to find words for a reply

Lord Nestor filled the silence Mya’s a clever girl and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa I believe her She has not failed me yet

Then I put myself in your hands Mya Stone Catelyn said Lord Nestor I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner

And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon before he dies of hunger Lannister said A girl would be pleasant as well but I suppose that’s too much to ask of you The sellsword Bronn laughed aloud

Lord Nestor ignored the banter As you say my lady so it will be done Only then did he look at the dwarf See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell and bring him meat and mead

Catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off then followed the bastard girl through the castle Two mules were waiting in the upper bailey saddled and ready Mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce and the mountain like a black wall but the steps were there chiseled deep into the rock ascending into the sky Some people find it easier if they close their eyes Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood When they get frightened or dizzy sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight They don’t like that

I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark Catelyn said I do not frighten easily Do you plan to light a torch The steps were black as pitch

The girl made a face Torches just blind you On a clear night like this the moon and the stars are enough Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl She mounted and urged her mule up the first step Catelyn’s animal followed of its own accord

You mentioned Mychel before Catelyn said The mules set the pace slow but steady She was perfectly content with that

Mychel’s my love Mya explained Mychel Redfort He’s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray We’re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight next year or the year after

She sounded so like Sansa so happy and innocent with her dreams Catelyn smiled but the smile was tinged with sadness The Redforts were an old name in the Vale she knew with the blood of the First Men in their veins His love she might be but no Redfort would ever wed a bastard His family would arrange a more suitable match for him to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the Vale If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all it would be on the wrong side of the sheet

The ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope The trees pressed close leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon so it seemed as though they were moving up a long black tunnel But the mules were surefooted and tireless and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes They plodded upward winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock The quiet soothed her and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle Before long she was fighting sleep

Perhaps she did doze for a moment for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them Stone Mya announced cheerily dismounting Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls and two fat round towers overtopped the keep The gate swung open at Mya’s shout Inside the portly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions still hot from the spit Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was She ate standing in the yard as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak but she was too famished to care

Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight The second part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn The trail was steeper the steps more worn and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path You don’t want your mule to break a leg up here she said Catelyn was forced to agree She could feel the altitude more now The trees were sparser up here and the wind blew more vigorously sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves and she could see Stone below them and the Gates of the Moon farther down its torches no brighter than candles

Snow was smaller than Stone a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock Yet it nestled against the Giant’s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above The commander an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire but Mya declined We ought to keep going my lady she said If it please you Catelyn nodded

Again they were given fresh mules Hers was white Mya smiled when she saw him Whitey’s a good one my lady Sure of foot even on ice but you need to be careful He’ll kick if he doesn’t like you

The white mule seemed to like Catelyn there was no kicking thank the gods There was no ice either and she was grateful for that as well My mother says that hundreds of years ago this was where the snow began Mya told her It was always white above here and the ice never melted She shrugged I can’t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain but maybe it was that way once in the olden times

So young Catelyn thought trying to remember if she had ever been like that The girl had lived half her life in summer and that was all she knew Winter is coming child she wanted to tell her The words were on her lips she almost said them Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last

Above Snow the wind was a living thing howling around them like a wolf in the waste then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency The stars seemed brighter up here so close that she could almost touch them and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky As they climbed Catelyn found it was better to look up than down The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock Mya dismounted It’s best to lead the mules over she said The wind can be a little scary here my lady

Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead twenty feet long and close to three feet wide but with a precipitous drop to either side She could hear the wind shrieking Mya stepped lightly out her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing a bailey It was her turn Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws She could feel the emptiness the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her She stopped trembling afraid to move The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak trying to pull her over the edge Catelyn edged her foot backward the most timid of steps but the mule was behind her and she could not retreat I am going to die here she thought She could feel cold sweat trickling down her back

Lady Stark Mya called across the gulf The girl sounded a thousand leagues away Are you well

Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride I… I cannot do this child she called out

Yes you can the bastard girl said I know you can Look how wide the path is

I don’t want to look The world seemed to be spinning around her mountain and sky and mules whirling like a child’s top Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing

I’ll come back for you Mya said Don’t move my lady

Moving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do She listened to the skirling of the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone Then Mya was there taking her gently by the arm Keep your eyes closed if you like Let go of the rope now Whitey will take care of himself Very good my lady I’ll lead you over it’s easy you’ll see Give me a step now That’s it move your foot just slide it forward See Now another Easy You could run across Another one go on Yes And so foot by foot step by step the bastard girl led Catelyn across blind and trembling while the white mule followed placidly behind them

The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain but even the topless towers of Valyria could not have looked more beautiful to Catelyn Stark Here at last the snow crown began Sky’s weathered stones were rimed with frost and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above

Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards and the gates opened before them Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all sizes No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them The stables and barracks are in there Mya said The last part is inside the mountain It can be a little dark but at least you’re out of the wind This is as far as the mules can go Past here well it’s a sort of chimney more like a stone ladder than proper steps but it’s not too bad Another hour and we’ll be there

Catelyn looked up Directly overhead pale in the dawn light she could see the foundations of the Eyrie It could not be more than six hundred feet above them From below it looked like a small white honeycomb She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches The Lannisters may have their pride she told Mya but the Tullys are born with better sense I have ridden all day and the best part of a night Tell them to lower a basket I shall ride with the turnips
