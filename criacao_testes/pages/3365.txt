interpretation King of righteousness and after that also King of
Salem which is King of peace 73 Without father without mother
without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life
but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually

74 Now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch
Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils

75 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the
office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the
people according to the law that is of their brethren though they
come out of the loins of Abraham 76 But he whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had
the promises

77 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better

78 And here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth

79 And as I may so say Levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes
in Abraham

710 For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met
him

711 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood for
under it the people received the law what further need was there
that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec and
not be called after the order of Aaron  712 For the priesthood being
changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law

713 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar

714 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda of which
tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood

715 And it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of
Melchisedec there ariseth another priest 716 Who is made not after
the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless
life

717 For he testifieth Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedec

718 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof

719 For the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better
hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God

720 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest 721 For
those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him
that said unto him The Lord sware and will not repent Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec 722 By so much was
Jesus made a surety of a better testament

723 And they truly were many priests because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death 724 But this man because he
continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood

725 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them

726 For such an high priest became us who is holy harmless
undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
727 Who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up
sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this
he did once when he offered up himself

728 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the
word of the oath which was since the law maketh the Son who is
consecrated for evermore

81 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum We have
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens 82 A minister of the sanctuary and of the
true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man

83 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to
offer

84 For if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that
there are priests that offer gifts according to the law 85 Who serve
unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as Moses was
admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle for See
saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to
thee in the mount

86 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established
upon better promises

87 For if that first covenant had been faultless then should no
place have been sought for the second

88 For finding fault with them he saith Behold the days come
saith the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of
