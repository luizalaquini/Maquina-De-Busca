Do you know him asked Petyr

No

Look closer

She studied the old man’s lined windburnt face hook nose white hair and huge knuckly hands There was something familiar about him yet Sansa had to shake her head I don’t I never saw Oswell before I got into his boat I’m certain

Oswell grinned showing a mouth of crooked teeth No but m’lady might of met my three sons

It was the three sons and that smile too Kettleblack Sansa’s eyes went wide You’re a Kettleblack

Aye m’lady as it please you

She’s beside herself with joy Lord Petyr dismissed him with a wave and returned to the pomegranate again as Oswell shuffled down the steps Tell me Alayne—which is more dangerous the dagger brandished by an enemy or the hidden one pressed to your back by someone you never even see

The hidden dagger

There’s a clever girl He smiled his thin lips bright red from the pomegranate seeds When the Imp sent off her guards the queen had Ser Lancel hire sellswords for her Lancel found her the Kettleblacks which delighted your little lord husband since the lads were in his pay through his man Bronn He chuckled But it was me who told Oswell to get his sons to King’s Landing when I learned that Bronn was looking for swords Three hidden daggers Alayne now perfectly placed

So one of the Kettleblacks put the poison in Joff’s cup Ser Osmund had been near the king all night she remembered

Did I say that Lord Petyr cut the blood orange in two with his dagger and offered half to Sansa The lads are far too treacherous to be part of any such scheme    and Osmund has become especially unreliable since he joined the Kingsguard That white cloak does things to a man I find Even a man like him He tilted his chin back and squeezed the blood orange so the juice ran down into his mouth I love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers he complained wiping his hands Clean hands Sansa Whatever you do make certain your hands are clean

Sansa spooned up some juice from her own orange But if it wasn’t the Kettleblacks and it wasn’t Ser Dontos    you weren’t even in the city and it couldn’t have been Tyrion   

No more guesses sweetling

She shook her head I don’t   

Petyr smiled I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net was crooked and straightened it for you

Sansa raised a hand to her mouth You cannot mean    she wanted to take me to Highgarden to marry me to her grandson   

Gentle pious good-hearted Willas Tyrell Be grateful you were spared he would have bored you spitless The old woman is not boring though I’ll grant her that A fearsome old harridan and not near as frail as she pretends When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery’s hand she let her lord son bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey’s nature I praised him to the skies to be sure    whilst my men spread disturbing tales amongst Lord Tyrell’s servants That is how the game is played

I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white Not that I suggested it that would have been too crude But men in my party supplied grisly tales about how the mob had killed Ser Preston Greenfield and raped the Lady Lollys and slipped a few silvers to Lord Tyrell’s army of singers to sing of Ryam Redwyne Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight A harp can be as dangerous as a sword in the right hands

Mace Tyrell actually thought it was his own idea to make Ser Loras’s inclusion in the Kingsguard part of the marriage contract Who better to protect his daughter than her splendid knightly brother And it relieved him of the difficult task of trying to find lands and a bride for a third son never easy and doubly difficult in Ser Loras’s case

Be that as it may Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm her precious darling granddaughter but unlike her son she also realized that under all his flowers and finery Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as Jaime Lannister Toss Joffrey Margaery and Loras in a pot and you’ve got the makings for kingslayer stew The old woman understood something else as well Her son was determined to make Margaery a queen and for that he needed a king    but he did not need Joffrey We shall have another wedding soon wait and see Margaery will marry Tommen She’ll keep her queenly crown and her maidenhead neither of which she especially wants but what does that matter The great western alliance will be preserved    for a time at least

Margaery and Tommen Sansa did not know what to say She had liked Margaery Tyrell and her small sharp grandmother as well She thought wistfully of Highgarden with its courtyards and musicians and the pleasure barges on the Mander a far cry from this bleak shore At least I am safe here Joffrey is dead he cannot hurt me anymore and I am only a bastard girl now Alayne Stone has no husband and no claim And her aunt would soon be here as well The long nightmare of King’s Landing was behind her and her mockery of a marriage as well She could make herself a new home here just as Petyr said

It was eight long days until Lysa Arryn arrived On five of them it rained while Sansa sat bored and restless by the fire beside the old blind dog He was too sick and toothless to walk guard with Bryen anymore and mostly all he did was sleep but when she patted him he whined and licked her hand and after that they were fast friends When the rains let up Petyr walked with her around his holdings which took less than half a day He owned a lot of rocks just as he had said There was one place where the tide came jetting up out of a blowhole to shoot thirty feet into the air and another where someone had chiseled the seven-pointed star of the new gods upon a boulder Petyr said that marked one of the places the Andals had landed when they came across the sea to wrest the Vale from the First Men

Farther inland a dozen families lived in huts of piled stone beside a peat bog Mine own smallfolk Petyr said though only the oldest seemed to know him There was a hermit’s cave on his land as well but no hermit He’s dead now but when I was a boy my father took me to see him The man had not washed in forty years so you can imagine how he smelled but supposedly he had the gift of prophecy He groped me a bit and said I would be a great man and for that my father gave him a skin of wine Petyr snorted I would have told him the same thing for half a cup

Finally on a grey windy afternoon Bryen came running back to the tower with his dogs barking at his heels to announce that riders were approaching from the southwest Lysa Lord Petyr said Come Alayne let us greet her

They put on their cloaks and waited outside The riders numbered no more than a score a very modest escort for the Lady of the Eyrie Three maids rode with her and a dozen household knights in mail and plate She brought a septon as well and a handsome singer with a wisp of a mustache and long sandy curls

Could that be my aunt Lady Lysa was two years younger than Mother but this woman looked ten years older Thick auburn tresses fell down past her waist but beneath the costly velvet gown and jeweled bodice her body sagged and bulged Her face was pink and painted her breasts heavy her limbs thick She was taller than Littlefinger and heavier nor did she show any grace in the clumsy way she climbed down off her horse

Petyr knelt to kiss her fingers The king’s small council commanded me to woo and win you my lady Do you think you might have me for your lord and husband

Lady Lysa pooched her lips and pulled him up to plant a kiss upon his cheek Oh mayhaps I could be persuaded She giggled Have you brought gifts to melt my heart

The king’s peace

Oh poo to the peace what else have you brought me

My daughter Littlefinger beckoned Sansa forward with a hand My lady allow me to present you Alayne Stone

Lysa Arryn did not seem greatly pleased to see her Sansa did a deep curtsy her head bowed A bastard she heard her aunt say Petyr have you been wicked Who was her mother

The wench is dead I’d hoped to take Alayne to the Eyrie

What am I to do with her there

I have a few notions said Lord Petyr But just now I am more interested in what I might do with you my lady

All the sternness melted off her aunt’s round pink face and for a moment Sansa thought Lysa Arryn was about to cry Sweet Petyr I’ve missed you so you don’t know you can’t know Yohn Royce has been stirring up all sorts of trouble demanding that I call my banners and go to war And the others all swarm around me Hunter and Corbray and that dreadful Nestor Royce all wanting to wed me and take my son to ward but none of them truly love me Only you Petyr I’ve dreamed of you so long

And I of you my lady He slid an arm around behind her and kissed her on the neck How soon can we be wed

Now said Lady Lysa sighing I’ve brought my own septon and a singer and mead for the wedding feast

Here That did not please him I’d sooner wed you at the Eyrie with your whole court in attendance

Poo to my court I have waited so long I could not bear to wait another moment She put her arms around him I want to share your bed tonight my sweet I want us to make another child a brother for Robert or a sweet little daughter

I dream of that as well sweetling Yet there is much to be gained from a great public wedding with all the Vale—

No She stamped a foot I want you now this very night And I must warn you after all these years of silence and whisperings I mean to scream when you love me I am going to scream so loud they’ll hear me in the Eyrie

Perhaps I could bed you now and wed you later

The Lady Lysa giggled like a girl Oh Petyr Baelish you are so wicked No I say no I am the Lady of the Eyrie and I command you to wed me this very moment

Petyr gave a shrug As my lady commands then I am helpless before you as ever

They said their vows within the hour standing beneath a sky-blue canopy as the sun sank in the west Afterward trestle tables were set up beneath the small flint tower and they feasted on quail venison and roast boar washing it down with a fine light mead Torches were lit as dusk crept in Lysa’s singer played The Vow Unspoken and Seasons of My Love and Two Hearts That Beat as One Several younger knights even asked Sansa to dance Her aunt danced as well her skirts whirling when Petyr spun her in his arms Mead and marriage had taken years off Lady Lysa She laughed at everything so long as she held her husband’s hand and her eyes seemed to glow whenever she looked at him

When it was time for the bedding her knights carried her up to the tower stripping her as they went and shouting bawdy jests Tyrion spared me that Sansa remembered It would not have been so bad being undressed for a man she loved by friends who loved them both By Joffrey though    She shuddered

Her aunt had brought only three ladies with her so they pressed Sansa to help them undress Lord Petyr and march him up to his marriage bed He submitted with good grace and a wicked tongue giving as good as he got By the time they had gotten him into the tower and out of his clothes the other women were flushed with laces unlaced kirtles crooked and skirts in disarray But Littlefinger only smiled at Sansa as they marched him up to the bedchamber where his lady wife was waiting

Lady Lysa and Lord Petyr had the third-story bedchamber to themselves but the tower was small    and true to her word her aunt screamed It had begun to rain outside driving the feasters into the hall one floor below so they heard most every word Petyr her aunt moaned Oh Petyr Petyr sweet Petyr oh oh oh There Petyr there That’s where you belong Lady Lysa’s singer launched into a bawdy version of Milady’s Supper but even his singing and playing could not drown out Lysa’s cries Make me a baby Petyr she screamed make me another sweet little baby Oh Petyr my precious my precious PEEEEEETYR Her last shriek was so loud that it set the dogs to barking and two of her aunt’s ladies could scarce contain their mirth
