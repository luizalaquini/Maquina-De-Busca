I’m certain of nothing but winter and battle he said Come I’m riding with you part of the way

Chataya’s

You know me too well

They left through a postern gate in the north wall Tyrion put his heels into his horse and clattered down Shadowblack Lane A few furtive shapes darted into alleys at the sound of hoofbeats on the cobbles but no one dared accost them The council had extended his curfew it was death to be taken on the streets after the evenfall bells had sung The measure had restored a degree of peace to King’s Landing and quartered the number of corpses found in the alleys of a morning yet Varys said the people cursed him for it They should be thankful they have the breath to curse A pair of gold cloaks confronted them as they were making their way along Coppersmith’s Wynd but when they realized whom they’d challenged they begged the Hand’s pardons and waved them on Bronn turned south for the Mud Gate and they parted company

Tyrion rode on toward Chataya’s but suddenly his patience deserted him He twisted in the saddle scanning the street behind There were no signs of followers Every window was dark or tightly shuttered He heard nothing but the wind swirling down the alleys If Cersei has someone stalking me tonight he must be disguised as a rat Bugger it all he muttered He was sick of caution Wheeling his horse around he dug in his spurs If anyone’s after me we’ll see how well they ride He flew through the moonlight streets clattering over cobbles darting down narrow alleys and up twisty wynds racing to his love

As he hammered on the gate he heard music wafting faintly over the spiked stone walls One of the Ibbenese ushered him inside Tyrion gave the man his horse and said Who is that The diamond-shaped panes of the longhall windows shone with yellow light and he could hear a man singing

The Ibbenese shrugged Fatbelly singer

The sound swelled as he walked from the stable to the house Tyrion had never been fond of singers and he liked this one even less than the run of the breed sight unseen When he pushed open the door the man broke off My lord Hand He knelt balding and kettle-bellied murmuring An honor an honor

M’lord Shae smiled at the sight of him He liked that smile the quick unthinking way it came to her pretty face The girl wore her purple silk belted with a cloth-of-silver sash The colors favored her dark hair and the smooth cream of her skin

Sweetling he called her And who is this

The singer raised his eyes I am called Symon Silver Tongue my lord A player a singer a taleteller—

And a great fool Tyrion finished What did you call me when I entered

Call I only… The silver in Symon’s tongue seemed to have turned to lead My lord Hand I said an honor…

A wiser man would have pretended not to recognize me Not that I would have been fooled but you ought to have tried What am I to do with you now You know of my sweet Shae you know where she dwells you know that I visit by night alone

I swear I’ll tell no one…

On that much we agree Good night to you Tyrion led Shae up the stairs

My singer may never sing again now she teased You’ve scared the voice from him

A little fear will help him reach those high notes

She closed the door to their bedchamber You won’t hurt him will you She lit a scented candle and knelt to pull off his boots His songs cheer me on the nights you don’t come

Would that I could come every night he said as she rubbed his bare feet How well does he sing

Better than some Not so good as others

Tyrion opened her robe and buried his face between her breasts She always smelled clean to him even in this reeking sty of a city Keep him if you like but keep him close I won’t have him wandering the city spreading tales in pot-shops

He won’t— she started

Tyrion covered her mouth with his own He’d had talk enough he needed the sweet simplicity of the pleasure he found between Shae’s thighs Here at least he was welcome wanted

Afterward he eased his arm out from under her head slipped on his tunic and went down to the garden A half-moon silvered the leaves of the fruit trees and shone on the surface of the stone bathing pond Tyrion seated himself beside the water Somewhere off to his right a cricket was chirping a curiously homey sound It is peaceful here he thought but for how long

A whiff of something rank made him turn his head Shae stood in the door behind him dressed in the silvery robe he’d given her I loved a maid as white as winter with moonglow in her hair Behind her stood one of the begging brothers a portly man in filthy patched robes his bare feet crusty with dirt a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a septon would have worn a crystal The smell of him would have gagged a rat

Lord Varys has come to see you Shae announced
