Theyd be stupid not to
Theyve been watching me when I help out in the
hospital Im already taking the medic courses Its just
beginners stuff I know a lot of it from home Still theres
plenty to learn she tells me
Thats great I say Prim a doctor She couldnt even
dream of it in 12 Something small and quiet like a match
being struck lights up the gloom inside me This is the sort
of future a rebellion could bring
What about you Katniss How are you managing
Her fingertip moves in short gentle strokes between
Buttercups eyes And dont say youre fine
Its true Whatever the opposite of fine is thats what I
am So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta his
deterioration on-screen and how I think they must be killing
him at this very moment Buttercup has to rely on himself for
a while because now Prim turns her attention to me Pulling
me closer brushing the hair back behind my ears with her
fingers Ive stopped talking because theres really nothing
left to say and theres this piercing sort of pain where my
heart is Maybe Im even having a heart attack but it doesnt
seem worth mentioning
Katniss I dont think President Snow will kill Peeta
she says Of course she says this its what she thinks will
calm me But her next words come as a surprise If he
does he wont have anyone left you want He wont have
any way to hurt you
Suddenly I am reminded of another girl one who had
seen all the evil the Capitol had to offer Johanna Mason
the tribute from District 7 in the last arena I was trying to
prevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjays
mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured but she
brushed me off saying They cant hurt me Im not like
the rest of you Theres no one left I love
Then I know Prim is right that Snow cannot afford to
waste Peetas life especially now while the Mockingjay
causes so much havoc Hes killed Cinna already
Destroyed my home My family Gale and even Haymitch
are out of his reach Peetas all he has left
So what do you think theyll do to him I ask
Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she
speaks
Whatever it takes to break you
11
What will break me
This is the question that consumes me over the next
three days as we wait to be released from our prison of
safety What will break me into a million pieces so that I am
beyond repair beyond usefulness I mention it to no one
but it devours my waking hours and weaves itself
throughout my nightmares
Four more bunker missiles fall over this period all
massive all very damaging but theres no urgency to the
attack The bombs are spread out over the long hours so
that just when you think the raid is over another blast sends
shock waves through your guts It feels more designed to
keep us in lockdown than to decimate 13 Cripple the
district yes Give the people plenty to do to get the place
running again But destroy it No Coin was right on that
point You dont destroy what you want to acquire in the
future I assume what they really want in the short term is to
stop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off the televisions of
Panem
We receive next to no information about what is
happening Our screens never come on and we get only
brief audio updates from Coin about the nature of the
bombs Certainly the war is still being waged but as to its
status were in the dark
Inside the bunker cooperation is the order of the day
We adhere to a strict schedule for meals and bathing
exercise and sleep Small periods of socialization are
granted to alleviate the tedium Our space becomes very
popular because both children and adults have a
fascination with Buttercup He attains celebrity status with
his evening game of Crazy Cat I created this by accident a
few years ago during a winter blackout You simply wiggle
a flashlight beam around on the floor and Buttercup tries to
catch it Im petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makes
him look stupid Inexplicably everyone here thinks hes
clever and delightful Im even issued a special set of
batteries--an enormous waste--to be used for this purpose
The citizens of 13 are truly starved for entertainment
Its on the third night during our game that I answer the
question eating away at me Crazy Cat becomes a
metaphor for my situation I am Buttercup Peeta the thing I
want so badly to secure is the light As long as Buttercup
feels he has the chance of catching the elusive light under
his paws hes bristling with aggression Thats how Ive
been since I left the arena with Peeta alive When the light
goes out completely Buttercups temporarily distraught and
confused but he recovers and moves on to other things
Thats what would happen if Peeta died But the one thing
that sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the light
on but put it hopelessly out of his reach high on the wall
beyond even his jumping skills He paces below the wall
wails and cant be comforted or distracted Hes useless
until I shut the light off Thats what Snow is trying to do to
me now only I dont know what form his game takes
Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs
Thinking that Peeta was in his possession and being
