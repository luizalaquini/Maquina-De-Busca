representing the trees shown in Figure 92
FC Figure 92
Here N stands for a noun NP for a noun phrase and A for an adjective
These categories appear explicitly as nodes in the tree
In the linearized textual representation they are used to label
brackets which represent the tree structure
An additional piece of information which is needed is the lexical entry for
eraser which would show that it has only one accented
that is potentially stressed syllable namely the second
pp
Consider now how to account for stress in prefixed and
suffixed words and those polysyllabic ones with more than one potential
stress point
For these the morphological structure must appear in the input
pp
Now
ul
morphemes
are well-defined minimal units of grammatical analysis from which a word
may be composed
For example  went = go + ed  is
a morphemic decomposition where ed denotes the
past-tense morpheme
This representation is not particularly suitable for speech synthesis
for the obvious reason that the result bears no phonetic resemblance to
the input
What is needed is a decomposition into
ul
morphs
which occur only when the lexical or phonetic representation of a word may
easily be segmented into parts
Thus  wanting = want + ing  and  bigger = big + er  are
simultaneously morphic and morphemic decompositions
Notice that in the second example a rule about final consonant doubling has
been applied at the lexical level although it is not needed in
a phonetic representation  this comes into the sphere
of easy segmentation
Contrast this with  went = go + ed  which
is certainly not an easy segmentation and hence a
morphemic but not a morphic decomposition
But between these extremes there are some difficult
cases  specific = specify + ic  is probably morphic
as well as morphemic but it is not clear
that  galactic = galaxy + ic  is

Assuming that the input is given as a derivation tree with morphological
structure made explicit Chomsky and Halle present rules which assign stress
correctly in nearly all cases  For example their rules give

There are two rules which account for the word-level stress
on such examples  the main stress
rule and the alternating stress rule
In essence the main stress rule emphasizes the last strong syllable
of a stem
A syllable is strong either if it contains one of a class of so-called
long vowels or if there is a cluster of two or more consonants
following the vowel otherwise it is weak
If you are exceptionally observant you will notice that this strongemweak
distinction has been used before when discussing the rhythm of feet in
syllables  Thus the verb torment receives stress on the second syllable
for it is a strong one
A noun like torment is treated as being derived from the corresponding verb
and the rule assigns stress to the verb first and then modifies it for the noun
The second alternating stress rule gives some stress to alternate
syllables of polysyllabic words like formc

It is quite easy to incorporate the word-level rules into a computer
program which uses feet rather than stress levels as the basis for prosodic
description
A foot boundary is simply placed before the primary-stressed level-1 syllable
except for function words which do not begin a foot
The other stress levels should be ignored
except that for slow deliberate speech secondary level-2 stress is
mapped into a foot boundary too if it precedes the primary stress
There is also a rule which reduces vowels in unstressed
