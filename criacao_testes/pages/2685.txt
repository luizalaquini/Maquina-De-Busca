1934 And Barzillai said unto the king How long have I to live that
I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem  1935 I am this day
fourscore years old and can I discern between good and evil can thy
servant taste what I eat or what I drink can I hear any more the
voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king  1936 Thy servant will
go a little way over Jordan with the king and why should the king
recompense it me with such a reward  1937 Let thy servant I pray
thee turn back again that I may die in mine own city and be buried
by the grave of my father and of my mother But behold thy servant
Chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what
shall seem good unto thee

1938 And the king answered Chimham shall go over with me and I will
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou
shalt require of me that will I do for thee

1939 And all the people went over Jordan And when the king was come
over the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto
his own place

1940 Then the king went on to Gilgal and Chimham went on with him
and all the people of Judah conducted the king and also half the
people of Israel

1941 And behold all the men of Israel came to the king and said
unto the king Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee
away and have brought the king and his household and all Davids
men with him over Jordan  1942 And all the men of Judah answered
the men of Israel Because the king is near of kin to us wherefore
then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings
cost or hath he given us any gift  1943 And the men of Israel
answered the men of Judah and said We have ten parts in the king
and we have also more right in David than ye why then did ye despise
us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king
And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
men of Israel

201 And there happened to be there a man of Belial whose name was
Sheba the son of Bichri a Benjamite and he blew a trumpet and
said We have no part in David neither have we inheritance in the son
of Jesse every man to his tents O Israel

202 So every man of Israel went up from after David and followed
Sheba the son of Bichri but the men of Judah clave unto their king
from Jordan even to Jerusalem

203 And David came to his house at Jerusalem and the king took the
ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put
them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them So they were
shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood

204 Then said the king to Amasa Assemble me the men of Judah within
three days and be thou here present

205 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah but he tarried longer
than the set time which he had appointed him

206 And David said to Abishai Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do
us more harm than did Absalom take thou thy lords servants and
pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us

207 And there went out after him Joabs men and the Cherethites and
the Pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of
Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri

208 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon Amasa went
before them And Joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto
him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the
sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out

209 And Joab said to Amasa Art thou in health my brother And Joab
took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him

2010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joabs hand so
he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to
the ground and struck him not again and he died So Joab and Abishai
his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri

2011 And one of Joabs men stood by him and said He that favoureth
Joab and he that is for David let him go after Joab

2012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway And
when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed Amasa out
of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw
that every one that came by him stood still

2013 When he was removed out of the highway all the people went on
after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri

2014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel and to
Bethmaachah and all the Berites and they were gathered together and
went also after him

2015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah and they
cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all
the people that were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down

2016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city Hear hear say I pray
