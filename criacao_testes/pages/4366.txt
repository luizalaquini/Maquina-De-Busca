contours of originals A and B were quite different
and in these cases it was immediately obvious to the ear that two of
the four utterances shared the same intonation
which was different to that shared by the other two
pp
Experienced researchers in speech analysis-synthesis served as
judges
In order to make the test as stringent as possible it was explained
to them exactly what had been done
except that the order of the utterances in each quadruple was kept secret
They were asked to identify which two of the four sentences did not have their
original contours
and were allowed to listen to each quadruple as often as they liked
On occasion they were prepared to identify only one or even none
of the sentences as artificial
pp
The result was that an utterance with pitch transferred
from another lexically identical one is indistinguishable from
a resynthesized version of the original even to a skilled ear
To be more precise this hypothesis
could not be rejected even at the 1 level of statistical significance  This
gave confidence in the transfer procedure
However one particular judge was quite successful at identifying the bogus contours
and he attributed his success to the fact that
on occasion the segmental durations did not accord with the
pitch contour
This casts a shadow of suspicion on the linear stretching and
squashing mechanism

The second experiment examined pitch transfers between utterances having only one variable part
each the price is  cents to test the transfer
method under relatively controlled conditions
Ten sentences of the form
LB
The price is em cents
LE
were selected to cover
a wide range of syllable structures
Each one was regenerated with pitch transferred from each of
the other nine
and these nine versions were paired with the original resynthesized
with its natural pitch
The 10 times 9=90 resulting pairs were recorded on tape in random order
pp
Five males and five females with widely differing occupations
secretaries teachers academics and students served as judges
Written instructions explained that the tape contained pairs of
sentences which were lexically identical but had a slight difference
in tone of voice and that the subjects were to judge which of
each pair sounded most natural and intelligible  The
response form gave the price associated with each pair em
a preliminary experiment had shown that there was never
any difficulty in identifying this em and a column for decision
With each decision the subjects recorded their confidence in the decision
Subjects could rest at any time during the test which lasted for about
30 minutes but they were not permitted to hear any pair a second time
pp
Defining a success to be a choice of the utterance with
natural pitch as the best of a pair
the overall success rate was about 60
If choices were random one would of course expect only a 50 success rate
and the figure obtained was significantly different from this
Almost half the choices were correct and made with high confidence
high-confidence but incorrect choices accounted for a quarter of the
judgements
pp
To investigate structural effects in the pitch transfer process
low confidence decisions were ignored to eliminate noise and the others
lumped together and tabulated by source and target utterance
The number of stressed and unstressed syllables does not appear to play
an important part in determining whether a particular utterance is an
easy target
For example it proved to be particularly difficult to tell

In fact the results showed no better than random discrimination for them
even though the decisions in which listeners expressed little confidence
had been discarded
Hence it seems that the syllable alignment procedure and the policy
of replication were successful

The worst target scores were for utterances 011 and 079

Both of these contained large unbroken voiced periods
in the variable part em almost twice as long as the next longest
voiced period
The first has an unstressed syllable followed by
a stressed one with no break in voicing
involving in a natural contour
a fast but continuous climb in pitch over the juncture
