answer and say So shall it be done unto that man that will not build
up his brothers house

2510 And his name shall be called in Israel The house of him that
hath his shoe loosed

2511 When men strive together one with another and the wife of the
one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him
that smiteth him and putteth forth her hand and taketh him by the
secrets 2512 Then thou shalt cut off her hand thine eye shall not
pity her

2513 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a
small

2514 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures a great and
a small

2515 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and
just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee

2516 For all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are
an abomination unto the LORD thy God

2517 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come
forth out of Egypt 2518 How he met thee by the way and smote the
hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou
wast faint and weary and he feared not God

2519 Therefore it shall be when the LORD thy God hath given thee
rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the LORD
thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt
blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven thou shalt not
forget it

261 And it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the
LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance and possessest it and
dwellest therein 262 That thou shalt take of the first of all the
fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD
thy God giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto
the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there

263 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days
and say unto him I profess this day unto the LORD thy God that I am
come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to
give us

264 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set
it down before the altar of the LORD thy God

265 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God A Syrian
ready to perish was my father and he went down into Egypt and
sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty
and populous 266 And the Egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted
us and laid upon us hard bondage 267 And when we cried unto the
LORD God of our fathers the LORD heard our voice and looked on our
affliction and our labour and our oppression 268 And the LORD
brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an
outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and
with wonders 269 And he hath brought us into this place and hath
given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honey

2610 And now behold I have brought the firstfruits of the land
which thou O LORD hast given me And thou shalt set it before the
LORD thy God and worship before the LORD thy God 2611 And thou
shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given
unto thee and unto thine house thou and the Levite and the
stranger that is among you

2612 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given
it unto the Levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that
they may eat within thy gates and be filled 2613 Then thou shalt
say before the LORD thy God I have brought away the hallowed things
out of mine house and also have given them unto the Levite and unto
the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all
thy commandments which thou hast commanded me I have not transgressed
thy commandments neither have I forgotten them

2614 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have I taken
away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for
the dead but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God and
have done according to all that thou hast commanded me

2615 Look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy
people Israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest
unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honey

2616 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all
thine heart and with all thy soul

2617 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God and to walk
in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his
judgments and to hearken unto his voice 2618 And the LORD hath
avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised
thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments 2619 And to
make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in
name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the
