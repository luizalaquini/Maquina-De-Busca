She stuck him with the pointy end driving the blade upward with a wild hysterical strength

Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder blades The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise something between a gasp and a sigh His hands closed around the blade Oh gods he moaned as his undertunic began to redden Take it out

When she took it out he died

The horses were screaming Arya stood over the body still and frightened in the face of death Blood had gushed from the boy’s mouth as he collapsed and more was seeping from the slit in his belly pooling beneath his body His palms were cut where he’d grabbed at the blade She backed away slowly Needle red in her hand She had to get away someplace far from here someplace safe away from the stableboy’s accusing eyes

She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare but as she lifted the saddle to the horse’s back Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed Even the postern doors would likely be guarded Maybe the guards wouldn’t recognize her If they thought she was a boy perhaps they’d let her… no they’d have orders not to let anyone out it wouldn’t matter whether they knew her or not

But there was another way out of the castle…

The saddle slipped from Arya’s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust Could she find the room with the monsters again She wasn’t certain yet she knew she had to try

She found the clothing she’d gathered and slipped into the cloak concealing Needle beneath its folds The rest of her things she tied in a roll With the bundle under her arm she crept to the far end of the stable Unlatching the back door she peeked out anxiously She could hear the distant sound of swordplay and the shivery wail of a man screaming in pain across the bailey She would need to go down the serpentine steps past the small kitchen and the pig yard that was how she’d gone last time chasing the black tomcat… only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks She couldn’t go that way Arya tried to think of another way If she crossed to the other side of the castle she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood… but first she’d have to cross the yard in the plain view of the guards on the walls

She had never seen so many men on the walls Gold cloaks most of them armed with spears Some of them knew her by sight What would they do if they saw her running across the yard She’d look so small from up there would they be able to tell who she was Would they care

She had to leave now she told herself but when the moment came she was too frightened to move

Calm as still water a small voice whispered in her ear Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle She looked around wildly but there was no one in the stable but her and the horses and the dead men

Quiet as a shadow she heard Was it her own voice or Syrio’s She could not tell yet somehow it calmed her fears

She stepped out of the stable

It was the scariest thing she’d ever done She wanted to run and hide but she made herself walk across the yard slowly putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone She thought she could feel their eyes like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes Arya never looked up If she saw them watching all her courage would desert her she knew and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby and then they would have her She kept her gaze on the ground By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the yard Arya was cold with sweat but no one had raised the hue and cry

The sept was open and empty Inside half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence Arya figured the gods would never miss two She stuffed them up her sleeves and left by a back window Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-eared tom was easy but after that she got lost She crawled in and out of windows hopped over walls and felt her way through dark cellars quiet as a shadow Once she heard a woman weeping It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited

She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle That was chancy the fire she’d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle she went out the window as they were coming in the door without ever getting a glimpse of who it was

This time the monsters did not frighten her They seemed almost old friends Arya held the candle over her head With each step she took the shadows moved against the walls as if they were turning to watch her pass Dragons she whispered She slid Needle out from under her cloak The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand

The long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered She held Needle in her left hand her sword hand the candle in her right fist Hot wax ran down across her knuckles The entrance to the well had been to the left so Arya went right Part of her wanted to run but she was afraid of snuffing out her candle She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light but rats did not scare her Other things did It would be so easy to hide here as she had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard She could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where Needle had cut him He might be waiting to grab her as she passed He would see her candle coming a long way off Maybe she would be better off without the light…

Fear cuts deeper than swords the quiet voice inside her whispered Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell They were a lot scarier than this place she told herself She’d been just a little girl the first time she saw them Her brother Robb had taken them down her and Sansa and baby Bran who’d been no bigger than Rickon was now They’d only had one candle between them and Bran’s eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter with their wolves at their feet and their iron swords across their laps

Robb took them all the way down to the end past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna to show them their own tombs Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle anxious that it might go out Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here and rats as big as dogs Robb smiled when she said that There are worse things than spiders and rats he whispered This is where the dead walk That was when they heard the sound low and deep and shivery Baby Bran had clutched at Arya’s hand

When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb pale white and moaning for blood Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs and Bran wrapped himself around Robb’s leg sobbing Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch It was only Jon covered with flour You stupid she told him you scared the baby but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too

The memory made Arya smile and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her The stableboy was dead she’d killed him and if he jumped out at her she’d kill him again She was going home Everything would be better once she was home again safe behind Winterfell’s grey granite walls

Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness





SANSA

They came for Sansa on the third day

She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants Jeyne Poole had been confined with her but Jeyne was useless Her face was puffy from all her crying and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father

I’m certain your father is well Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right I’ll ask the queen to let you see him She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne’s spirits but the other girl just looked at her with red swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder She was such a child

Sansa had wept too the first day Even within the stout walls of Maegor’s Holdfast with her door closed and barred it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world She heard it as she had never heard it before and there were other sounds as well grunts of pain angry curses shouts for help and the moans of wounded and dying men In the songs the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy

So she wept pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening calling for her father for Septa Mordane for the king for her gallant prince If the men guarding her heard her pleas they gave no answer The only time the door opened was late that night when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside bruised and shaking They’re killing everyone the steward’s daughter had shrieked at her She went on and on The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer she said There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand and the steps were slick with blood Sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend They went to sleep in the same bed cradled in each other’s arms like sisters

The second day was even worse The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the highest tower of Maegor’s Holdfast From its window she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to hand The fighting was over and the silence of the grave had settled over the Red Keep The only sounds were Jeyne Poole’s endless whimpers and sobs

They were fed—hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast roast chicken and greens at midday and a late supper of beef and barley stew—but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa’s questions That evening some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand and some of Jeyne’s things as well but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne and when she tried to talk to them they fled from her as if she had the grey plague The guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room

Please I need to speak to the queen again Sansa told them as she told everyone she saw that day She’ll want to talk to me I know she will Tell her I want to see her please If not the queen then Prince Joffrey if you’d be so kind We’re to marry when we’re older

At sunset on the second day a great bell began to ring Its voice was deep and sonorous and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread The ringing went on and on and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill The sound rumbled across the city like thunder warning of the storm to come

What is it Jeyne asked covering her ears Why are they ringing the bells

The king is dead Sansa could not say how she knew it yet she did The slow endless clanging filled their room as mournful as a dirge Had some enemy stormed the castle and murdered King Robert Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard

She went to sleep wondering restless and fearful Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now Or had they killed him too She was afraid for him and for her father If only they would tell her what was happening…

That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven gold She had a crown on her head and everyone she had ever known came before her to bend the knee and say their courtesies

The next morning the morning of the third day Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her to the queen

Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short bandy legs His nose was flat his cheeks baggy with jowls his hair grey and brittle Today he wore white velvet and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch The beast had the soft sheen of gold and his eyes were tiny rubies You look very handsome and splendid this morning Ser Boros Sansa told him A lady remembered her courtesies and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what

And you my lady Ser Boros said in a flat voice Her Grace awaits Come with me

There were guards outside her door Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past To keep you safe my sweet one Queen Cersei had told her Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious

Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments but instead he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast The bridge was down again Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat When Sansa peered down she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below She averted her eyes quickly afraid to ask afraid to look too long afraid he might be someone she knew

They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers seated at the head of a long table littered with papers candles and blocks of sealing wax The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door

Your Grace Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face I’ve brought the girl

Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her Her prince was not there but three of the king’s councillors were Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table while Lord Varys hovered over them smelling flowery All of them were clad in black she realized with a feeling of dread Mourning clothes…

The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice covering her from neck to bosom They were cut in the shape of teardrops as if the queen were weeping blood Cersei smiled to see her and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen Sansa my sweet child she said I know you’ve been asking for me I’m sorry that I could not send for you sooner Matters have been very unsettled and I have not had a moment I trust my people have been taking good care of you

Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant Your Grace thank you ever so much for asking Sansa said politely Only well no one will talk to us or tell us what’s happened…

Us Cersei seemed puzzled
