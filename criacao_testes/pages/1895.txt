You may be wondering how the frequency response for the digital pre-emphasis
filters displayed in Figure 42 can be calculated  Suppose a digitized
sinusoid is applied as input to the filter

A sine wave of frequency f has equation  xt  =  sin  2 pi ft and when
sampled at t=0 T 2T  where T is the sampling interval 125 msec for
an 8 kHz sample rate this becomes  xn  =  sin  2 pi fnT  It is much
more convenient to consider a complex exponential
input  e sup  j2 pi fnT  em the response to a sinusoid can then be derived
by taking imaginary parts if necessary  The output for this input is

yn  =  e sup j2 pi fnT -ae sup j2 pi fn-1T  = 
1-ae sup -j2 pi fT e sup j2 pi fnT

a sinusoid at the same frequency as the input  The
factor  1-ae sup -j2 pi fT  is complex with both amplitude and phase
components  Thus the output will be a phase-shifted and amplified version
of the input  The amplitude response at frequency f is therefore

Normalizing to 20 dB at 1 kHz and assuming 8 kHz sampling yields

With a=09 and 1 this gives the graphs of Figure 42

Frequency responses for analogue filters are often plotted with a logarithmic
frequency scale as well as a logarithmic amplitude one to bring out the
asymptotes in dBoctave as straight lines  For digital filters the response
is usually drawn on a
ul
linear
frequency axis extending to half the sampling frequency  The response is
symmetric about this point

Analyses like the above are usually expressed in terms of the z-transform
Denote the unit delay operation by z sup -1  The choice of the inverse rather
than z itself is of course an arbitrary matter but the convention has stuck
Then the filter can be characterized
by Figure 43 which signifies that the output is the input minus a delayed
and scaled version of itself

The transfer function of the filter is

Hz  =  1 - az sup -1

and we have seen that the effect of the system on a complex exponential of
frequency f is to multiply it by
LB
EQ
1 - ae sup -j2 pi fT

To get the frequency response from the transfer function replace z sup -1
by e sup -j2 pi fT  Amplitude and phase responses can then be found by
taking the modulus and angle of the complex frequency response

If z sup -1 is treated as an
ul
operator
it is quite in order to summarize the action of the filter by

yn  =  xn - az sup -1 xn  =  1 - az sup -1 xn

However it is usual to derive from the sequence xn a
