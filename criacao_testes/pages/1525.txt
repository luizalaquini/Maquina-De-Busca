Look down said Lady Lysa Look down

She tried to wrench free but her aunt’s fingers were digging into her arm like claws Lysa gave her another shove and Sansa shrieked Her left foot broke through a crust of snow and knocked it loose There was nothing in front of her but empty air and a waycastle six hundred feet below clinging to the side of the mountain Don’t Sansa screamed You’re scaring me Behind her Marillion was still playing his woodharp and singing Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey

Do you still want my leave to go Do you

No Sansa planted her feet and tried to squirm backward but her aunt did not budge Not this way Please… She put a hand up her fingers scrabbling at the doorframe but she could not get a grip and her feet were sliding on the wet marble floor Lady Lysa pressed her forward inexorably Her aunt outweighed her by three stone The lady lay a-kissing upon a mound of hay Marillion was singing Sansa twisted sideways hysterical with fear and one foot slipped out over the void She screamed Hey-nonny hey-nonny hey-nonny-hey The wind flapped her skirts up and bit at her bare legs with cold teeth She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks Sansa flailed found Lysa’s thick auburn braid and clutched it tight My hair her aunt shrieked Let go of my hair She was shaking sobbing They teetered on the edge Far off she heard the guards pounding on the door with their spears demanding to be let in Marillion broke off his song

Lysa What’s the meaning of this The shout cut through the sobs and heavy breathing Footsteps echoed down the High Hall Get back from there Lysa what are you doing The guards were still beating at the door Littlefinger had come in the back way through the lords’ entrance behind the dais

As Lysa turned her grip loosened enough for Sansa to rip free She stumbled to her knees where Petyr Baelish saw her He stopped suddenly Alayne What is the trouble here

Her Lady Lysa grabbed a handful of Sansa’s hair She’s the trouble She kissed you

Tell her Sansa begged Tell her we were just building a castle…

Be quiet her aunt screamed I never gave you leave to speak No one cares about your castle

She’s a child Lysa Cat’s daughter What did you think you were doing

I was going to marry her to Robert She has no gratitude No… no decency You are not hers to kiss Not hers I was teaching her a lesson that was all

I see He stroked his chin I think she understands now Isn’t that so Alayne

Yes sobbed Sansa I understand

I don’t want her here Her aunt’s eyes were shiny with tears Why did you bring her to the Vale Petyr This isn’t her place She doesn’t belong here

We’ll send her away then Back to King’s Landing if you like He took a step toward them Let her up now Let her away from the door

NO Lysa gave Sansa’s head another wrench Snow eddied around them making their skirts snap noisily You can’t want her You can’t She’s a stupid empty-headed little girl She doesn’t love you the way I have I’ve always loved you I’ve proved it haven’t I Tears ran down her aunt’s puffy red face I gave you my maiden’s gift I would have given you a son too but they murdered him with moon tea with tansy and mint and wormwood a spoon of honey and a drop of pennyroyal It wasn’t me I never knew I only drank what Father gave me…

That’s past and done Lysa Lord Hoster’s dead and his old maester as well Littlefinger moved closer Have you been at the wine again You ought not to talk so much We don’t want Alayne to know more than she should do we Or Marillion

Lady Lysa ignored that Cat never gave you anything It was me who got you your first post who made Jon bring you to court so we could be close to one another You promised me you would never forget that

Nor have I We’re together just as you always wanted just as we always planned Just let go of Sansa’s hair…

I won’t I saw you kissing in the snow She’s just like her mother Catelyn kissed you in the godswood but she never meant it she never wanted you Why did you love her best It was me it was always meeee

I know love He took another step And I am here All you need to do is take my hand come on He held it out to her There’s no cause for all these tears

Tears tears tears she sobbed hysterically No need for tears… but that’s not what you said in King’s Landing You told me to put the tears in Jon’s wine and I did For Robert and for us And I wrote Catelyn and told her the Lannisters had killed my lord husband just as you said That was so clever… you were always clever I told Father that I said Petyr’s so clever he’ll rise high he will he will and he’s sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly… Why did you kiss her Why We’re together now we’re together after so long so very long why would you want to kiss herrrrrr

Lysa Petyr sighed after all the storms we’ve suffered you should trust me better I swear I shall never leave your side again for as long as we both shall live

Truly she asked weeping Oh truly

Truly Now unhand the girl and come give me a kiss

Lysa threw herself into Littlefinger’s arms sobbing As they hugged Sansa crawled from the Moon Door on hands and knees and wrapped her arms around the nearest pillar She could feel her heart pounding There was snow in her hair and her right shoe was missing It must have fallen She shuddered and hugged the pillar tighter

Littlefinger let Lysa sob against his chest for a moment then put his hands on her arms and kissed her lightly My sweet silly jealous wife he said chuckling I’ve only loved one woman I promise you

Lysa Arryn smiled tremulously Only one Oh Petyr do you swear it Only one

Only Cat He gave her a short sharp shove

Lysa stumbled backward her feet slipping on the wet marble And then she was gone She never screamed For the longest time there was no sound but the wind

Marillion gasped You… you…

The guards were shouting outside the door pounding with the butts of their heavy spears Lord Petyr pulled Sansa to her feet You’re not hurt When she shook her head he said Run let my guards in then Quick now there’s no time to lose This singer’s killed my lady wife





Epilogue


The road up to Oldstones went twice around the hill before reaching the summit Overgrown and stony it would have been slow going even in the best of times and last night’s snow had left it muddy as well Snow in autumn in the riverlands it’s unnatural Merrett thought gloomily It had not been much of a snow true just enough to blanket the ground for a night Most of it had started melting away as soon as the sun came up Still Merrett took it for a bad omen Between rains floods fire and war they had lost two harvests and a good part of a third An early winter would mean famine all across the riverlands A great many people would go hungry and some of them would starve Merrett only hoped he wouldn’t be one of them I may though With my luck I just may I never did have any luck

Beneath the castle ruins the lower slopes of the hill were so thickly forested that half a hundred outlaws could well have been lurking there They could be watching me even now Merrett glanced about and saw nothing but gorse bracken thistle sedge and blackberry bushes between the pines and grey-green sentinels Elsewhere skeletal elm and ash and scrub oaks choked the ground like weeds He saw no outlaws but that meant little Outlaws were better at hiding than honest men

Merrett hated the woods if truth be told and he hated outlaws even more Outlaws stole my life he had been known to complain when in his cups He was too often in his cups his father said often and loudly Too true he thought ruefully You needed some sort of distinction in the Twins else they were liable to forget you were alive but a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle had done little to enhance his prospects he’d found I once hoped to be the greatest knight who ever couched a lance The gods took that away from me Why shouldn’t I have a cup of wine from time to time It helps my headaches Besides my wife is a shrew my father despises me my children are worthless What do I have to stay sober for

He was sober now though Well he’d had two horns of ale when he broke his fast and a small cup of red when he set out but that was just to keep his head from pounding Merrett could feel the headache building behind his eyes and he knew that if he gave it half a chance he would soon feel as if he had a thunderstorm raging between his ears Sometimes his headaches got so bad that it even hurt too much to weep Then all he could do was rest on his bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over his eyes and curse his luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to him

Just thinking about it made him anxious He could no wise afford a headache now If I bring Petyr back home safely all my luck will change He had the gold all he needed to do was climb to the top of Oldstones meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle and make the exchange A simple ransom Even he could not muck it up… unless he got a headache one so bad that it left him unable to ride He was supposed to be at the ruins by sunset not weeping in a huddle at the side of the road Merrett rubbed two fingers against his temple Once more around the hill and there I am When the message had come in and he had stepped forward to offer to carry the ransom his father had squinted down and said You Merrett and started laughing through his nose that hideous heh heh heh laugh of his Merrett practically had to beg before they’d give him the bloody bag of gold

Something moved in the underbrush along the side of the road Merrett reined up hard and reached for his sword but it was only a squirrel Stupid he told himself shoving the sword back in its scabbard without ever having gotten it out Outlaws don’t have tails Bloody hell Merrett get hold of yourself His heart was thumping in his chest as if he were some green boy on his first campaign As if this were the kingswood and it was the old Brotherhood I was going to face not the lightning lord’s sorry lot of brigands For a moment he was tempted to trot right back down the hill and find the nearest alehouse That bag of gold would buy a lot of ale enough for him to forget all about Petyr Pimple Let them hang him he brought this on himself It’s no more than he deserves wandering off with some bloody camp follower like a stag in rut

His head had begun to pound soft now but he knew it would get worse Merrett rubbed the bridge of his nose He really had no right to think so ill of Petyr I did the same myself when I was his age In his case all it got him was a pox but still he shouldn’t condemn Whores did have charms especially if you had a face like Petyr’s The poor lad had a wife to be sure but she was half the problem Not only was she twice his age but she was bedding his brother Walder too if the talk was true There was always lots of talk around the Twins and only a little was ever true but in this case Merrett believed it Black Walder was a man who took what he wanted even his brother’s wife He’d had Edwyn’s wife too that was common knowledge Fair Walda had been known to slip into his bed from time to time and some even said he’d known the seventh Lady Frey a deal better than he should have Small wonder he refused to marry Why buy a cow when there were udders all around begging to be milked

Cursing under his breath Merrett jammed his heels into his horse’s flanks and rode on up the hill As tempting as it was to drink the gold away he knew that if he didn’t come back with Petyr Pimple he had as well not come back at all

Lord Walder would soon turn two-and-ninety His ears had started to go his eyes were almost gone and his gout was so bad that he had to be carried everywhere He could not possibly last much longer all his sons agreed And when he goes everything will change and not for the better His father was querulous and stubborn with an iron will and a wasp’s tongue but he did believe in taking care of his own All of his own even the ones who had displeased and disappointed him Even the ones whose names he can’t remember Once he was gone though…

When Ser Stevron had been heir that was one thing The old man had been grooming Stevron for sixty years and had pounded it into his head that blood was blood But Stevron had died whilst campaigning with the Young Wolf in the west—of waiting no doubt Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven brought them the news—and his sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey Stevron’s son Ser Ryman stood to inherit now a thick-witted stubborn greedy man And after Ryman came his own sons Edwyn and Black Walder who were even worse Fortunately Lame Lothar once said they hate each other even more than they hate us

Merrett wasn’t certain that was fortunate at all and for that matter Lothar himself might be more dangerous than either of them Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin’s wedding but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton all the way down to which songs would be played Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn his back on him In the Twins you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted and them not very far

It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died and every daughter as well The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of his uncles nephews and cousins at the Twins the ones he happened to like or trust or more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him The rest of us he’ll shove out to fend for ourselves

The prospect worried Merrett more than words could say He would be forty in less than three years too old to take up the life of a hedge knight… even if he’d been a knight which as it happened he wasn’t He had no land no wealth of his own He owned the clothes on his back but not much else not even the horse he was riding He wasn’t clever enough to be a maester pious enough to be a septon or savage enough to be a sellsword The gods gave me no gift but birth and they stinted me there What good was it to be the son of a rich and powerful House if you were the ninth son When you took grandsons and great-grandsons into account Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than he did of inheriting the Twins

I have no luck he thought bitterly I have never had any bloody luck He was a big man broad around the chest and shoulders if only of middling height In the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy he knew but when he’d been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen his eldest full brother who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey’s brood As a boy he’d been packed off to Crakehall to serve his mother’s family as a page When old Lord Sumner had made him a squire everyone had assumed he would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years but the outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans While his fellow squire Jaime Lannister was covering himself in glory Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower then managed to get captured by a woman the one called the White Fawn Lord Sumner had ransomed him back from the outlaws but in the very next fight he’d been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken his helm and left him insensible for a fortnight Everyone gave him up for dead they told him later
