This cave is dark too said the Hound but I’m the terror here I hope your god’s a sweet one Dondarrion You’re going to meet him shortly

Unsmiling Lord Beric laid the edge of his longsword against the palm of his left hand and drew it slowly down Blood ran dark from the gash he made and washed over the steel

And then the sword took fire

Arya heard Gendry whisper a prayer

Burn in seven hells the Hound cursed You and Thoros too He threw a glance at the red priest When I’m done with him you’ll be next Myr

Every word you say proclaims your guilt dog answered Thoros while Lem and Greenbeard and Jack-Be-Lucky shouted threats and curses Lord Beric himself waited silent calm as still water his shield on his left arm and his sword burning in his right hand Kill him Arya thought please you have to kill him Lit from below his face was a death mask his missing eye a red and angry wound The sword was aflame from point to crossguard but Dondarrion seemed not to feel the heat He stood so still he might have been carved of stone

But when the Hound charged him he moved fast enough

The flaming sword leapt up to meet the cold one long streamers of fire trailing in its wake like the ribbons the Hound had spoken of Steel rang on steel No sooner was his first slash blocked than Clegane made another but this time Lord Beric’s shield got in the way and wood chips flew from the force of the blow Hard and fast the cuts came from low and high from right and left and each one Dondarrion blocked The flames swirled about his sword and left red and yellow ghosts to mark its passage Each move Lord Beric made fanned them and made them burn the brighter until it seemed as though the lightning lord stood within a cage of fire Is it wildfire Arya asked Gendry

No This is different This is…

…magic she finished as the Hound edged back Now it was Lord Beric attacking filling the air with ropes of fire driving the bigger man back on his heels Clegane caught one blow high on his shield and a painted dog lost a head He countercut and Dondarrion interposed his own shield and launched a fiery backslash The outlaw brotherhood shouted on their leader He’s yours Arya heard and At him At him At him The Hound parried a cut at his head grimacing as the heat of the flames beat against his face He grunted and cursed and reeled away

Lord Beric gave him no respite Hard on the big man’s heels he followed his arm never still The swords clashed and sprang apart and clashed again splinters flew from the lightning shield while swirling flames kissed the dogs once and twice and thrice The Hound moved to his right but Dondarrion blocked him with a quick sidestep and drove him back the other way… toward the sullen red blaze of the firepit Clegane gave ground until he felt the heat at his back A quick glance over his shoulder showed him what was behind him and almost cost him his head when Lord Beric attacked anew

Arya could see the whites of Sandor Clegane’s eyes as he bulled his way forward again Three steps up and two back a move to the left that Lord Beric blocked two more forward and one back clang and clang and the big oaken shields took blow after blow after blow The Hound’s lank dark hair was plastered to his brow in a sheen of sweat Wine sweat Arya thought remembering that he’d been taken drunk She thought she could see the beginnings of fear wake in his eyes He’s going to lose she told herself exulting as Lord Beric’s flaming sword whirled and slashed In one wild flurry the lightning lord took back all the ground the Hound had gained sending Clegane staggering to the very edge of the firepit once more He is he is he’s going to die She stood on her toes for a better look

Bloody bastard the Hound screamed as he felt the fire licking against the back of his thighs He charged swinging the heavy sword harder and harder trying to smash the smaller man down with brute force to break blade or shield or arm But the flames of Dondarrion’s parries snapped at his eyes and when the Hound jerked away from them his foot went out from under him and he staggered to one knee At once Lord Beric closed his downcut screaming through the air trailing pennons of fire Panting from exertion Clegane jerked his shield up over his head just in time and the cave rang with the loud crack of splintering oak

His shield is afire Gendry said in a hushed voice Arya saw it in the same instant The flames had spread across the chipped yellow paint and the three black dogs were engulfed

Sandor Clegane had fought his way back to his feet with a reckless counterattack Not until Lord Beric retreated a pace did the Hound seem to realize that the fire that roared so near his face was his own shield burning With a shout of revulsion he hacked down savagely on the broken oak completing its destruction The shield shattered one piece of it spinning away still afire while the other clung stubbornly to his forearm His efforts to free himself only fanned the flames His sleeve caught and now his whole left arm was ablaze Finish him Greenbeard urged Lord Beric and other voices took up the chant of Guilty Arya shouted with the rest Guilty guilty kill him guilty

Smooth as summer silk Lord Beric slid close to make an end of the man before him The Hound gave a rasping scream raised his sword in both hands and brought it crashing down with all his strength Lord Beric blocked the cut easily…

Noooooo Arya shrieked

…but the burning sword snapped in two and the Hound’s cold steel plowed into Lord Beric’s flesh where his shoulder joined his neck and clove him clean down to the breastbone The blood came rushing out in a hot black gush

Sandor Clegane jerked backward still burning He ripped the remnants of his shield off and flung them away with a curse then rolled in the dirt to smother the fire running along his arm

Lord Beric’s knees folded slowly as if for prayer When his mouth opened only blood came out The Hound’s sword was still in him as he toppled face forward The dirt drank his blood Beneath the hollow hill there was no sound but the soft crackling of flames and the whimper the Hound made when he tried to rise Arya could only think of Mycah and all the stupid prayers she’d prayed for the Hound to die If there were gods why didn’t Lord Beric win She knew the Hound was guilty

Please Sandor Clegane rasped cradling his arm I’m burned Help me Someone Help me He was crying Please

Arya looked at him in astonishment He’s crying like a little baby she thought

Melly see to his burns said Thoros Lem Jack help me with Lord Beric Ned you’d best come too The red priest wrenched the Hound’s sword from the body of his fallen lord and thrust the point of it down in the blood-soaked earth Lem slid his big hands under Dondarrion’s arms while Jack-Be-Lucky took his feet They carried him around the firepit into the darkness of one of the tunnels Thoros and the boy Ned followed after

The Mad Huntsman spat I say we take him back to Stoney Sept and put him in a crow cage

Yes Arya said He murdered Mycah He did

Such an angry squirrel murmured Greenbeard

Harwin sighed R’hllor has judged him innocent
