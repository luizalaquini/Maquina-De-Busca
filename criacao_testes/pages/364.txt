She was not surprised Kurz had died of his wound and he’d been a lot stronger than Lommy Whenever it was Arya’s turn to help carry him she could feel how warm his skin was and smell the stink off his leg Maybe we could find a maester…

You only find maesters in castles and even if we found one he wouldn’t dirty his hands on the likes of Lommy Gendry ducked under a low-hanging limb

That’s not true Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to him she was certain

He’s going to die and the sooner he does it the better for the rest of us We should just leave him like he says If it was you or me hurt you know he’d leave us They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side using roots for handholds I’m sick of carrying him and I’m sick of all his talk about yielding too If he could stand up I’d knock his teeth in Lommy’s no use to anyone That crying girl’s no use either

You leave Weasel alone she’s just scared and hungry is all Arya glanced back but the girl was not following for once Hot Pie must have grabbed her like Gendry had told him

She’s no use Gendry repeated stubbornly Her and Hot Pie and Lommy they’re slowing us down and they’re going to get us killed You’re the only one of the bunch who’s good for anything Even if you are a girl

Arya froze in her steps I’m not a girl

Yes you are Do you think I’m as stupid as they are

No you’re stupider The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls everyone knows that

That’s true I don’t know why Yoren brought you but he must have had some reason You’re still a girl

I am not

Then pull out your cock and take a piss Go on

I don’t need to take a piss If I wanted to I could

Liar You can’t take out your cock because you don’t have one I never noticed before when there were thirty of us but you always go off in the woods to make your water You don’t see Hot Pie doing that nor me neither If you’re not a girl you must be some eunuch

You’re the eunuch

You know I’m not Gendry smiled You want me to take out my cock and prove it I don’t have anything to hide

Yes you do Arya blurted desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didn’t have Those gold cloaks were after you at the inn and you won’t tell us why

I wish I knew I think Yoren knew but he never told me Why did you think they were after you though

Arya bit her lip She remembered what Yoren had said the day he had hacked off her hair This lot half o’ them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers The other half’d do the same only they’d rape you first Only Gendry was different the queen wanted him too I’ll tell you if you’ll tell me she said warily

I would if I knew Arry… is that really what you’re called or do you have some girl’s name

Arya glared at the gnarled root by her feet She realized that the pretense was done Gendry knew and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise She could draw Needle and kill him where he stood or else trust him She wasn’t certain she’d be able to kill him even if she tried he had his own sword and he was a lot stronger All that was left was the truth Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know she said

They won’t he swore Not from me

Arya She raised her eyes to his My name is Arya Of House Stark

Of House… It took him a moment before he said The King’s Hand was named Stark The one they killed for a traitor

He was never a traitor He was my father

Gendry’s eyes widened So that’s why you thought…

She nodded Yoren was taking me home to Winterfell
