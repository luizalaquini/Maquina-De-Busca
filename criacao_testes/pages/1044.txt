I hit him she said wonder in her voice Now that it was over it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed Ser Jorah do you think… he’ll be so angry when he gets back… She shivered I woke the dragon didn’t I

Ser Jorah snorted Can you wake the dead girl Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon and he died on the Trident Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake

His blunt words startled her It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question You… you swore him your sword…

That I did girl Ser Jorah said And if your brother is the shadow of a snake what does that make his servants His voice was bitter

He is still the true king He is…

Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her Truth now Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne

Dany thought about that He would not be a very good king would he

There have been worse… but not many The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again

Dany rode close beside him Still she said the common people are waiting for him Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them

The common people pray for rain healthy children and a summer that never ends Ser Jorah told her It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones so long as they are left in peace He gave a shrug They never are

Dany rode along quietly for a time working his words like a puzzle box It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them Yet the more she thought on Jorah’s words the more they rang of truth

What do you pray for Ser Jorah she asked him

Home he said His voice was thick with longing

I pray for home too she told him believing it

Ser Jorah laughed Look around you then Khaleesi

But it was not the plains Dany saw then It was King’s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built It was Dragonstone where she had been born In her mind’s eye they burned with a thousand lights a fire blazing in every window In her mind’s eye all the doors were red

My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms Dany said She had known that for a long time she realized She had known it all her life Only she had never let herself say the words even in a whisper but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear

Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look You think not

He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one Dany said He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake The Dothraki make mock of his weakness He will never take us home

Wise child The knight smiled

I am no child she told him fiercely Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount rousing the silver to a gallop Faster and faster she raced leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face By the time she reached the khalasar it was dusk

The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool She could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill Soon there would be laughter when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today By the time Viserys came limping back among them every man woman and child in the camp would know him for a walker There were no secrets in the khalasar

Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent It was cool and dim beneath the silk As she let the door flap close behind her Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon’s eggs across the tent For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes She blinked and they were gone

Stone she told herself They are only stone even Illyrio said so the dragons are all dead She put her palm against the black egg fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell The stone was warm Almost hot The sun Dany whispered The sun warmed them as they rode

She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath Doreah built a fire outside the tent while Irri and Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub—another bride gift—from the packhorses and carried water from the pool When the bath was steaming Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her

Have you ever seen a dragon she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea Perhaps some were still living there in realms strange and wild

Dragons are gone Khaleesi Irri said

Dead agreed Jhiqui Long and long ago

Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago during the reign of Aegon III who was called the Dragonbane That did not seem so long ago to Dany Everywhere she said disappointed Even in the east Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back but Dany had always heard that the east was different It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti that spellsingers warlocks and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night Why shouldn’t there be dragons too

No dragon Irri said Brave men kill them for dragon terrible evil beasts It is known

It is known agreed Jhiqui

A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father’s khalasar Doreah was older almost twenty Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys

Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head curious The moon

He told me the moon was an egg Khaleesi the Lysene girl said Once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat A thousand thousand dragons poured forth and drank the fire of the sun That is why dragons breathe flame One day the other moon will kiss the sun too and then it will crack and the dragons will return

The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed You are foolish strawhead slave Irri said Moon is no egg Moon is god woman wife of sun It is known

It is known Jhiqui agreed

Dany’s skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon While Doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver she thought about the moon and eggs and dragons

Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down Doreah stay and eat with me Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away The Lysene girl had hair the color of honey and eyes like the summer sky

She lowered those eyes when they were alone You honor me Khaleesi she said but it was no honor only service Long after the moon had risen they sat together talking

That night when Khal Drogo came Dany was waiting for him He stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground This night we must go outside my lord she told him for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life must be done beneath the open sky

Khal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight the bells in his hair tinkling softly A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass and it was there that Dany drew him down When he tried to turn her over she put a hand on his chest No she said This night I would look on your face

There is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him heard the soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told her to do It was nothing to her Was she not khaleesi His were the only eyes that mattered and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver and when the moment of his pleasure came Khal Drogo called out her name

They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany’s stomach with her fingers and said Khaleesi you are with child

I know Dany told her

It was her fourteenth name day





BRAN

In the yard below Rickon ran with the wolves

Bran watched from his window seat Wherever the boy went Grey Wind was there first loping ahead to cut him off until Rickon saw him screamed in delight and went pelting off in another direction Shaggydog ran at his heels spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close His fur had darkened until he was all black and his eyes were green fire Bran’s Summer came last He was silver and smoke with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see Smaller than Grey Wind and more wary Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter He could hear his brother’s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs
