1221 Then said his servants unto him What thing is this that thou
hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive
but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread

1222 And he said While the child was yet alive I fasted and wept
for I said Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me that the
child may live  1223 But now he is dead wherefore should I fast
can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return
to me

1224 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife and went in unto her
and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name Solomon
and the LORD loved him

1225 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his
name Jedidiah because of the LORD

1226 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon and
took the royal city

1227 And Joab sent messengers to David and said I have fought
against Rabbah and have taken the city of waters

1228 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp
against the city and take it lest I take the city and it be called
after my name

1229 And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah
and fought against it and took it

1230 And he took their kings crown from off his head the weight
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set
on Davids head And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great
abundance

1231 And he brought forth the people that were therein and put them
under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and
made them pass through the brick-kiln and thus did he unto all the
cities of the children of Ammon So David and all the people returned
unto Jerusalem

131 And it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had
a fair sister whose name was Tamar and Amnon the son of David loved
her

132 And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar
for she was a virgin and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything
to her

133 But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of
Shimeah Davids brother and Jonadab was a very subtil man

134 And he said unto him Why art thou being the kings son lean
from day to day wilt thou not tell me And Amnon said unto him I
love Tamar my brother Absaloms sister

135 And Jonadab said unto him Lay thee down on thy bed and make
thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him I
pray thee let my sister Tamar come and give me meat and dress the
meat in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her hand

136 So Amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was
come to see him Amnon said unto the king I pray thee let Tamar my
sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat
at her hand

137 Then David sent home to Tamar saying Go now to thy brother
Amnons house and dress him meat

138 So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house and he was laid down
And she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and
did bake the cakes

139 And she took a pan and poured them out before him but he
refused to eat And Amnon said Have out all men from me And they
went out every man from him

1310 And Amnon said unto Tamar Bring the meat into the chamber that
I may eat of thine hand And Tamar took the cakes which she had made
and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother

1311 And when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of
her and said unto her Come lie with me my sister

1312 And she answered him Nay my brother do not force me for no
such thing ought to be done in Israel do not thou this folly

1313 And I whither shall I cause my shame to go and as for thee
thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel Now therefore I pray
thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee

1314 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger
than she forced her and lay with her

1315 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith
he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her And
Amnon said unto her Arise be gone

1316 And she said unto him There is no cause this evil in sending
me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me But he
