Rabiner 1969 A model for synthesizing speech by rule

The time-constant of decay was stored with each segment in the rule
table  The rhythm of the synthetic speech was controlled at this level
for the next segment was begun when all the formants had attained
values sufficiently close to the current targets
This is a poor model of the human speech production process where rhythm
is dictated at a relatively high level and the next phoneme is not
simply started when the current one happens to end
Nevertheless the algorithm produced smooth continuous formant motions
not unlike those found in spectrograms

There is however by no means universal agreement on decaying exponential formant
motions  Lawrence 1974 divided segments into checked and free
categories corresponding roughly to consonants and vowels and postulated
ul
increasing
exponential transitions into checked segments and decaying transitions into
free ones

Lawrence 1974

This is a reasonable supposition if you consider the mechanics of
articulation  The speed of movement of the tongue for example is likely
to increase until it is physically stopped by reaching the roof of the
mouth
When moving away from a checked posture into a free one the transition will
be rapid at first but slow down to approach the target asymptotically
governed by proprioceptive feedback
pp
The only thing that seems to be agreed is that the formant tracks should
certainly
ul
not
be piecewise linear  However in the face of
conflicting opinions as to whether exponentials should be decaying
or increasing piecewise linear motions seem to be a reasonable
compromise  It is likely that the precise shape of formant
tracks is unimportant so long as the gross features are imitated
correctly
Nevertheless this is a question which an articulatory model
could help to answer

There are unfortunately few books to recommend on the subject of
joining segments of speech
The references form a representative and moderately comprehensive bibliography

This book of readings contains many classic papers on acoustic phonetics
published from 1922-1965
It covers much of the history of the subject and is intended
primarily for students of linguistics
