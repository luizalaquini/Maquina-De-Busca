She is looking at me Bran realized He had to make some answer My brother Robb is fighting in the south he said but you can say your words to me if you like

To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater they said together Hearth and heart and harvest we yield up to you my lord Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command Grant mercy to our weak help to our helpless and justice to all and we shall never fail you

I swear it by earth and water said the boy in green

I swear it by bronze and iron his sister said

We swear it by ice and fire they finished together

Bran groped for words Was he supposed to swear something back to them Their oath was not one he had been taught May your winters be short and your summers bountiful he said That was usually a good thing to say Rise I’m Brandon Stark

The girl Meera got to her feet and helped her brother up The boy stared at Bran all the while We bring you gifts of fish and frog and fowl he said

I thank you Bran wondered if he would have to eat a frog to be polite I offer you the meat and mead of Winterfell He tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands They were a poor folk fishers and frog-hunters who lived in houses of thatch and woven reeds on floating islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp It was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open battle And yet Howland Reed had been one of Father’s staunchest companions during the war for King Robert’s crown before Bran was born

The boy Jojen looked about the hall curiously as he took his seat Where are the direwolves

In the godswood Rickon answered Shaggy was bad

My brother would like to see them the girl said

Little Walder spoke up loudly He’d best watch they don’t see him or they’ll take a bite out of him

They won’t bite if I’m there Bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves Summer won’t anyway and he’ll keep Shaggydog away He was curious about these mudmen He could not recall ever seeing one before His father had sent letters to the Lord of Greywater over the years but none of the crannogmen had ever called at Winterfell He would have liked to talk to them more but the Great Hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear anyone who wasn’t right beside you

Ser Rodrik was right beside Bran Do they truly eat frogs he asked the old knight

Aye Ser Rodrik said Frogs and fish and lizard-lions and all manner of birds

Maybe they don’t have sheep and cattle Bran thought He commanded the serving men to bring them mutton chops and a slice off the aurochs and fill their trenchers with beef-and-barley stew They seemed to like that well enough The girl caught him staring at her and smiled Bran blushed and looked away

Much later after all the sweets had been served and washed down with gallons of summerwine the food was cleared and the tables shoved back against the walls to make room for the dancing The music grew wilder the drummers joined in and Hother Umber brought forth a huge curved warhorn banded in silver When the singer reached the part in The Night That Ended where the Night’s Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the Battle for the Dawn he blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking

Two Glover men began a spinning skirl on bladder and woodharp Mors Umber was the first on his feet He seized a passing serving girl by the arm knocking the flagon of wine out of her hands to shatter on the floor Amidst the rushes and bones and bits of bread that littered the stone he whirled her and spun her and tossed her in the air The girl squealed with laughter and turned red as her skirts swirled and lifted

Others soon joined in Hodor began to dance all by himself while Lord Wyman asked little Beth Cassel to partner him For all his size he moved gracefully When he tired Cley Cerwyn danced with the child in his stead Ser Rodrik approached Lady Hornwood but she made her excuses and took her leave Bran watched long enough to be polite and then had Hodor summoned He was hot and tired flushed from the wine and the dancing made him sad It was something else he could never do I want to go

Hodor Hodor shouted back kneeling Maester Luwin and Hayhead lifted him into his basket The folk of Winterfell had seen this sight half a hundred times but doubtless it looked queer to the guests some of whom were more curious than polite Bran felt the stares

They went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall Bran ducking his head as they passed through the lord’s door In the dim-lit gallery outside the Great Hall they came upon Joseth the master of horse engaged in a different sort of riding He had some woman Bran did not know shoved up against the wall her skirts around her waist She was giggling until Hodor stopped to watch Then she screamed Leave them be Hodor Bran had to tell him Take me to my bedchamber

Hodor carried him up the winding steps to his tower and knelt beside one of the iron bars that Mikken had driven into the wall Bran used the bars to move himself to the bed and Hodor pulled off his boots and breeches You can go back to the feast now but don’t go bothering Joseth and that woman Bran said

Hodor Hodor replied bobbing his head

When he blew out his bedside candle darkness covered him like a soft familiar blanket The faint sound of music drifted through his shuttered window

Something his father had told him once when he was little came back to him suddenly He had asked Lord Eddard if the Kingsguard were truly the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms No longer he answered but once they were a marvel a shining lesson to the world

Was there one who was best of all

The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne who fought with a blade called Dawn forged from the heart of a fallen star They called him the Sword of the Morning and he would have killed me but for Howland Reed Father had gotten sad then and he would say no more Bran wished he had asked him what he meant

He went to sleep with his head full of knights in gleaming armor fighting with swords that shone like starfire but when the dream came he was in the godswood again The smells from the kitchen and the Great Hall were so strong that it was almost as if he had never left the feast He prowled beneath the trees his brother close behind him This night was wildly alive full of the howling of the man-pack at their play The sounds made him restless He wanted to run to hunt he wanted to—

The rattle of iron made his ears prick up His brother heard it too They raced through the undergrowth toward the sound Bounding across the still water at the foot of the old white one he caught the scent of a stranger the man-smell well mixed with leather and earth and iron

The intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon them a female and a young male with no taint of fear to them even when he showed them the white of his teeth His brother growled low in his throat yet still they did not run

Here they come the female said Meera some part of him whispered some wisp of the sleeping boy lost in the wolf dream Did you know they would be so big

They will be bigger still before they are grown the young male said watching them with eyes large green and unafraid The black one is full of fear and rage but the grey is strong    stronger than he knows    can you feel him sister

No she said moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore Go careful Jojen

He won’t hurt me This is not the day I die The male walked toward them unafraid and reached out for his muzzle a touch as light as a summer breeze Yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing and then he was spinning and falling falling falling   





CATELYN

As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again that Arya and Sansa held hands that Rickon was still a babe at her breast Robb crownless played with a wooden sword and when all were safe asleep she found Ned in her bed smiling

Sweet it was sweet and gone too soon Dawn came cruel a dagger of light She woke aching and alone and weary weary of riding weary of hurting weary of duty I want to weep she thought I want to be comforted I’m so tired of being strong I want to be foolish and frightened for once Just for a small while that’s all    a day    an hour   

Outside her tent men were stirring She heard the whicker of horses Shadd complaining of stiffness in his back Ser Wendel calling for his bow Catelyn wished they would all go away They were good men loyal yet she was tired of them all It was her children she yearned after One day she promised herself as she lay abed one day she would allow herself to be less than strong

But not today It could not be today

Her fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as she fumbled on her clothes She supposed she ought to be grateful that she had any use of her hands at all The dagger had been Valyrian steel and Valyrian steel bites deep and sharp She had only to look at the scars to remember

Outside Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing his bow My lady he said when Catelyn emerged There are birds in this grass Would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning

Oats and bread are sufficient    for all of us I think We have many leagues yet to ride Ser Wendel

As you will my lady The knight’s moon face looked crestfallen the tips of his great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment Oats and bread and what could be better He was one of the fattest men Catelyn had ever known but howevermuch he loved his food he loved his honor more

Found some nettles and brewed a tea Shadd announced Will m’lady take a cup

Yes with thanks

She cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it Shadd was one of the Winterfell men Robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to Renly He had sent five lordlings as well whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission As they made their way south staying well clear of towns and holdfasts they had seen bands of mailed men more than once and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon but none had dared molest them They were too weak to be a threat too many to be easy prey Once across the Blackwater the worst was behind For the past four days they had seen no signs of war

Catelyn had never wanted this She had told Robb as much back in Riverrun When last I saw Renly he was a boy no older than Bran I do not know him Send someone else My place is here with my father for whatever time he has left

Her son had looked at her unhappily There is no one else I cannot go myself Your father’s too ill The Blackfish is my eyes and ears I dare not lose him Your brother I need to hold Riverrun when we march—
