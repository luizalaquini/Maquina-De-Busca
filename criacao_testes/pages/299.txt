wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained
two thousand baths

727 And he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one
base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height
of it

728 And the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders
and the borders were between the ledges 729 And on the borders that
were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the
ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were
certain additions made of thin work

730 And every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and
the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were
undersetters molten at the side of every addition

731 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit
but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit
and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their
borders foursquare not round

732 And under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the
wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit
and half a cubit

733 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel
their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes
were all molten

734 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base
and the undersetters were of the very base itself

735 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the
borders thereof were of the same

736 For on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders
thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the
proportion of every one and additions round about

737 After this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one
casting one measure and one size

738 Then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty
baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten
bases one laver

739 And he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on
the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of
the house eastward over against the south

740 And Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons So
Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for
the house of the LORD 741 The two pillars and the two bowls of the
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the
top of the pillars 742 And four hundred pomegranates for the two
networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars 743 And the
ten bases and ten lavers on the bases 744 And one sea and twelve
oxen under the sea 745 And the pots and the shovels and the
basons and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for
the house of the LORD were of bright brass

746 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarthan

747 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were
exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out

748 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
the LORD the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the
shewbread was 749 And the candlesticks of pure gold five on the
right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers
and the lamps and the tongs of gold 750 And the bowls and the
snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure
gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house
the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the
temple

751 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
the LORD And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put
among the treasures of the house of the LORD

81 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto
king Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the
covenant of the LORD out of the city of David which is Zion

82 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
at the feast in the month Ethanim which is the seventh month

83 And all the elders of Israel came and the priests took up the
ark

84 And they brought up the ark of the LORD and the tabernacle of the
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle
even those did the priests and the Levites bring up
