She believes she has good reason When I was her guest in the Eyrie she insisted that Id murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials He leaned forward If I gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer she might think more kindly of me

That made Littlefinger sit up True killer I confess you make me curious Who do you propose

It was Tyrion’s turn to smile Gifts I give my friends freely Lysa Arryn would need to understand that

Is it her friendship you require or her swords

Both

Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard Lysa has woes of her own Clansmen raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon in greater numbers than ever before… and better armed

Distressing said Tyrion Lannister who had armed them I could help her with that A word from me…

And what would this word cost her

I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king to swear fealty and to—

—make war on the Starks and Tullys Littlefinger shook his head There’s the roach in your pudding Lannister Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun

Nor would I ask it We have no lack of enemies I’ll use her power to oppose Lord Renly or Lord Stannis should he stir from Dragonstone In return I will give her justice for Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East as his father was before him I want to see him fly a boy’s voice whispered faintly in memory And to seal the bargain I will give her my niece

He had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish’s grey-green eyes Myrcella

When she comes of age she can wed little Lord Robert Until such time she’ll be Lady Lysa’s ward at the Eyrie

And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy When Tyrion shrugged Littlefinger burst into laughter I thought not You’re a dangerous little man Lannister Yes I could sing this song to Lysa Again the sly smile the mischief in his glance If I cared to

Tyrion nodded waiting knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence

So Lord Petyr continued after a pause utterly unabashed what’s in your pot for me

Harrenhal

It was interesting to watch his face Lord Petyr’s father had been the smallest of small lords his grandfather a landless hedge knight by birth he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms its lands broad and rich and fertile its great castle as formidable as any in the realm… and so large as to dwarf Riverrun where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to Lord Hoster’s daughter

Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat’s eyes I have him he knew Harrenhal is cursed Lord Petyr said after a moment trying to sound bored

Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself You’ll have no lack of coin I mean to make you liege lord of the Trident These river lords have proven they cannot be trusted Let them do you fealty for their lands

Even the Tullys

If there are any Tullys left when we are done

Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb He was trying to watch for bees but the honey was so sweet Harrenhal and all its lands and incomes he mused With a stroke you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm Not that I’m ungrateful my lord but—why

You served my sister well in the matter of the succession

As did Janos Slynt On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently bestowed—only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use

Tyrion laughed You have me my lord What can I say I need you to deliver the Lady Lysa I did not need Janos Slynt He gave a crooked shrug I’d sooner have you seated in Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne What could be plainer

What indeed You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to this marriage

I have little doubt you’ll be equal to the task

I once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into Tyrion’s mismatched eyes Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to Gulltown

That will do nicely

His guest rose This has been quite the pleasant morning Lannister And profitable… for both of us I trust He bowed his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door

Two thought Tyrion

He went up to his bedchamber to await Varys who would soon be making an appearance Evenfall he guessed Perhaps as late as moonrise though he hoped not He hoped to visit Shae tonight He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door You are a cruel man to make the Grand Maester squirm so the eunuch scolded The man cannot abide a secret

Is that a crow I hear calling the raven black Or would you sooner not hear what I’ve proposed to Doran Martell

Varys giggled Perhaps my little birds have told me

Have they indeed He wanted to hear this Go on

The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars Doran Martell has called his banners but no more His hatred for House Lannister is well known and it is commonly thought he will join Lord Renly You wish to dissuade him

All this is obvious said Tyrion

The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance The prince is a sentimental man and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe

My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition… and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council now that Lord Janos has taken the black

A council seat is not to be despised Varys admitted yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sister’s murder

Why forget Tyrion smiled I’ve promised to deliver his sister’s killers alive or dead as he prefers After the war is done to be sure

Varys gave him a shrewd look My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried a… certain name… when they came for her

Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it In Casterly Rock it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe They said he had raped the princess with her son’s blood and brains still on his hands

This secret is your lord father’s sworn man

My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog

Varys stroked a powdered cheek And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed…

Robert Baratheon led the rebellion All commands came from him in the end

Robert was not at King’s Landing

Neither was Doran Martell
