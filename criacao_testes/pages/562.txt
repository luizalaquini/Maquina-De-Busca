Belike we need to flush the crows Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor Feather them

No The word burst from Jon’s lips before the bowmen could loose He took two quick steps forward We yield

They warned me bastard blood was craven he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind him I see it is so Run to your new masters coward

Face reddening Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm and said The free folk have no need of cravens

He is no craven One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out a head of shaggy red hair This is the Bastard o’ Winterfell who spared me Let him live

Jon met Ygritte’s eyes and had no words

Let him die insisted the Lord of Bones The black crow is a tricksy bird I trust him not

On a rock above them the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury

The bird hates you Jon Snow said Ygritte And well he might He was a man before you killed him

I did not know said Jon truthfully trying to remember the face of the man he had slain in the pass You told me Mance would take me

And he will Ygritte said

Mance is not here said Rattleshirt Ragwyle gut him

The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said If the crow would join the free folk let him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him

I’ll do whatever you ask The words came hard but Jon said them

Rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed Then kill the Halfhand bastard

As if he could said Qhorin Turn Snow and die

And then Qhorin’s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon’s hand and sent him staggering backward You must not balk whatever is asked of you He shifted to a two-hand grip quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease Back and forth they went black cloaks swirling the youth’s quickness against the savage strength of Qhorin’s left-hand cuts The Halfhand’s longsword seemed to be everywhere at once raining down from one side and then the other driving him where he would keeping him off balance Already he could feel his arms growing numb

Even when Ghost’s teeth closed savagely around the ranger’s calf somehow Qhorin kept his feet But in that instant as he twisted the opening was there Jon planted and pivoted The ranger was leaning away and for an instant it seemed that Jon’s slash had not touched him Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man’s throat bright as a ruby necklace and the blood gushed out of him and Qhorin Halfhand fell

Ghost’s muzzle was dripping red but only the point of the bastard blade was stained the last half inch Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him The light was already fading in Qhorin’s eyes …sharp he said lifting his maimed fingers Then his hand fell and he was gone

He knew he thought numbly He knew what they would ask of me He thought of Samwell Tarly then of Grenn and Dolorous Edd of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black Had he lost them all as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb Who was he now What was he

Get him up Rough hands dragged him to his feet Jon did not resist Do you have a name

Ygritte answered for him His name is Jon Snow He is Eddard Stark’s blood of Winterfell

Ragwyle laughed Who would have thought it Qhorin Halfhand slain by some lordling’s byblow

Gut him That was Rattleshirt still ahorse The eagle flew to him and perched atop his bony helm screeching

He yielded Ygritte reminded them

Aye and slew his brother said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron halfhelm

Rattleshirt rode closer bones clattering The wolf did his work for him It were foully done The Halfhand’s death was mine
