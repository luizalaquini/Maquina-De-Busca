ye ear O house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye
have been a snare on Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor

52 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter though I have
been a rebuker of them all

53 I know Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me for now O Ephraim
thou committest whoredom and Israel is defiled

54 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known
the LORD

55 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face therefore shall
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity Judah also shall fall with
them

56 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
LORD but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from
them

57 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD for they have
begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their
portions

58 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah cry aloud
at Bethaven after thee O Benjamin

59 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes
of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be

510 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound
therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water

511 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly
walked after the commandment

512 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth and to the house of
Judah as rottenness

513 When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah saw his wound then went
Ephraim to the Assyrian and sent to king Jareb yet could he not heal
you nor cure you of your wound

514 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the
house of Judah I even I will tear and go away I will take away
and none shall rescue him

515 I will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their
offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me
early

61 Come and let us return unto the LORD for he hath torn and he
will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up

62 After two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise
us up and we shall live in his sight

63 Then shall we know if we follow on to know the LORD his going
forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the
rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth

64 O Ephraim what shall I do unto thee O Judah what shall I do
unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early
dew it goeth away

65 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets I have slain them by
the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth
forth

66 For I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God
more than burnt offerings

67 But they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they
dealt treacherously against me

68 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with
blood

69 And as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests
murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness

610 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel there is
the whoredom of Ephraim Israel is defiled

611 Also O Judah he hath set an harvest for thee when I returned
the captivity of my people

71 When I would have healed Israel then the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered and the wickedness of Samaria for they commit falsehood
and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without

72 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are
before my face

73 They make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes
with their lies

74 They are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who
