173 And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him

174 Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us
to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for
thee and one for Moses and one for Elias

175 While he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and
behold a voice out of the cloud which said This is my beloved Son
in whom I am well pleased hear ye him

176 And when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and
were sore afraid

177 And Jesus came and touched them and said Arise and be not
afraid

178 And when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save
Jesus only

179 And as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them
saying Tell the vision to no man until the Son of man be risen again
from the dead

1710 And his disciples asked him saying Why then say the scribes
that Elias must first come  1711 And Jesus answered and said unto
them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things

1712 But I say unto you That Elias is come already and they knew
him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed Likewise shall
also the Son of man suffer of them

1713 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
the Baptist

1714 And when they were come to the multitude there came to him a
certain man kneeling down to him and saying 1715 Lord have mercy
on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth
into the fire and oft into the water

1716 And I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him

1717 Then Jesus answered and said O faithless and perverse
generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you
bring him hither to me

1718 And Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the
child was cured from that very hour

1719 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said Why could not
we cast him out  1720 And Jesus said unto them Because of your
unbelief for verily I say unto you If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain Remove hence to yonder
place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you

1721 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting

1722 And while they abode in Galilee Jesus said unto them The Son
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men 1723 And they shall
kill him and the third day he shall be raised again

And they were exceeding sorry

1724 And when they were come to Capernaum they that received tribute
money came to Peter and said Doth not your master pay tribute
1725 He saith Yes And when he was come into the house Jesus
prevented him saying What thinkest thou Simon of whom do the kings
of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of
strangers  1726 Peter saith unto him Of strangers Jesus saith unto
him Then are the children free

1727 Notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea
and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when
thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that
take and give unto them for me and thee

181 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying Who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven  182 And Jesus called a little
child unto him and set him in the midst of them 183 And said
Verily I say unto you Except ye be converted and become as little
children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven

184 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven

185 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me

186 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea

187 Woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that
offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh  188
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast
them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
everlasting fire

189 And if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
