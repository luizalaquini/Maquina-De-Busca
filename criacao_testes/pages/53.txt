All Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept He looked across the room at Robert His old friend closer than any brother Please Robert For the love you bear me For the love you bore my sister Please

The king looked at them for a long moment then turned his eyes on his wife Damn you Cersei he said with loathing

Ned stood gently disengaging himself from Sansa’s grasp All the weariness of the past four days had returned to him Do it yourself then Robert he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel At least have the courage to do it yourself

Robert looked at Ned with flat dead eyes and left without a word his footsteps heavy as lead Silence filled the hall

Where is the direwolf Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone Beside her Prince Joffrey was smiling

The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse Your Grace Ser Barristan Selmy answered reluctantly

Send for Ilyn Payne

No Ned said Jory take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice The words tasted of bile in his throat but he forced them out If it must be done I will do it

Cersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously You Stark Is this some trick Why would you do such a thing

They were all staring at him but it was Sansa’s look that cut She is of the north She deserves better than a butcher

He left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter’s wails echoing in his ears and found the direwolf pup where they chained her Ned sat beside her for a while Lady he said tasting the name He had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked but looking at her now he knew that Sansa had chosen well She was the smallest of the litter the prettiest the most gentle and trusting She looked at him with bright golden eyes and he ruffled her thick grey fur

Shortly Jory brought him Ice

When it was over he said Choose four men and have them take the body north Bury her at Winterfell

All that way Jory said astonished

All that way Ned affirmed The Lannister woman shall never have this skin

He was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate back from their hunt

There was something slung over the back of his destrier a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak No sign of your daughter Hand the Hound rasped down but the day was not wholly wasted We got her little pet He reached back and shoved the burden off and it fell with a thump in front of Ned

Bending Ned pulled back the cloak dreading the words he would have to find for Arya but it was not Nymeria after all It was the butcher’s boy Mycah his body covered in dried blood He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above

You rode him down Ned said

The Hound’s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog’s-head helm He ran He looked at Ned’s face and laughed But not very fast





BRAN

It seemed as though he had been falling for years

Fly a voice whispered in the darkness but Bran did not know how to fly so all he could do was fall

Maester Luwin made a little boy of clay baked him till he was hard and brittle dressed him in Bran’s clothes and flung him off a roof Bran remembered the way he shattered But I never fall he said falling

The ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him but he could feel how fast he was falling and he knew what was waiting for him down there Even in dreams you could not fall forever He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground he knew You always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground
