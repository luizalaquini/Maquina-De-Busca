Sure there is Beetee and I have been following the
same rule book President Snow used when he hijacked
Peeta says Gale
Cruel but to the point I leave without further comment I
feel if I dont get outside immediately Ill just go ballistic but
Im still in Special Defense when Im waylaid by Haymitch
Come on he says We need you back up at the
hospital
What for I ask
Theyre going to try something on Peeta he answers
Send in the most innocuous person from Twelve they can
come up with Find someone Peeta might share childhood
memories with but nothing too close to you Theyre
screening people now
I know this will be a difficult task since anyone Peeta
shares childhood memories with would most likely be from
town and almost none of those people escaped the
flames But when we reach the hospital room that has been
turned into a work space for Peetas recovery team there
she sits chatting with Plutarch Delly Cartwright As always
she gives me a smile that suggests Im her best friend in
the world She gives this smile to everyone Katniss she
calls out
Hey Delly I say Id heard she and her younger
brother had survived Her parents who ran the shoe shop in
town werent as lucky She looks older wearing the drab
13 clothes that flatter no one with her long yellow hair in a
practical braid instead of curls Dellys a bit thinner than I
remember but she was one of the few kids in District 12
with a couple of pounds to spare The diet here the stress
the grief of losing her parents have all no doubt
contributed How are you doing I ask
Oh its been a lot of changes all at once Her eyes fill
with tears But everyones really nice here in Thirteen dont
you think
Delly means it She genuinely likes people All people
not just a select few shes spent years making up her mind
about
Theyve made an effort to make us feel welcome I
say I think thats a fair statement without going overboard
Are you the one theyve picked to see Peeta
I guess so Poor Peeta Poor you Ill never
understand the Capitol she says
Better not to maybe I tell her
Dellys known Peeta for a long time says Plutarch
Oh yes Dellys face brightens We played together
from when we were little I used to tell people he was my
brother
What do you think Haymitch asks me Anything that
might trigger memories of you
We were all in the same class But we never
overlapped much I say
Katniss was always so amazing I never dreamed she
would notice me says Delly The way she could hunt and
go in the Hob and everything Everyone admired her so
Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her
face to double-check if shes joking To hear Delly describe
it I had next to no friends because I intimidated people by
being so exceptional Not true I had next to no friends
because I wasnt friendly Leave it to Delly to spin me into
something wonderful
Delly always thinks the best of everyone I explain I
dont think Peeta could have bad memories associated
with her Then I remember Wait In the Capitol When I
lied about recognizing the Avox girl Peeta covered for me
and said she looked like Delly
I remember says Haymitch But I dont know It
wasnt true Delly wasnt actually there I dont think it can
compete with years of childhood memories
Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly
says Plutarch Lets give it a shot
Plutarch Haymitch and I go to the observation room
next to where Peetas confined Its crowded with ten
members of his recovery team armed with pens and
clipboards The one-way glass and audio setup allow us to
watch Peeta secretly He lies on the bed his arms
strapped down He doesnt fight the restraints but his
hands fidget continuously His expression seems more
lucid than when he tried to strangle me but its still not one
that belongs to him
When the door quietly opens his eyes widen in alarm
then become confused Delly crosses the room tentatively
but as she nears him she naturally breaks into a smile
Peeta Its Delly From home
Delly Some of the clouds seem to clear Delly Its
you
Yes she says with obvious relief How do you feel
Awful Where are we Whats happened asks
Peeta
Here we go says Haymitch
I told her to steer clear of any mention of Katniss or
the Capitol says Plutarch Just see how much of home
she could conjure up
Wellwere in District Thirteen We live here now
says Delly
Thats what those people have been saying But it
makes no sense Why arent we home asks Peeta
Delly bites her lip There wasan accident I miss
home badly too I was only just thinking about those chalk
drawings we used to do on the paving stones Yours were
