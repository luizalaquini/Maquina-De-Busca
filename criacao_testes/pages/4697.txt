The flames will burn so long as you live he heard Cersei call When they die so must you

Sister he shouted Stay with me Stay There was no reply but the soft sound of retreating footsteps

Brienne moved her longsword back and forth watching the silvery flames shift and shimmer Beneath her feet a reflection of the burning blade shone on the surface of the flat black water She was as tall and strong as he remembered yet it seemed to Jaime that she had more of a woman’s shape now

Do they keep a bear down here Brienne was moving slow and wary sword to hand step turn and listen Each step made a little splash A cave lion Direwolves Some bear Tell me Jaime What lives here What lives in the darkness

Doom No bear he knew No lion Only doom

In the cool silvery-blue light of the swords the big wench looked pale and fierce I mislike this place

I’m not fond of it myself Their blades made a little island of light but all around them stretched a sea of darkness unending My feet are wet

We could go back the way they brought us If you climbed on my shoulders you’d have no trouble reaching that tunnel mouth

Then I could follow Cersei He could feel himself growing hard at the thought and turned away so Brienne would not see

Listen She put a hand on his shoulder and he trembled at the sudden touch She’s warm Something comes Brienne lifted her sword to point off to his left There

He peered into the gloom until he saw it too Something was moving through the darkness he could not quite make it out   

A man on a horse No two Two riders side by side

Down here beneath the Rock It made no sense Yet there came two riders on pale horses men and mounts both armored The destriers emerged from the blackness at a slow walk They make no sound Jaime realized No splashing no clink of mail nor clop of hoof He remembered Eddard Stark riding the length of Aerys’s throne room wrapped in silence Only his eyes had spoken a lord’s eyes cold and grey and full of judgment

Is it you Stark Jaime called Come ahead I never feared you living I do not fear you dead

Brienne touched his arm There are more

He saw them too They were armored all in snow it seemed to him and ribbons of mist swirled back from their shoulders The visors of their helms were closed but Jaime Lannister did not need to look upon their faces to know them

Five had been his brothers Oswell Whent and Jon Darry Lewyn Martell a prince of Dorne The White Bull Gerold Hightower Ser Arthur Dayne Sword of the Morning And beside them crowned in mist and grief with his long hair streaming behind him rode Rhaegar Targaryen Prince of Dragonstone and rightful heir to the Iron Throne

You don’t frighten me he called turning as they split to either side of him He did not know which way to face I will fight you one by one or all together But who is there for the wench to duel She gets cross when you leave her out

I swore an oath to keep him safe she said to Rhaegar’s shade I swore a holy oath

We all swore oaths said Ser Arthur Dayne so sadly

The shades dismounted from their ghostly horses When they drew their longswords it made not a sound He was going to burn the city Jaime said To leave Robert only ashes

He was your king said Darry

You swore to keep him safe said Whent

And the children them as well said Prince Lewyn

Prince Rhaegar burned with a cold light now white now red now dark I left my wife and children in your hands

I never thought he’d hurt them Jaime’s sword was burning less brightly now I was with the king   

Killing the king said Ser Arthur

Cutting his throat said Prince Lewyn

The king you had sworn to die for said the White Bull

The fires that ran along the blade were guttering out and Jaime remembered what Cersei had said No Terror closed a hand about his throat Then his sword went dark and only Brienne’s burned as the ghosts came rushing in

No he said no no no Nooooooooo

Heart pounding he jerked awake and found himself in starry darkness amidst a grove of trees He could taste bile in his mouth and he was shivering with sweat hot and cold at once When he looked down for his sword hand his wrist ended in leather and linen wrapped snug around an ugly stump He felt sudden tears well up in his eyes I felt it I felt the strength in my fingers and the rough leather of the sword’s grip My hand   

My lord Qyburn knelt beside him his fatherly face all crinkly with concern What is it I heard you cry out

Steelshanks Walton stood above them tall and dour What is it Why did you scream

A dream    only a dream Jaime stared at the camp around him lost for a moment I was in the dark but I had my hand back He looked at the stump and felt sick all over again There’s no place like that beneath the Rock he thought His stomach was sour and empty and his head was pounding where he’d pillowed it against the stump

Qyburn felt his brow You still have a touch of fever

A fever dream Jaime reached up Help me Steelshanks took him by his good hand and pulled him to his feet

Another cup of dreamwine asked Qyburn

No I’ve dreamt enough this night He wondered how long it was till dawn Somehow he knew that if he closed his eyes he would be back in that dark wet place again

Milk of the poppy then And something for your fever You are still weak my lord You need to sleep To rest

That is the last thing I mean to do The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested his head The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before but now he saw that the wood was white It made him think of Winterfell and Ned Stark’s heart tree It was not him he thought It was never him But the stump was dead and so was Stark and so were all the others Prince Rhaegar and Ser Arthur and the children And Aerys Aerys is most dead of all Do you believe in ghosts Maester he asked Qyburn

The man’s face grew strange Once at the Citadel I came into an empty room and saw an empty chair Yet I knew a woman had been there only a moment before The cushion was dented where she’d sat the cloth was still warm and her scent lingered in the air If we leave our smells behind us when we leave a room surely something of our souls must remain when we leave this life Qyburn spread his hands The archmaesters did not like my thinking though Well Marwyn did but he was the only one

Jaime ran his fingers through his hair Walton he said saddle the horses I want to go back

Back Steelshanks regarded him dubiously

He thinks I’ve gone mad And perhaps I have I left something at Harrenhal

Lord Vargo holds it now Him and his Bloody Mummers

You have twice the men he does

If I don’t serve you up to your father as commanded Lord Bolton will have my hide We press on to King’s Landing

Once Jaime might have countered with a smile and a threat but one-handed cripples do not inspire much fear He wondered what his brother would do Tyrion would find a way Lannisters lie Steelshanks Didn’t Lord Bolton tell you that

The man frowned suspiciously What if he did
