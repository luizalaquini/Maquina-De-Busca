You said I had honor…

I’m the bloody Kingslayer remember When I say you have honor that’s like a whore vouchsafing your maidenhood He leaned back and looked up at her Steelshanks is on his way back north to deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton

You gave her to him she cried dismayed You swore an oath to Lady Catelyn…

With a sword at my throat but never mind Lady Catelyn’s dead I could not give her back her daughters even if I had them And the girl my father sent with Steelshanks was not Arya Stark

Not Arya Stark

You heard me My lord father found some skinny northern girl more or less the same age with more or less the same coloring He dressed her up in white and grey gave her a silver wolf to pin her cloak and sent her off to wed Bolton’s bastard He lifted his stump to point at her I wanted to tell you that before you went galloping off to rescue her and got yourself killed for no good purpose You’re not half bad with a sword but you’re not good enough to take on two hundred men by yourself

Brienne shook her head When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid him with false coin…

Oh he knows Lannisters lie remember It makes no matter this girl serves his purpose just as well Who is going to say that she isn’t Arya Stark Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for her sister who has disappeared

Why would you tell me all this if it’s true You are betraying your father’s secrets

The Hand’s secrets he thought I no longer have a father I pay my debts like every good little lion I did promise Lady Stark her daughters… and one of them is still alive My brother may know where she is but if so he isn’t saying Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped him murder Joffrey

The wench’s mouth got stubborn I will not believe that gentle girl a poisoner Lady Catelyn said that she had a loving heart It was your brother There was a trial Ser Loras said

Two trials actually Words and swords both failed him A bloody mess Did you watch from your window

My cell faces the sea I heard the shouting though

Prince Oberyn of Dorne is dead Ser Gregor Clegane lies dying and Tyrion stands condemned before the eyes of gods and men They’re keeping him in a black cell till they kill him

Brienne looked at him You do not believe he did it

Jaime gave her a hard smile See wench We know each other too well Tyrion’s wanted to be me since he took his first step but he’d never follow me in kingslaying Sansa Stark killed Joffrey My brother’s kept silent to protect her He gets these fits of gallantry from time to time The last one cost him a nose This time it will mean his head

No Brienne said It was not my lady’s daughter It could not have been her

There’s the stubborn stupid wench that I remember

She reddened My name is…

Brienne of Tarth Jaime sighed I have a gift for you He reached down under the Lord Commander’s chair and brought it out wrapped in folds of crimson velvet

Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite her reached out a huge freckled hand and flipped back a fold of cloth Rubies glimmered in the light She picked the treasure up gingerly curled her fingers around the leather grip and slowly slid the sword free of its scabbard Blood and black the ripples shone A finger of reflected light ran red along the edge Is this Valyrian steel I have never seen such colors

Nor I There was a time that I would have given my right hand to wield a sword like that Now it appears I have so the blade is wasted on me Take it Before she could think to refuse he went on A sword so fine must bear a name It would please me if you would call this one Oathkeeper One more thing The blade comes with a price

Her face darkened I told you I will never serve…

…such foul creatures as us Yes I recall Hear me out Brienne Both of us swore oaths concerning Sansa Stark Cersei means to see that the girl is found and killed wherever she has gone to ground…

Brienne’s homely face twisted in fury If you believe that I would harm my lady’s daughter for a sword you—

Just listen he snapped angered by her assumption I want you to find Sansa first and get her somewhere safe How else are the two of us going to make good our stupid vows to your precious dead Lady Catelyn

The wench blinked I… I thought…
