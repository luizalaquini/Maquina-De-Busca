the men marked her light laugh and apology as she met
him he took her into the house and the door closed
again
Gracious heaven I didnt know it was like that with
him said one of the men I thought that fancy of
his was over long ago
You dont know much of master if you thought
that said Samway
I wouldnt he should know we heard what a said
for the world remarked a third
I wish we had told of the report at once the first
uneasily continued More harm may come of this than
we know of Poor Mr Boldwood it will be hard upon
en I wish Troy was in  --  --  Well God forgive me
for such a wish A scoundrel to play a poor wife such
tricks Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he
came here And now Ive no heart to go in Lets
look into Warrens for a few minutes first shall us
neighbours
Samway Tall and Smallbury agreed to go to Warrens
and went out at the gate the remaining ones entering
the house The three soon drew near the malt-house
approaching it from the adjoining orchard and not by
way of the street The pane of glass was illuminated
as usual Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest
when pausing he turned suddenly to his companions
and said Hist See there
P 432
The light from the pane was now perceived to be
shining not upon the ivied wall as usual but upon some
object close to the glass It was a human face
Lets come closer whispered Samway and they
approached on tiptoe There was no disbelieving the
report any longer Troys face was almost close to the
pane and he was looking in Not only was he looking in
but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation
which was in progress in the malt-house the voices of
the interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster
The spree is all in her honour isnt it -- hey said
the old man Although he made believe tis only
keeping up o Christmas
I cannot say replied Oak
O tis true enough faith I cannot understand
Farmer Boldwood being such a fool at his time of life
as to ho and hanker after thik woman in the way a do
and she not care a bit about en
The men after recognizing Troys features withdrew
across the orchard as quietly as they had come The
air was big with Bathshebas fortunes to-night  every
word everywhere concerned her When they were quite
out of earshot all by one instinct paused
It gave me quite a turn -- his face said Tall
breathing
And so it did me said Samway Whats to be
done
I dont see that tis any busincss of ours Smallbury
murmured dubiously
But it is Tis a thing which is everybodys business
said Samway We know very well that masters on a
wrong tack and that shes quite in the dark and we
should let em know at once Laban you know her
best -- youd better go and ask to speak to her
I baint fit for any such thing said Laban nervously
I should think William ought to do it if anybody Hes
oldest
I shall have nothing to do with it said Smallbury
Tis a ticklish business altogether Why hell go on
to her himself in a few minutes yell see
We dont know that he will Come Laban
P 433
Very well if I must I must I suppose Tall reluct+
antly answered What must I say
Just ask to see master
O no I shant speak to Mr Boldwood If I tell
anybody twill be mistress
Very well said Samway
Laban then went to the door When he opened it
the hum of bustle rolled out as a wave upon a still
strand -- the assemblage being immediately inside the
hali-and was deadened to a murmur as he closed it
again Each man waited intently and looked around at
the dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and
occasionally shivering in a slight wind as if he took
interest in the scene which neither did One of them
began walking up and down and then came to where
he started from and stopped again with a sense that
walking was thing not worth doing now
I should think Laban must have seen mistress by
this time said Smallbury breaking the silence Per+
haps she wont come and speak to him
The door opened Tall appeared and joined them
Well said both
I didnt like to ask for her after all Laban faltered
out They were all in such a stir trying to put a little
spirit into the party Somehow the fun seems to hang
fire though everythings there that a heart can desire
and I couldnt for my soul interfere and throw damp
upon it -- if twas to save my life I couldnt
I suppose we had better all go in together said
Samway gloomily Perhaps I may have a chance of
