and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira+
tion from their foreheads and cheeks Drought was
everywhere else
They were about to withdraw for a while into the
charitable shade of a tree in the fence when Coggan
saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running
to them across the field
I wonder who that is he said
I hope nothing is wrong about mistress said
Maryann who with some other women was tying the
bundles oats being always sheafed on this farm but
an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning
l went to unlock the door and dropped the key and it
fell upon the stone floor and broke into two pieces
Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement I wish misess
was home
Tis Cain Ball said Gabriel pausing from whetting
his reaphook
Oak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the
corn-field but the harvest month is an anxious time for
P 275
a farmer and the corn was Bathshebas so he lent a
hand
Hes dressed up in his best clothes said Matthew
Moon He hev been away from home for a few days
since hes had that felon upon his finger for a said
since I cant work Ill have a hollerday
  A good time for one -- a excellent time said Joseph
Poorgrass straightening his back for he like some of
the others had a way of resting a while from his labour
on such hot days for reasons preternaturally small of
which Cain Palls advent on a week-day in his Sunday+
clothes was one of the first magnitude Twas a bad leg
allowed me to read the Pilgrims Progress and Mark
Clark learnt AliFours in a whitlow
Ay and my father put his arm out of joint to have
time to go courting said Jan Coggan in an eclipsing
tone wiping his face with his shirt-sleeve and thrusting
back his hat upon the nape of his neck
By this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters
and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread
and ham in one hand from which he took mouthfuls
as he ran the other being wrapped in a bandage
When he came close his mouth assumed the bell shape
and he began to cough violently
   Now Cainy said Gabriel sternly  How many
more times must I tell you to keep from running so fast
when you be eating Youll choke yourself some day
thats what youll do Cain Ball
 Hok-hok-hok  replied Cain A crumb of my
victuals went the wrong way -- hok-hok Thats what
tis Mister Oak And Ive been visiting to Bath
because I had a felon on my thumb yes and lve
seen -- ahok-hok
Directly Cain mentioned Bath they all threw down
their hooks and forks and drew round him Un+
fortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his
narrative powers and a supplementary hindrance was
that of a sneeze jerking from his pocket his rather large
watch which dangled in front of the young man
pendulum-wise
P 276
 Yes he continued directing his thoughts to Bath
and letting his eyes follow lve seed the world at last
 -- yes -- and Ive seed our misess -- ahok-hok-hok  
 Bother the boy  said Gabriel  Something is
always going the wrong way down your throat so that
you cant tell whats necessary to be told
Ahok  there  Please Mister Oak a gnat have
just fleed into my stomach and brought the cough on
again  
Yes thats just it Your mouth is always open you
young rascal  
Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat
pore boy   said Matthew Moon
 Well at Bath you saw --  --  prompted Gabriel
I saw our mistress continued the junior shepherd
and a sojer walking along And bymeby they got
closer and closer and then they went arm-in-crook like
courting complete -- hok-hok  like courting complete --
hok  -- courting complete --  --  Losing the thread of his
narrative at this point simultaneously with his loss of
breath their informant looked up and down the field
apparently for some clue to it Well I see our misess
and a soldier -- a-ha-a-wk  
A HARBlNGER
Damn the boy  said Gabriel
Tis only my manner Mister Oak if yell excuse it
said Cain Ball looking reproachfully at Oak with eyes
drenched in their own dew
Heres some cider for him -- thatll cure his throat
said Jan Coggan lifting a flagon of cider pulling out
the cork and applying the hole to Cainys mouth
Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think
apprehensively of the serious consequences that would
follow Cainy Balls strangulation in his cough and the
history of his Bath adventures dying with him
For my poor self I always say please God  afore
I do anything said Joseph in an unboastful voice   and
so should you Cain Ball Tis a great safeguard and
