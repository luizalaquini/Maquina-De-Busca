Dany kissed him on the cheek and sent him on his way

That night her handmaids brought her lamb with a salad of raisins and carrots soaked in wine and a hot flaky bread dripping with honey She could eat none of it Did Rhaegar ever grow so weary she wondered Did Aegon after his conquest

Later when the time came for sleep Dany took Irri into bed with her for the first time since the ship But even as she shuddered in release and wound her fingers through her handmaid’s thick black hair she pretended it was Drogo holding her… only somehow his face kept turning into Daario’s If I want Daario I need only say so She lay with Irri’s legs entangled in her own His eyes looked almost purple today…

Dany’s dreams were dark that night and she woke three times from half-remembered nightmares After the third time she was too restless to return to sleep Moonlight streamed through the slanting windows silvering the marble floors A cool breeze was blowing through the open terrace doors Irri slept soundly beside her her lips slightly parted one dark brown nipple peeping out above the sleeping silks For a moment Dany was tempted but it was Drogo she wanted or perhaps Daario Not Irri The maid was sweet and skillful but all her kisses tasted of duty

She rose leaving Irri asleep in the moonlight Jhiqui and Missandei slept in their own beds Dany slipped on a robe and padded barefoot across the marble floor out onto the terrace The air was chilly but she liked the feel of grass between her toes and the sound of the leaves whispering to one another Wind ripples chased each other across the surface of the little bathing pool and made the moon’s reflection dance and shimmer

She leaned against a low brick parapet to look down upon the city Meereen was sleeping too Lost in dreams of kinder days perhaps Night covered the streets like a black blanket hiding the corpses and the grey rats that came up from the sewers to feast on them the swarms of stinging flies Distant torches glimmered red and yellow where her sentries walked their rounds and here and there she saw the faint glow of lanterns bobbing down an alley Perhaps one was Ser Jorah leading his horse slowly toward the gate Farewell old bear Farewell betrayer

She was Daenerys Stormborn the Unburnt khaleesi and queen Mother of Dragons slayer of warlocks breaker of chains and there was no one in the world that she could trust

Your Grace Missandei stood at her elbow wrapped in a bedrobe wooden sandals on her feet I woke and saw that you were gone Did you sleep well What are you looking at

My city said Dany I was looking for a house with a red door but by night all the doors are black

A red door Missandei was puzzled What house is this

No house It does not matter Dany took the younger girl by the hand Never lie to me Missandei Never betray me

I never would Missandei promised Look dawn comes

The sky had turned a cobalt blue from the horizon to the zenith and behind the line of low hills to the east a glow could be seen pale gold and oyster pink Dany held Missandei’s hand as they watched the sun come up All the grey bricks became red and yellow and blue and green and orange The scarlet sands of the fighting pits transformed them into bleeding sores before her eyes Elsewhere the golden dome of the Temple of the Graces blazed bright and bronze stars winked along the walls where the light of the rising sun touched the spikes on the helms of the Unsullied On the terrace a few flies stirred sluggishly A bird began to chirp in the persimmon tree and then two more Dany cocked her head to hear their song but it was not long before the sounds of the waking city drowned them out

The sounds of my city

That morning she summoned her captains and commanders to the garden rather than descending to the audience chamber Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros but afterward he gave them peace prosperity and justice But all I have brought to Slaver’s Bay is death and ruin I have been more khal than queen smashing and plundering then moving on

There is nothing to stay for said Brown Ben Plumm

Your Grace the slavers brought their doom on themselves said Daario Naharis

You have brought freedom as well Missandei pointed out

Freedom to starve asked Dany sharply Freedom to die Am I a dragon or a harpy Am I mad Do I have the taint

A dragon Ser Barristan said with certainty Meereen is not Westeros Your Grace

But how can I rule seven kingdoms if I cannot rule a single city He had no answer to that Dany turned away from them to gaze out over the city once again My children need time to heal and learn My dragons need time to grow and test their wings And I need the same I will not let this city go the way of Astapor I will not let the harpy of Yunkai chain up those I’ve freed all over again She turned back to look at their faces I will not march

What will you do then Khaleesi asked Rakharo

Stay she said Rule And be a queen
