Led by the Florents I’d wager said Littlefinger

Varys gave him a simpering smile You would win my lord Lord Alester was indeed the first to bend the knee Many others followed

Many Tyrion said pointedly but not all

Not all agreed the eunuch Not Loras Tyrell nor Randyll Tarly nor Mathis Rowan And Storm’s End itself has not yielded Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly’s name and will not believe his liege is dead He demands to see the mortal remains before he opens his gates but it seems that Renly’s corpse has unaccountably vanished Carried away most likely A fifth of Renly’s knights departed with Ser Loras rather than bend the knee to Stannis It’s said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw his king’s body and slew three of Renly’s guards in his wrath among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce

A pity he stopped at three thought Tyrion

Ser Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge Varys went on His sister is there Renly’s queen as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless Which side will they take now A ticklish question Many serve the lords who remained at Storm’s End and those lords now belong to Stannis

Tyrion leaned forward There is a chance here it seems to me Win Loras Tyrell to our cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well They may have sworn their swords to Stannis for the moment yet they cannot love the man or they would have been his from the start

Is their love for us any greater asked Cersei

Scarcely said Tyrion They loved Renly clearly but Renly is slain Perhaps we can give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer Joffrey to Stannis… if we move quickly

What sort of reasons do you mean to give them

Gold reasons Littlefinger suggested at once

Varys made a tsking sound Sweet Petyr surely you do not mean to suggest that these puissant lords and noble knights could be bought like so many chickens in the market

Have you been to our markets of late Lord Varys asked Littlefinger You’d find it easier to buy a lord than a chicken I daresay Of course lords cluck prouder than chickens and take it ill if you offer them coin like a tradesman but they are seldom adverse to taking gifts… honors lands castles…

Bribes might sway some of the lesser lords Tyrion said but never Highgarden

True Littlefinger admitted The Knight of Flowers is the key there Mace Tyrell has two older sons but Loras has always been his favorite Win him and Highgarden will be yours

Yes Tyrion thought It seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly We can win the Tyrell alliance as he did With a marriage

Varys understood the quickest You think to wed King Joffrey to Margaery Tyrell

I do Renly’s young queen was no more than fifteen sixteen he seemed to recall… older than Joffrey but a few years were nothing it was so neat and sweet he could taste it

Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark Cersei objected

Marriage contracts can be broken What advantage is there in wedding the king to the daughter of a dead traitor

Littlefinger spoke up You might point out to His Grace that the Tyrells are much wealthier than the Starks and that Margaery is said to be lovely… and beddable besides

Yes said Tyrion Joff ought to like that well enough

My son is too young to care about such things

You think so asked Tyrion He’s thirteen Cersei The same age at which I married

You shamed us all with that sorry episode Joffrey is made of finer stuff

So fine that he had Ser Boros rip off Sansa’s gown

He was angry with the girl
