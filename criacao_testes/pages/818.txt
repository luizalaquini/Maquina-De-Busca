By the causeway Against Moat Cailin

He gave her an enigmatic smile That’s one way to go he said and she knew from his tone that he would say no more A wise king keeps his own counsel she reminded herself

They reached Oldstones after eight more days of steady rain and made their camp upon the hill overlooking the Blue Fork within a ruined stronghold of the ancient river kings Its foundations remained amongst the weeds to show where the walls and keeps had stood but the local smallfolk had long ago made off with most of the stones to raise their barns and septs and holdfasts Yet in the center of what once would have been the castle’s yard a great carved sepulcher still rested half hidden in waist-high brown grass amongst a stand of ash

The lid of the sepulcher had been carved into a likeness of the man whose bones lay beneath but the rain and the wind had done their work The king had worn a beard they could see but otherwise his face was smooth and featureless with only vague suggestions of a mouth a nose eyes and the crown about the temples His hands folded over the shaft of a stone warhammer that lay upon his chest Once the warhammer would have been carved with runes that told its name and history but all that the centuries had worn away The stone itself was cracked and crumbling at the corners discolored here and there by spreading white splotches of lichen while wild roses crept up over the king’s feet almost to his chest

It was there that Catelyn found Robb standing somber in the gathering dusk with only Grey Wind beside him The rain had stopped for once and he was bareheaded Does this castle have a name he asked quietly when she came up to him

Oldstones all the smallfolk called it when I was a girl but no doubt it had some other name when it was still a hall of kings She had camped here once with her father on their way to Seagard Petyr was with us too…

There’s a song he remembered ‘Jenny of Oldstones with the flowers in her hair’

We’re all just songs in the end If we are lucky She had played at being Jenny that day had even wound flowers in her hair And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies Catelyn could not have been more than twelve Petyr just a boy

Robb studied the sepulcher Whose grave is this

Here lies Tristifer the Fourth of His Name King of the Rivers and the Hills Her father had told her his story once He ruled from the Trident to the Neck thousands of years before Jenny and her prince in the days when the kingdoms of the First Men were falling one after the other before the onslaught of the Andals The Hammer of justice they called him He fought a hundred battles and won nine-and-ninety or so the singers say and when he raised this castle it was the strongest in Westeros She put a hand on her son’s shoulder He died in his hundredth battle when seven Andal kings joined forces against him The fifth Tristifer was not his equal and soon the kingdom was lost and then the castle and last of all the line With Tristifer the Fifth died House Mudd that had ruled the riverlands for a thousand years before the Andals came

His heir failed him Robb ran a hand over the rough weathered stone I had hoped to leave Jeyne with child… we tried often enough but I’m not certain…

It does not always happen the first time Though it did with you Nor even the hundredth You are very young

Young and a king he said A king must have an heir If I should die in my next battle the kingdom must not die with me By law Sansa is next in line of succession so Winterfell and the north would pass to her His mouth tightened To her and her lord husband Tyrion Lannister I cannot allow that I will not allow that That dwarf must never have the north

No Catelyn agreed You must name another heir until such time as Jeyne gives you a son She considered a moment Your father’s father had no siblings but his father had a sister who married a younger son of Lord Raymar Royce of the junior branch They had three daughters all of whom wed Vale lordlings A Waynwood and a Corbray for certain The youngest… it might have been a Templeton but…

Mother There was a sharpness in Robb’s tone You forget My father had four sons

She had not forgotten she had not wanted to look at it yet there it was A Snow is not a Stark

Jon’s more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never so much as set eyes on Winterfell

Jon is a brother of the Night’s Watch sworn to take no wife and hold no lands Those who take the black serve for life

So do the knights of the Kingsguard That did not stop the Lannisters from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros Blount when they had no more use for them If I send the Watch a hundred men in Jon’s place I’ll wager they find some way to release him from his vows

He is set on this Catelyn knew how stubborn her son could be A bastard cannot inherit

Not unless he’s legitimized by a royal decree said Robb There is more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from his oath

Precedent she said bitterly Yes Aegon the Fourth legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed And how much pain grief war and murder grew from that I know you trust Jon But can you trust his sons Or their sons The Blackfyre pretenders troubled the Targaryens for five generations until Barristan the Bold slew the last of them on the Stepstones If you make Jon legitimate there is no way to turn him bastard again Should he wed and breed any sons you may have by Jeyne will never be safe

Jon would never harm a son of mine

No more than Theon Greyjoy would harm Bran or Rickon

Grey Wind leapt up atop King Tristifer’s crypt his teeth bared Robb’s own face was cold That is as cruel as it is unfair Jon is no Theon

So you pray Have you considered your sisters What of their rights I agree that the north must not be permitted to pass to the Imp but what of Arya By law she comes after Sansa… your own sister trueborn…

…and dead No one has seen or heard of Arya since they cut Father’s head off Why do you lie to yourself Arya’s gone the same as Bran and Rickon and they’ll kill Sansa too once the dwarf gets a child from her Jon is the only brother that remains to me Should I die without issue I want him to succeed me as King in the North I had hoped you would support my choice
