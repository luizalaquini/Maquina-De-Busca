On their iron spikes atop the gatehouse the heads waited

Theon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on his cloak with small ghostly hands The miller’s boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon alike in size and coloring and once Reek had flayed the skin from their faces and dipped their heads in tar it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh People were such fools If we’d said they were rams’ heads they would have seen horns





SANSA

They had been singing in the sept all morning since the first report of enemy sails had reached the castle The sound of their voices mingled with the whicker of horses the clank of steel and the groaning hinges of the great bronze gates to make a strange and fearful music In the sept they sing for the Mother’s mercy but on the walls it’s the Warrior they pray to and all in silence She remembered how Septa Mordane used to tell them that the Warrior and the Mother were only two faces of the same great god But if there is only one whose prayers will be heard

Ser Meryn Trant held the blood bay for Joffrey to mount Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate with matching golden lions on their heads The pale sunlight flashed off the golds and reds every time Joff moved Bright shining and empty Sansa thought

The Imp was mounted on a red stallion armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in his father’s clothes But there was nothing childish about the battle-axe slung below his shield Ser Mandon Moore rode at his side white steel icy bright When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way Lady Sansa he called from the saddle surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor’s

She has my lord but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off I mean to visit the sept as well to pray

I won’t ask for whom His mouth twisted oddly if that was a smile it was the queerest she had ever seen This day may change all For you as well as for House Lannister I ought to have sent you off with Tommen now that I think on it Still you should be safe enough in Maegor’s so long as—

Sansa The boyish shout rang across the yard Joffrey had seen her Sansa here

He calls me as if he were calling a dog she thought

His Grace has need of you Tyrion Lannister observed We’ll talk again after the battle if the gods permit

Sansa threaded her way through a file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned her closer It will be battle soon everyone says so

May the gods have mercy on us all

My uncle’s the one who will need mercy but I won’t give him any Joffrey drew his sword The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart set between a lion’s jaws Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade My new blade Hearteater

He’d owned a sword named Lion’s Tooth once Sansa remembered Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river I hope Stannis does the same with this one It is beautifully wrought Your Grace

Bless my steel with a kiss He extended the blade down to her Go on kiss it

He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy Sansa touched her lips to the metal thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey The gesture seemed to please him though He sheathed the blade with a flourish You’ll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle’s blood

Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you Three of the White Swords would go with Joffrey and his uncle Ser Meryn Ser Mandon and Ser Osmund Kettleblack Will you lead your knights into battle Sansa asked hoping

I would but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river I’ll command the Three Whores though I’m going to see to the traitors myself The prospect made Joff smile His plump pink lips always made him look pouty Sansa had liked that once but now it made her sick

They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest she said recklessly Though he’s older than Your Grace to be sure A man grown

That made him frown I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle I’ll gut him with Hearteater you’ll see He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the gate Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left the gold cloaks following four abreast The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear The guards saw them off with shouts and cheers When the last was gone a sudden stillness settled over the yard like the hush before a storm

Through the quiet the singing pulled at her Sansa turned toward the sept Two stableboys followed and one of the guards whose watch was ended Others fell in behind them

Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded nor so brightly lit great shafts of rainbow-colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows and candles burned on every side their little flames twinkling like stars The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s swam in light but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face    for what was Stannis Baratheon if not the Stranger come to judge them Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn lighting a candle at each altar and then found herself a place on the benches between a wizened old washerwoman and a boy no older than Rickon dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight’s son The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus the boy’s small and soft but it was good to have someone to hold on to The air was hot and heavy smelling of incense and sweat crystal-kissed and candle-bright it made her dizzy to breathe it

She knew the hymn her mother had taught it to her once a long time ago in Winterfell She joined her voice to theirs

Gentle Mother font of mercy

save our sons from war we pray

stay the swords and stay the arrows

let them know a better day

Gentle Mother strength of women

help our daughters through this fray

soothe the wrath and tame the fury

teach us all a kinder way

Across the city thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill and they would be singing too their voices swelling out over the city across the river and up into the sky Surely the gods must hear us she thought

Sansa knew most of the hymns and followed along on those she did not know as best she could She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives with serving girls and soldiers cooks and falconers knights and knaves squires and spit boys and nursing mothers She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without sang with all the city She sang for mercy for the living and the dead alike for Bran and Rickon and Robb for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow away off on the Wall She sang for her mother and her father for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully for her friend Jeyne Poole for old drunken King Robert for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today and for the children and the wives who would mourn them and finally toward the end she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound He is no true knight but he saved me all the same she told the Mother Save him if you can and gentle the rage inside him

But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend their true and noble king Sansa got to her feet The aisles were jammed with people She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword and shield the Warrior to give him courage the Father to defend him in his need Let his sword break and his shield shatter Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors let his courage fail him and every man desert him

A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements but otherwise the castle seemed empty Sansa stopped and listened Away off she could hear the sounds of battle The singing almost drowned them out but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear the deep moan of warhorns the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones the splashes and splinterings the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-headed shafts    and beneath it all the cries of dying men

It was another sort of song a terrible song Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over her ears and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe At the foot of the drawbridge she came upon Lady Tanda and her two daughters Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a small troop of soldiers She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge but Lollys clung to her maid sobbing I don’t want to I don’t want to I don’t want to

The battle is begun Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice

I don’t want to I don’t want to

There was no way Sansa could avoid them She greeted them courteously May I be of help

Lady Tanda flushed with shame No my lady but we thank you kindly You must forgive my daughter she has not been well

I don’t want to Lollys clutched at her maid a slender pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat onto those iron spikes Please please I don’t want to

Sansa spoke to her gently We’ll all be thrice protected inside and there’s to be food and drink and song as well

Lollys gaped at her mouth open She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet with tears I don’t want to

You have to her sister Falyse said sharply and that is the end of it Shae help me They each took an elbow and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge Sansa followed with their mother She’s been sick Lady Tanda said If a babe can be termed a sickness Sansa thought It was common gossip that Lollys was with child

The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords Another sat at the foot of the stair—a real guard would have been standing not sitting on a step with his halberd across his knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside

The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand but it could still seat a hundred and it made up in grace what it lacked in space Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce so the torches burned twice as bright the walls were paneled in richly carved wood and sweet-smelling rushes covered the floors From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and fiddle A line of arched windows ran along the south wall but they had been closed off with heavy draperies Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light and would muffle the sound of prayer and war alike It makes no matter Sansa thought The war is with us

Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables along with a handful of old men and young boys The women were wives daughters mothers and sisters Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis Many would not return The air was heavy with the knowledge As Joffrey’s betrothed Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail and held his sword before him her father’s greatsword Ice near as tall as he was Its point rested on the floor and his hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip Sansa’s breath caught in her throat Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare He turned his gaunt pox-ravaged face toward her
