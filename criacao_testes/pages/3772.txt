Only six Winterfell men remained of the twenty her father had sent west with Beric Dondarrion Harwin told her and they were scattered It was a trap milady Lord Tywin sent his Mountain across the Red Fork with fire and sword hoping to draw your lord father He planned for Lord Eddard to come west himself to deal with Gregor Clegane If he had he would have been killed or taken prisoner and traded for the Imp who was your lady mother’s captive at the time Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord Tywin’s plan and when he heard about his brother’s capture he attacked your father in the streets of King’s Landing

I remember said Arya He killed Jory Jory had always smiled at her when he wasn’t telling her to get from underfoot

He killed Jory Harwin agreed and your father’s leg was broken when his horse fell on him So Lord Eddard couldn’t go west He sent Lord Beric instead with twenty of his own men and twenty from Winterfell me among them There were others besides Thoros and Ser Raymun Darry and their men Ser Gladden Wylde a lord named Lothar Mallery But Gregor was waiting for us at the Mummer’s Ford with men concealed on both banks As we crossed he fell upon us from front and rear

I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that it took Darry’s arm off at the elbow and killed the horse beneath him too Gladden Wylde died there with him and Lord Mallery was ridden down and drowned We had lions on every side and I thought I was doomed with the rest but Alyn shouted commands and restored order to our ranks and those still a horse rallied around Thoros and cut our way free Six score we’d been that morning By dark no more than two score were left and Lord Beric was gravely wounded Thoros drew a foot of lance from his chest that night and poured boiling wine into the hole it left

Every man of us was certain his lordship would be dead by daybreak But Thoros prayed with him all night beside the fire and when dawn came he was still alive and stronger than he’d been It was a fortnight before he could mount a horse but his courage kept us strong He told us that our war had not ended at the Mummer’s Ford but only begun there and that every man of ours who’d fallen would be avenged tenfold

By then the fighting had passed by us The Mountain’s men were only the van of Lord Tywin’s host They crossed the Red Fork in strength and swept up into the riverlands burning everything in their path We were so few that all we could do was harry their rear but we told each other that we’d join up with King Robert when he marched west to crush Lord Tywin’s rebellion Only then we heard that Robert was dead and Lord Eddard as well and Cersei Lannister’s whelp had ascended the Iron Throne

That turned the whole world on its head We’d been sent out by the King’s Hand to deal with outlaws you see but now we were the outlaws and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King There was some wanted to yield then but Lord Beric wouldn’t hear of it We were still king’s men he said and these were the king’s people the lions were savaging If we could not fight for Robert we would fight for them until every man of us was dead And so we did but as we fought something queer happened For every man we lost two showed up to take his place A few were knights or squires of gentle birth but most were common men—fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps servants and shoemakers even two septons Men of all sorts and women too children dogs…

Dogs said Arya

Aye Harwin grinned One of our lads keeps the meanest dogs you’d ever want to see

I wish I had a good mean dog said Arya wistfully A lion-killing dog She’d had a direwolf once Nymeria but she’d thrown rocks at her until she fled to keep the queen from killing her Could a direwolf kill a lion she wondered

It rained again that afternoon and long into the evening Thankfully the outlaws had secret friends all over so they did not need to camp out in the open or seek shelter beneath some leaky bower as she and Hot Pie and Gendry had done so often

That night they sheltered in a burned abandoned village At least it seemed to be abandoned until Jack-Be-Lucky blew two short blasts and two long ones on his hunting horn Then all sorts of people came crawling out of the ruins and up from secret cellars They had ale and dried apples and some stale barley bread and the outlaws had a goose that Anguy had brought down on the ride so supper that night was almost a feast

Arya was sucking the last bit of meat off a wing when one of the villagers turned to Lem Lemoncloak and said There were men through here not two days past looking for the Kingslayer

Lem snorted They’d do better looking in Riverrun Down in the deepest dungeons where it’s nice and damp His nose looked like a squashed apple red and raw and swollen and his mood was foul

No another villager said He’s escaped

The Kingslayer Arya could feel the hair on the back of her neck prickling She held her breath to listen

Could that be true Tom o’ Sevens said

I’ll not believe it said the one-eyed man in the rusty pothelm The other outlaws called him Jack-Be-Lucky though losing an eye didn’t seem very lucky to Arya I’ve had me a taste o’ them dungeons How could he escape

The villagers could only shrug at that Greenbeard stroked his thick grey-and-green whiskers and said The wolves will drown in blood if the Kingslayer’s loose again Thoros must be told The Lord of Light will show him Lannister in the flames

There’s a fine fire burning here said Anguy smiling

Greenbeard laughed and cuffed the archer’s ear Do I look a priest to you Archer When Pello of Tyrosh peers into the fire the cinders singe his beard

Lem cracked his knuckles and said Wouldn’t Lord Beric love to capture Jaime Lannister though…

Would he hang him Lem one of the village women asked It’d be half a shame to hang a man as pretty as that one

A trial first said Anguy Lord Beric always gives them a trial you know that He smiled Then he hangs them

There was laughter all around Then Tom drew his fingers across the strings of his woodharp and broke into soft song





The brothers of the Kingswood

they were an outlaw band

The forest was their castle

but they roamed across the land

No man’s gold was safe from them

nor any maiden’s hand

Oh the brothers of the Kingswood

that fearsome outlaw band…





Warm and dry in a corner between Gendry and Harwin Arya listened to the singing for a time then closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep She dreamt of home not Riverrun but Winterfell It was not a good dream though She was alone outside the castle up to her knees in mud She could see the grey walls ahead of her but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before and the castle faded before her until it looked more like smoke than granite And there were wolves as well gaunt grey shapes stalking through the trees all around her their eyes shining Whenever she looked at them she remembered the taste of blood

The next morning they left the road to cut across the fields The wind was gusting sending dry brown leaves swirling around the hooves of their horses but for once it did not rain When the sun came out from behind a cloud it was so bright Arya had to pull her hood forward to keep it out of her eyes

She reined up very suddenly We are going the wrong way

Gendry groaned What is it moss again

Look at the sun she said We’re going south Arya rummaged in her saddlebag for the map so she could show them We should never have left the Trident See She unrolled the map on her leg All of them were looking at her now See there’s Riverrun between the rivers

As it happens said Jack-Be-Lucky we know where Riverrun is Every man o’ us

You’re not going to Riverrun Lem told her bluntly

I was almost there Arya thought I should have let them take our horses I could have walked the rest of the way She remembered her dream then and bit her lip

Ah don’t look so hurt child said Tom Sevenstrings No harm will come to you you have my word on that

The word of a liar

No one lied said Lem We made no promises It’s not for us to say what’s to be done with you

Lem was not the leader though no more than Tom that was Greenbeard the Tyroshi Arya turned to face him Take me to Riverrun and you’ll be rewarded she said desperately

Little one Greenbeard answered a peasant may skin a common squirrel for his pot but if he finds a gold squirrel in his tree he takes it to his lord or he will wish he did
