He looked at her uncomfortably My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal—

That’s not so He loved my lady mother

I’m sure he did my lady but—

She was the only one he loved

He must have found that bastard under a cabbage leaf then Gendry said behind them

Arya wished she had another crabapple to bounce off his face My father had honor she said angrily And we weren’t talking to you anyway Why don’t you go back to Stoney Sept and ring that girl’s stupid bells

Gendry ignored that At least your father raised his bastard not like mine I don’t even know my father’s name Some smelly drunk I’d wager like the others my mother dragged home from the alehouse Whenever she got mad at me she’d say ‘If your father was here he’d beat you bloody’ That’s all I know of him He spat Well if he was here now might be I’d beat him bloody But he’s dead I figure and your father’s dead too so what does it matter who he lay with

It mattered to Arya though she could not have said why Ned was trying to apologize for upsetting her but she did not want to hear it She pressed her heels into her horse and left them both Anguy the Archer was riding a few yards ahead When she caught up with him she said Dornishmen lie don’t they

They’re famous for it The bowman grinned Of course they say the same of us marchers so there you are What’s the trouble now Ned’s a good lad   

He’s just a stupid liar Arya left the trail leapt a rotten log and splashed across a streambed ignoring the shouts of the outlaws behind her They just want to tell me more lies She thought about trying to get away from them but there were too many and they knew these lands too well What was the use of running if they caught you

It was Harwin who rode up beside her in the end Where do you think you’re going milady You shouldn’t run off There are wolves in these woods and worse things

I’m not afraid she said That boy Ned said   

Aye he told me Lady Ashara Dayne It’s an old tale that one I heard it once at Winterfell when I was no older than you are now He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around I doubt there’s any truth to it But if there is what of it When Ned met this Dornish lady his brother Brandon was still alive and it was him betrothed to Lady Catelyn so there’s no stain on your father’s honor There’s nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot so maybe some words were whispered in a tent of a night who can say Words or kisses maybe more but where’s the harm in that Spring had come or so they thought and neither one of them was pledged

She killed herself though said Arya uncertainly Ned says she jumped from a tower into the sea

So she did Harwin admitted as he led her back but that was for grief I’d wager She’d lost a brother the Sword of the Morning He shook his head Let it lie my lady They’re dead all of them Let it lie    and please when we come to Riverrun say naught of this to your mother

The village was just where Notch had promised it would be They took shelter in a grey stone stable Only half a roof remained but that was half a roof more than any other building in the village It’s not a village it’s only black stones and old bones Did the Lannisters kill the people who lived here Arya asked as she helped Anguy dry the horses

No He pointed Look at how thick the moss grows on the stones No one’s moved them for a long time And there’s a tree growing out of the wall there see This place was put to the torch a long time ago

Who did it then asked Gendry

Hoster Tully Notch was a stooped thin grey-haired man born in these parts This was Lord Goodbrook’s village When Riverrun declared for Robert Goodbrook stayed loyal to the king so Lord Tully came down on him with fire and sword After the Trident Goodbrook’s son made his peace with Robert and Lord Hoster but that didn’t help the dead none

A silence fell Gendry gave Arya a queer look then turned away to brush his horse Outside the rain came down and down I say we need a fire Thoros declared The night is dark and full of terrors And wet too eh Too very wet

Jack-Be-Lucky hacked some dry wood from a stall while Notch and Merrit gathered straw for kindling Thoros himself struck the spark and Lem fanned the flames with his big yellow cloak until they roared and swirled Soon it grew almost hot inside the stable Thoros sat before it crosslegged devouring the flames with his eyes just as he had atop High Heart Arya watched him closely and once his lips moved and she thought she heard him mutter Riverrun Lem paced back and forth coughing a long shadow matching him stride for stride while Tom o’ Sevens pulled off his boots and rubbed his feet I must be mad to be going back to Riverrun the singer complained The Tullys have never been lucky for old Tom It was that Lysa sent me up the high road when the moon men took my gold and my horse and all my clothes as well There’s knights in the Vale still telling how I came walking up to the Bloody Gate with only my harp to keep me modest They made me sing ‘The Name Day Boy’ and ‘The King Without Courage’ before they opened that gate My only solace was that three of them died laughing I haven’t been back to the Eyrie since and I won’t sing ‘The King Without Courage’ either not for all the gold in Casterly—

Lannisters Thoros said Roaring red and gold He lurched to his feet and went to Lord Beric Lem and Tom wasted no time joining them Arya could not make out what they were saying but the singer kept glancing at her and one time Lem got so angry he pounded a fist against the wall That was when Lord Beric gestured for her to come closer It was the last thing she wanted to do but Harwin put a hand in the small of her back and pushed her forward She took two steps and hesitated full of dread My lord She waited to hear what Lord Beric would say

Tell her the lightning lord commanded Thoros

The red priest squatted down beside her My lady he said the Lord granted me a view of Riverrun An island in a sea of fire it seemed The flames were leaping lions with long crimson claws And how they roared A sea of Lannisters my lady Riverrun will soon come under attack

Arya felt as though he’d punched her in the belly No

Sweetling said Thoros the flames do not lie Sometimes I read them wrongly blind fool that I am But not this time I think The Lannisters will soon have Riverrun under siege

Robb will beat them Arya got a stubborn look He’ll beat them like he did before

Your brother may be gone said Thoros Your mother as well I did not see them in the flames This wedding the old one spoke of a wedding on the Twins    she has her own ways of knowing things that one The weirwoods whisper in her ear when she sleeps If she says your mother is gone to the Twins   

Arya turned on Tom and Lem If you hadn’t caught me I would have been there I would have been home

Lord Beric paid no heed to her outburst My lady he said with weary courtesy would you know your grandfather’s brother by sight Ser Brynden Tully called the Blackfish Would he know you perchance

Arya shook her head miserably She had heard her mother speak of Ser Brynden Blackfish but if she had ever met him herself it had been when she was too little to remember

Small chance the Blackfish will pay good coin for a girl he doesn’t know said Tom Those Tullys are a sour suspicious lot he’s like to think we’re selling him false goods

We’ll convince him Lem Lemoncloak insisted She will or Harwin Riverrun is closest I say we take her there get the gold and be bloody well done with her

And if the lions catch us inside the castle said Tom They’d like nothing better than to hang his lordship in a cage from the top of Casterly Rock

I do not mean to be taken said Lord Beric A final word hung unspoken in the air Alive They all heard it even Arya though it never passed his lips Still we dare not go blindly here I want to know where the armies are the wolves and lions both Sharna will know something and Lord Vance’s maester will know more Acorn Hall’s not far Lady Smallwood will shelter us for a time while we send scouts ahead to learn   

His words beat at her ears like the pounding of a drum and suddenly it was more than Arya could stand She wanted Riverrun not Acorn Hall she wanted her mother and her brother Robb not Lady Smallwood or some uncle she never knew Whirling she broke for the door and when Harwin tried to grab her arm she spun away from him quick as a snake

Outside the stables the rain was still falling and distant lightning flashed in the west Arya ran as fast as she could She did not know where she was going only that she wanted to be alone away from all the voices away from their hollow words and broken promises All I wanted was to go to Riverrun It was her own fault for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when she left Harrenhal She would have been better alone If she had been alone the outlaws would never have caught her and she’d be with Robb and her mother by now They were never my pack If they had been they wouldn’t leave me She splashed through a puddle of muddy water Someone was shouting her name Harwin probably or Gendry but the thunder drowned them out as it rolled across the hills half a heartbeat behind the lightning The lightning lord she thought angrily Maybe he couldn’t die but he could lie

Somewhere off to her left a horse whinnied Arya couldn’t have gone more than fifty yards from the stables yet already she was soaked to the bone She ducked around the corner of one of the tumbledown houses hoping the mossy walls would keep the rain off and almost bowled right into one of the sentries A mailed hand closed hard around her arm

You’re hurting me she said twisting in his grasp Let go I was going to go back I   

Back Sandor Clegane’s laughter was iron scraping over stone Bugger that wolf girl You’re mine He needed only one hand to yank her off her feet and drag her kicking toward his waiting horse The cold rain lashed them both and washed away her shouts and all that Arya could think of was the question he had asked her Do you know what dogs do to wolves





JAIME

Though his fever lingered stubbornly the stump was healing clean and Qyburn said his arm was no longer in danger Jaime was anxious to be gone to put Harrenhal the Bloody Mummers and Brienne of Tarth all behind him A real woman waited for him in the Red Keep

I am sending Qyburn with you to look after you on the way to King’s Landing Roose Bolton said on the morn of their departure He has a fond hope that your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain in gratitude

We all have fond hopes If he grows me back a hand my father will make him Grand Maester

Steelshanks Walton commanded Jaime’s escort blunt brusque brutal at heart a simple soldier Jaime had served with his sort all his life Men like Walton would kill at their lord’s command rape when their blood was up after battle and plunder wherever they could but once the war was done they would go back to their homes trade their spears for hoes wed their neighbors’ daughters and raise a pack of squalling children Such men obeyed without question but the deep malignant cruelty of the Brave Companions was not a part of their nature

Both parties left Harrenhal the same morning beneath a cold grey sky that promised rain Ser Aenys Frey had marched three days before striking northeast for the kingsroad Bolton meant to follow him The Trident is in flood he told Jaime Even at the ruby ford the crossing will be difficult You will give my warm regards to your father

So long as you give mine to Robb Stark

That I shall
