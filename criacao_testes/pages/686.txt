Greenbeard laughed and cuffed the archer’s ear Do I look a priest to you Archer When Pello of Tyrosh peers into the fire the cinders singe his beard

Lem cracked his knuckles and said Wouldn’t Lord Beric love to capture Jaime Lannister though…

Would he hang him Lem one of the village women asked It’d be half a shame to hang a man as pretty as that one

A trial first said Anguy Lord Beric always gives them a trial you know that He smiled Then he hangs them

There was laughter all around Then Tom drew his fingers across the strings of his woodharp and broke into soft song





The brothers of the Kingswood

they were an outlaw band

The forest was their castle

but they roamed across the land

No man’s gold was safe from them

nor any maiden’s hand

Oh the brothers of the Kingswood

that fearsome outlaw band…





Warm and dry in a corner between Gendry and Harwin Arya listened to the singing for a time then closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep She dreamt of home not Riverrun but Winterfell It was not a good dream though She was alone outside the castle up to her knees in mud She could see the grey walls ahead of her but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before and the castle faded before her until it looked more like smoke than granite And there were wolves as well gaunt grey shapes stalking through the trees all around her their eyes shining Whenever she looked at them she remembered the taste of blood

The next morning they left the road to cut across the fields The wind was gusting sending dry brown leaves swirling around the hooves of their horses but for once it did not rain When the sun came out from behind a cloud it was so bright Arya had to pull her hood forward to keep it out of her eyes

She reined up very suddenly We are going the wrong way

Gendry groaned What is it moss again

Look at the sun she said We’re going south Arya rummaged in her saddlebag for the map so she could show them We should never have left the Trident See She unrolled the map on her leg All of them were looking at her now See there’s Riverrun between the rivers

As it happens said Jack-Be-Lucky we know where Riverrun is Every man o’ us

You’re not going to Riverrun Lem told her bluntly

I was almost there Arya thought I should have let them take our horses I could have walked the rest of the way She remembered her dream then and bit her lip

Ah don’t look so hurt child said Tom Sevenstrings No harm will come to you you have my word on that

The word of a liar
