And so he did for all the good it did him

At first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long Lysa Arryn wanted to humble him that was all She would send for him again and soon If not her then Catelyn Stark would want to question him This time he would guard his tongue more closely They dare not kill him out of hand he was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock and if they shed his blood it would mean war Or so he had told himself

Now he was not so certain

Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long He was growing weaker every day and it was only a matter of time until Mord’s kicks and blows did him serious harm provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first A few more nights of cold and hunger and the blue would start calling to him too

He wondered what was happening beyond the walls such as they were of his cell Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now… unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard The king could order him freed but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand Tyrion had no illusions about the king’s love for his sister

If Cersei kept her wits about her she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that not without impugning the honor of the king And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial Whatever murders they might lay at his door the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land It would be the end of them If only Cersei were clever enough to see that…

Tyrion Lannister sighed His sister was not without a certain low cunning but her pride blinded her She would see the insult in this not the opportunity And Jaime was even worse rash and headstrong and quick to anger His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword

He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy and whether they had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn If the old Hand had been murdered it was deftly and subtly done Men of his age died of sudden illness all the time In contrast sending some oaf with a stolen knife after Brandon Stark struck him as unbelievably clumsy And wasn’t that peculiar come to think on it…

Tyrion shivered Now there was a nasty suspicion Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods and if that was true someone was using him as a catspaw Tyrion Lannister hated being used

He would have to get out of here and soon His chances of overpowering Mord were small to none and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope so he would have to talk himself free His mouth had gotten him into this cell it could damn well get him out

Tyrion pushed himself to his feet doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge He hammered on the door with a fist Mord he shouted Turnkey Mord I want you He had to keep it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps Tyrion stepped back an instant before the door opened with a crash

Making noise Mord growled with blood in his eyes Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap wide and thick doubled over in his fist

Never show them you’re afraid Tyrion reminded himself How would you like to be rich he asked

Mord hit him He swung the strap backhand lazily but the leather caught Tyrion high on the arm The force of it staggered him and the pain made him grit his teeth No mouth dwarf man Mord warned him

Gold Tyrion said miming a smile Casterly Rock is full of gold… ahhhh… This time the blow was a forehand and Mord put more of his arm into the swing making the leather crack and jump It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees wimpering He forced himself to look up at the gaoler As rich as the Lannisters he wheezed That’s what they say Mord—

Mord grunted The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face The pain was so bad he did not remember falling but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell His ear was ringing and his mouth was full of blood He groped for purchase to push himself up and his fingers brushed against… nothing Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded and tried his best to stop breathing He had fallen right on the edge inches from the blue

More to say Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull The snap made Tyrion jump The turnkey laughed

He won’t push me over Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge Catelyn Stark wants me alive he doesn’t dare kill me He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand grinned and said That was a stiff one Mord The gaoler squinted at him trying to decide if he was being mocked I could make good use of a strong man like you The strap flew at him but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away from it He took a glancing blow to the shoulder nothing more Gold he repeated scrambling backward like a crab more gold than you’ll see here in a lifetime Enough to buy land women horses… you could be a lord Lord Mord Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky

Is no gold Mord said

He’s listening Tyrion thought They relieved me of my purse when they captured me but the gold is still mine Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner but she’d never stoop to rob him That wouldn’t be honorable Help me and all the gold is yours Mord’s strap licked out but it was a halfhearted desultory swing slow and contemptuous Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned There will be no risk to you All you need do is deliver a message

The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion’s grasp Message he said as if he had never heard the word before His frown made deep creases in his brow

You heard me my lord Only carry my word to your lady Tell her… What What would possibly make Lysa Anyn relent The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister suddenly …tell her that I wish to confess my crimes

Mord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow but the turnkey hesitated Suspicion and greed warred in his eyes He wanted that gold yet he feared a trick he had the look of a man who had often been tricked Is lie he muttered darkly Dwarf man cheat me

I will put my promise in writing Tyrion vowed

Some illiterates held writing in disdain others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word as if it were some sort of magic Fortunately Mord was one of the latter The turnkey lowered the strap Writing down gold Much gold

Oh much gold Tyrion assured him The purse is just a taste my friend My brother wears armor of solid gold plate In truth Jaime’s armor was gilded steel but this oaf would never know the difference

Mord fingered his strap thoughtfully but in the end he relented and went to fetch paper and ink When the letter was written the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously Now deliver my message Tyrion urged
