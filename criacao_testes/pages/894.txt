He needed sun then It was too cold and dark inside the tunnel and the stench of blood and death was suffocating Jon gave the lantern back to Clydas squeezed around the bodies and through the twisted bars and walked toward the daylight to see what lay beyond the splintered door

The huge carcass of a dead mammoth partially blocked the way One of the beast’s tusks snagged his cloak and tore it as he edged past Three more giants lay outside half buried beneath stone and slush and hardened pitch He could see where the fire had melted the Wall where great sheets of ice had come sloughing off in the heat to shatter on the blackened ground He looked up at where they’d come from When you stand here it seems immense as if it were about to crush you

Jon went back inside to where the others waited We need to repair the outer gate as best we can and then block up this section of the tunnel Rubble chunks of ice anything All the way to the second gate if we can Ser Wynton will need to take command he’s the last knight left but he needs to move now the giants will be back before we know it We have to tell him—

Tell him what you will said Maester Aemon gently He will smile nod and forget Thirty years ago Ser Wynton Stout came within a dozen votes of being Lord Commander He would have made a fine one Ten years ago he would still have been capable No longer You know that as well as Donal did Jon

It was true You give the order then Jon told the maester You have been on the Wall your whole life the men will follow you We have to close the gate

I am a maester chained and sworn My order serves Jon We give counsel not commands

Someone must—

You You must lead

No

Yes Jon It need not be for long Only until such time as the garrison returns Donal chose you and Qhorin Halfhand before him Lord Commander Mormont made you his steward You are a son of Winterfell a nephew of Benjen Stark It must be you or no one The Wall is yours Jon Snow





Arya


She could feel the hole inside her every morning when she woke It wasn’t hunger though sometimes there was that too It was a hollow place an emptiness where her heart had been where her brothers had lived and her parents Her head hurt too Not as bad as it had at first but still pretty bad Arya was used to that though and at least the lump was going down But the hole inside her stayed the same The hole will never feel any better she told herself when she went to sleep

Some mornings Arya did not want to wake at all She would huddle beneath her cloak with her eyes squeezed shut and try to will herself back to sleep If the Hound would only have left her alone she would have slept all day and all night

And dreamed That was the best part the dreaming She dreamed of wolves most every night A great pack of wolves with her at the head She was bigger than any of them stronger swifter faster She could outrun horses and outfight lions When she bared her teeth even men would run from her her belly was never empty long and her fur kept her warm even when the wind was blowing cold And her brothers and sisters were with her many and more of them fierce and terrible and hers They would never leave her

But if her nights were full of wolves her days belonged to the dog Sandor Clegane made her get up every morning whether she wanted to or not He would curse at her in his raspy voice or yank her to her feet and shake her Once he dumped a helm full of cold water all over her head She bounced up sputtering and shivering and tried to kick him but he only laughed Dry off and feed the bloody horses he told her and she did

They had two now Stranger and a sorrel palfrey mare Arya had named Craven because Sandor said she’d likely run off from the Twins the same as them They’d found her wandering riderless through a field the morning after the slaughter She was a good enough horse but Arya could not love a coward Stranger would have fought Still she tended the mare as best she knew It was better than riding double with the Hound And Craven might have been a coward but she was young and strong as well Arya thought that she might be able to outrun Stranger if it came to it

The Hound no longer watched her as closely as he had Sometimes he did not seem to care whether she stayed or went and he no longer bound her up in a cloak at night One night I’ll kill him in his sleep she told herself but she never did One day I’ll ride away on Craven and he won’t be able to catch me she thought but she never did that either Where would she go Winterfell was gone Her grandfather’s brother was at Riverrun but he didn’t know her no more than she knew him Maybe Lady Smallwood would take her in at Acorn Hall but maybe she wouldn’t Besides Arya wasn’t even sure she could find Acorn Hall again Sometimes she thought she might go back to Sharna’s inn if the floods hadn’t washed it away She could stay with Hot Pie or maybe Lord Beric would find her there Anguy would teach her to use a bow and she could ride with Gendry and be an outlaw like Wenda the White Fawn in the songs

But that was just stupid like something Sansa might dream Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her just like the Hound None of them wanted her around They were never my pack not even Hot Pie and Gendry I was stupid to think so just a stupid little girl and no wolf at all

So she stayed with the Hound They rode every day never sleeping twice in the same place avoiding towns and villages and castles as best they could Once she asked Sandor Clegane where they were going Away he said That’s all you need to know You’re not worth spit to me now and I don’t want to hear your whining I should have let you run into that bloody castle

You should have she agreed thinking of her mother

You’d be dead if I had You ought to thank me You ought to sing me a pretty little song the way your sister did

Did you hit her with an axe too

I hit you with the flat of the axe you stupid little bitch If I’d hit you with the blade there’d still be chunks of your head floating down the Green Fork Now shut your bloody mouth If I had any sense I’d give you to the silent sisters They cut the tongues out of girls who talk too much

That wasn’t fair of him to say Aside from that one time Arya hardly talked at all Whole days passed when neither of them said anything She was too empty to talk and the Hound was too angry She could feel the fury in him she could see it on his face the way his mouth would tighten and twist the looks he gave her Whenever he took his axe to chop some wood for a fire he would slide into a cold rage hacking savagely at the tree or the deadfall or the broken limb until they had twenty times as much kindling and firewood as they’d needed Sometimes he would be so sore and tired afterward that he would lie down and go right to sleep without even lighting a fire Arya hated it when that happened and hated him too Those were the nights when she stared the longest at the axe It looks awfully heavy but I bet I could swing it She wouldn’t hit him with the flat either
