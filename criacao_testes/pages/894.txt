1733 So Paul departed from among them

1734 Howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the
which was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and
others with them

181 After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to
Corinth 182 And found a certain Jew named Aquila born in Pontus
lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because that
Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome and came unto
them

183 And because he was of the same craft he abode with them and
wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers

184 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the
Jews and the Greeks

185 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia Paul was
pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was
Christ

186 And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his
raiment and said unto them Your blood be upon your own heads I am
clean from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles

187 And he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house
named Justus one that worshipped God whose house joined hard to the
synagogue

188 And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the
Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed
and were baptized

189 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision Be not
afraid but speak and hold not thy peace 1810 For I am with thee
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for I have much people in
this city

1811 And he continued there a year and six months teaching the word
of God among them

1812 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia the Jews made
insurrection with one accord against Paul and brought him to the
judgment seat 1813 Saying This fellow persuadeth men to worship God
contrary to the law

1814 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth Gallio said unto
the Jews If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness O ye Jews
reason would that I should bear with you 1815 But if it be a
question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for I
will be no judge of such matters

1816 And he drave them from the judgment seat

1817 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes the chief ruler of the
synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat And Gallio cared for
none of those things

1818 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then
took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into Syria and with
him Priscilla and Aquila having shorn his head in Cenchrea for he
had a vow

1819 And he came to Ephesus and left them there but he himself
entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews

1820 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them he
consented not 1821 But bade them farewell saying I must by all
means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem but I will return
again unto you if God will And he sailed from Ephesus

1822 And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the
church he went down to Antioch

1823 And after he had spent some time there he departed and went
over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order strengthening
all the disciples

1824 And a certain Jew named Apollos born at Alexandria an eloquent
man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus

1825 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being
fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of
the Lord knowing only the baptism of John

1826 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto
him the way of God more perfectly

1827 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia the brethren
wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come
helped them much which had believed through grace 1828 For he
mightily convinced the Jews and that publickly shewing by the
scriptures that Jesus was Christ

191 And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding
certain disciples 192 He said unto them Have ye received the Holy
Ghost since ye believed  And they said unto him We have not so much
