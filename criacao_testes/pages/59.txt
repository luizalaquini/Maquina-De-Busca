Good lady Varys said with great solicitude There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing powers Say only the word and I will send for one for your dear Bran

Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran she told him She would not speak of Bran not here not with these men She trusted Littlefinger only a little and Varys not at all She would not let them see her grief Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here

Varys giggled like a little girl Oh yes I suppose I am guilty I hope you forgive me kind lady He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger

Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief He was a spider she thought wildly an enchanter or worse He knew things no one could possibly know unless…What have you done to Ser Rodrik she demanded

Littlefinger was lost I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance What dagger are we talking about Who is Ser Rodrik

Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell Varys informed him I assure you Lady Stark nothing at all has been done to the good knight He did call here early this afternoon He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory and they talked of a certain dagger About sunset they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying They are still there drinking in the common room waiting for your return Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone

How could you know all that

The whisperings of little birds Varys said smiling I know things sweet lady That is the nature of my service He shrugged You do have the dagger with you yes

Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him Here Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to

Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge Blood welled and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table

Careful Catelyn told him it’s sharp

Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand testing the grip He flipped it in the air caught it again with his other hand Such sweet balance You want to find the owner is that the reason for this visit You have no need of Ser Aron for that my lady You should have come to me

And if I had she said what would you have told me

I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King’s Landing He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger drew it back over his shoulder and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak quivering It’s mine

Yours It made no sense Petyr had not been at Winterfell

Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day he said crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting along with half the court Petyr’s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him many of us became a trifle poorer Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons the queen lost an emerald pendant and I lost my knife Her Grace got the emerald back but the winner kept the rest

Who Catelyn demanded her mouth dry with fear Her fingers ached with remembered pain

The Imp said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face Tyrion Lannister





JON

The courtyard rang to the song of swords

Under black wool boiled leather and mail sweat trickled icily down Jon’s chest as he pressed the attack Grenn stumbled backward defending himself clumsily When he raised his sword Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy’s leg and sent him staggering Grenn’s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm When he tried a sideswing Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain

Enough Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel

Grenn cradled his hand The bastard broke my wrist

The bastard hamstrung you opened your empty skull and cut off your hand Or would have if these blades had an edge It’s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad Get the Aurochs on his feet he has funeral arrangements to make

Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet The frosty morning air felt good on his face He leaned on his sword drew a deep breath and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory
