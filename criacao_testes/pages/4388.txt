FG Table 95  Word fragments and their pronunciations
pp
It is sometimes important to specify that a rule applies only when
the fragment is matched at the beginning or end of a word
In the Table - means that other fragments can precede or follow this
one
The | sign is used to separate suffixes from a word stem
as will be explained
shortly
pp
An advantage of the longest-string search strategy is that it is easy
to account for exceptions simply by incorporating them into the fragment
table
If they occur in the input the complete word will automatically be
matched first before any fragment of it is translated
The exception list of complete words can be surprisingly small for
quite respectable performance
Table 96 shows the entire dictionary for an excellent early pronunciation
system written at Bell Laboratories McIlroy 1974

McIlroy 1974

Some of the words are notorious exceptions in English while others are
included simply because the rules would run amok on them
Notice that the exceptions are all quite short with only a few of them
having more than two syllables

FG Table 96  Exception table for a simple pronunciation program
pp
Special action has to be taken with final es
These lengthen and alter the quality
of the preceding vowel so that bit becomes bite and so on
Unfortunately if the word has a suffix the e must be detected even though
it is no longer final as in lonely and it is even dropped sometimes
biting em otherwise these would be pronounced lonelly bitting
To make matters worse the suffix may be another word  we do not
want kiteflying to have an extra syllable which rhymes with deaf
Although simple procedures can be developed to take care of common
word endings like -ly -ness -d it is difficult to decompose
compound words like wisecrack and bumblebee reliably em but this must
be done if they are not to be articulated with three syllables instead of two
Of course there are exceptions to the final e rule
Many common words some done livedVu disobey the rule by not
lengthening the main vowel while in other rarer ones anemone
catastrophe epitome the final e is actually pronounced
There are also some complete anomalies fete
pp
McIlroys 1974 system is a superb example of a robust program which takes
a pragmatic approach to these problems accepting that they will never be
fully solved and which is careful to degrade
gracefully when stumped

McIlroy 1974

The pronunciation of each word is found by a succession of increasingly
desperate trials
