465 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram and the meat
offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give and an hin of oil
to an ephah

466 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
without blemish and six lambs and a ram they shall be without
blemish

467 And he shall prepare a meat offering an ephah for a bullock and
an ephah for a ram and for the lambs according as his hand shall
attain unto and an hin of oil to an ephah

468 And when the prince shall enter he shall go in by the way of the
porch of that gate and he shall go forth by the way thereof

469 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the
solemn feasts he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to
worship shall go out by the way of the south gate and he that
entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the
north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came
in but shall go forth over against it

4610 And the prince in the midst of them when they go in shall go
in and when they go forth shall go forth

4611 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall
be an ephah to a bullock and an ephah to a ram and to the lambs as
he is able to give and an hin of oil to an ephah

4612 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or
peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD one shall then open him the
gate that looketh toward the east and he shall prepare his burnt
offering and his peace offerings as he did on the sabbath day then
he shall go forth and after his going forth one shall shut the gate

4613 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
lamb of the first year without blemish thou shalt prepare it every
morning

4614 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning the
sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to temper
with the fine flour a meat offering continually by a perpetual
ordinance unto the LORD

4615 Thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the
oil every morning for a continual burnt offering

4616 Thus saith the Lord GOD If the prince give a gift unto any of
his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be
their possession by inheritance

4617 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants
then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to
the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them

4618 Moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance
by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall
give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be
not scattered every man from his possession

4619 After he brought me through the entry which was at the side of
the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward
the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward

4620 Then said he unto me This is the place where the priests shall
boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake
the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court
to sanctify the people

4621 Then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to
pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of
the court there was a court

4622 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one
measure

4623 And there was a row of building round about in them round about
them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round
about

4624 Then said he unto me These are the places of them that boil
where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the
people

471 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and
behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house
eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and
the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at
the south side of the altar

472 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led
me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh
eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side

473 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the
waters the waters were to the ankles
