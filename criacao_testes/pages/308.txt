Then we are done The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as Robb turned to leave Grey Wind at his heels Olyvar Frey scrambled ahead to open the door Catelyn followed them out her brother at her side

You did well she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall though that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king

Robb scratched Grey Wind behind the ear Did you see the look on his face Mother he asked smiling

What I saw was Lord Karstark walking out

As did I Robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to Olyvar Take this thing back to my bedchamber

At once Your Grace The squire hurried off

I’ll wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark her brother Edmure declared How can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father’s domains stealing his crops and slaughtering his people I say again we ought to be marching on Harrenhal

We lack the strength Robb said though unhappily

Edmure persisted Do we grow stronger sitting here Our host dwindles every day

And whose doing is that Catelyn snapped at her brother It had been at Edmure’s insistence that Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning each to defend his own lands Ser Marq Piper and Lord Karyl Vance had been the first to go Lord Jonos Bracken had followed vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced his intent to return to his seat at Seagard still mercifully untouched by the fighting

You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to the sword Ser Edmure said but Lord Karstark is a northman It would be an ill thing if he were to leave us

I’ll speak with him said Robb He lost two sons in the Whispering Wood Who can blame him if he does not want to make peace with their killers… with my father’s killers…

More bloodshed will not bring your father back to us or Lord Rickard’s sons Catelyn said An offer had to be made—though a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms

Any sweeter and I would have gagged Her son’s beard had grown in redder than his auburn hair Robb seemed to think it made him look fierce royal… older But bearded or no he was still a youth of fifteen and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark it had been no easy thing to convince him to make even this offer poor as it was

Cersei Lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of cousins It’s her brother she’ll want as you know full well She had told him as much before but Catelyn was finding that kings do not listen half so attentively as sons

I can’t release the Kingslayer not even if I wanted to My lords would never abide it

Your lords made you their king

And can unmake me just as easy

If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe we should pay it willingly Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in his cell If he should die while he’s your prisoner men will say—

—that he well deserved it Robb finished

And your sisters Catelyn asked sharply Will they deserve their deaths as well I promise you if any harm comes to her brother Cersei will pay us back blood for blood—

Lannister won’t die Robb said No one so much as speaks to him without my warrant He has food water clean straw more comfort than he has any right to But I won’t free him not even for Arya and Sansa

Her son was looking down at her Catelyn realized Was it war that made him grow so fast she wondered or the crown they had put on his head Are you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field again is that the truth of it

Grey Wind growled as if he sensed Robb’s anger and Edmure Tully put a brotherly hand on Catelyn’s shoulder Cat don’t The boy has the right of this

Don’t call me the boy Robb said rounding on his uncle his anger spilling out all at once on poor Edmure who had only meant to support him I’m almost a man grown and a king—your king ser And I don’t fear Jaime Lannister I defeated him once I’ll defeat him again if I must only… He pushed a fall of hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head I might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for Father but…

…but not for the girls Her voice was icy quiet Girls are not important enough are they

Robb made no answer but there was hurt in his eyes Blue eyes Tully eyes eyes she had given him She had wounded him but he was too much his father’s son to admit it
