10738 He blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease

10739 Again they are minished and brought low through oppression
affliction and sorrow

10740 He poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness where there is no way

10741 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him
families like a flock

10742 The righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth

10743 Whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD



1081 O god my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise even with
my glory

1082 Awake psaltery and harp I myself will awake early

1083 I will praise thee O LORD among the people and I will sing
praises unto thee among the nations

1084 For thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds

1085 Be thou exalted O God above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth

1086 That thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and
answer me

1087 God hath spoken in his holiness I will rejoice I will divide
Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth

1088 Gilead is mine Manasseh is mine Ephraim also is the strength
of mine head Judah is my lawgiver

1089 Moab is my washpot over Edom will I cast out my shoe over
Philistia will I triumph

10810 Who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
Edom

10811 Wilt not thou O God who hast cast us off and wilt not thou
O God go forth with our hosts

10812 Give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man

10813 Through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall
tread down our enemies



1091 Hold not thy peace O God of my praise

1092 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue

1093 They compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought
against me without a cause

1094 For my love they are my adversaries but I give myself unto
prayer

1095 And they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love

1096 Set thou a wicked man over him and let Satan stand at his right
hand

1097 When he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his
prayer become sin

1098 Let his days be few and let another take his office

1099 Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow

10910 Let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them
seek their bread also out of their desolate places

10911 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the
strangers spoil his labour

10912 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there
be any to favour his fatherless children

10913 Let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following
let their name be blotted out

10914 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out

10915 Let them be before the LORD continually that he may cut off
the memory of them from the earth
