And still the direwolves howled The guards on the walls muttered curses hounds in the kennels barked furiously horses kicked at their stalls the Walders shivered by their fire and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights Only Bran did not mind Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran’s window Other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls loping round like sentries He wished that he could see them

He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower and farther back the First Keep squat and round its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings inside and out he had climbed them all scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs Their rooftops had been his secret places and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends

And then he had fallen

Bran did not remember falling yet they said he had so he supposed it must be true He had almost died When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened he got a queer tight feeling in his belly And now he could not climb nor walk nor run nor swordfight and the dreams he’d dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head

Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen and for long after as he lay broken in his bed Robb had told him so before he went away to war Summer had mourned for him and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father’s death the wolves had known that too Bran had been in the maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls

Who are they mourning now Had some enemy slain the King in the North who used to be his brother Robb Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall Had his mother died or one of his sisters Or was this something else as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think

If I were truly a direwolf I would understand the song he thought wistfully In his wolf dreams he could race up the sides of mountains jagged icy mountains taller than any tower and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him the way it used to be

Oooo Bran cried tentatively He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet Ooooooooooooooooooo ahooooooooooooooo he howled it sounded stupid high and hollow and quavering a little boy’s howl not a wolf’s Yet Summer gave answer his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one and Shaggydog made it a chorus Bran haroooed again They howled together last of their pack

The noise brought a guard to his door Hayhead with the wen on his nose He peered in saw Bran howling out the window and said What’s this my prince

It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince though he was Robb’s heir and Robb was King in the North now He turned his head to howl at the guard Oooooooo Oo-oo-oooooooooooo

Hayhead screwed up his face Now you stop that there

Ooo-ooo-Oooooo Ooo-Ooo-Ooooooooooooooooo

The guardsman retreated When he came back Maester Luwin was with him all in grey his chain tight about his neck Bran those beasts make sufficient noise without your help He crossed the room and put his hand on the boy’s brow The hour grows late you ought to be fast asleep

I’m talking to the wolves Bran brushed the hand away

Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed

I can get to bed myself Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall so Bran could pull himself about the room with his arms It was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache but he hated being carried Anyway I don’t have to sleep if I don’t want to

All men must sleep Bran Even princes

When I sleep I turn into a wolf Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night Do wolves dream

All creatures dream I think yet not as men do

Do dead men dream Bran asked thinking of his father In the dark crypts below Winterfell a stonemason was chiseling out his father’s likeness in granite

Some say yes some no the maester answered The dead themselves are silent on the matter

Do trees dream

Trees No…

They do Bran said with sudden certainty They dream tree dreams I dream of a tree sometimes A weirwood like the one in the godswood It calls to me The wolf dreams are better I smell things and sometimes I can taste the blood

Maester Luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck If you would only spend more time with the other children—

I hate the other children Bran said meaning the Walders I commanded you to send them away

Luwin grew stern The Freys are your lady mother’s wards sent here to be fostered at her express command It is not for you to expel them nor is it kind If we turned them out where would they go
