dead and my son is the living

324 And the king said Bring me a sword And they brought a sword
before the king

325 And the king said Divide the living child in two and give half
to the one and half to the other

326 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king
for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said O my lord give her
the living child and in no wise slay it But the other said Let it
be neither mine nor thine but divide it

327 Then the king answered and said Give her the living child and
in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof

328 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged
and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of God was in
him to do judgment

41 So king Solomon was king over all Israel

42 And these were the princes which he had Azariah the son of Zadok
the priest 43 Elihoreph and Ahiah the sons of Shisha scribes
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud the recorder

44 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host and Zadok and
Abiathar were the priests 45 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over
the officers and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer and
the kings friend 46 And Ahishar was over the household and
Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute

47 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel which provided
victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year
made provision

48 And these are their names The son of Hur in mount Ephraim 49
The son of Dekar in Makaz and in Shaalbim and Bethshemesh and
Elonbethhanan 410 The son of Hesed in Aruboth to him pertained
Sochoh and all the land of Hepher 411 The son of Abinadab in all
the region of Dor which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife
412 Baana the son of Ahilud to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo
and all Bethshean which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel from
Bethshean to Abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam
413 The son of Geber in Ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of
Jair the son of Manasseh which are in Gilead to him also pertained
the region of Argob which is in Bashan threescore great cities with
walls and brasen bars 414 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim
415 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali he also took Basmath the daughter of
Solomon to wife 416 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in
Aloth 417 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah in Issachar 418 Shimei
the son of Elah in Benjamin 419 Geber the son of Uri was in the
country of Gilead in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and
of Og king of Bashan and he was the only officer which was in the
land

420 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in
multitude eating and drinking and making merry

421 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt they brought
presents and served Solomon all the days of his life

422 And Solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour and threescore measures of meal 423 Ten fat oxen and twenty
oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and
roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl

424 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river
from Tiphsah even to Azzah over all the kings on this side the river
and he had peace on all sides round about him

425 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and
under his fig tree from Dan even to Beersheba all the days of
Solomon

426 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots
and twelve thousand horsemen

427 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon and for all
that came unto king Solomons table every man in his month they
lacked nothing

428 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
unto the place where the officers were every man according to his
charge

429 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and
largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore

430 And Solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
the east country and all the wisdom of Egypt

431 For he was wiser than all men than Ethan the Ezrahite and
Heman and Chalcol and Darda the sons of Mahol and his fame was in
all nations round about

432 And he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a
thousand and five
