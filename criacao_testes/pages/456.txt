As he made his way down the steep plank to the quay Tyrion could feel unkind eyes upon him The galley rocked gently and the movement underfoot made his waddle worse than ever I’ll wager they’d love to snigger No one dared not openly though he heard mutterings mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings They do not love me he thought Well small wonder I’m well fed and ugly and they are starving

Bronn escorted him through the crowd to join his sister and her sons Cersei ignored him preferring to lavish her smiles on their cousin He watched her charming Lancel with eyes as green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat and smiled a small sly smile to himself I know your secret Cersei he thought His sister had oft called upon the High Septon of late to seek the blessings of the gods in their coming struggle with Lord Stannis… or so she would have him believe In truth after a brief call at the Great Sept of Baelor Cersei would don a plain brown traveler’s cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the unlikely name of Ser Osmund Kettleblack and his equally unsavory brothers Osney and Osfryd Lancel had told him all about them Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy her own force of sellswords

Well let her enjoy her plots She was much sweeter when she thought she was outwitting him The Kettleblacks would charm her take her coin and promise her anything she asked and why not when Bronn was matching every copper penny coin for coin Amiable rogues all three the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than they’d ever been at bloodletting Cersei had managed to buy herself three hollow drums they would make all the fierce booming sounds she required but there was nothing inside It amused Tyrion no end

Horns blew fanfares as Lionstar and Lady Lyanna pushed out from shore moving downriver to clear the way for Seaswift A few cheers went up from the crush along the banks as thin and ragged as the clouds scuttling overhead Myrcella smiled and waved from the deck Behind her stood Arys Oakheart his white cloak streaming The captain ordered lines cast off and oars pushed the Seaswift out into the lusty current of the Blackwater Rush where her sails blossomed in the wind—common white sails as Tyrion had insisted not sheets of Lannister crimson Prince Tommen sobbed You mew like a suckling babe his brother hissed at him Princes aren’t supposed to cry

Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon Sansa Stark said and the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound

Be quiet or I’ll have Ser Meryn give you a mortal wound Joffrey told his betrothed Tyrion glanced at his sister but Cersei was engrossed in something Ser Balon Swann was telling her Can she truly be so blind as to what he is he wondered

Out on the river Bold Wind unshipped her oars and glided downstream in the wake of Seaswift Last came King Robert’s Hammer the might of the royal fleet… or at least that portion that had not fled to Dragonstone last year with Stannis Tyrion had chosen the ships with care avoiding any whose captains might be of doubtful loyalty according to Varys… but as Varys himself was of doubtful loyalty a certain amount of apprehension remained I rely too much on Varys he reflected I need my own informers Not that I’d trust them either Trust would get you killed

He wondered again about Littlefinger There had been no word from Petyr Baelish since he had ridden off for Bitterbridge That might mean nothing—or everything Even Varys could not say The eunuch had suggested that perhaps Littlefinger had met some misfortune on the roads He might even be slain Tyrion had snorted in derision If Littlefinger is dead then I’m a giant More likely the Tyrells were balking at the proposed marriage Tyrion could scarcely blame them If I were Mace Tyrell I would sooner have Joffrey’s head on a pike than his cock in my daughter

The little fleet was well out into the bay when Cersei indicated that it was time to go Bronn brought Tyrion’s horse and helped him mount That was Podrick Payne’s task but they had left Pod back at the Red Keep The gaunt sellsword made for a much more reassuring presence than the boy would have

The narrow streets were lined by men of the City Watch holding back the crowd with the shafts of their spears Ser Jacelyn Bywater went in front heading a wedge of mounted lancers in black ringmail and golden cloaks Behind him came Ser Aron Santagar and Ser Balon Swann bearing the king’s banners the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon

King Joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey a golden crown set upon his golden curls Sansa Stark rode a chesnut mare at his side looking neither right nor left her thick auburn hair flowing to her shoulders beneath a net of moonstones Two of the Kingsguard flanked the couple the Hound on the king’s right hand and Ser Mandon Moore to the left of the Stark girl

Next came Tommen snuffling with Ser Preston Greenfield in his white armor and cloak and then Cersei accompanied by Ser Lancel and protected by Meryn Trant and Boros Blount Tyrion fell in with his sister After them followed the High Septon in his litter and a long tail of other courtiers—Ser Horas Redwyne Lady Tanda and her daughter Jalabhar Xho Lord Gyles Rosby and the rest A double column of guardsmen brought up the rear

The unshaven and the unwashed stared at the riders with dull resentment from behind the line of spears I like this not one speck Tyrion thought Bronn had a score of sellswords scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before it started Perhaps Cersei had similarly disposed her Kettleblacks Somehow Tyrion did not think it would help much If the fire was too hot you could hardly keep the pudding from scorching by tossing a handful of raisins in the pot

They crossed Fishmonger’s Square and rode along Muddy Way before turning onto the narrow curving Hook to begin their climb up Aegon’s High Hill A few voices raised a cry of Joffrey All hail all hail as the young king rode by but for every man who picked up the shout a hundred kept their silence The Lannisters moved through a sea of ragged men and hungry women breasting a tide of sullen eyes Just ahead of him Cersei was laughing at something Lancel had said though he suspected her merriment was feigned She could not be oblivious to the unrest around them but his sister always believed in putting on the brave show

Halfway along the route a wailing woman forced her way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions holding the corpse of her dead baby above her head It was blue and swollen grotesque but the real horror was the mother’s eyes Joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down but Sansa Stark leaned over and said something to him The king fumbled in his purse and flung the woman a silver stag The coin bounced off the child and rolled away under the legs of the gold cloaks and into the crowd where a dozen men began to fight for it The mother never once blinked Her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son

Leave her Your Grace Cersei called out to the king she’s beyond our help poor thing

The mother heard her Somehow the queen’s voice cut through the woman’s ravaged wits Her slack face twisted in loathing Whore she shrieked Kingslayer’s whore Brotherfucker Her dead child dropped from her arms like a sack of flour as she pointed at Cersei Brotherfucker brotherfucker brotherfucker

Tyrion never saw who threw the dung He only heard Sansa’s gasp and Joffrey’s bellowed curse and when he turned his head the king was wiping brown filth from his cheek There was more caked in his golden hair and spattered over Sansa’s legs

Who threw that Joffrey screamed He pushed his fingers into his hair made a furious face and flung away another handful of dung I want the man who threw that he shouted A hundred golden dragons to the man who gives him up

He was up there someone shouted from the crowd The king wheeled his horse in a circle to survey the rooftops and open balconies above them In the crowd people were pointing shoving cursing one another and the king

Please Your Grace let him go Sansa pleaded

The king paid her no heed Bring me the man who flung that filth Joffrey commanded He’ll lick it off me or I’ll have his head Dog you bring him here

Obedient Sandor Clegane swung down from his saddle but there was no way through that wall of flesh let alone to the roof Those closest to him began to squirm and shove to get away while others pushed forward to see Tyrion smelled disaster Clegane leave off the man is long fled

I want him Joffrey pointed at the roof He was up there Dog cut through them and bring—

A tumult of sound drowned his last words a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed them from all sides Bastard someone screamed at Joffrey bastard monster Other voices flung calls of Whore and Brotherfucker at the queen while Tyrion was pelted with shouts of Freak and Halfman Mixed in with the abuse he heard a few cries of Justice and Robb King Robb the Young Wolf of Stannis and even Renly From both sides of the street the crowd surged against the spear shafts while the gold cloaks struggled to hold the line Stones and dung and fouler things whistled overhead Feed us a woman shrieked Bread boomed a man behind her We want bread bastard In a heartbeat a thousand voices took up the chant King Joffrey and King Robb and King Stannis were forgotten and King Bread ruled alone Bread they clamored Bread bread

Tyrion spurred to his sister’s side yelling Back to the castle Now Cersei gave a curt nod and Ser Lancel unsheathed his sword Ahead of the column Jacelyn Bywater was roaring commands His riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge The king was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks grasping for him One managed to get hold of his leg but only for an instant Ser Mandon’s sword slashed down parting hand from wrist Ride Tyrion shouted at his nephew giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump The animal reared trumpeting and plunged ahead the press shattering before him

Tyrion drove into the gap hard on the king’s hooves Bronn kept pace sword in hand A jagged rock flew past his head as he rode and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser Mandon’s shield To their left three gold cloaks went down under the surge and then the crowd was rushing forward trampling the fallen men The Hound had vanished behind though his riderless horse galloped beside them Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the saddle the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp Ser Balon Swann dropped the Lannister lion to draw his longsword He slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped apart the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind In an instant they were gone Someone staggered in front of Joffrey’s horse and shrieked as the king rode him down Whether it had been man woman or child Tyrion could not have said Joffrey was galloping at his side whey-faced with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on his left
