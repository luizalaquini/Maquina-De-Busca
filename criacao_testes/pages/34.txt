Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos Ser Jorah Mormont jested The exile had offered her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo Viserys had accepted eagerly Mormont had been their constant companion ever since

Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard but Viserys did not so much as smile He can have her tomorrow if he likes her brother said He glanced over at Dany and she lowered her eyes So long as he pays the price

Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air rings glittering on his fat fingers I have told you all is settled Trust me The khal has promised you a crown and you shall have it

Yes but when

When the khal chooses Illyrio said He will have the girl first and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak After that perhaps If the omens favor war

Viserys seethed with impatience I piss on Dothraki omens The Usurper sits on my father’s throne How long must I wait

Illyrio gave a massive shrug You have waited most of your life great king What is another few months another few years

Ser Jorah who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak nodded in agreement I counsel you to be patient Your Grace The Dothraki are true to their word but they do things in their own time A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal but must never presume to berate him

Viserys bristled Guard your tongue Mormont or I’ll have it out I am no lesser man I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms The dragon does not beg

Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat There are no more dragons Dany thought staring at her brother though she did not dare say it aloud

Yet that night she dreamt of one Viserys was hitting her hurting her She was naked clumsy with fear She ran from him but her body seemed thick and ungainly He struck her again She stumbled and fell You woke the dragon he screamed as he kicked her You woke the dragon you woke the dragon Her thighs were slick with blood She closed her eyes and whimpered As if in answer there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire When she looked again Viserys was gone great columns of flame rose all around and in the midst of them was the dragon It turned its great head slowly When its molten eyes found hers she woke shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat She had never been so afraid…

… until the day of her wedding came at last

The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo above the seething sea of Dothraki She had never seen so many people in one place nor people so strange and frightening The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities but out under the open sky they kept the old ways Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers drank themselves blind on fermented mare’s milk and Illyrio’s fine wines and spat jests at each other across the fires their voices harsh and alien in Dany’s ears

Viserys was seated just below her splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him Theirs was a place of high honor just below the khal’s own bloodriders but Dany could see the anger in her brother’s lilac eyes He did not like sitting beneath her and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride and served him from the portions they refused He could do nothing but nurse his resentment so nurse it he did his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person

Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde Her brother had told her to smile and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes She did her best to hide them knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying terrified of how Khal Drogo might react Food was brought to her steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos but she waved it all away Her stomach was a roil and she knew she could keep none of it down

There was no one to talk to Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders and laughed at their replies but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him They had no common language Dothraki was incomprehensible to her and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother but they were too far below to hear her

So she sat in her wedding silks nursing a cup of honeyed wine afraid to eat talking silently to herself I am blood of the dragon she told herself I am Daenerys Stormborn Princess of Dragonstone of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror

The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal Drogo watched without expression but his eyes followed their movements and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over

The warriors were watching too One of them finally stepped into the circle grabbed a dancer by the arm pushed her down to the ground and mounted her right there as a stallion mounts a mare Illyrio had told her that might happen The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds There is no privacy in a khalasar and they do not understand sin or shame as we do

Dany looked away from the coupling frightened when she realized what was happening but a second warrior stepped forward and a third and soon there was no way to avert her eyes Then two men seized the same woman She heard a shout saw a shove and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out long razor-sharp blades half sword and half scythe A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed leaping toward each other whirling the blades around their heads shrieking insults at each clash No one made a move to interfere

It ended as quickly as it began The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow one man missed a step the other swung his blade in a flat arc Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki’s waist and opened him from backbone to belly button spilling his entrails into the dust As the loser died the winner took hold of the nearest woman—not even the one they had been quarreling over—and had her there and then Slaves carried off the body and the dancing resumed

Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair he had said Her wedding must have been especially blessed before the day was over a dozen men had died

As the hours passed the terror grew in Dany until it was all she could do not to scream She was afraid of the Dothraki whose ways seemed alien and monstrous as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all She was afraid of her brother of what he might do if she failed him Most of all she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask

I am the blood of the dragon she told herself again

When at last the sun was low in the sky Khal Drogo clapped his hands together and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him It was time for her bride gifts

And after the gifts she knew after the sun had gone down it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage Dany tried to put the thought aside but it would not leave her She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking

Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids Dany knew they had cost him nothing Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes Doreah a fair-haired blue-eyed Lysene girl These are no common servants sweet sister her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one Illyrio and I selected them personally for you Irri will teach you riding Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love He smiled thinly She’s very good Illyrio and I can both swear to that
