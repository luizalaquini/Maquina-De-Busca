3723 And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren
that they stript Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that
was on him 3724 And they took him and cast him into a pit and the
pit was empty there was no water in it

3725 And they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes
and looked and behold a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead
with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry
it down to Egypt

3726 And Judah said unto his brethren What profit is it if we slay
our brother and conceal his blood  3727 Come and let us sell him
to the Ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our
brother and our flesh And his brethren were content

3728 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt

3729 And Reuben returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in
the pit and he rent his clothes

3730 And he returned unto his brethren and said The child is not
and I whither shall I go  3731 And they took Josephs coat and
killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood 3732 And
they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their
father and said This have we found know now whether it be thy sons
coat or no

3733 And he knew it and said It is my sons coat an evil beast
hath devoured him Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces

3734 And Jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins
and mourned for his son many days

3735 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him
but he refused to be comforted and he said For I will go down into
the grave unto my son mourning Thus his father wept for him

3736 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar an officer
of Pharaohs and captain of the guard

381 And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his
brethren and turned in to a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah

382 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name
was Shuah and he took her and went in unto her

383 And she conceived and bare a son and he called his name Er

384 And she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name
Onan

385 And she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name
Shelah and he was at Chezib when she bare him

386 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn whose name was Tamar

387 And Er Judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the LORD
and the LORD slew him

388 And Judah said unto Onan Go in unto thy brothers wife and
marry her and raise up seed to thy brother

389 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to
pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on
the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother

3810 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD wherefore he
slew him also

3811 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law Remain a widow at
thy fathers house till Shelah my son be grown for he said Lest
peradventure he die also as his brethren did And Tamar went and
dwelt in her fathers house

3812 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judahs wife died
and Judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite

3813 And it was told Tamar saying Behold thy father in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep

3814 And she put her widows garments off from her and covered her
with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is
by the way to Timnath for she saw that Shelah was grown and she was
not given unto him to wife

3815 When Judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she
had covered her face

3816 And he turned unto her by the way and said Go to I pray thee
let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter
in law And she said What wilt thou give me that thou mayest come
in unto me  3817 And he said I will send thee a kid from the flock
And she said Wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it  3818
And he said What pledge shall I give thee And she said Thy signet
and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand And he gave it
her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
