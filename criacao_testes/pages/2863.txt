113 If the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do

114 The LORD is in his holy temple the LORDs throne is in heaven
his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men

115 The LORD trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth

116 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an
horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup

117 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness his countenance doth
behold the upright



121 Help LORD for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from
among the children of men

122 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering
lips and with a double heart do they speak

123 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that
speaketh proud things

124 Who have said With our tongue will we prevail our lips are our
own who is lord over us

125 For the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now
will I arise saith the LORD I will set him in safety from him that
puffeth at him

126 The words of the LORD are pure words as silver tried in a
furnace of earth purified seven times

127 Thou shalt keep them O LORD thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever

128 The wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted



131 How long wilt thou forget me O LORD for ever how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me

132 How long shall I take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my
heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me

133 Consider and hear me O LORD my God lighten mine eyes lest I
sleep the sleep of death

134 Lest mine enemy say I have prevailed against him and those that
trouble me rejoice when I am moved

135 But I have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation

136 I will sing unto the LORD because he hath dealt bountifully with
me



141 The fool hath said in his heart There is no God They are
corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth
good

142 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see
if there were any that did understand and seek God

143 They are all gone aside they are all together become filthy
there is none that doeth good no not one

144 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my
people as they eat bread and call not upon the LORD

145 There were they in great fear for God is in the generation of
the righteous

146 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the LORD is his
refuge

147 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion when the
LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice
and Israel shall be glad



151 Lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy
holy hill

152 He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and
speaketh the truth in his heart

153 He that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his
neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour

154 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them
that fear the LORD He that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth
not
