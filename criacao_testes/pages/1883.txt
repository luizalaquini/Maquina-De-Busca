ds CX Principles of computer speech
pp
The most familiar device that produces speech output is the ordinary tape
recorder which stores information in analogue form on magnetic tape
However this is unsuitable for speech output from computers
One reason is that it is difficult to access different utterances quickly
Although random-access tape recorders do exist they are expensive and
subject to mechanical breakdown because of the stresses associated with
frequent starting and stopping
pp
Storing speech on a rotating drum instead of
tape offers the possibility of access to any track within one revolution time
For example the IBM 7770 Audio Response Unit employs drums rotating twice
a second which are able to store up to 32 500-msec words  These can be accessed
randomly within half a second at most
