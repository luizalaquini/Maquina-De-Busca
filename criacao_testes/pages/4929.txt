oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye
shall be remembered before the LORD your God and ye shall be saved
from your enemies

1010 Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and
in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over
your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings
that they may be to you for a memorial before your God I am the LORD
your God

1011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in
the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony

1012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of Sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran

1013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the LORD by the hand of Moses

1014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
of Judah according to their armies and over his host was Nahshon the
son of Amminadab

1015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
Nethaneel the son of Zuar

1016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
Eliab the son of Helon

1017 And the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of Gershon and
the sons of Merari set forward bearing the tabernacle

1018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
their armies and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur

1019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai

1020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
Eliasaph the son of Deuel

1021 And the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and the
other did set up the tabernacle against they came

1022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
forward according to their armies and over his host was Elishama the
son of Ammihud

1023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur

1024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
Abidan the son of Gideoni

1025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward
which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and
over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai

1026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
Pagiel the son of Ocran

1027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
Ahira the son of Enan

1028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
their armies when they set forward

1029 And Moses said unto Hobab the son of Raguel the Midianite
Moses father in law We are journeying unto the place of which the
LORD said I will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee
good for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel

1030 And he said unto him I will not go but I will depart to mine
own land and to my kindred

1031 And he said Leave us not I pray thee forasmuch as thou
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to
us instead of eyes

1032 And it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what
goodness the LORD shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee

1033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days
journey and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in
the three days journey to search out a resting place for them

1034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day when they went
out of the camp

1035 And it came to pass when the ark set forward that Moses said
Rise up LORD and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that
hate thee flee before thee

1036 And when it rested he said Return O LORD unto the many
thousands of Israel

111 And when the people complained it displeased the LORD and the
LORD heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
