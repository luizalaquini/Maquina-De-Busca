931 And the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in
the ear and the flax was bolled

932 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not
grown up

933 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread abroad
his hands unto the LORD and the thunders and hail ceased and the
rain was not poured upon the earth

934 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his
servants

935 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the
children of Israel go as the LORD had spoken by Moses

101 And the LORD said unto Moses Go in unto Pharaoh for I have
hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that I might shew
these my signs before him 102 And that thou mayest tell in the ears
of thy son and of thy sons son what things I have wrought in Egypt
and my signs which I have done among them that ye may know how that I
am the LORD

103 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him Thus
saith the LORD God of the Hebrews How long wilt thou refuse to humble
thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me

104 Else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will
I bring the locusts into thy coast 105 And they shall cover the face
of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall
eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you
from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of
the field 106 And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all
thy servants and the houses of all the Egyptians which neither thy
fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they
were upon the earth unto this day And he turned himself and went out
from Pharaoh

107 And Pharaohs servants said unto him How long shall this man be
a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the LORD their
God knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed  108 And Moses and
Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh and he said unto them Go
serve the LORD your God but who are they that shall go  109 And
Moses said We will go with our young and with our old with our sons
and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go
for we must hold a feast unto the LORD

1010 And he said unto them Let the LORD be so with you as I will
let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you

1011 Not so go now ye that are men and serve the LORD for that ye
did desire And they were driven out from Pharaohs presence

1012 And the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand over the
land of Egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of
Egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath
left

1013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt and
the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that
night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts

1014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt and rested in
all the coasts of Egypt very grievous were they before them there
were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such

1015 For they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land
was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the
fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any
green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all
the land of Egypt

1016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste and he said I
have sinned against the LORD your God and against you

1017 Now therefore forgive I pray thee my sin only this once and
intreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death
only

1018 And he went out from Pharaoh and intreated the LORD

1019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away
the locusts and cast them into the Red sea there remained not one
locust in all the coasts of Egypt

1020 But the LORD hardened Pharaohs heart so that he would not let
the children of Israel go

1021 And the LORD said unto Moses Stretch out thine hand toward
heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt even
darkness which may be felt

1022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was
a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days 1023 They saw
not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but
all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings

1024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses and said Go ye serve the LORD
