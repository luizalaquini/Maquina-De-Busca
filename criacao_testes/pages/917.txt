I don’t need—

You do I want you rested Go on I’m not going to let you sleep through the fight He made himself smile You’re the only one who can move those bloody barrels

Grenn went off muttering and Jon returned to the far eye searching the wildling camp From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead but he had learned to ignore those The range was long and the angle was bad the chances of being hit were small He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle The sons were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger Varamyr Sixskins walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging his heels

When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening he knew it would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning The sight of Mance’s turtle had robbed Jon of his appetite Their oil was all but gone and the last barrel of pitch had been rolled off the Wall two nights ago They would soon run short of arrows as well and there were no fletchers making more And the night before last a raven had come from the west from Ser Denys Mallister Bowen Marsh had chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower it seemed and then farther down into the gloom of the Gorge At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle But the victory had been a costly one More than a hundred brothers slain among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded Maester Mullin was tending him but it would be some time before he was fit to return to Castle Black

When he had read that Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole’s Town on their best horse to plead with the villagers to help man the Wall She never returned When he sent Mully after her he came back to report the whole village deserted even the brothel Most likely Zei had followed them straight down the kingsroad Maybe we should all do the same Jon reflected glumly

He made himself eat hungry or no Bad enough he could not sleep he could not go on without food as well Besides this might be my last meal It might be the last meal for all of us So it was that Jon had a belly full of bread bacon onions and cheese when he heard Horse shout IT’S COMING

No one needed to ask what it was Nor did Jon need the maester’s Myrish eye to see it creeping out from amongst the tents and trees It doesn’t really look much like a turtle Satin commented Turtles don’t have fur

Most of them don’t have wheels either said Pyp

Sound the warhorn Jon commanded and Kegs blew two long blasts to wake Grenn and the other sleepers who’d had the watch during the night If the wildlings were coming the Wall would need every man Gods know we have few enough Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin Horse and Owen the Oaf Tim Tangletongue Mully Spare Boot and the rest and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings in the freezing darkness of that tunnel with only a few iron bars between them That was what it would come down to unless they could stop the turtle before the gate was breached

It’s big Horse said

Pyp smacked his lips Think of all the soup it will make The jape was stillborn Even Pyp sounded tired He looks half dead thought Jon but so do we all The King-beyond-the-Wall had so many men that he could throw fresh attackers at them every time but the same handful of black brothers had to meet every assault and it had worn them ragged

The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard Jon knew putting their shoulders into it straining to keep the wheels turning but once the turtle was flush against the gate they would exchange their ropes for axes At least Mance was not sending his mammoths today Jon was glad of that Their awesome strength was wasted on the Wall and their size only made them easy targets The last had been a day and a half in the dying its mournful trumpetings terrible to hear

The turtle crept slowly through stones and stumps and brush The earlier attacks had cost the free folk a hundred lives or more Most still lay where they had fallen In the lulls the crows would come and pay them court but now the birds fled screeching They liked the look of that turtle no more than he did

Satin Horse and the others were looking to him Jon knew waiting for his orders He was so tired he hardly knew any more The Wall is mine he reminded himself Owen Horse to the catapults Kegs you and Spare Boot on the scorpions The rest of you string your bows Fire arrows Let’s see if we can burn it It was likely to be a futile gesture Jon knew but it had to be better than standing helpless

Cumbersome and slow-moving the turtle made for an easy shot and his archers and crossbowmen soon turned it into a lumbering wooden hedgehog… but the wet hides protected it just as they had the mantlets and the flaming arrows guttered out almost as soon as they struck Jon cursed under his breath Scorpions he commanded Catapults

The scorpions bolts punched deep into the pelts but did no more damage than the fire arrows The rocks went bouncing off the turtle’s roof leaving dimples in the thick layers of hides A stone from one of the trebuchets might have crushed it but the one machine was still broken and the wildlings had gone wide around the area where the other dropped its loads

Jon it’s still coming said Owen the Oaf

He could see that for himself Inch by inch yard by yard the turtle crept closer rolling rumbling and rocking as it crossed the killing ground Once the wildlings got it flush against the Wall it would give them all the shelter they needed while their axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates Inside under the ice they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours and then there would be nothing to stop them but two iron gates a few half-frozen corpses and whatever brothers Jon cared to throw in their path to fight and die down in the dark

To his left the catapult made a thunk and filled the air with spinning stones They plonked down on the turtle like hail and caromed harmlessly aside The wildling archers were still loosing arrows from behind their mantlets One thudded into the face of a straw man and Pyp said Four for Watt of Long Lake We have a tie The next shaft whistled past his own ear however Fie he shouted down I’m not in the tourney

The hides won’t burn Jon said as much to himself as to the others Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it reached the Wall For that they needed boulders No matter how stoutly built the turtle was a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of it from seven hundred feet was bound to do some damage Grenn Owen Kegs it’s time

Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were lined up in a row They were full of crushed rock the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give themselves better footing atop the Wall Yesterday after he’d seen the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins Jon told Grenn to pour water into the barrels as much as they would take The water would seep down through the crushed stone and overnight the whole thing would freeze solid It was the nearest thing to a boulder they were going to get

Why do we need to freeze it Grenn had asked him Why don’t we just roll the barrels off the way they are

Jon answered If they crash against the Wall on the way down they’ll burst and loose gravel will spray everywhere We don’t want to rain pebbles on the whoresons

He put his shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn while Kegs and Owen were wrestling with another Together they rocked it back and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around its bottom The bugger weighs a ton said Grenn

Tip it over and roll it Jon said Careful if it rolls over your foot you’ll end up like Spare Boot

Once the barrel was on its side Jon grabbed a torch and waved it above the surface of the Wall back and forth just enough to melt the ice a little The thin film of water helped the barrel roll more easily Too easily in fact they almost lost it But finally with four of them pooling their efforts they rolled their boulder to the edge and stood it up again

They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted There’s a turtle at our door Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look Hoardings Marsh should have built hoardings So many things they should have done The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away from the gate Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them and Jon thought he saw one man go down but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path but then he saw The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall so they simply pushed it over the carcass His leg twitched but Horse caught his arm and drew him back to safety You shouldn’t lean out like that the boy said
