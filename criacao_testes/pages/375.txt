No she said moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore Go careful Joien

He won’t hurt me This is not the day I die The male walked toward them unafraid and reached out for his muzzle a touch as light as a summer breeze Yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing and then he was spinning and falling falling falling…





CATELYN

As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again that Arya and Sansa held hands that Rickon was still a babe at her breast Robb crownless played with a wooden sword and when all were safe asleep she found Ned in her bed smiling

Sweet it was sweet and gone too soon Dawn came cruel a dagger of light She woke aching and alone and weary weary of riding weary of hurting weary of duty I want to weep she thought I want to be comforted I’m so tired of being strong I want to be foolish and frightened for once Just for a small while that’s all… a day… an hour…

Outside her tent men were stirring She heard the whicker of horses Shadd complaining of stiffness in his back Ser Wendel calling for his bow Catelyn wished they would all go away They were good men loyal yet she was tired of them all It was her children she yearned after One day she promised herself as she lay abed one day she would allow herself to be less than strong

But not today It could not be today

Her fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as she fumbled on her clothes She supposed she ought to be grateful that she had any use of her hands at all The dagger had been Valyrian steel and Valyrian steel bites deep and sharp She had only to look at the scars to remember

Outside Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing his bow My lady he said when Catelyn emerged There are birds in this grass Would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning

Oats and bread are sufficient… for all of us I think We have many leagues yet to ride Ser Wendel

As you will my lady The knight’s moon face looked crestfallen the tips of his great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment Oats and bread and what could be better He was one of the fattest men Catelyn had ever known but howevermuch he loved his food he loved his honor more

Found some nettles and brewed a tea Shadd announced Will m’lady take a cup

Yes with thanks

She cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it Shadd was one of the Winterfell men Robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to Renly He had sent five lordlings as well whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission As they made their way south staying well clear of towns and holdfasts they had seen bands of mailed men more than once and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon but none had dared molest them They were too weak to be a threat too many to be easy prey Once across the Blackwater the worst was behind For the past four days they had seen no signs of war

Catelyn had never wanted this She had told Robb as much back in Riverrun When last I saw Renly he was a boy no older than Bran I do not know him Send someone else My place is here with my father for whatever time he has left

Her son had looked at her unhappily There is no one else I cannot go myself Your father’s too ill The Blackfish is my eyes and ears I dare not lose him Your brother I need to hold Riverrun when we march—

March No one had said a word to her of marching

I cannot sit at Riverrun waiting for peace It makes me look as if I were afraid to take the field again When there are no battles to fight men start to think of hearth and harvest Father told me that Even my northmen grow restless

My northmen she thought He is even starting to talk like a king No one has ever died of restlessness but rashness is another matter We’ve planted seeds let them grow

Robb shook his head stubbornly We’ve tossed some seeds in the wind that’s all if your sister Lysa was coming to aid us we would have heard by now How many birds have we sent to the Eyrie four I want peace too but why should the Lannisters give me anything if all I do is sit here while my army melts away around me swift as summer snow

So rather than look craven you will dance to Lord Tywin’s pipes she threw back He wants you to march on Harrenhal ask your uncle Brynden if—

I said nothing of Harrenhal Robb said Now will you go to Renly for me or must I send the Greatjon

The memory brought a wan smile to her face Such an obvious ploy that yet deft for a boy of fifteen Robb knew how ill-suited a man like Greatjon Umber would be to treat with a man like Renly Baratheon and he knew that she knew it as well What could she do but accede praying that her father would live until her return Had Lord Hoster been well he would have gone himself she knew Still that leavetaking was hard hard He did not even know her when she came to say farewell Minisa he called her where are the children My little Cat my sweet Lysa… Catelyn had kissed him on the brow and told him his babes were well Wait for me my lord she said as his eyes closed I waited for you oh so many times Now you must wait for me

Fate drives me south and south again Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea when it is north I should be going north to home She had written to Bran and Rickon that last night at Riverrun I do not forget you my sweet ones you must believe that It is only that your brother needs me more

We ought to reach the upper Mander today my lady Ser Wendel announced while Shadd spooned out the porridge Lord Renly will not be far if the talk be true
