The user dials the system from an
ordinary telephone  The recognition side must be trained by each user and
accepts isolated words spoken with brief pauses between them
The voice response unit has a vocabulary of around 200 words and
synthesizes its answers by slotting words into templates evoked by the speech
understanding part in response to a query  For example
LB
NI
This flight makes em stops
NI
Flight number em leaves em at em  arrives in em at em
LE
are templates which when called with specific slot fillers could produce the
utterances
LB
NI
This flight makes three stops
NI
Flight number nine two leaves New York at four pm
arrives in Chicago at five twenty-five pm
LE
The chief research interest of the system is in its speech understanding
capabilities and the method used for speech output is relatively
straightforward  The templates and words are recorded digitized compressed
slightly and stored on disk files totalling a few hundred thousand bytes of
storage using techniques similar to those of System X
Again no independent manipulation of pitch is possible and so the utterances
sound intelligible but the transition between templates and slot fillers is not
completely fluent  However the overall context of the interaction means that
the communication is not seriously disrupted even if the machine occasionally
misunderstands the man or vice versa  The users attention is drawn away from
recognition accuracy and focussed on the exchange of information with the machine
The authors conclude that progress in speech recognition can best be made by
studying it in the context of communication rather than in a vacuum or as part
of a one-way channel and the same is undoubtedly true of speech synthesis as

Perhaps the most advanced attempt to provide speech output from a computer
is the Kurzweil reading machine for the blind first marketed in the late
1970s Figure 14
FC Figure 14
This device reads an ordinary book aloud  Users adjust the reading
speed according to the content of the material and their familiarity with
it and the maximum rate has recently been improved to around 225 words per
minute em perhaps half as fast again as normal human speech rates

As well as generating speech from text the machine has to scan the document
being read and identify the characters presented to it  A scanning camera
is used controlled by a program which searches for and tracks the lines of
text  The output of the camera is digitized and the image is enhanced
using signal-processing techniques  Next each individual letter must be
isolated and its geometric features identified and compared with a pre-stored
table of letter shapes  Isolation of letters is not at all trivial for
many type fonts have ligatures which are combinations of characters joined
together for example the letters fi are often run together  The
machine must cope with many printed type fonts as well as typewritten ones
The text-recognition side of the Kurzweil reading machine is in fact one of
its most advanced features

We will discuss the problem of speech generation from text in Chapter 9
It has many facets  First there is pronunciation the
translation of letters to sounds  It is important to take into account
the morphological structure of words dividing them into root and endings
Many words have concatenated suffixes like like-li-ness  These are
important to detect because a final e which appears on a root word
is not pronounced itself but affects the pronunciation of the previous
vowel  Then there is the difficulty that some words look the same
but are pronounced differently depending on their meaning or on the syntactic
part that they play in the sentence
Appropriate intonation is extremely difficult to generate from a plain textual
representation for it depends on the meaning of the text and the way in which
emphasis is given to it by the reader  Similarly the rhythmic structure is
important partly for correct pronunciation and partly for purposes of
emphasis
Finally the sounds that have been deduced from the text need to be synthesized
into acoustic form taking due account of the many and varied contextual effects
that occur in natural speech  This by itself is a challenging problem
pp
The performance of the Kurzweil reading machine is not good  While it seems
to be true that some blind people can make use of it it is far from
comprehensible to an untrained listener  For example
it will miss out words and even whole phrases hesitate in a
