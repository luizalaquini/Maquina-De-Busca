But 11-bit quantization seems to give a very much better signal-to-noise
ratio than these figures  To estimate its magnitude note that for N-bit quantization
the error for each sample will lie between
LB

-  1 over 2  2 sup -N    and    +  1 over 2  2 sup -N 

LE
Assuming that it is uniformly distributed in this range em an assumption
which is likely to be justified if the number of levels is sufficiently
large em leads to a mean-squared error of
LB
EQ
integral from -2 sup -N-1 to 2 sup -N-1 e sup 2 pe de
EN
LE
where pe the probability density function of the error e is a constant
which satisfies the usual probability normalization constraint namely
LB
EQ
integral from -2 sup -N-1 to 2 sup -N-1  pe de = 1
EN
LE
Hence pe=2 sup N  and so the mean-squared error is  2 sup -2N 12
This is  10  log sub 10 2 sup -2N 12 dB or around -77 dB for 11-bit
quantization

This noise level is relative to the maximum amplitude range of the conversion
A maximum-amplitude sine wave has a power of -9 dB relative to the same
reference giving a signal-to-noise ratio of some 68 dB  This is far in excess
of that needed for telephone-quality speech  However look at the very peaky
nature of the typical speech waveform given in Figure 35
FC Figure 35
If clipping is to be avoided the maximum amplitude level of the AD converter
must be set at a value which makes the power of the speech signal very much
less than a maximum-amplitude sine wave  Furthermore different people
speak at very different volumes and the overall level fluctuates constantly
with just one speaker  Experience shows that while 8- or 9-bit quantization
may provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to preserve telephone-quality
speech if the overall speaker levels are carefully controlled about 11 bits
are generally required to provide high-quality representation of speech with
a uniform quantization  With 11 bits a sine wave whose amplitude is only 132
of the full-scale value would be digitized with a signal-to-noise ratio
of around 36 dB the most pessimistic figure quoted above for adequate quality
Even then it is useful if the speaker is provided
with an indication of the amplitude of his speech  a traffic-light
indicator with red signifying clipping overload orange a suitable level
and green too low a value is often convenient for this
rh Logarithmic quantization
For the purposes of speech
ul
processing
it is essential to have the signal quantized uniformly  This is because
all of the theory applies to linear systems and nonlinearities introduce
complexities which are not amenable to analysis
Uniform quantization although a nonlinear operation is linear in the
limiting case as the number of levels becomes large and for most purposes
its effect can be modelled by assuming that the quantized signal is obtained
from the original analogue one by the addition of a small amount of
uniformly-distributed quantizing noise as in fact was done above
Usually the quantization noise is disregarded in subsequent analysis
pp
However the peakiness of the speech signal illustrated in Figure 35 leads
one to suspect that a non-linear representation for example a logarithmic one
could provide a better signal-to-noise ratio over a wider range of input
amplitudes and hence be more useful than linear quantization em at least
for speech storage and transmission
And indeed this is the case  Linear quantization has the unfortunate effect
that the absolute noise level is independent of the signal level so that an excessive
number of bits must be used if a reasonable ratio is to be achieved for peaky
signals  It can be shown that a logarithmic representation like
LB
EQ
y  =  1  +  k  log  x
EN
LE
where x is the original signal and y is the value which is to be quantized
gives a
signal-to-noise
ul
ratio
which is independent of the input signal level
This relationship cannot be realized physically for it is undefined when the signal
is negative and diverges when it is zero
However realizable approximations to it can be made which retain the advantages
of constant signal-to-noise ratio within a useful range of signal amplitudes
Figure 36 shows the logarithmic relation with one widely-used approximation to it
called the A-law
FC Figure 36
The idea of non-linearly quantizing a signal to achieve adequate signal-to-noise
ratios for a wide variety of amplitudes is called companding a contraction
of compressing-expanding  The original signal can be retrieved from
its A-law compression by antilogarithmic expansion
pp
Figure 36 also
shows one common coding scheme which is a piecewise linear approximation
to the A-law  This provides an 8-bit code and gives the equivalent
of 12-bit linear quantization for small signal levels  It approximates
the A-law in 16 linear segments 8 for positive and 8 for negative
inputs
