Vylarr stood like a man made of stone It was Grand Maester Pycelle who rose gasping My lord Hand that cannot… your father Lord Tywin himself he sent these good men to our city to protect Queen Cersei and her children…

The Kingsguard and the City Watch protect them well enough The gods speed you on your way Vylarr

At the council table Varys smiled knowingly Littlefinger sat feigning boredom and Pycelle gaped like a fish pale and confused A herald stepped forward If any man has other matters to set before the King’s Hand let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence

I will be heard A slender man all in black pushed his way between the Redwyne twins

Ser Alliser Tyrion exclaimed Why I had no notion that you’d come to court You should have sent me word

I have as well you know Thorne was as prickly as his name a spare sharp-featured man of fifty hard-eyed and hard-handed his black hair streaked with grey I have been shunned ignored and left to wait like some baseborn servant

Truly Bronn this was not well done Ser Alliser and I are old friends We walked the Wall together

Sweet Ser Alliser murmured Varys you must not think too harshly of us So many seek our Joffrey’s grace in these troubled and tumultuous times

More troubled than you know eunuch

To his face we call him Lord Eunuch quipped Littlefinger

How may we be of help to you good brother Grand Maester Pycelle asked in soothing tones

The Lord Commander sent me to His Grace the king Thorne answered The matter is too grave to be left to servants

The king is playing with his new crossbow Tyrion said Ridding himself of Joffrey had required only an ungainly Myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time and nothing would do but that he try it at once You can speak to servants or hold your silence

As you will Ser Alliser said displeasure in every word I am sent to tell you that we found two rangers long missing They were dead yet when we brought the corpses back to the Wall they rose again in the night One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker while the second tried to murder the Lord Commander

Distantly Tyrion heard someone snigger Does he mean to mock me with this folly He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys Littlefinger and Pycelle wondering if one of them had a role in this A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him he was doomed And yet… and yet…

Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he’d stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world gazing out at the trackless dark beyond He had felt—what—something to be sure a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind A wolf had howled off in the night and the sound had sent a shiver through him

Don’t be a fool he told himself A wolf a wind a dark forest it meant nothing And yet… He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black I trust that the Old Bear survived this attack

He did

And that your brothers killed these ah dead men

We did

You’re certain that they are dead this time Tyrion asked mildly When Bronn choked on a snort of laughter he knew how he must proceed Truly truly dead

They were dead the first time Ser Alliser snapped Pale and cold with black hands and feet I brought Jared’s hand torn from his corpse by the bastard’s wolf

Littlefinger stirred And where is this charming token

Ser Alliser frowned uncomfortably It… rotted to pieces while I waited unheard There’s naught left to show but bones

Titters echoed through the hall Lord Baelish Tyrion called down to Littlefinger buy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him

Spades Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously

If you bury your dead they won’t come walking Tyrion told him and the court laughed openly Spades will end your troubles with some strong backs to wield them Ser Jacelyn see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons
