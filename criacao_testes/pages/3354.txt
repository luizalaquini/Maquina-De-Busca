sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God

25 Remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these
things  26 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
revealed in his time

27 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now
letteth will let until he be taken out of the way

28 And then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming 29 Even him whose coming is after the
working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders 210 And
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish
because they received not the love of the truth that they might be
saved

211 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they
should believe a lie 212 That they all might be damned who believed
not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness

213 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you brethren
beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
truth 214 Whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of
the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ

215 Therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye
have been taught whether by word or our epistle

216 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even our Father
which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and
good hope through grace 217 Comfort your hearts and stablish you in
every good word and work

31 Finally brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may have
free course and be glorified even as it is with you 32 And that we
may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have
not faith

33 But the Lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you
from evil

34 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you that ye both do
and will do the things which we command you

35 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the
patient waiting for Christ

36 Now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us

37 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you 38 Neither did we eat any mans bread
for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we
might not be chargeable to any of you 39 Not because we have not
power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us

310 For even when we were with you this we commanded you that if
any would not work neither should he eat

311 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly
working not at all but are busybodies

312 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread

313 But ye brethren be not weary in well doing

314 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man
and have no company with him that he may be ashamed

315 Yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother

316 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means
The Lord be with you all

317 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand which is the token in
every epistle so I write

318 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen




The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy


11 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope 12 Unto Timothy
my own son in the faith Grace mercy and peace from God our Father
and Jesus Christ our Lord

13 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus when I went into
Macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
doctrine 14 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies
which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in
faith so do
