812 Then said he unto me Son of man hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark every man in the
chambers of his imagery for they say the LORD seeth us not the LORD
hath forsaken the earth

813 He said also unto me Turn thee yet again and thou shalt see
greater abominations that they do

814 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORDs house
which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for
Tammuz

815 Then said he unto me Hast thou seen this O son of man turn
thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these

816 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORDs house and
behold at the door of the temple of the LORD between the porch and
the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the
temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east and they
worshipped the sun toward the east

817 Then he said unto me Hast thou seen this O son of man Is it a
light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations
which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence
and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch
to their nose

818 Therefore will I also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare
neither will I have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
voice yet will I not hear them

91 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying Cause them
that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his
destroying weapon in his hand

92 And behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which
lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand
and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhorn
by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar

93 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub
whereupon he was to the threshold of the house And he called to the
man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side
94 And the LORD said unto him Go through the midst of the city
through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of
the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done
in the midst thereof

95 And to the others he said in mine hearing Go ye after him through
the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity 96
Slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and
women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at
my sanctuary Then they began at the ancient men which were before the
house

97 And he said unto them Defile the house and fill the courts with
the slain go ye forth And they went forth and slew in the city

98 And it came to pass while they were slaying them and I was left
that I fell upon my face and cried and said Ah Lord GOD wilt thou
destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon
Jerusalem  99 Then said he unto me The iniquity of the house of
Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood
and the city full of perverseness for they say The LORD hath
forsaken the earth and the LORD seeth not

910 And as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will I have
pity but I will recompense their way upon their head

911 And behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by
his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou hast
commanded me

101 Then I looked and behold in the firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire
stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne

102 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said Go in
between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the
city And he went in in my sight

103 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the
man went in and the cloud filled the inner court

104 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub and stood
over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the
cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the LORDs glory

105 And the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer
court as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh

106 And it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed
with linen saying Take fire from between the wheels from between
the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels

107 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took
thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen
