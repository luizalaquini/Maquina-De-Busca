What are you talking about Tollett

The axe that split your skull Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate them

The big lout Grenn laughed and even Samwell Tarly managed a weak little smile Chett kicked the nearest dog yanked on their leashes and started up the hill Smile all you want Ser Piggy We’ll see who laughs tonight He only wished he had time to kill Tollett as well Gloomy horsefaced fool that’s what he is

The climb was steep even on this side of the Fist which had the gentlest slope Partway up the dogs started barking and pulling at him figuring that they’d get fed soon He gave them a taste of his boot instead and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that snapped at him Once they were tied up he went to report The prints were there like Giant said but the dogs wouldn’t track he told Mormont in front of his big black tent Down by the river like that could be old prints

A pity Lord Commander Mormont had a bald head and a great shaggy grey beard and sounded as tired as he looked We might all have been better for a bit of fresh meat The raven on his shoulder bobbed its head and echoed Meat Meat Meat

We could cook the bloody dogs Chett thought but he kept his mouth shut until the Old Bear sent him on his way And that’s the last time I’ll need to bow my head to that one he thought to himself with satisfaction It seemed to him that it was growing even colder which he would have swom Wasn’t possible The dogs huddled together miserably in the hard frozen mud and Chett was half tempted to crawl in with them Instead he wrapped a black wool scarf round the lower part of his face leaving a slit for his mouth between the winds It was warmer if he kept moving he found so he made a slow circuit of the perimeter with a wad of sourleaf sharing a chew or two with the black brothers on guard and hearing what they had to say None of the men on the day watch were part of his scheme even so he figured it was good to have some sense of what they were thinking

Mostly what they were thinking was that it was bloody cold

The wind was rising as the shadows lengthened It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall I hate that sound little Giant said It sounds like a babe in the brush wailing away for milk

When he finished the circuit and returned to the dogs he found Lark waiting for him The officers are in the Old Bear’s tent again talking something fierce

That’s what they do said Chett They’re highborn all but Blane they get drunk on words instead of wine

Lark sidled closer Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird he warned glancing about to make certain no one was close Now he’s asking if we cached any seed for the damn thing

It’s a raven said Chett It eats corpses

Lark grinned His might be

Or yours It seemed to Chett that they needed the big man more than they needed Lark Stop fretting about Small Paul You do your part he’ll do his

Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid himself of the Sisterman and sat down to edge his sword It was bloody hard work with his gloves on but he wasn’t about to take them off Cold as it was any fool that touched steel with a bare hand was going to lose a patch of skin

The dogs whimpered when the sun went down He gave them water and curses Half a night more and you can find your own feast By then he could smell supper

Dywen was holding forth at the cookfire as Chett got his heel of hardbread and a bowl of bean and bacon soup from Hake the cook The wood’s too silent the old forester was saying No frogs near that river no owls in the dark I never heard no deader wood than this

Them teeth of yours sound pretty dead said Hake

Dywen clacked his wooden teeth No wolves neither There was before but no more Where’d they go you figure

Someplace warm said Chett

Of the dozen odd brothers who sat by the fire four were his He gave each one a hard squinty look as he ate to see if any showed signs of breaking Dirk seemed calm enough sitting silent and sharpening his blade the way he did every night And Sweet Donnel Hill was all easy japes He had white teeth and fat red lips and yellow locks that he wore in an artful tumble about his shoulders and he claimed to be the bastard of some Lannister Maybe he was at that Chett had no use for pretty boys nor for bastards neither but Sweet Donnel seemed like to hold his own

He was less certain about the forester the brothers called Sawwood more for his snoring than for anything to do with trees Just now he looked so restless he might never snore again And Maslyn was worse Chett could see sweat trickling down his face despite the frigid wind The beads of moisture sparkled in the firelight like so many little wet jewels Maslyn wasn’t eating neither only staring at his soup as if the smell of it was about to make him sick I’ll need to watch that one Chett thought

Assemble The shout came suddenly from a dozen throats and quickly spread to every part of the hilltop camp Men of the Night’s Watch Assemble at the central fire

Frowning Chett finished his soup and followed the rest

The Old Bear stood before the fire with Smallwood Locke Wythers and Blane ranged behind him in a row Mormont wore a cloak of thick black fur and his raven perched upon his shoulder preening its black feathers This can’t be good Chett squeezed between Brown Bernarr and some Shadow Tower men When everyone was gathered save for the watchers in the woods and the guards on the ringwall Mormont cleared his throat and spat The spittle was frozen before it hit the ground Brothers he said men of the Night’s Watch

Men his raven screamed Men Men

The wildlings are on the march following the course of the Milkwater down out of the mountains Thoren believes their van will be upon us ten days hence Their most seasoned raiders will be with Harma Dogshead in that van The rest will likely form a rearguard or ride in close company with Mance Rayder himself Elsewhere their fighters will be spread thin along the line of march They have oxen mules horses… But few enough Most will be afoot and ill-armed and untrained Such weapons as they carry are more like to be stone and bone than steel They are burdened with women children herds of sheep and goats and all their worldly goods besides In short though they are numerous they are vulnerable… And they do not know that we are here Or so we must pray
