173 And this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true
God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent

174 I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do

175 And now O Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the
glory which I had with thee before the world was

176 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have
kept thy word

177 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
are of thee

178 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and
they have received them and have known surely that I came out from
thee and they have believed that thou didst send me

179 I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which
thou hast given me for they are thine

1710 And all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified
in them

1711 And now I am no more in the world but these are in the world
and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those
whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are

1712 While I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name
those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but
the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled

1713 And now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves

1714 I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them
because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world

1715 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil

1716 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world

1717 Sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth

1718 As thou hast sent me into the world even so have I also sent
them into the world

1719 And for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be
sanctified through the truth

1720 Neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word 1721 That they all may be one as
thou Father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in
us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me

1722 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they
may be one even as we are one 1723 I in them and thou in me that
they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me

1724 Father I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with
me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given
me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world

1725 O righteous Father the world hath not known thee but I have
known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me

1726 And I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and I in
them

181 When Jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron where was a garden into the which he
entered and his disciples

182 And Judas also which betrayed him knew the place for Jesus
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples

183 Judas then having received a band of men and officers from the
chief priests and Pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons

184 Jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him
went forth and said unto them Whom seek ye  185 They answered him
Jesus of Nazareth Jesus saith unto them I am he

And Judas also which betrayed him stood with them

186 As soon then as he had said unto them I am he they went
backward and fell to the ground

187 Then asked he them again Whom seek ye And they said Jesus of
Nazareth

188 Jesus answered I have told you that I am he if therefore ye
seek me let these go their way 189 That the saying might be
