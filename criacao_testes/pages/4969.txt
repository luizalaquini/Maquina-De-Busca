as water

1217 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or
of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill
offerings or heave offering of thine hand 1218 But thou must eat
them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall
choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and
thy maidservant and the Levite that is within thy gates and thou
shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine
hands unto

1219 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
thou livest upon the earth

1220 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border as he hath
promised thee and thou shalt say I will eat flesh because thy soul
longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul
lusteth after

1221 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name
there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of
thy flock which the LORD hath given thee as I have commanded thee
and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after

1222 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat
them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike

1223 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the
life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh

1224 Thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
water

1225 Thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with
thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the
sight of the LORD

1226 Only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt
take and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose 1227 And
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon
the altar of the LORD thy God and the blood of thy sacrifices shall
be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God and thou shalt eat
the flesh

1228 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee that it
may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when
thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy
God

1229 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them
and dwellest in their land 1230 Take heed to thyself that thou be
not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before
thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying How did
these nations serve their gods even so will I do likewise

1231 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God for every
abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done unto their
gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the
fire to their gods

1232 What thing soever I command you observe to do it thou shalt
not add thereto nor diminish from it

131 If there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder 132 And the sign or the wonder come
to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying Let us go after other
gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them 133 Thou
shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of
dreams for the LORD your God proveth you to know whether ye love the
LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul

134 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his
commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave
unto him

135 And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to
death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God
which brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of
the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy
God commanded thee to walk in So shalt thou put the evil away from
the midst of thee

136 If thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy
daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine
own soul entice thee secretly saying Let us go and serve other
gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers 137 Namely
of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee
or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth 138 Thou shalt not consent unto him nor
hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou
spare neither shalt thou conceal him 139 But thou shalt surely kill
him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and
afterwards the hand of all the people

1310 And thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he
hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God which brought
thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage
