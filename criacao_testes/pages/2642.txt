717 And his return was to Ramah for there was his house and there
he judged Israel and there he built an altar unto the LORD

81 And it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons
judges over Israel

82 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his
second Abiah they were judges in Beersheba

83 And his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre
and took bribes and perverted judgment

84 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and
came to Samuel unto Ramah 85 And said unto him Behold thou art
old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us
like all the nations

86 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said Give us a king to
judge us And Samuel prayed unto the LORD

87 And the LORD said unto Samuel Hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected
thee but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them

88 According to all the works which they have done since the day that
I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day wherewith they have
forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee

89 Now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest
solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall
reign over them

810 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
asked of him a king

811 And he said This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
over you He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for
his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his
chariots

812 And he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains
over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his
harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his
chariots

813 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be
cooks and to be bakers

814 And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your
oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants

815 And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards
and give to his officers and to his servants

816 And he will take your menservants and your maidservants and
your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work

817 He will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his
servants

818 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
shall have chosen you and the LORD will not hear you in that day

819 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel and
they said Nay but we will have a king over us 820 That we also may
be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out
before us and fight our battles

821 And Samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the LORD

822 And the LORD said to Samuel Hearken unto their voice and make
them a king And Samuel said unto the men of Israel Go ye every man
unto his city

91 Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of
Abiel the son of Zeror the son of Bechorath the son of Aphiah a
Benjamite a mighty man of power

92 And he had a son whose name was Saul a choice young man and a
goodly and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier
person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any
of the people

93 And the asses of Kish Sauls father were lost And Kish said to
Saul his son Take now one of the servants with thee and arise go
seek the asses

94 And he passed through mount Ephraim and passed through the land
of Shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the
land of Shalim and there they were not and he passed through the
land of the Benjamites but they found them not

95 And when they were come to the land of Zuph Saul said to his
servant that was with him Come and let us return lest my father
leave caring for the asses and take thought for us

96 And he said unto him Behold now there is in this city a man of
God and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to
