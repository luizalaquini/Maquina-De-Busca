Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard That was clever of him the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth The little princess had been barefoot still dressed in her bed gown and the boy… the boy…

Ned could not let that happen again The realm could not withstand a second mad king another dance of blood and vengeance He must find some way to save the children

Robert could be merciful Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned Grand Maester Pycelle Varys the Spider Lord Balon Greyjoy each had been counted an enemy to Robert once and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty So long as a man was brave and honest Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy

This was something else poison in the dark a knife thrust to the soul This he could never forgive no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar He will kill them all Ned realized

And yet he knew he could not keep silent He had a duty to Robert to the realm to the shade of Jon Arryn… and to Bran who surely must have stumbled on some part of the truth Why else would they have tried to slay him

Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard the portly guardsman with the ginger-colored whiskers his children called Fat Tom With Jory dead and Alyn gone Fat Tom had command of his household guard The thought filled Ned with vague disquiet Tomard was a solid man affable loyal tireless capable in a limited way but he was near fifty and even in his youth he had never been energetic Perhaps Ned should not have been so quick to send off half his guard and all his best swords among them

I shall require your help Ned said when Tomard appeared looking faintly apprehensive as he always did when called before his lord Take me to the godswood

Is that wise Lord Eddard With your leg and all

Perhaps not But necessary

Tomard summoned Varly With one arm around each man’s shoulders Ned managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey I want the guard doubled he told Fat Tom No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave

Tom blinked M’lord with Alyn and the others away we are hard-pressed already—

It will only be a short while Lengthen the watches

As you say m’lord Tom answered Might I ask why—

Best not Ned answered crisply

The godswood was empty as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods Ned’s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree Thank you He drew a paper from his sleeve sealed with the sigil of his House Kindly deliver this at once

Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously My lord…

Do as I bid you Tom Ned said

How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood he could not say It was peaceful here The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle and he could hear birds singing the murmur of crickets leaves rustling in a gentle wind The heart tree was an oak brown and faceless yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods His leg did not seem to hurt so much

She came to him at sunset as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers She came alone as he had bid her For once she was dressed simply in leather boots and hunting greens When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak he saw the bruise where the king had struck her The angry plum color had faded to yellow and the swelling was down but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was

Why here Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him

So the gods can see

She sat beside him on the grass Her every move was graceful Her curling blond hair moved in the wind and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty but he saw it now I know the truth Jon Arryn died for he told her

Do you The queen watched his face wary as a cat Is that why you called me here Lord Stark To pose me riddles Or is it your intent to seize me as your wife seized my brother

If you truly believed that you would never have come Ned touched her cheek gently Has he done this before

Once or twice She shied away from his hand Never on the face before Jaime would have killed him even if it meant his own life Cersei looked at him defiantly My brother is worth a hundred of your friend

Your brother Ned said Or your lover

Both She did not flinch from the truth Since we were children together And why not The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years to keep the bloodlines pure And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We are one person in two bodies We shared a womb together He came into this world holding my foot our old maester said When he is in me I feel… whole The ghost of a smile flitted over her lips

My son Bran…

To her credit Cersei did not look away He saw us You love your children do you not

Robert had asked him the very same question the morning of the melee He gave her the same answer With all my heart

No less do I love mine

Ned thought If it came to that the life of some child I did not know against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon what would I do Even more so what would Catelyn do if it were Jon’s life against the children of her body He did not know He prayed he never would

All three are Jaime’s he said It was not a question

Thank the gods

The seed is strong Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed and so it was All those bastards all with hair as black as night Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion some ninety years ago when Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon third son of the reigning lord Their only issue an unnamed boy described in Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair died in infancy Thirty years before that a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid to wife She had given him three daughters and a son each black-haired No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages always he found the gold yielding before the coal

A dozen years Ned said How is it that you have had no children by the king

She lifted her head defiant Your Robert got me with child once she said her voice thick with contempt My brother found a woman to cleanse me He never knew If truth be told I can scarcely bear for him to touch me and I have not let him inside me for years I know other ways to pleasure him when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber Whatever we do the king is usually so drunk that he’s forgotten it all by the next morning

How could they have all been so blind The truth was there in front of them all the time written on the children’s faces Ned felt sick I remember Robert as he was the day he took the throne every inch a king he said quietly A thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts What did he do to make you hate him so

Her eyes burned green fire in the dusk like the lioness that was her sigil The night of our wedding feast the first time we shared a bed he called me by your sister’s name He was on top of me in me stinking of wine and he whispered Lyanna

Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses and for a moment he wanted to weep I do not know which of you I pity most

The queen seemed amused by that Save your pity for yourself Lord Stark I want none of it

You know what I must do

Must She put her hand on his good leg just above the knee A true man does what he will not what he must Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh the gentlest of promises The realm needs a strong Hand Joff will not come of age for years No one wants war again least of all me Her hand touched his face his hair If friends can turn to enemies enemies can become friends Your wife is a thousand leagues away and my brother has fled Be kind to me Ned I swear to you you shall never regret it

Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn

She slapped him

I shall wear that as a badge of honor Ned said dryly

Honor she spat How dare you play the noble lord with me What do you take me for You’ve a bastard of your own I’ve seen him Who was the mother I wonder Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned A whore Or was it the grieving sister the Lady Ashara She threw herself into the sea I’m told Why was that For the brother you slew or the child you stole Tell me my honorable Lord Eddard how are you any different from Robert or me or Jaime

For a start said Ned I do not kill children You would do well to listen my lady I shall say this only once When the king returns from his hunt I intend to lay the truth before him You must be gone by then You and your children all three and not to Casterly Rock If I were you I should take ship for the Free Cities or even farther to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben As far as the winds blow

Exile she said A bitter cup to drink from

A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar’s children Ned said and kinder than you deserve Your father and your brothers would do well to go with you Lord Tywin’s gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe You shall need them I promise you no matter where you flee Robert’s wrath will follow you to the back of beyond if need be
