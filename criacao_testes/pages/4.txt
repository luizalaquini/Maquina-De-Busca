64 There were giants in the earth in those days and also after that
when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bare
children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of
renown

65 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually

66 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth and it
grieved him at his heart

67 And the LORD said I will destroy man whom I have created from the
face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and
the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them

68 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD

69 These are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations and Noah walked with God

610 And Noah begat three sons Shem Ham and Japheth

611 The earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled
with violence

612 And God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth

613 And God said unto Noah The end of all flesh is come before me
for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I
will destroy them with the earth

614 Make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the
ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch

615 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of The length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty
cubits and the height of it thirty cubits

616 A window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it

617 And behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under
heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die

618 But with thee will I establish my covenant and thou shalt come
into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives
with thee

619 And of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be
male and female

620 Of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort
shall come unto thee to keep them alive

621 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt
gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them

622 Thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so did
he

71 And the LORD said unto Noah Come thou and all thy house into the
ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation

72 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male
and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
his female

73 Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth

74 For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights and every living substance that I have
made will I destroy from off the face of the earth

75 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him

76 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth

77 And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood

78 Of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 79 There went in two
and two unto Noah into the ark the male and the female as God had
commanded Noah

710 And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth

711 In the six hundredth year of Noahs life in the second month
the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
