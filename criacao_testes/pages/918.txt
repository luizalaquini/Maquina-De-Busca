We should have built hoardings Jon thought he could hear the crash of axes on wood but that was probably just fear ringing in his ears He looked to Grenn Do it

Grenn got behind a barrel put his shoulder against it grunted and began to push Owen and Mully moved to help him They shoved the barrel out a foot and then another And suddenly it was gone

They heard the thump as it struck the Wall on the way down and then much louder the crash and crack of splintering wood followed by shouts and screams Satin whooped and Owen the Oaf danced in circles while Pyp leaned out and called The turtle was stuffed full of rabbits Look at them hop away

Again Jon barked and Grenn and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel and sent it tottering out into empty air

By the time they were done the front of Mance’s turtle was a crushed and splintered ruin and wildlings were spilling out the other end and scrambling for their camp Satin scooped up his crossbow and sent a few quarrels after them as they ran to see them off the faster Grenn was grinning through his beard Pyp was making japes and none of them would die today

On the morrow though… Jon glanced toward the shed Eight barrels of gravel remained where twelve had stood a few moments before He realized how tired he was then and how much his wound was hurting I need to sleep A few hours at least He could go to Maester Aemon for some dreamwine that would help I am going down to the King’s Tower he told them Call me if Mance gets up to anything Pyp you have the Wall

Me said Pyp

Him said Grenn

Smiling he left them to it and rode down in the cage

A cup of dreamwine did help as it happened No sooner had he stretched out on the narrow bed in his cell than sleep took him His dreams were strange and formless full of strange voices shouts and cries and the sound of a warhorn blowing low and loud a single deep booming note that lingered in the air

When he awoke the sky was black outside the arrow slit that served him for a window and four men he did not know were standing over him One held a lantern Jon Snow the tallest of them said brusquely pull on your boots and come with us

His first groggy thought was that somehow the Wall had fallen whilst he slept that Mance Rayder had sent more giants or another turtle and broken through the gate But when he rubbed his eyes he saw that the strangers were all in black They’re men of the Night’s Watch Jon realized Come where Who are you

The tall man gestured and two of the others pulled Jon from the bed With the lantern leading the way they marched him from his cell and up a half turn of stair to the Old Bear’s solar He saw Maester Aemon standing by the fire his hands folded around the head of a blackthorn cane Septon Cellador was half drunk as usual and Ser Wynton Stout was asleep in a window seat The other brothers were strangers to him All but one

Immaculate in his fur-trimmed cloak and polished boots Ser Alliser Thorne turned to say Here’s the turncloak now my lord Ned Stark’s bastard of Winterfell

I’m no turncloak Thorne Jon said coldly

We shall see In the leather chair behind the table where the Old Bear wrote his letters sat a big broad jowly man Jon did not know Yes we shall see he said again You will not deny that you are Jon Snow I hope Stark’s bastard

Lord Snow he likes to call himself Ser Alliser was a spare slim man compact and sinewy and just now his flinty eyes were dark with amusement

You’re the one who named me Lord Snow said Jon Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys he trained during his time as Castle Black’s master-at-arms The Old Bear had sent Thorne to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea These others must be Eastwatch men The bird reached Cotter Pyke and he’s sent us help How many men have you brought he asked the man behind the table

It’s me who’ll ask the questions the jowly man replied You’ve been charged with oathbreaking cowardice and desertion Jon Snow Do you deny that you abandoned your brothers to die on the Fist of the First Men and joined the wildling Mance Rayder this self-styled King-beyond-the-Wall

Abandoned… Jon almost choked on the word

Maester Aemon spoke up then My lord Donal Noye and I discussed these issues when Jon Snow first returned to us and were satisfied by Jon’s explanations

Well I am not satisfied Maester said the jowly man I will hear these explanations for myself Yes I will

Jon swallowed his anger I abandoned no one I left the Fist with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Skirling Pass I joined the wildlings under orders The Halfhand feared that Mance might have found the Horn of Winter…

The Horn of Winter Ser Alliser chuckled Were you commanded to count their snarks as well Lord Snow

No but I counted their giants as best I could

Ser snapped the jowly man You will address Ser Alliser as ser and myself as m’lord I am Janos Slynt Lord of Harrenhal and commander here at Castle Black until such time as Bowen Marsh returns with his garrison You will grant us our courtesies yes I will not suffer to hear an anointed knight like the good Ser Alliser mocked by a traitor’s bastard He raised a hand and pointed a meaty finger at Jon’s face Do you deny that you took a wildling woman into your bed

No Jon’s grief over Ygritte was too fresh for him to deny her now No my lord
