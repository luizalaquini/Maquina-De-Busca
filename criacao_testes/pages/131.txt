And this one Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha

Robb walked over to her She was a head taller than he was but she dropped to her knees at his approach Give me my life m’lord of Stark and I am yours

Mine What would I do with an oathbreaker

I broke no oaths Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall not me The black crows got no place for women

Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer Give her to the wolves he urged Robb The woman’s eyes went to what was left of Hali and just as quickly away She shuddered Even the guardsmen looked queasy

She’s a woman Robb said

A wildling Bran told him She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder

Do you have a name Robb asked her

Osha as it please the lord she muttered sourly

Maester Luwin stood We might do well to question her

Bran could see the relief on his brother’s face As you say Maester Wayn bind her hands She’ll come back to Winterfell with us… and live or die by the truths she gives us





TYRION

You want eat Mord asked glowering He had a plate of oiled beans in one thick stub-fingered hand

Tyrion Lannister was starved but he refused to let this brute see him cringe A leg of lamb would be pleasant he said from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell Perhaps a dish of peas and onions some fresh baked bread with butter and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down Or beer if that’s easier I try not to be overly particular

Is beans Mord said Here He held out the plate

Tyrion sighed The turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity with brown rotting teeth and small dark eyes The left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek He was as predictable as he was ugly but Tyrion was hungry He reached up for the plate

Mord jerked it away grinning Is here he said holding it out beyond Tyrion’s reach

The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet every joint aching Must we play the same fool’s game with every meal He made another grab for the beans

Mord shambled backward grinning through his rotten teeth Is here dwarf man He held the plate out at arm’s length over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began You not want eat Here Come take

Tyrion’s arms were too short to reach the plate and he was not about to step that close to the edge All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord’s heavy white belly and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries Come to think on it I’m not hungry after all he declared retreating to the corner of his cell

Mord grunted and opened his thick fingers The wind took the plate flipping it over as it fell A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight The turnkey laughed his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding

Tyrion felt a pang of rage You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass he spat I hope you die of a bloody flux

For that Mord gave him a kick driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion’s ribs on the way out I take it back he gasped as he doubled over on the straw I’ll kill you myself I swear it The heavy iron-bound door slammed shut Tyrion heard the rattle of keys

For a small man he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth he reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he’d won from Marillion at dice after the singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief The skin had smelled of blood and mold but it was warm and thick Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it

The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons His cell was miserably small even for a dwarf Not five feet away where a wall ought to have been where a wall would be in a proper dungeon the floor ended and the sky began He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine and the moon and stars by night but Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock
