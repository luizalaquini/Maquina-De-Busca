of all dismal sounds the hark of a fox its three hollow
notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the
precision of a funeral bell
Less than a mile the woman murmured No
more she added after a pause The mile is to the
county hall and my resting-place is on the other side
Casterbridge A little over a mile and there I am 
After an interval she again spoke Five or six steps to
a yard -- six perhaps I have to go seventeen hundred
yards A hundred times six six hundred Seventeen
times that O pity me Lord
Holding to the rails she advanced thrusting one
hand forward upon the rail then the other then leaning
over it whilst she dragged her feet on beneath
This woman was not given to soliloquy but ex
tremity of feeling lessens the individuality of the weak
as it increases

that of the strong She said again in the
same tone Ill believe that the end lies five posts for+
ward and no further and so get strength to pass them
This was a practical application of the principle that
a half-feigned and fictitious faith is better than no faith
at all
She passed five posts and held on to the fifth
Ill pass five more by believing my longed-for spot
is at the next fifth I can do it
she passed five more
It lies only five further
she passed five more
But it is five further
She passed them
That stone bridge is the end of my journey she
said when the bridge over the Froom was in view
She crawled to the bridge During the effort each
breath of the woman went into the air as if never to
return again
Now for the truth of the matter she said sitting
down The truth is that I have less than half a mile
Self-beguilement with what she had known all the time
to be false had given her strength to come over half
a mile that she would have been powerless to face in
the lump The artifice showed that the woman by
some mysterious intuition had grasped the paradoxical
truth that blindness may operate more vigorously than
prescience and the short-sighted effect more than the
far-seeing  that limitation and not comprehensiveness
is needed for striking a blow
The half-mile stood now before the sick and weary
woman like a stolid Juggernaut It was an impassive
King of her world The road here ran across Durnover
Moor open to the road on either side She surveyed
the wide space the lights herself sighed and lay down
against a guard-stone of the bridge
Never was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the
traveller here exercised hers Every conceivable aid
mthod stratagem mechanism by which these last
desperate eight hundred yards could be overpasscd by a
human being unperceived was revolved in her busy
brain and dismissed as impracticable She thought of
P 326
sticks wheels crawling -- she even thought of rolling
But the exertion demanded by either of these latter two
was greater than to walk erect The faculty of con+
trivance was worn out Hopelessness had come at
last
 No further she whispered and closed her eyes
From the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of
the bridge a portion of shade seemed to detach itself
and move into isolation upon the pale white of the road
It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman
She became conscious of something touching her
hand it was softness and it was warmth She
opened her eyes and the substance touched her face
A dog was licking her cheek
He was huge heavy and quiet creature standing
darkly against the low horizon and at least two feet
higher than the present position of her eyes Whether
Newfoundland mastiff bloodhound or what not it was
impossible to say He seemed to be of too strange and
mysterious a nature to belong to any variety among those
of popular nomenclature Being thus assignable to no
breed he was the ideal embodiment of canine greatness
 -- a generalization from what was common to all Night
in its sad solemn and benevolent aspect apart from its
stealthy and cruel side was personified in this form
Darkness endows the small and ordinary ones among
mankind with poetical power and even the suffering
woman threw her idea nto figure
In her reclining position she looked up to him just
as in earlier times she had when standing looked up
to a man The animal who was as homeless as she
respectfully withdrew a step or two when the woman
moved and seeing that she did not repulse him he
licked her hand again
A thought moved within her like lightning Perhaps
I can make use of him-i might do it then
She pointed in the direction of Casterbridge and
the dog seemed to misunderstand  he trotted on Then
finding she could not follow he came back and whined
