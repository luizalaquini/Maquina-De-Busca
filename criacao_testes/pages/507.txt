She’d thought she was going to die then but the fingers had twitched all five at once and the man had shrieked loud as a horse When his hand fell away another hand stronger shoved her back into her saddle The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground blood pumping out the stump of his arm but there were others all around some with clubs in hand The Hound leapt at them his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung When they broke and ran before him he had laughed his terrible burned face for a moment transformed

She made herself look at that face now really look It was only courteous and a lady must never forget her courtesies The scars are not the worst part nor even the way his mouth twitches It’s his eyes She had never seen eyes so full of anger I… I should have come to you after she said haltingly To thank you for… for saving me… you were so brave

Brave His laugh was half a snarl A dog doesn’t need courage to chase off rats They had me thirty to one and not a man of them dared face me

She hated the way he talked always so harsh and angry Does it give you joy to scare people

No it gives me joy to kill people His mouth twitched Wrinkle up your face all you like but spare me this false piety You were a high lord’s get Don’t tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man

That was his duty He never liked it

Is that what he told you Clegane laughed again Your father lied Killing is the sweetest thing there is He drew his longsword Here’s your truth Your precious father found that out on Baelor’s steps Lord of Winterfell Hand of the King Warden of the North the mighty Eddard Stark of a line eight thousand years old… but Ilyn Payne’s blade went through his neck all the same didn’t it Do you remember the dance he did when his head came off his shoulders

Sansa hugged herself suddenly cold Why are you always so hateful I was thanking you…

Just as if I was one of those true knights you love so well yes What do you think a knight is for girl You think it’s all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate Knights are for killing He laid the edge of his longsword against her neck just under her ear Sansa could feel the sharpness of the steel I killed my first man at twelve I’ve lost count of how many I’ve killed since then High lords with old names fat rich men dressed in velvet knights puffed up like bladders with their honors yes and women and children too—they’re all meat and I’m the butcher Let them have their lands and their gods and their gold Let them have their sers Sandor Clegane spat at her feet to show what he thought of that So long as I have this he said lifting the sword from her throat there’s no man on earth I need fear

Except your brother Sansa thought but she had better sense than to say it aloud He is a dog just as he says A half-wild mean-tempered dog that bites any hand that tries to pet him and yet will savage any man who tries to hurt his masters Not even the men across the river

Clegane’s eyes turned toward the distant fires All this burning He sheathed his sword Only cowards fight with fire

Lord Stannis is no coward

He’s not the man his brother was either Robert never let a little thing like a river stop him

What will you do when he crosses

Fight Kill Die maybe

Aren’t you afraid The gods might send you down to some terrible hell for all the evil you’ve done

What evil He laughed What gods

The gods who made us all

All he mocked Tell me little bird what kind of god makes a monster like the Imp or a halfwit like Lady Tanda’s daughter If there are gods they made sheep so wolves could eat mutton and they made the weak for the strong to play with

True knights protect the weak

He snorted There are no true knights no more than there are gods If you can’t protect yourself die and get out of the way of those who can Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world don’t ever believe any different

Sansa backed away from him You’re awful

I’m honest It’s the world that’s awful Now fly away little bird I’m sick of you peeping at me

Wordless she fled She was afraid of Sandor Clegane… and yet some part of her wished that Ser Dontos had a little of the Hound’s ferocity There are gods she told herself and there are true knights too All the stories can’t be lies

That night Sansa dreamed of the riot again The mob surged around her shrieking a maddened beast with a thousand faces Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks She wept and told them she had never done them hurt yet they dragged her from her horse all the same No she cried no please don’t don’t but no one paid her any heed She shouted for Ser Dontos for her brothers for her dead father and her dead wolf for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once but none of them came She called for the heroes from the songs for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight but no one heard Women swarmed over her like weasels pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel The knife plunged into her belly and tore and tore and tore until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons

When she woke the pale light of morning was slanting through her window yet she felt as sick and achy as if she had not slept at all There was something sticky on her thighs When she threw back the blanket and saw the blood all she could think was that her dream had somehow come true She remembered the knives inside her twisting and ripping She squirmed away in horror kicking at the sheets and falling to the floor breathing raggedly naked bloodied and afraid

But as she crouched there on her hands and knees understanding came No please Sansa whimpered please no She didn’t want this happening to her not now not here not now not now not now not now
