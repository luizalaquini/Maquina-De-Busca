Tormund’s sons Toregg and Dormund added their deep voices as well then his daughter Munda and all the rest Others began to bang their spears on leathern shields to keep rough time until the whole war band was singing as they rode





In stone halls they burn their great fires

in stone halls they forge their sharp spears

Whilst I walk alone in the mountains

with no true companion but tears

They hunt me with dogs in the daylight

they hunt me with torches by night

For these men who are small can never stand tall

whilst giants still walk in the light

Oooooooh I am the LAST of the giants

so learn well the words of my song

For when I am gone the singing will fade

and the silence shall last long and long





There were tears on Ygritte’s cheeks when the song ended

Why are you weeping Jon asked It was only a song There are hundreds of giants I’ve just seen them

Oh hundreds she said furiously You know nothing Jon Snow You—JON

Jon turned at the sudden sound of wings Blue-grey feathers filled his eyes as sharp talons buried themselves in his face Red pain lanced through him sudden and fierce as pinions beat round his head He saw the beak but there was no time to get a hand up or reach for a weapon Jon reeled backward his foot lost the stirrup his garron broke in panic and then he was falling And still the eagle clung to his face its talons tearing at him as it flapped and shrieked and pecked The world turned upside down in a chaos of feathers and horseflesh and blood and then the ground came up to smash him

The next he knew he was on his face with the taste of mud and blood in his mouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively a bone dagger in her hand He could still hear wings though the eagle was not in sight Half his world was black My eye he said in sudden panic raising a hand to his face

It’s only blood Jon Snow He missed the eye just ripped your skin up some

His face was throbbing Tormund stood over them bellowing he saw from his right eye as he rubbed blood from his left Then there were hoofbeats shouts and the clacking of old dry bones

Bag o’ Bones roared Tormund call off your hellcrow

There’s your hellcrow Rattleshirt pointed at Jon Bleeding in the mud like a faithless dog The eagle came flapping down to land atop the broken giant’s skull that served him for his helm I’m here for him

Come take him then said Tormund but best come with sword in hand for that’s where you’ll find mine Might be I’ll boil your bones and use your skull to piss in Har
