THE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS
THE hill opposite Bathshebas dwelling extended a
mile off into an uncultivated tract of land dotted at
this season with tall thickets of brake fern plump and
diaphanous from recent rapid growth and radiant in
hues of clear and untainted green
At eight oclock this midsummer evening whilst the
bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of
the ferns with its long luxuriant rays a soft brushing+
by of garments might have been heard among them
and Bathsheba appeared in their midst their soft
feathery arms caressing her up to her shoulders She
paused turned went back over the hill and half-way
to her own door whence she cast a farewell glance upon
the spot she had just left having resolved not to remain
near the place after all
She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round
the shoulder of the rise It disappeared on the other
side
She waited one minute -- two minutes -- thought of
Troys disappointment at her non-fulfilment of a promised
engagement till she again ran along the field clambered
over the bank and followed the original direction She
was now literally trembling and panting at this her
temerity in such an errant undertaking her breath
came and went quickly and her eyes shone with an in+
frequent light Yet go she must She reached the
verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns Troy stood
in the bottom looking up towards her
I heard you rustling through the fern before I saw
you he said coming up and giving her his hand to help
her down the slope
The pit was a saucer-shaped concave naturally
formed with a top diameter of about thirty feet and
shallow enough to allow the sunshine to reach their
heads Standing in the
P 238
centre the sky overhead was
met by a circular horizon of fern  this grew nearly to
the bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased The
middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a
thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled so
yielding that the foot was half-buried within it
Now said Troy producing the sword which as he
raised it into the sunlight gleamed a sort of greeting
like a living thing first we have four right and four
left cuts four right and four left thrusts Infantry cuts
and guards are more interesting than ours to my mind
but they are not so swashing They have seven cuts
and three thrusts So much as a preliminary Well
next our cut one is as if you were sowing your corn --
so Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow upside down in
the air and Troys arm was still again Cut two as if
you were hedging -- so Three as if you were reaping
 -- so Four as if you were threshing -- in that way
Then the same on the left The thrusts are these  one
two three four right  one two three four left He
repeated them Have em again  he said One
two --  -- 
She hurriedly interrupted  Id rather not though
I dont mind your twos and fours but your ones and
threes are terrible 
Very well Ill let you off the ones and threes
Next cuts points and guards altogether Troy duly
exhibited them Then theres pursuing practice in
this way He gave the movements as before There
those are the stereotyped forms The infantry have
two most diabolical upward cuts which we are too
humane to use Like this -- three four
How murderous and bloodthirsty 
They are rather deathy Now Ill be more inter+
esting and let you see some loose play -- giving all the
cuts and points infantry and cavalry quicker than
lightning and as promiscuously -- with just enough rule
to regulate instinct and yet not to fetter it You are
my antagonist with this difference from real warfare
that I shall miss you every time by one hairs breadth
or perhaps two Mind you dont flinch whatever you
do
P 239
Ill be sure not to she said invincibly
He pointed to about a yard in front of him
Bathshebas adventurous spirit was beginning to find
some grains of relish in these highly novel proceedings
She took up her position as directed facing Troy
Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough
to let me do what I wish Ill give you a preliminary
test
He flourished the sword by way of introduction
number two and the next thing of which she was
conscious was that the point and blade of the sword
were darting with a gleam towards her left side just
above her hip then of their reappearance on her right
side emerging as it were from between her ribs having
apparently passed through her body The third item
of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword
perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in
Troys hand in the position technically called recover
swords All was as quick as electricity
