Tyrion shrugged It may be Stannis burned the godswood at Storm’s End as an offering to the Lord of Light If he’d offend the old gods why should he spare the new Tell them that Tell them that any man who thinks to give aid to the usurper betrays the gods as well as his rightful king

I shall my lord And I shall command them to pray for the health of the king and his Hand as well

Hallyne the Pyromancer was waiting on him when Tyrion returned to his solar and Maester Frenken had brought messages He let the alchemist wait a little longer while he read what the ravens had brought him There was an old letter from Doran Martell warning him that Storm’s End had fallen and a much more intriguing one from Balon Greyjoy on Pyke who styled himself King of the Isles and the North He invited King Joffrey to send an envoy to the Iron Islands to fix the borders between their realms and discuss a possible alliance

Tyrion read the letter three times and set it aside Lord Balon’s longships would have been a great help against the fleet sailing up from Storm’s End but they were thousands of leagues away on the wrong side of Westeros and Tyrion was far from certain that he wanted to give away half the realm Perhaps I should spill this one in Cersei’s lap or take it to the council

Only then did he admit Hallyne with the latest tallies from the alchemists This cannot be true said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers Almost thirteen thousand jars Do you take me for a fool I’m not about to pay the king’s gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed with wax I warn you

No no Hallyne squeaked the sums are accurate I swear We have been hmmm most fortunate my lord Hand Another cache of Lord Rossart’s was found more than three hundred jars Under the Dragonpit Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their patrons and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a cellar When he felt the jars he mistook them for wine He was so drunk he broke the seal and drank some

There was a prince who tried that once said Tyrion dryly I haven’t seen any dragons rising over the city so it would seem it didn’t work this time either The Dragonpit atop the hill of Rhaenys had been abandoned for a century and a half He supposed it was as good a place as any to store wildfire and better than most but it would have been nice if the late Lord Rossart had told someone Three hundred jars you say That still does not account for these totals You are several thousand jars ahead of the best estimate you gave me when last we met

Yes yes that’s so Hallyne mopped at his pale brow with the sleeve of his black-and-scarlet robe We have been working very hard my lord Hand hmmm

That would doubtless explain why you are making so much more of the substance than before Smiling Tyrion fixed the pyromancer with his mismatched stare Though it does raise the question of why you did not begin working hard until now

Hallyne had the complexion of a mushroom so it was hard to see how he could turn any paler yet somehow he managed We were my lord Hand my brothers and I have been laboring day and night from the first I assure you It is only hmmm we have made so much of the substance that we have become hmmm more practiced as it were and also—the alchemist shifted uncomfortably—certain spells hmmm ancient secrets of our order very delicate very troublesome but necessary if the substance is to be hmmm all it should be…

Tyrion was growing impatient Ser Jacelyn Bywater was likely here by now and Ironhand misliked waiting Yes you have secret spells how splendid What of them

They hmmm seem to be working better than they were Hallyne smiled weakly You don’t suppose there are any dragons about do you

Not unless you found one under the Dragonpit Why

Oh pardon I was just remembering something old Wisdom Pollitor told me once when I was an acolyte I’d asked him why so many of our spells seemed well not as effectual as the scrolls would have us believe and he said it was because magic had begun to go out of the world the day the last dragon died

Sorry to disappoint you but I’ve seen no dragons I have noticed the King’s Justice lurking about however Should any of these fruits you’re selling me turn out to be filled with anything but wildfire you’ll be seeing him as well

Hallyne fled so quickly that he almost bowled over Ser Jacelyn—no Lord Jacelyn he must remember that Ironhand was mercifully direct as ever He’d returned from Rosby to deliver a fresh levy of spearmen recruited from Lord Gyles’s estates and resume his command of the City Watch How does my nephew fare Tyrion asked when they were done discussing the city’s defenses

Prince Tommen is hale and happy my lord He has adopted a fawn some of my men brought home from a hunt He had one once before he says but Joffrey skinned her for a jerkin He asks about his mother sometimes and often begins letters to the Princess Myrcella though he never seems to finish any His brother however he does not seem to miss at all

You have made suitable arrangements for him should the battle be lost

My men have their instructions

Which are

You commanded me to tell no one my lord

That made him smile I’m pleased you remember Should King’s Landing fall he might well be taken alive Better if he did not know where Joffrey’s heir might be found

Varys appeared not long after Lord Jacelyn had left Men are such faithless creatures he said by way of greeting

Tyrion sighed Who’s the traitor today

The eunuch handed him a scroll So much villainy it sings a sad song for our age Did honor die with our fathers

My father is not dead yet Tyrion scanned the list I know some of these names These are rich men Traders merchants craftsmen Why should they conspire against us

It seems they believe that Lord Stannis must win and wish to share his victory They call themselves the Antler Men after the crowned stag
