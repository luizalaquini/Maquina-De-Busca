Yes Your Grace the child said A different dialect than Astapor’s yet close enough to understand The slavers name themselves the Wise Masters

Wise Dany sat crosslegged on a cushion and Viserion spread his white-and-gold wings and flapped to her side We shall see how wise they are she said as she scratched the dragon’s scaly head behind the horns

Ser Jorah Mormont returned an hour later accompanied by three captains of the Stormcrows They wore black feathers on their polished helms and claimed to be all equal in honor and authority Dany studied them as Irri and Jhiqui poured the wine Prendahl na Ghezn was a thickset Ghiscari with a broad face and dark hair going grey Sallor the Bald had a twisting scar across his pale Qartheen cheek and Daario Naharis was flamboyant even for a Tyroshi His beard was cut into three prongs and dyed blue the same color as his eyes and the curly hair that fell to his collar His pointed mustachios were painted gold His clothes were all shades of yellow a foam of Myrish lace the color of butter spilled from his collar and cuffs his doublet was sewn with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions and ornamental goldwork crawled up his high leather boots to his thighs Gloves of soft yellow suede were tucked into a belt of gilded rings and his fingernails were enameled blue

But it was Prendahl na Ghezn who spoke for the sellswords You would do well to take your rabble elsewhere he said You took Astapor by treachery but Yunkai shall not fall so easily

Five hundred of your Stormcrows against ten thousand of my Unsullied said Dany I am only a young girl and do not understand the ways of war yet these odds seem poor to me

The Stormcrows do not stand alone said Prendahl

Stormcrows do not stand at all They fly at the first sign of thunder Perhaps you should be flying now I have heard that sellswords are notoriously unfaithful What will it avail you to be staunch when the Second Sons change sides

That will not happen Prendahl insisted unmoved And if it did it would not matter The Second Sons are nothing We fight beside the stalwart men of Yunkai

You fight beside bed-boys armed with spears When she turned her head the twin bells in her braid rang softly Once battle is joined do not think to ask for quarter Join me now however and you shall keep the gold the Yunkai’i paid you and claim a share of the plunder besides with greater rewards later when I come into my kingdom Fight for the Wise Masters and your wages will be death Do you imagine that Yunkai will open its gates when my Unsullied are butchering you beneath the walls

Woman you bray like an ass and make no more sense

Woman She chuckled Is that meant to insult me I would return the slap if I took you for a man Dany met his stare I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen the Unburnt Mother of Dragons khaleesi to Drogo’s riders and queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros

What you are said Prendahl na Ghezn is a horselord’s whore When we break you I will breed you to my stallion

Strong Belwas drew his arakh Strong Belwas will give his ugly tongue to the little queen if she likes

No Belwas I have given these men my safe conduct She smiled Tell me this—are the Stormcrows slave or free

We are a brotherhood of free men Sallor declared

Good Dany stood Go back and tell your brothers what I said then It may be that some of them would sooner sup on gold and glory than on death I shall want your answer on the morrow

The Stormcrow captains rose in unison Our answer is no said Prendahl na Ghezn His fellows followed him out of the tent    but Daario Naharis glanced back as he left and inclined his head in polite farewell

Two hours later the commander of the Second Sons arrived alone He proved to be a towering Braavosi with pale green eyes and a bushy red-gold beard that reached nearly to his belt His name was Mero but he called himself the Titan’s Bastard

Mero tossed down his wine straightaway wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and leered at Dany I believe I fucked your twin sister in a pleasure house back home Or was it you

I think not I would remember a man of such magnificence I have no doubt

Yes that is so No woman has ever forgotten the Titan’s Bastard The Braavosi held out his cup to Jhiqui What say you take those clothes off and come sit on my lap If you please me I might bring the Second Sons over to your side

If you bring the Second Sons over to my side I might not have you gelded

The big man laughed Little girl another woman once tried to geld me with her teeth She has no teeth now but my sword is as long and thick as ever Shall I take it out and show you

No need After my eunuchs cut it off I can examine it at my leisure Dany took a sip of wine It is true that I am only a young girl and do not know the ways of war Explain to me how you propose to defeat ten thousand Unsullied with your five hundred Innocent as I am these odds seem poor to me

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won

The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run At Qohor when the Three Thousand made their stand Or do you deny it

That was many and more years ago before the Second Sons were led by the Titan’s Bastard

So it is from you they get their courage Dany turned to Ser Jorah When the battle is joined kill this one first

The exile knight smiled Gladly Your Grace

Of course she said to Mero you could run again We will not stop you Take your Yunkish gold and go

Had you ever seen the Titan of Braavos foolish girl you would know that it has no tail to turn

Then stay and fight for me

You are worth fighting for it is true the Braavosi said and I would gladly let you kiss my sword if I were free But I have taken Yunkai’s coin and pledged my holy word

Coins can be returned she said I will pay you as much and more I have other cities to conquer and a whole kingdom awaiting me half a world away Serve me faithfully and the Second Sons need never seek hire again

The Braavosi tugged on his thick red beard As much and more and perhaps a kiss besides eh Or more than a kiss For a man as magnificent as me

Perhaps

I will like the taste of your tongue I think

She could sense Ser Jorah’s anger My black bear does not like this talk of kissing Think on what I’ve said tonight Can I have your answer on the morrow

You can The Titan’s Bastard grinned Can I have a flagon of this fine wine to take back to my captains

You may have a tun It is from the cellars of the Good Masters of Astapor and I have wagons full of it

Then give me a wagon A token of your good regard

You have a big thirst

I am big all over And I have many brothers The Titan’s Bastard does not drink alone Khaleesi

A wagon it is if you promise to drink to my health

Done he boomed And done and done Three toasts we’ll drink you and bring you an answer when the sun comes up

But when Mero was gone Arstan Whitebeard said That one has an evil reputation even in Westeros Do not be misled by his manner Your Grace He will drink three toasts to your health tonight and rape you on the morrow

The old man’s right for once Ser Jorah said The Second Sons are an old company and not without valor but under Mero they’ve turned near as bad as the Brave Companions The man is as dangerous to his employers as to his foes That’s why you find him out here None of the Free Cities will hire him any longer

It is not his reputation that I want it’s his five hundred horse What of the Stormcrows is there any hope there

No Ser Jorah said bluntly That Prendahl is Ghiscari by blood Likely he had kin in Astapor

A pity Well perhaps we will not need to fight Let us wait and hear what the Yunkai’i have to say
