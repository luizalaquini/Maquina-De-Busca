The crow opened its beak and cawed at him a shrill scream of fear and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil and he saw that the crow was really a woman a serving woman with long black hair and he knew her from somewhere from Winterfell yes that was it he remembered her now and then he realized that he was in Winterfell in a bed high in some chilly tower room and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps shouting He’s awake he’s awake he’s awake

Bran touched his forehead between his eyes The place where the crow had pecked him was still burning but there was nothing there no blood no wound He felt weak and dizzy He tried to get out of bed but nothing happened

And then there was movement beside the bed and something landed lightly on his legs He felt nothing A pair of yellow eyes looked into his own shining like the sun The window was open and it was cold in the room but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath His pup Bran realized… or was it He was so big now He reached out to pet him his hand trembling like a leaf

When his brother Robb burst into the room breathless from his dash up the tower steps the direwolf was licking Bran’s face Bran looked up calmly His name is Summer he said





CATELYN

We will make King’s Landing within the hour

Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile Your oarmen have done well by us Captain Each one of them shall have a silver stag as a token of my gratitude

Captain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow You are far too generous Lady Stark The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need

But they’ll take the silver anyway

Moreo smiled As you say He spoke the Common Tongue fluently with only the slightest hint of a Tyroshi accent He’d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years he’d told her as oarman quartermaster and finally captain of his own trading galleys The Storm Dancer was his fourth ship and his fastest a two-masted galley of sixty oars

She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters but Catelyn had insisted on the galley It was good that she had The winds had been against them much of the voyage and without the galley’s oars they’d still be beating their way past the Fingers instead of skimming toward King’s Landing and journey’s end

So close she thought Beneath the linen bandages her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten The pain was her scourge Catelyn felt lest she forget She could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand and the others would never again be dexterous Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran’s life

Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck My good friend said Moreo through his forked green beard The Tyroshi loved bright colors even in their facial hair It is so fine to see you looking better

Yes Ser Rodrik agreed I haven’t wanted to die for almost two days now He bowed to Catelyn My lady

He was looking better A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor but almost himself again The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him and he’d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo’s men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks

The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end she said

Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile So soon He looked odd without his great white side whiskers smaller somehow less fierce and ten years older Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman’s razor after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds

I will leave you to discuss your business Captain Moreo said He bowed and took his leave of them

The galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly her oars rising and falling in perfect time Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore I have not been the most valiant of protectors

Catelyn touched his arm We are here Ser Rodrik and safely That is all that truly matters Her hand groped beneath her cloak her fingers stiff and fumbling The dagger was still at her side She found she had to touch it now and then to reassure herself Now we must reach the king’s master-at-arms and pray that he can be trusted

Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man but an honest one Ser Rodrik’s hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone He looked nonplussed He may know the blade yes… but my lady the moment we go ashore we are at risk And there are those at court who will know you on sight

Catelyn’s mouth grew tight Littlefinger she murmured His face swam up before her a boy’s face though he was a boy no longer His father had died several years before so he was Lord Baelish now yet still they called him Littlefinger Her brother Edmure had given him that name long ago at Riverrun His family’s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers and Petyr had been slight and short for his age

Ser Rodrik cleared his throat Lord Baelish once ah… His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word

Catelyn was past delicacy He was my father’s ward We grew up together in Riverrun I thought of him as a brother but his feelings for me were… more than brotherly When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark Petyr challenged for the right to my hand It was madness Brandon was twenty Petyr scarcely fifteen I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr’s life He let him off with a scar Afterward my father sent him away I have not seen him since She lifted her face to the spray as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed but I burned the letter unread By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother’s place

Ser Rodrik’s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers Littlefinger sits on the small council now

I knew he would rise high Catelyn said He was always clever even as a boy but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise I wonder what the years have done to him

High overhead the far-eyes sang out from the rigging Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck giving orders and all around them the Storm Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King’s Landing slid into view atop its three high hills

Three hundred years ago Catelyn knew those heights had been covered with forest and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep swift river flowed into the sea Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone It was here that his army had put ashore and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth

Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see manses and arbors and granaries brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant’s stalls taverns and graveyards and brothels all piled one on another She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees wandering crookback streets and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast Visenya’s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit its huge dome collapsing into ruin its bronze doors closed now for a century The Street of the Sisters ran between them straight as an arrow The city walls rose in the distance high and strong

A hundred quays lined the waterfront and the harbor was crowded with ships Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys Catelyn spied the queen’s ornate barge tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben its hull black with tar while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water

And above it all frowning down from Aegon’s high hill was the Red Keep seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts an immense grim barbican vaulted halls and covered bridges barracks and dungeons and granaries massive curtain walls studded with archers’ nests all fashioned of pale red stone Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason woodworker and builder who had labored on it Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built he vowed

Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden not black and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon

A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port its white sails huge with wind The Storm Dancer moved past it pulling steadily for shore

My lady Ser Rodrik said I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed You must not enter the castle I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place

She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities You would be as much at risk as I would

Ser Rodrik smiled I think not I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers and she is forty years dead I believe I am safe enough my lady

Moreo bellowed a command As one sixty oars lifted from the river then reversed and backed water The galley slowed Another shout The oars slid back inside the hull As they thumped against the dock Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up Moreo came bustling up all smiles King’s Landing my lady as you did command and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle

We shall not be going to the castle Perhaps you can suggest an inn someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river

The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard Just so I know of several establishments that might suit your needs Yet first if I may be so bold there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise Sixty stags I believe it was

For the oarmen Catelyn reminded him

Oh of a certainty said Moreo Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh For the sake of their wives and children If you give them the silver here my lady they will dice it away or spend it all for a night’s pleasure

There are worse things to spend money on Ser Rodrik put in Winter is coming

A man must make his own choices Catelyn said They earned the silver How they spend it is no concern of mine

As you say my lady Moreo replied bowing and smiling

Just to be sure Catelyn paid the oarmen herself a stag to each man and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya’s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real Her rooms were large and airy though and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms Best of all she had no interest in their names

I think it best if you stay away from the common room Ser Rodrik said after they had settled in Even in a place like this one never knows who may be watching He wore ringmail dagger and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head I will be back before nightfall with Ser Aron he promised Rest now my lady

Catelyn was tired The voyage had been long and fatiguing and she was no longer as young as she had been Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops with a view of the Blackwater beyond She watched Ser Rodrik set off striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds then decided to take his advice The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers but she had no trouble falling asleep

She woke to a pounding on her door
