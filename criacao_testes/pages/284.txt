The morning of King Joffrey’s name day dawned bright and windy with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds What do you think it means she asked him

Glory to your betrothed Ser Arys answered at once See how it flames across the sky today on His Grace’s name day as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey’s Comet

Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey Sansa was not so sure I’ve heard servants calling it the Dragon’s Tail

King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat in the castle built by his son Ser Arys said He is the dragon’s heir—and crimson is the color of House Lannister another sign This comet is sent to herald Joffrey’s ascent to the throne I have no doubt It means that he will triumph over his enemies

Is it true she wondered Would the gods be so cruel Her mother was one of Joffrey’s enemies now her brother Robb another Her father had died by the king’s command Must Robb and her lady mother die next The comet was red but Joffrey was Baratheon as much as Lannister and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field Shouldn’t the gods have sent Joff a golden comet

Sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window You look very lovely today my lady Ser Arys said

Thank you ser Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes She wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from Joffrey The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms Those were Joffrey’s gifts as well When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North his rage had been a fearsome thing and he had sent Ser Boros to beat her

Shall we go Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber If she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging her steps Sansa preferred that it be him Ser Boros was short-tempered Ser Meryn cold and Ser Mandon’s strange dead eyes made her uneasy while Ser Preston treated her like a lackwit child Arys Oakheart was courteous and would talk to her cordially Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded him to hit her He did hit her in the end but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have and at least he had argued The others obeyed without question… except for the Hound but Joff never asked the Hound to punish her He used the other five for that

Ser Arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon Today he made quite the dashing figure with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread Who do you think will win the day’s honors Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm

I will Ser Arys answered smiling Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor This will be a small field and poor No more than two score will enter the lists including squires and freeriders There is small honor in unhorsing green boys

The last tourney had been different Sansa reflected King Robert had staged it in her father’s honor High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete and the whole city had turned out to watch She remembered the splendor of it the field of pavilions along the river with a knight’s shield hung before each door the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves and the nights had been full of feasts and song Those had been the most magical days of her life but they seemed a memory from another age now Robert Baratheon was dead and her father as well beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor Now there were three kings in the land and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men Small wonder that they had to hold Joff’s tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep

Will the queen attend do you think Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to restrain her son

I fear not my lady The council is meeting some urgent business Ser Arys dropped his voice Lord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded Her Grace is furious He fell silent as a column of Lannister guardsmen marched past in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms Ser Arys was fond of gossip but only when he was certain that no one was listening

The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey It was a poor thing indeed and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats Most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few the handful that remained at court Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk Lady Tanda was bracketed by her daughters placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse’s lap The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen’s cousins so the Lannisters might claim her lands

The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen sat behind him In the back of the royal box Sandor Clegane stood at guard his hands resting on his swordbelt The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin Lady Sansa the Hound announced curtly when he saw her His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke

Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa’s name but plump little Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly Sansa did you hear I’m to ride in the tourney today Mother said I could Tommen was all of eight He reminded her of her own little brother Bran They were of an age Bran was back at Winterfell a cripple yet safe

Sansa would have given anything to be with him I fear for the life of your foeman she told Tommen solemnly

His foeman will be stuffed with straw Joff said as he rose The king was clad in a gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest as if he expected the war to engulf them at any moment He was thirteen today and tall for his age with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters

Your Grace she said dipping in a curtsy

Ser Arys bowed Pray pardon me Your Grace I must equip myself for the lists

Joffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied Sansa from head to heels I’m pleased you wore my stones

So the king had decided to play the gallant today Sansa was relieved I thank you for them… and for your tender words I pray you a lucky name day Your Grace

Sit Joff commanded gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own Have you heard The Beggar King is dead

Who For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb

Viserys The last son of Mad King Aerys He’s been going about the Free Cities since before I was born calling himself a king Well Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned him With molten gold He laughed That’s funny don’t you think The dragon was their sigil It’s almost as good as if some wolf killed your traitor brother Maybe I’ll feed him to wolves after I’ve caught him Did I tell you I intend to challenge him to single combat

I should like to see that Your Grace More than you know Sansa kept her tone cool and polite yet even so Joffrey’s eyes narrowed as he tried to decide whether she was mocking him Will you enter the lists today she asked quickly

The king frowned My lady mother said it was not fitting since the tourney is in my honor Otherwise I would have been champion Isn’t that so dog
