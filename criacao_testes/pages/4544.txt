And now they come said Qhorin





TYRION

Pod dressed him for his ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him his chain of office Tyrion left it on the bedside table His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King’s Hand and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further

Varys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard My lord he said a little out of breath You had best read this at once He held out a parchment in a soft white hand A report from the north

Good news or bad Tyrion asked

That is not for me to judge

Tyrion unrolled the parchment He had to squint to read the words in the torchlit yard Gods be good he said softly Both of them

I fear so my lord It is so sad So grievous sad And them so young and innocent

Tyrion remembered how the wolves had howled when the Stark boy had fallen Are they howling now I wonder Have you told anyone else he asked

Not as yet though of course I must

He rolled up the letter I’ll tell my sister He wanted to see how she took the news He wanted that very much

The queen looked especially lovely that night She wore a low-cut gown of deep green velvet that brought out the color of her eyes Her golden hair tumbled across her bare shoulders and around her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds Tyrion waited until he had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at her He said not a word Cersei blinked at him innocently and took the parchment from his hand

I trust you’re pleased he said as she read You wanted the Stark boy dead I believe

Cersei made a sour face It was Jaime who threw him from that window not me For love he said as if that would please me It was a stupid thing to do and dangerous besides but when did our sweet brother ever stop to think

The boy saw you Tyrion pointed out

He was a child I could have frightened him into silence She looked at the letter thoughtfully Why must I suffer accusations every time some Stark stubs his toe This was Greyjoy’s work I had nothing to do with it

Let us hope Lady Catelyn believes that

Her eyes widened She wouldn’t—

—kill Jaime Why not What would you do if Joffrey and Tommen were murdered

I still hold Sansa the queen declared

We still hold Sansa he corrected her and we had best take good care of her Now where is this supper you’ve promised me sweet sister

Cersei set a tasty table that could not be denied They started with a creamy chestnut soup crusty hot bread and greens dressed with apples and pine nuts Then came lamprey pie honeyed ham buttered carrots white beans and bacon and roast swan stuffed with mushrooms and oysters Tyrion was exceedingly courteous he offered his sister the choice portions of every dish and made certain he ate only what she did Not that he truly thought she’d poison him but it never hurt to be careful

The news about the Starks had soured her he could see We’ve had no word from Bitterbridge she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of her dagger and ate it with small delicate bites

None

I’ve never trusted Littlefinger For enough coin he’d go over to Stannis in a heartbeat

Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men Nor would he make a comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr This war has made for some queer bedfellows I agree but those two No

As he carved some slices off the ham she said We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig

A token of her love

A bribe She begs leave to return to her castle Your leave as well as mine I suspect she fears you’ll arrest her on the road as you did Lord Gyles

Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne Tyrion served his sister a cut of ham and took one for himself I’d sooner she remain If she wants to feel safe tell her to bring down her garrison from Stokeworth As many men as she has

If we need men so badly why did you send away your savages A certain testiness crept into Cersei’s voice

It was the best use I could have made of them he told her truthfully They’re fierce warriors but not soldiers In formal battle discipline is more important than courage They’ve already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city walls

As the swan was being served the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the Antler Men She seemed more annoyed than afraid Why are we plagued with so many treasons What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches

None said Tyrion but they think to be on the winning side    which makes them fools as well as traitors

Are you certain you’ve found them all

Varys says so The swan was too rich for his taste

A line appeared on Cersei’s pale white brow between those lovely eyes You put too much trust in that eunuch

He serves me well

Or so he’d have you believe You think you’re the only one he whispers secrets to He gives each of us just enough to convince us that we’d be helpless without him He played the same game with me when I first wed Robert For years I was convinced I had no truer friend at court but now    She studied his face for a moment He says you mean to take the Hound from Joffrey

Damn Varys I need Clegane for more important duties

Nothing is more important than the life of the king

The life of the king is not at risk Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him and Meryn Trant as well They’re good for nothing better I need Balon Swann and the Hound to lead sorties to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater

Jaime would lead the sorties himself

From Riverrun That’s quite a sortie

Joff’s only a boy

A boy who wants to be part of this battle and for once he’s showing some sense I don’t intend to put him in the thick of the fighting but he needs to be seen Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother’s skirts

He’s thirteen Tyrion

Remember Jaime at thirteen If you want the boy to be his father’s son let him play the part Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy and he’ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him at all times If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling I’ll have him escorted back to the Red Keep at once
