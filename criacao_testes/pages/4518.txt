Then hear me Ser Cortnay’s lieutenant is cousin to the Fossoways Lord Meadows a green boy of twenty Should some ill chance strike down Penrose command of Storm’s End would pass to this stripling and his cousins believe he would accept my terms and yield up the castle

I remember another stripling who was given command of Storm’s End He could not have been much more than twenty

Lord Meadows is not as stonehead stubborn as I was

Stubborn or craven what does it matter Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to me

So did my brother the day before his death The night is dark and full of terrors Davos

Davos Seaworth felt the small hairs rising on the back of his neck My lord I do not understand you

I do not require your understanding Only your service Ser Cortnay will be dead within the day Melisandre has seen it in the flames of the future His death and the manner of it He will not die in knightly combat needless to say Stannis held out his cup and Devan filled it again from the flagon Her flames do not lie She saw Renly’s doom as well On Dragonstone she saw it and told Selyse Lord Velaryon and your friend Salladhor Saan would have had me sail against Joffrey but Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm’s End I would win the best part of my brother’s power and she was right

B-but Davos stammered Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to the castle He was marching toward King’s Landing before against the Lannisters he would have—

Stannis shifted in his seat frowning Was would have what is that He did what he did He came here with his banners and his peaches to his doom    and it was well for me he did Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King’s Landing Had I met my brother there it might have been me who died in place of him

Or you might have joined your strength to his to bring down the Lannisters Davos protested Why not that If she saw two futures well    both cannot be true

King Stannis pointed a finger There you err Onion Knight Some lights cast more than one shadow Stand before the nightfire and you’ll see for yourself The flames shift and dance never still The shadows grow tall and short and every man casts a dozen Some are fainter than others that’s all Well men cast their shadows across the future as well One shadow or many Melisandre sees them all

You do not love the woman I know that Davos I am not blind My lords mislike her too Estermont thinks the flaming heart ill-chosen and begs to fight beneath the crowned stag as of old Ser Guyard says a woman should not be my standard-bearer Others whisper that she has no place in my war councils that I ought to send her back to Asshai that it is sinful to keep her in my tent of a night Aye they whisper    while she serves

Serves how Davos asked dreading the answer

As needed The king looked at him And you

I    Davos licked his lips I am yours to command What would you have me do

Nothing you have not done before Only land a boat beneath the castle unseen in the black of night Can you do that

Yes Tonight

The king gave a curt nod You will need a small boat Not Black Betha No one must know what you do

Davos wanted to protest He was a knight now no longer a smuggler and he had never been an assassin Yet when he opened his mouth the words would not come This was Stannis his just lord to whom he owed all he was And he had his sons to consider as well Gods be good what has she done to him

You are quiet Stannis observed

And should remain so Davos told himself yet instead he said My liege you must have the castle I see that now but surely there are other ways Cleaner ways Let Ser Cortnay keep the bastard boy and he may well yield

I must have the boy Davos Must Melisandre has seen that in the flames as well

Davos groped for some other answer Storm’s End holds no knight who can match Ser Guyard or Lord Caron or any of a hundred others sworn to your service This single combat    could it be that Ser Cortnay seeks for a way to yield with honor Even if it means his own life

A troubled look crossed the king’s face like a passing cloud More like he plans some treachery There will be no combat of champions Ser Cortnay was dead before he ever threw that glove The flames do not lie Davos

Yet they require me to make them true he thought It had been a long time since Davos Seaworth felt so sad

And so it was that he found himself once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of night steering a tiny boat with a black sail The sky was the same and the sea The same salt smell was in the air and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered it A thousand flickering campfires burned around the castle as the fires of the Tyrells and Redwynes had sixteen years before But all the rest was different

The last time it was life I brought to Storm’s End shaped to look like onions This time it is death in the shape of Melisandre of Asshai Sixteen years ago the sails had cracked and snapped with every shift of wind until he’d pulled them down and gone on with muffled oars Even so his heart had been in his gullet The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax after so long however and they had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin This time the only ships in sight belonged to Stannis and the only danger would come from watchers on the castle walls Even so Davos was taut as a bowstring

Melisandre huddled upon a thwart lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered her from head to heels her face a paleness beneath the cowl Davos loved the water He slept best when he had a deck rocking beneath him and the sighing of the wind in his rigging was a sweeter sound to him than any a singer could make with his harp strings Even the sea brought him no comfort tonight though I can smell the fear on you ser knight the red woman said softly

Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors And tonight I am no knight Tonight I am Davos the smuggler again Would that you were an onion

She laughed Is it me you fear Or what we do

What you do I’ll have no part of it

Your hand raised the sail Your hand holds the tiller

Silent Davos tended to his course The shore was a snarl of rocks so he was taking them well out across the bay He would wait for the tide to turn before coming about Storm’s End dwindled behind them but the red woman seemed unconcerned Are you a good man Davos Seaworth she asked

Would a good man be doing this I am a man he said I am kind to my wife but I have known other women I have tried to be a father to my sons to help make them a place in this world Aye I’ve broken laws but I never felt evil until tonight I would say my parts are mixed m’lady Good and bad

A grey man she said Neither white nor black but partaking of both Is that what you are Ser Davos

What if I am It seems to me that most men are grey

If half of an onion is black with rot it is a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil

The fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky and the land was almost out of sight It was time to come about Watch your head my lady He pushed on the tiller and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned Melisandre leaned under the swinging yard one hand on the gunwale calm as ever Wood creaked canvas cracked and water splashed so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear Davos knew better The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm’s End and that but faintly

A rippling wake spread out behind as they swung back toward the shore You speak of men and onions Davos said to Melisandre What of women Is it not the same for them Are you good or evil my lady

That made her chuckle Oh good I am a knight of sorts myself sweet ser A champion of light and life

Yet you mean to kill a man tonight he said As you killed Maester Cressen

Your maester poisoned himself He meant to poison me but I was protected by a greater power and he was not

And Renly Baratheon Who was it who killed him

Her head turned Beneath the shadow of the cowl her eyes burned like pale red candle flames Not I

Liar Davos was certain now

Melisandre laughed again You are lost in darkness and confusion Ser Davos

And a good thing Davos gestured at the distant lights flickering along the walls of Storm’s End Feel how cold the wind is The guards will huddle close to those torches A little warmth a little light they’re a comfort on a night like this Yet that will blind them so they will not see us pass I hope The god of darkness protects us now my lady Even you

The flames of her eyes seemed to burn a little brighter at that Speak not that name ser Lest you draw his black eye upon us He protects no man I promise you He is the enemy of all that lives It is the torches that hide us you have said so yourself Fire The bright gift of the Lord of Light

Have it your way

His way rather
