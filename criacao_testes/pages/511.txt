10430 Thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou
renewest the face of the earth

10431 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever the LORD shall
rejoice in his works

10432 He looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the
hills and they smoke

10433 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live I will sing praise
to my God while I have my being

10434 My meditation of him shall be sweet I will be glad in the
LORD

10435 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the
wicked be no more Bless thou the LORD O my soul Praise ye the LORD



1051 O give thanks unto the LORD call upon his name make known his
deeds among the people

1052 Sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
works

1053 Glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the LORD

1054 Seek the LORD and his strength seek his face evermore

1055 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth

1056 O ye seed of Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob his
chosen

1057 He is the LORD our God his judgments are in all the earth

1058 He hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations

1059 Which covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac

10510 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for
an everlasting covenant

10511 Saying Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of
your inheritance

10512 When they were but a few men in number yea very few and
strangers in it

10513 When they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to
another people

10514 He suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for
their sakes

10515 Saying Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm

10516 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the
whole staff of bread

10517 He sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a
servant

10518 Whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron

10519 Until the time that his word came the word of the LORD tried
him

10520 The king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and
let him go free

10521 He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance

10522 To bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators
wisdom

10523 Israel also came into Egypt and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Ham

10524 And he increased his people greatly and made them stronger
than their enemies

10525 He turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with
his servants

10526 He sent Moses his servant and Aaron whom he had chosen

10527 They shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of
Ham

10528 He sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not
against his word

10529 He turned their waters into blood and slew their fish

10530 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of
