In the black hour before dawn they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay We are not far from the place the wildlings died said Qhorin From there one man could hold a hundred The right man He looked at Squire Dalbridge

The squire bowed his head Leave me as many arrows as you can spare brothers He stroked his longbow And see my garron has an apple when you’re home He’s earned it poor beastie

He’s staying to die Jon realized

Qhorin clasped the squire’s forearm with a gloved hand If the eagle flies down for a look at you…

…he’ll sprout some new feathers

The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was his back as he clambered up the narrow path to the heights

When dawn broke Jon looked up into a cloudless sky and saw a speck moving through the blue Ebben saw it too and cursed but Qhorin told him to be quiet Listen

Jon held his breath and heard it Far away and behind them the call of a hunting horn echoed against the mountains

And now they come said Qhorin





TYRION

Pod dressed him for his ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him his chain of office Tyrion left it on the bedside table His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King’s Hand and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further

Varys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard My lord he said a little out of breath You had best read this at once He held out a parchment in a soft white hand A report from the north

Good news or bad Tyrion asked

That is not for me to judge

Tyrion unrolled the parchment He had to squint to read the words in the torchlit yard Gods be good he said softly Both of them

I fear so my lord It is so sad So grievous sad And them so young and innocent

Tyrion remembered how the wolves had howled when the Stark boy had fallen Are they howling now I wonder Have you told anyone else he asked

Not as yet though of course I must

He rolled up the letter I’ll tell my sister He wanted to see how she took the news He wanted that very much

The queen looked especially lovely that night She wore a low-cut gown of deep green velvet that brought out the color of her eyes Her golden hair tumbled across her bare shoulders and around her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds Tyrion waited until he had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at her He said not a word Cersei blinked at him innocently and took the parchment from his hand

I trust you’re pleased he said as she read You wanted the Stark boy dead I believe

Cersei made a sour face It was Jaime who threw him from that window not me For love he said as if that would please me It was a stupid thing to do and dangerous besides but when did our sweet brother ever stop to think

The boy saw you Tyrion pointed out

He was a child I could have frightened him into silence She looked at the letter thoughtfully Why must I suffer accusations every time some Stark stubs his toe This was Greyjoy’s work I had nothing to do with it

Let us hope Lady Catelyn believes that
