As the Hand commands Symon said

The last time Tyrion had seen the man a sharp word had been enough to set him sweating but it seemed the singer had found some courage somewhere Most like in that flagon Or perhaps Tyrion himself was to blame for this new boldness I threatened him but nothing ever came of the threat so now he believes me toothless He sighed I am told you are a very gifted singer

You are most kind to say so my lord

Tyrion gave him a smile I think it is time you brought your music to the Free Cities They are great lovers of song in Braavos and Pentos and Lys and generous with those who please them He took a sip of wine It was foul stuff but strong A tour of all nine cities would be best You wouldn’t want to deny anyone the joy of hearing you sing A year in each should suffice He reached inside his cloak to where the gold was hidden With the port closed you will need to go to Duskendale to take ship but my man Bronn will find a horse for you and I would be honored if you would let me pay your passage…

But my lord the man objected you have never heard me sing Pray listen a moment His fingers moved deftly over the strings of the woodharp and soft music filled the cellar Symon began to sing





He rode through the streets of the city

down from his hill on high

O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles

he rode to a woman’s sigh

For she was his secret treasure

she was his shame and his bliss

And a chain and a keep are nothing

compared to a woman’s kiss





There’s more the man said as he broke off Oh a good deal more The refrain is especially nice I think For hands of gold are always cold but a woman’s hands are warm…

Enough Tyrion slid his fingers from his cloak empty That’s not a song I would care to hear again Ever

No Symon Silver Tongue put his harp aside and took a sip of wine A pity Still each man has his song as my old master used to say when he was teaching me to play Others might like my tune better The queen perhaps Or your lord father

Tyrion rubbed the scar over his nose and said My father has no time for singers and my sister is not as generous as one might think A wise man could earn more from silence than from song He could not put it much plainer than that

Symon seemed to take his meaning quick enough You will find my price modest my lord

That’s good to know This would not be a matter of thirty golden dragons Tyrion feared Tell me

At King Joffrey’s wedding feast the man said there is to be a tournament of singers

And jugglers and jesters and dancing bears

Only one dancing bear my lord said Symon who had plainly attended Cersei’s arrangements with far more interest than Tyrion had but seven singers Galyeon of Cuy Bethany Fair-fingers Aemon Costayne Alaric of Eysen Hamish the Harper Collio Quaynis and Orland of Oldtown will compete for a gilded lute with silver strings… yet unaccountably no invitation has been forthcoming for one who is master of them all

Let me guess Symon Silver Tongue
