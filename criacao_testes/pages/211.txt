That grim thought soured Jon’s fragile mood I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear’s supper he announced brusquely sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard His friends meant well but they did not understand It was not their fault truly they had not had to face Othor they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands How could they hope to comprehend He turned away from them abruptly and strode off sullen Pyp called after him but Jon paid him no mind

They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin’s Tower after the fire and it was there he returned Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon’s boots The direwolf’s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men Jon knelt scratched his ear and showed him the pommel of the sword Look It’s you

Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick Jon smiled You’re the one deserves an honor he told the wolf… and suddenly he found himself remembering how he’d found him that day in the late summer snow They had been riding off with the other pups but Jon had heard a noise and turned back and there he was white fur almost invisible against the drifts He was all alone he thought apart from the others in the litter He was different so they drove him out

Jon He looked up Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels His cheeks were red and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation

Sam Jon stood What is it Do you want to see the sword If the others had known no doubt Sam did too

The fat boy shook his head I was heir to my father’s blade once he said mournfully Heartsbane Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times but it always scared me It was Valyrian steel beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I’d hurt one of my sisters Dickon will have it now He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak I ah… Maester Aemon wants to see you

It was not time for his bandages to be changed Jon frowned suspiciously Why he demanded Sam looked miserable That was answer enough You told him didn’t you Jon said angrily You told him that you told me

I… he… Jon I didn’t want to… he asked… I mean I think he knew he sees things no one else sees…

He’s blind Jon pointed out forcefully disgusted I can find the way myself He left Sam standing there openmouthed and quivering

He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery feeding the ravens Clydas was with him carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage Sam said you wanted me

The maester nodded I did indeed Clydas give Jon the bucket Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me The hunched pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder Toss the meat into the cages Aemon instructed him The birds will do the rest 

Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars beating at the metal with night-black wings The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first Lord Mormont’s raven likes fruit and corn

He is a rare bird the maester said Most ravens will eat grain but they prefer flesh It makes them strong and I fear they relish the taste of blood In that they are like men… and like men not all ravens are alike

Jon had nothing to say to that He threw meat wondering why he’d been summoned No doubt the old man would tell him in his own good time Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried

Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages the maester went on though the raven is a stronger flyer larger bolder far more clever better able to defend itself against hawks… yet ravens are black and they eat the dead so some godly men abhor them Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves did you know The maester turned his white eyes on Jon smiling The Night’s Watch prefers ravens

Jon’s fingers were in the bucket blood up to the wrist Dywen says the wildlings call us crows he said uncertainty

The crow is the raven’s poor cousin They are both beggars in black hated and misunderstood

Jon wished he understood what they were talking about and why What did he care about ravens and doves If the old man had something to say to him why couldn’t he just say it

Jon did you ever wonder why the men of the Night’s Watch take no wives and father no children Maester Aemon asked

Jon shrugged No He scattered more meat The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket

So they will not love the old man answered for love is the bane of honor the death of duty

That did not sound right to Jon yet he said nothing The maester was a hundred years old and a high officer of the Night’s Watch it was not his place to contradict him

The old man seemed to sense his doubts Tell me Jon if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do

Jon hesitated He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself not even for love yet inside a small sly voice whispered He fathered a bastard where was the honor in that And your mother what of his duty to her he will not even say her name He would do whatever was right he said… ringingly to make up for his hesitation No matter what

Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a woman’s love What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms… or the memory of a brother’s smile Wind and words Wind and words We are only human and the gods have fashioned us for love That is our great glory and our great tragedy

The men who formed the Night’s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve So they vowed they would have no wives nor children

Yet brothers they had and sisters Mothers who gave them birth fathers who gave them names They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms and they knew times may change but men do not So they pledged as well that the Night’s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded
