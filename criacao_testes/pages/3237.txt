he hath he cannot be my disciple

1434 Salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith
shall it be seasoned  1435 It is neither fit for the land nor yet
for the dunghill but men cast it out He that hath ears to hear let
him hear

151 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
him

152 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying This man
receiveth sinners and eateth with them

153 And he spake this parable unto them saying 154 What man of
you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is
lost until he find it  155 And when he hath found it he layeth it
on his shoulders rejoicing

156 And when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and
neighbours saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my
sheep which was lost

157 I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons
which need no repentance

158 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one
piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek
diligently till she find it  159 And when she hath found it she
calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying Rejoice with
me for I have found the piece which I had lost

1510 Likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth

1511 And he said A certain man had two sons 1512 And the younger
of them said to his father Father give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me And he divided unto them his living

1513 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together
and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his
substance with riotous living

1514 And when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that
land and he began to be in want

1515 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and
he sent him into his fields to feed swine

1516 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat and no man gave unto him

1517 And when he came to himself he said How many hired servants of
my fathers have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger
1518 I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him Father
I have sinned against heaven and before thee 1519 And am no more
worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants

1520 And he arose and came to his father But when he was yet a
great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and
fell on his neck and kissed him

1521 And the son said unto him Father I have sinned against heaven
and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son

1522 But the father said to his servants Bring forth the best robe
and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
1523 And bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
and be merry 1524 For this my son was dead and is alive again he
was lost and is found And they began to be merry

1525 Now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh
to the house he heard musick and dancing

1526 And he called one of the servants and asked what these things
meant

1527 And he said unto him Thy brother is come and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound

1528 And he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father
out and intreated him

1529 And he answering said to his father Lo these many years do I
serve thee neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment and
yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make merry with my
friends 1530 But as soon as this thy son was come which hath
devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf

1531 And he said unto him Son thou art ever with me and all that I
have is thine

1532 It was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy
brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found

161 And he said also unto his disciples There was a certain rich
man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he
had wasted his goods
