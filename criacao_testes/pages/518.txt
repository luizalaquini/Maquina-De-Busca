see not

1156 They have ears but they hear not noses have they but they
smell not

1157 They have hands but they handle not feet have they but they
walk not neither speak they through their throat

1158 They that make them are like unto them so is every one that
trusteth in them

1159 O Israel trust thou in the LORD he is their help and their
shield

11510 O house of Aaron trust in the LORD he is their help and their
shield

11511 Ye that fear the LORD trust in the LORD he is their help and
their shield

11512 The LORD hath been mindful of us he will bless us he will
bless the house of Israel he will bless the house of Aaron

11513 He will bless them that fear the LORD both small and great

11514 The LORD shall increase you more and more you and your
children

11515 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth

11516 The heaven even the heavens are the LORDs but the earth
hath he given to the children of men

11517 The dead praise not the LORD neither any that go down into
silence

11518 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore

Praise the LORD



1161 I love the LORD because he hath heard my voice and my
supplications

1162 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live

1163 The sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of hell gat

deliver my soul

1165 Gracious is the LORD and righteous yea our God is merciful

1166 The LORD preserveth the simple I was brought low and he helped
me

1167 Return unto thy rest O my soul for the LORD hath dealt
bountifully with thee

1168 For thou hast delivered my soul from death mine eyes from
tears and my feet from falling

1169 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living

11610 I believed therefore have I spoken I was greatly afflicted

11611 I said in my haste All men are liars

11612 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
me

11613 I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the
LORD

11614 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people

11615 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints

11616 O LORD truly I am thy servant I am thy servant and the son
of thine handmaid thou hast loosed my bonds

11617 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will
call upon the name of the LORD

11618 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people

11619 In the courts of the LORDs house in the midst of thee O
Jerusalem Praise ye the LORD



1171 O praise the LORD all ye nations praise him all ye people

1172 For his merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of
