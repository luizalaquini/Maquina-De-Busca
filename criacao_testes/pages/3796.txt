Jon sat up Ygritte I never stole you

Aye you did You jumped down the mountain and killed Orell and afore I could get my axe you had a knife at my throat I thought you’d have me then or kill me or maybe both but you never did And when I told you the tale o’ Bael the Bard and how he plucked the rose o’ Winterfell I thought you’d know to pluck me then for certain but you didn’t You know nothing Jon Snow She gave him a shy smile You might be learning some though

The light was shifting all about her Jon noticed suddenly He looked around We had best go up The torch is almost done

Is the crow afeared o’ Gendel’s children she said with a grin It’s only a little way up and I’m not done with you Jon Snow She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him Would you… She hesitated

What he prompted as the torch began to gutter

Do it again Ygritte blurted With your mouth The lord’s kiss And I… I could see if you liked it any

By the time the torch burned out Jon Snow no longer cared

His guilt came back afterward but weaker than before If this is so wrong he wondered why did the gods make it feel so good

The grotto was pitch-dark by the time they finished The only light was the dim glow of the passage back up to the larger cavern where a score of fires burned They were soon fumbling and bumping into each other as they tried to dress in the dark Ygritte stumbled into the pool and screeched at the cold of the water When Jon laughed she pulled him in too They wrestled and splashed in the dark and then she was in his arms again and it turned out they were not finished after all

Jon Snow she told him when he’d spent his seed inside her don’t move now sweet I like the feel of you in there I do Let’s not go back t’ Styr and Jarl Let’s go down inside and join up with Gendel’s children I don’t ever want t’ leave this cave Jon Snow Not ever





Daenerys


All The slave girl sounded wary Your Grace did this one’s worthless ears mishear you

Cool green light filtered down through the diamond-shaped panes of colored glass set in the sloping triangular walls and a breeze was blowing gently through the terrace doors carrying the scents of fruit and flowers from the garden beyond Your ears heard true said Dany I want to buy them all Tell the Good Masters if you will

She had chosen a Qartheen gown today The deep violet silk brought out the purple of her eyes The cut of it bared her left breast While the Good Masters of Astapor conferred among themselves in low voices Dany sipped tart persimmon wine from a tall silver flute She could not quite make out all that they were saying but she could hear the greed

Each of the eight brokers was attended by two or three body slaves… though one Grazdan the eldest had six So as not to seem a beggar Dany had brought her own attendants Irri and Jhiqui in their sandsilk trousers and painted vests old Whitebeard and mighty Belwas her bloodriders Ser Jorah stood behind her sweltering in his green surcoat with the black bear of Mormont embroidered upon it The smell of his sweat was an earthy answer to the sweet perfumes that drenched the Astapori

All growled Kraznys mo Nakloz who smelled of peaches today The slave girl repeated the word in the Common Tongue of Westeros Of thousands there are eight Is this what she means by all There are also six centuries who shall be part of a ninth thousand when complete Would she have them too

I would said Dany when the question was put to her The eight thousands the six centuries… and the ones still in training as well The ones who have not earned the spikes

Kraznys turned back to his fellows Once again they conferred among themselves The translator had told Dany their names but it was hard to keep them straight Four of the men seemed to be named Grazdan presumably after Grazdan the Great who had founded Old Ghis in the dawn of days They all looked alike thick fleshy men with amber skin broad noses dark eyes Their wiry hair was black or a dark red or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari All wrapped themselves in tokars a garment permitted only to freeborn men of Astapor

It was the fringe on the tokar that proclaimed a man’s status Dany had been told by Captain Groleo In this cool green room atop the pyramid two of the slavers wore tokars fringed in silver five had gold fringes and one the oldest Grazdan displayed a fringe of fat white pearls that clacked together softly when he shifted in his seat or moved an arm

We cannot sell half-trained boys one of the silver-fringe Grazdans was saying to the others

We can if her gold is good said a fatter man whose fringe was gold

They are not Unsullied They have not killed their sucklings If they fail in the field they will shame us And even if we cut five thousand raw boys tomorrow it would be ten years before they are fit for sale What would we tell the next buyer who comes seeking Unsullied

We will tell him that he must wait said the fat man Gold in my purse is better than gold in my future

Dany let them argue sipping the tart persimmon wine and trying to keep her face blank and ignorant I will have them all no matter the price she told herself The city had a hundred slave traders but the eight before her were the greatest When selling bed slaves fieldhands scribes craftsmen and tutors these men were rivals but their ancestors had allied one with the other for the purpose of making and selling the Unsullied Brick and blood built Astapor and brick and blood her people

It was Kraznys who finally announced their decision Tell her that the eight thousands she shall have if her gold proves sufficient And the six centuries if she wishes Tell her to come back in a year and we will sell her another two thousand

In a year I shall be in Westeros said Dany when she had heard the translation My need is now The Unsullied are well trained but even so many will fall in battle I shall need the boys as replacements to take up the swords they drop She put her wine aside and leaned toward the slave girl Tell the Good Masters that I will want even the little ones who still have their puppies Tell them that I will pay as much for the boy they cut yesterday as for an Unsullied in a spiked helm

The girl told them The answer was still no

Dany frowned in annoyance Very well Tell them I will pay double so long as I get them all

Double The fat one in the gold fringe all but drooled

This little whore is a fool truly said Khaznys mo Nakloz Ask her for triple I say She is desperate enough to pay Ask for ten times the price of every slave yes

The tall Grazdan with the spiked beard spoke in the Common Tongue though not so well as the slave girl Your Grace he growled Westeros is being wealthy yes but you are not being queen now Perhaps will never being queen Even Unsullied may be losing battles to savage steel knights of Seven Kingdoms I am reminding the Good Masters of Astapor are not selling flesh for promisings Are you having gold and trading goods sufficient to be paying for all these eunuchs you are wanting

You know the answer to that better than I Good Master Dany replied Your men have gone through my ships and tallied every bead of amber and jar of saffron How much do I have

Sufficient to be buying one of thousands the Good Master said with a contemptuous smile Yet you are paying double you are saying Five centuries then is all you buy

Your pretty crown might buy another century said the fat one in Valyrian Your crown of the three dragons

Dany waited for his words to be translated My crown is not for sale When Viserys sold their mother’s crown the last joy had gone from him leaving only rage Nor will I enslave my people nor sell their goods and horses But my ships you can have The great cog Balerion and the galleys Vhagar and Meraxes She had warned Groleo and the other captains it might come to this though they had protested the necessity of it furiously Three good ships should be worth more than a few paltry eunuchs

The fat Grazdan turned to the others They conferred in low voices once again Two of the thousands the one with the spiked beard said when he turned back It is too much but the Good Masters are being generous and your need is being great

Two thousand would never serve for what she meant to do I must have them all Dany knew what she must do now though the taste of it was so bitter that even the persimmon wine could not cleanse it from her month She had considered long and hard and found no other way It is my only choice Give me all she said and you may have a dragon

There was the sound of indrawn breath from Jhiqui beside her Kraznys smiled at his fellows Did I not tell you Anything she would give us

Whitebeard stared in shocked disbelief His hand trembled where it grasped the staff No He went to one knee before her Your Grace I beg you win your throne with dragons not slaves You must not do this thing—

You must not presume to instruct me Ser Jorah remove Whitebeard from my presence

Mormont seized the old man roughly by an elbow yanked him back to his feet and marched him out onto the terrace

Tell the Good Masters I regret this interruption said Dany to the slave girl Tell them I await their answer

She knew the answer though she could see it in the glitter of their eyes and the smiles they tried so hard to hide Astapor had thousands of eunuchs and even more slave boys waiting to be cut but there were only three living dragons in all the great wide world And the Ghiscari lust for dragons How could they not Five times had Old Ghis contended with Valyria when the world was young and five times gone down to bleak defeat For the Freehold had dragons and the Empire had none

The oldest Grazdan stirred in his seat and his pearls clacked together softly A dragon of our choice he said in a thin hard voice The black one is largest and healthiest

His name is Drogon She nodded

All your goods save your crown and your queenly raiment which we will allow you to keep The three ships And Drogon

Done she said in the Common Tongue

Done the old Grazdan answered in his thick Valyrian
