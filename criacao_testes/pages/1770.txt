home
An opportunity occurred one evening when she had
gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour+
ing cornfields It was dusk when Oak who had not
been far a-field that day took the same path and met
her returning quite pensively as he thought
The wheat was now tall and the path was narrow
thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the
embowing thicket on either side Two persons could
not walk abreast
P 245
without damaging the crop and Oak
stood aside to let her pass
Oh is it Gabriel she said You are taking a
walk too Good-night
I thought I would come to meet you as it is rather
late said Oak turning and following at her heels when
she had brushed somewhat quickly by him
Thank you indeed but I am not very fearful
 O no  but there are bad characters about
I never meet them
Now Oak with marvellous ingenuity had been going
to introduce the gallant sergeant through the channel of
bad characters But all at once the scheme broke
down it suddenly occurring to him that this was rather a
clumsy way and too barefaced to begin with He tried
another preamble
And as the man who would naturally come to meet
you is away from home too -- I mean Farmer Boldwood
 -- why thinks I Ill go he said
Ah yes She walked on without turning her head
and for many steps nothing further was heard from her
quarter than the rustle of her dress against the heavy
corn-ears Then she resumed rather tartly --
I dont quite understand what you meant by saying
that Mr Boldwood would naturally come to meet me
I meant on account of the wedding which they say
is likely to take place between you and him miss For+
give my speaking plainly
They say what is not true she returned quickly
No marriage is likely to take place between us
Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion for
the moment had come  Well Miss Everdene he
said putting aside what people say I never in my life
saw any courting if his is not a courting of you
Bathsheba would probably have terminated the con
versation there and then by flatly forbidding the subject
had not her conscious weakness of position allured her
to palter and argue in endeavours to better it
P 246
Since this subject has been mentioned she said
very emphatically I am glad of the opportunity of
clearing up a mistake which is very common and very
provoking I didnt definitely promise Mr Boldwood
anything I have never cared for him I respect him
and he has urged me to marry him But I have given
him no distinct answer As soon as he returns I shall
do so and the answer will be that I cannot think of
marrying him
People are full of mistakes seemingly
 They are
The other day they said you were trifling with him
and you almost proved that you were not lately they
have said that you be not and you straightway begin
to show --  -- 
That I am I suppose you mean
 Well I hope they speak the truth
They do but wrongly applied I dont trifle with
him  but then I have nothing to do with him
Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwoods
rival in a wrong tone to her after all I wish you had
never met that young Sergeant Troy miss he sighed
PARTlCULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
Bathshebas steps became faintly spasmodic  Why
she asked
 He is not good enough for ee
Did any one tell you to speak to me like this 
 Nobody at all
Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not
concern us here she said intractably  Yet I must say
that Sergeant Troy is an educated man and quite worthy
of any woman He is well born
His being higher in learning and birth than the
ruck o soldiers is anything but a proof of his worth It
shows his course to be downard
I cannot see what this has to do with our conversa+
tion Mr Troys course is not by any means downward
and his superiority 1is1 a proof of his worth  
I believe him to have no conscience at all And I
cannot help begging you miss to have nothing to do
with him Listen to me this once -- only this once 
I dont say hes such
P 247
a bad man as I have fancied -- I
pray to God he is not But since we dont exactly
know what he is why not behave as if he 1might1 be bad
simply for your own safety  Dont trust him mistress
I ask you not to trust him so
 Why pray  
I like soldiers but this one I do not like he said
