ance which seem ordinary in philosophy are rare in
conduct and Bathsheba was astonishing all around her
now for her philosophy was her conduct and she
seldom thought practicable what she did not practise
She was of the stuff of which great mens mothers
are made She was indispensable to high generation
hated at tea parties feared in shops and loved at crises
Troy recumbent in his wifes lap formed now the sole
spectacle in the middle of the spacious room
Gabriel she said automatically when he entered
turning up a face of which only the weliknown lines
remained to tell him it was hers all else in the picture
having faded quite Ride to Casterbridge instantly
for a surgeon It is I believe useless but go Mr
Boldwood has shot my husband
Her statement of the fact in such quiet and simple
words came with more force than a tragic declamation
and had somewhat the effect of setting the distorted
images in each mind present into proper focus Oak
almost before he had comprehended anything beyond
the briefest abstract of the event hurried out of the
room saddled a horse and rode away Not till he had
ridden more than a mile did it occur to him that he
would have done better by sending some other man
on this errand remaining himself in the house What
had become of Boldwood He should have been
looked after Was he mad -- had there been a quarrel
Then how had Troy got there Where had he come
from How did this remarkable reappearance effect
itself when he was supposed by many to be at the
bottom of the sea Oak had in some slight measure
been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a
rumour of his return just before entering Boldwoods
house  but before he had weighed that information this
fatal event had been superimposed However it was too
late now to think of sending another messenger and
he rode on in the excitement of these self-inquiries
not discerning when about three miles from Caster+
bridge a square-figured pedestrian passing along
under the dark hedge in the same direction as his
own
The miles necessary to be traversed and other
hindrances

incidental to the lateness of the hour and
the darkness of the night delayed the arrival of Mr
Aldritch the surgeon  and more than three hours
passed between the time at which the shot was fired
and that of his entering the house Oak was addition+
ally detained in Casterbridge through having to give
notice to the authorities of what had happened and
he then found that Boldwood had also entered the
town and delivercd himself up
In the meantime the surgeon having hastened into
the hall at Boldwoods found it in darkness and quite
deserted He went on to the back of the house
where he discovered in the kitchen an old man of
whom he made inquiries
Shes had him took away to her own house sir
said his informant
Who has said the doctor
Mrs Troy A was quite dead sir
This was astonishing information She had no
right to do that said the doctor There will have
to be an inquest and she should have waited to know
what to do
Yes sir it was hinted to her that she had better
wait till the law was known But she said law was
nothing to her and she wouldnt let her dear husbands
corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all the
crowners in England
Mr Aldritch drove at once back again up the
hill to Bathshebas The first person he met was
poor Liddy who seemed literally to have dwindled
smaller in these few latter hours What has been
done he said
I dont know sir said Liddy with suspended
breath My mistress has done it all
Where is she
 Upstairs with him sir When he was brought
home and taken upstairs she said she wanted no
further help from the men And then she called me
and made me fill the bath and after that told me I
had better go and lie down because I looked so ill
Then she locked herself into the room alone with him
and would not let a nurse come in or anybody at all
But I thought ld wait in the next room in case she
should want me I heard her moving about inside
for more than an

hour but she only came out once
and that was for more candles because hers had burnt
down into the socket She said we were to let her
know when you or Mr Thirdly came sir
Oak entered with the parson at this moment and
they all went upstairs together preceded by Liddy
Smallbury Everything was silent as the grave when
they paused on the landing Liddy knocked and
Bathshebas dress was heard rustling across the room
the key turned in the lock and she opened the door
