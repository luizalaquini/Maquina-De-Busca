Jon stood I do my lord

I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree as your uncle did Mormont said

Yes my lord Jon said The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks

He heard Grenn whispering behind him There’s no godswood here Is there I never saw a godswood

You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow Pyp whispered back

I would so Grenn insisted I’d see them a long way off

Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts Castle Black has no need of a godswood Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot and mayhap your gods as well

My lord The voice made Jon glance back in surprise Samwell Tarly was on his feet The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic Might I… might I go as well To say my words at this heart tree

Does House Tarly keep the old gods too Mormont asked

No my lord Sam replied in a thin nervous voice The high officers frightened him Jon knew the Old Bear most of all I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill as my father was and his father and all the Tarlys for a thousand years

Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker

The Night’s Watch is my House now Sam said The Seven have never answered my prayers Perhaps the old gods will

As you wish boy Mormont said Sam took his seat again as did Jon We have placed each of you in an order as befits our need and your own strengths and skills Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read Haider to the builders he began Haider gave a stiff nod of approval Grenn to the rangers Albett to the builders Pypar to the rangers Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears Samwell to the stewards Sam sagged with relief mopping at his brow witha scrap of silk Matthar to the rangers Dareon to the stewards Todder to the rangers Jon to the stewards

The stewards For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard Mormont must have read it wrong He started to rise to open his mouth to tell them there had been a mistake… and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian and he knew

The Old Bear rolled up the paper Your firsts will instruct you in your duties May all the gods preserve you brothers The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow and took his leave Ser Alliser went with him a thin smile on his face Jon had never seen the master-at-arms took quite so happy

Rangers with me Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet His ears were red Grenn grinning broadly did not seem to realize that anything was amiss Matt and Toad fell in beside them and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept

Builders announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck Haider and Albett trailed out after him

Jon looked around him in sick disbelief Maester Aemon’s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see The septon was arranging crystals on the altar Only Sam and Darcon remained on the benches a fat boy a singer… and him

Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together Samwell you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library Chett is going to the kennels to help with the hounds You shall have his cell so as to be close to the maester night and day I trust you will take good care of him He is very old and very precious to us

Dareon I am told that you sang at many a high lord’s table and shared their meat and mead We are sending you to Eastwatch It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish and the quality of the olive oil we’re getting has been frightful Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive he will keep you busy between ships

Marsh turned his smile on Jon Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward Jon You’ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers in the Lord Commander’s tower

And what will my duties be Jon asked sharply Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals help him fasten his clothes fetch hot water for his bath

Certainly Marsh frowned at Jon’s tone And you will run his messages keep a fire burning in his chambers change his sheets and blankets daily and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you

Do you take me for a servant

No Maester Aemon said from the back of the sept Clydas helped him stand We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch… but perhaps we were wrong in that

It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days May I go he asked stiffly

As you wish Bowen Marsh responded

Dareon and Sam left with him They descended to the yard in silence Outside Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers Jon’s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant and the world be damned

Jon Samwell Tarly said excitedly Wait Don’t you see what they’re doing

Jon turned on him in a fury I see Ser Alliser’s bloody hand that’s all I see He wanted to shame me and he has

Dareon gave him a look The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me Sam but not for Lord Snow

I’m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you Jon blazed back It’s not fair

Fair Dareon sneered The girl was waiting for me naked as the day she was born She pulled me through the window and you talk to me of fair He walked off

There is no shame in being a steward Sam said

Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man’s smallclothes

The old man is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch Sam reminded him You’ll be with him day and night Yes you’ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh but you’ll also take his letters attend him at meetings squire for him in battle You’ll be as close to him as his shadow You’ll know everything be a part of everything… and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself

When I was little my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell he made me come Later though he started to take Dickon and leave me at home and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences so long as Dickon was there He wanted his heir at his side don’t you see To watch and listen and learn from all he did I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you Jon What else could it be He wants to groom you for command

Jon was taken aback It was true Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell Could Sam be right Even a bastard could rise high in the Night’s Watch they said I never asked for this he said stubbornly

None of us are here for asking Sam reminded him

And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed

Craven or not Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man On the Wall a man gets only what he earns Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive You’re no ranger Jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you He’d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children on the Wall you grew up or you died

Jon let out a deep sigh You have the right of it I was acting the boy

Then you’ll stay and say your words with me

The old gods will be expecting us He made himself smile

They set out late that afternoon The Wall had no gates as such neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned Three times their way was blocked by iron bars and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward The air was colder than a tomb and more still He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall

Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively The wildlings… they wouldn’t… they’d never dare come this close to the Wall Would they

They never have Jon climbed into his saddle When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled Ghost came loping out of the tunnel

The Lord Steward’s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf Do you mean to take that beast

Yes my lord Jon said Ghost’s head lifted He seemed to taste the air In the blink of an eye he was off racing across the broad weed-choked field to vanish in the trees

Once they had entered the forest they were in a different world Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man The haunted forest was much the same and yet the feel of it was very different
