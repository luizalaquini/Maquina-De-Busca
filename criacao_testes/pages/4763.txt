JON

The wind was blowing wild from the east so strong the heavy cage would rock whenever a gust got it in its teeth It skirled along the Wall shivering off the ice making Jon’s cloak flap against the bars The sky was slate grey the sun no more than a faint patch of brightness behind the clouds Across the killing ground he could see the glimmer of a thousand campfires burning but their lights seemed small and powerless against such gloom and cold

A grim day Jon Snow wrapped gloved hands around the bars and held tight as the wind hammered at the cage once more When he looked straight down past his feet the ground was lost in shadow as if he were being lowered into some bottomless pit Well death is a bottomless pit of sorts he reflected and when this day’s work is done my name will be shadowed forever

Bastard children were born from lust and lies men said their nature was wanton and treacherous Once Jon had meant to prove them wrong to show his lord father that he could be as good and true a son as Robb I made a botch of that Robb had become a hero king if Jon was remembered at all it would be as a turncloak an oathbreaker and a murderer He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see his shame

I should have stayed in that cave with Ygritte If there was a life beyond this one he hoped to tell her that She will claw my face the way the eagle did and curse me for a coward but I’ll tell her all the same He flexed his sword hand as Maester Aemon had taught him The habit had become part of him and he would need his fingers to be limber to have even half a chance of murdering Mance Rayder

They had pulled him out this morning after four days in the ice locked up in a cell five by five by five too low for him to stand too tight for him to stretch out on his back The stewards had long ago discovered that food and meat kept longer in the icy storerooms carved from the base of the Wall    but prisoners did not You will die in here Lord Snow Ser Alliser had said just before he closed the heavy wooden door and Jon had believed it But this morning they had come and pulled him out again and marched him cramped and shivering back to the King’s Tower to stand before jowly Janos Slynt once more

That old maester says I cannot hang you Slynt declared He has written Cotter Pyke and even had the bloody gall to show me the letter He says you are no turncloak

Aemon’s lived too long my lord Ser Alliser assured him His wits have gone dark as his eyes

Aye Slynt said A blind man with a chain about his neck who does he think he is

Aemon Targaryen Jon thought a king’s son and a king’s brother and a king who might have been But he said nothing

Still Slynt said I will not have it said that Janos Slynt hanged a man unjustly I will not I have decided to give you one last chance to prove you are as loyal as you claim Lord Snow One last chance to do your duty yes He stood Mance Rayder wants to parley with us He knows he has no chance now that Janos Slynt has come so he wants to talk this King-beyond-the-Wall But the man is craven and will not come to us No doubt he knows I’d hang him Hang him by his feet from the top of the Wall on a rope two hundred feet long But he will not come He asks that we send an envoy to him

We’re sending you Lord Snow Ser Alliser smiled

Me Jon’s voice was flat Why me

You rode with these wildlings said Thorne Mance Rayder knows you He will be more inclined to trust you

That was so wrong Jon might have laughed You’ve got it backward Mance suspected me from the first If I show up in his camp wearing a black cloak again and speaking for the Night’s Watch he’ll know that I betrayed him

He asked for an envoy we are sending one said Slynt If you are too craven to face this turncloak king we can return you to your ice cell This time without the furs I think Yes

No need for that my lord said Ser Alliser Lord Snow will do as we ask He wants to show us that he is no turncloak He wants to prove himself a loyal man of the Night’s Watch

Thorne was much the more clever of the two Jon realized this had his stink all over it He was trapped I’ll go he said in a clipped curt voice

M’lord Janos Slynt reminded him You’ll address me—

I’ll go my lord But you are making a mistake my lord You are sending the wrong man my lord Just the sight of me is going to anger Mance My lord would have a better chance of reaching terms if he sent—

Terms Ser Alliser chuckled

Janos Slynt does not make terms with lawless savages Lord Snow No he does not

We’re not sending you to talk with Mance Rayder Ser Alliser said We’re sending you to kill him

The wind whistled through the bars and Jon Snow shivered His leg was throbbing and his head He was not fit to kill a kitten yet here he was The trap had teeth With Maester Aemon insisting on Jon’s innocence Lord Janos had not dared to leave him in the ice to die This was better Our honor means no more than our lives so long as the realm is safe Qhorin Halfhand had said in the Frostfangs He must remember that Whether he slew Mance or only tried and failed the free folk would kill him Even desertion was impossible if he’d been so inclined to Mance he was a proven liar and betrayer

When the cage jerked to a halt Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw’s hilt to loosen the bastard blade in its scabbard The gate was a few yards to his left still blocked by the splintered ruins of the turtle the carcass of a mammoth ripening within There were other corpses too strewn amidst broken barrels hardened pitch and patches of burnt grass all shadowed by the Wall Jon had no wish to linger here He started walking toward the wildling camp past the body of a dead giant whose head had been crushed by a stone A raven was pulling out bits of brain from the giant’s shattered skull It looked up as he walked by Snow it screamed at him Snow snow Then it opened its wings and flew away

No sooner had he started out than a lone rider emerged from the wildling camp and came toward him He wondered if Mance was coming out to parley in no-man’s-land That might make it easier though nothing will make it easy But as the distance between them diminished Jon saw that the horseman was short and broad with gold rings glinting on thick arms and a white beard spreading out across his massive chest

Har Tormund boomed when they came together Jon Snow the crow I feared we’d seen the last o’ you

I never knew you feared anything Tormund

That made the wildling grin Well said lad I see your cloak is black Mance won’t like that If you’ve come to change sides again best climb back on that Wall o’ yours

They’ve sent me to treat with the King-beyond-the-Wall

Treat Tormund laughed Now there’s a word Har Mance wants to talk that’s true enough Can’t say he’d want to talk with you though

I’m the one they’ve sent

I see that Best come along then You want to ride

I can walk

You fought us hard here Tormund turned his garron back toward the wildling camp You and your brothers I give you that Two hundred dead and a dozen giants Mag himself went in that gate o’ yours and never did come out

He died on the sword of a brave man named Donal Noye

Aye Some great lord was he this Donal Noye One of your shiny knights in their steel smallclothes

A blacksmith He only had one arm

A one-armed smith slew Mag the Mighty Har That must o’ been a fight to see Mance will make a song of it see if he don’t Tormund took a waterskin off his saddle and pulled the cork This will warm us some To Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty He took a swing and handed it down to Jon

To Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty The skin was full of mead but a mead so potent that it made Jon’s eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through his chest After the ice cell and the cold ride down in the cage the warmth was welcome

Tormund took the skin back and downed another swig then wiped his mouth The Magnar of Thenn swore t’us that he’d have the gate wide open so all we’d need to do was stroll through singing He was going to bring the whole Wall down

He brought down part Jon said On his head

Har said Tormund Well I never had much use for Styr When a man’s got no beard nor hair nor ears you can’t get a good grip on him when you fight He kept his horse at a slow walk so Jon could limp beside him What happened to that leg

An arrow One of Ygritte’s I think

That’s a woman for you One day she’s kissing you the next she’s filling you with arrows

She’s dead

Aye Tormund gave a sad shake of the head A waste If I’d been ten years younger I’d have stolen her meself That hair she had Well the hottest fires burn out quickest He lifted the skin of mead To Ygritte kissed by fire He drank deep

To Ygritte kissed by fire Jon repeated when Tormund handed him back the skin He drank even deeper

Was it you killed her

My brother Jon had never learned which one and hoped he never would
