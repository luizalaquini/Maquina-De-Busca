Another issue which is closely bound up with pitch extraction is
the voiced-unvoiced distinction   A good pitch estimator ought to
fail when presented with aperiodic input such as an unvoiced
sound and so give a reliable indication of whether the frame of
speech is voiced or not
pp
One method of pitch estimation which uses the cepstrum has been outlined
above  It involves a substantial amount of computation
and has a high degree of complexity  However if implemented
properly it gives excellent results because the source-filter
structure of the speech is fully utilized
Another method using the
linear prediction residual will be described in Chapter 6
Again this requires a great deal of computation of a fairly sophisticated
nature and gives good results em although it relies on a
somewhat more
restricted version of the source-filter model than cepstral
analysis
rh Autocorrelation methods
The most reliable way of estimating the pitch of a periodic
signal which is corrupted by noise is to examine its
short-time autocorrelation function
The autocorrelation of a signal xn with lag k is defined as
LB
EQ
phi k  =  sum from n=- infinity to infinity  xnxn+k 
EN
LE
If the signal is quasi-periodic with slowly varying period
a finite stretch of it can be isolated with a window
wi which is 0 when i is outside the range 0N
Beginning this window at sample m gives the windowed signal
LB
EQ
xnwn-m
EN
LE
whose autocorrelation
the
ul
short-time
autocorrelation of the signal x at point m is
LB
EQ
phi sub m k =  sum from n  xnwn-mxn+kwn-m+k 
EN
LE
pp
The autocorrelation function exhibits peaks at lags which correspond to
the pitch periods and multiples of it  At such lags the signal is in
phase with a delayed version of itself giving high correlation
The pitch of natural speech ranges about three octaves from 50 Hz low-pitched men to around
400 Hz children  To ensure that at least two pitch cycles are seen even at
the
low end the window needs to be at least 40 msec long and the autocorrelation
function calculated for lags up to 20 msec  The peaks which occur at lags
corresponding to multiples of the pitch become smaller as the multiple
increases because the speech waveform will change slightly and the pitch
period is not perfectly constant  If signals at the high end of the pitch
range 400 Hz are
viewed through a 40 msec autocorrelation window considerable smearing of
pitch resolution in the time domain is to be expected  Finally for unvoiced
speech no substantial peaks of autocorrelation will occur
pp
If all deviations from perfect periodicity can be attributed to
additive white Gaussian noise then it can be shown from
standard detection theory that autocorrelation methods are
appropriate for pitch identification  Unfortunately this is
certainly not the case for speech signals  Although the
short-time autocorrelation of voiced speech exhibits peaks at
multiples of the pitch period it is not clear that it is any
easier to detect these peaks in the autocorrelation function
than it is in the original time waveform  To take a simple
example if a signal contains a fundamental and in-phase first
and second harmonics
LB
EQ
xn = a sin 2 pi fnT + b sin 4 pi fnT + c sin 6 pi fnT

then its autocorrelation function is
LB
EQ
phi k = a sup 2 cos2 pi fkT+b sup 2 cos2 pi
fkT+c sup 2 cos 2 pi fkT over 2  
EN
LE
There is no reason to believe that detection of the fundamental
period of this signal will be any easier in the autocorrelation
domain than in the time domain
pp
The most common error of pitch detection by autocorrelation
analysis is that the periodicities of the formants are confused
with the pitch  This typically leads to the repetition time
being identified as  T sub pitch  +-  T sub formant1  where the
Ts are the periods of the pitch and first formant  Fortunately
there are simple ways of processing the signal non-linearly to
reduce the effect of formants on pitch estimation using autocorrelation
