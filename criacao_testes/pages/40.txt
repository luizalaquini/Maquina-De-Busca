One did not say no to the queen’s brother of course so that had settled the matter but Stark had not been happy You will not like the ride I promise you that he’d said curtly and since the moment they set out he had done all he could to live up to that promise

By the end of the first week Tyrion’s thighs were raw from hard riding his legs were cramping badly and he was chilled to the bone He did not complain He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction

He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur a tattered bearskin old and musty-smelling Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Night’s Watch gallantry no doubt expecting him to graciously decline Tyrion had accepted with a smile He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough It was cold up here and growing colder The nights were well below freezing now and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse Perhaps he had learned a lesson The Lannisters never declined graciously or otherwise The Lannisters took what was offered

Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under and they were thrown back on their own resources

Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one Too small too hobbled too in-the-way So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters tended the horses and built a fire it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read

On the eighteenth night of their journey the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons With Lord Eddard Stark’s permission Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north

He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk took a sip of the wine and began to read about the properties of dragonbone Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content the book told him It is strong as steel yet lighter and far more flexible and of course utterly impervious to fire Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki and small wonder An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow

Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons When he had first come to King’s Landing for his sister’s wedding to Robert Baratheon he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen’s throne room King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries but Tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored

He had expected to find them impressive perhaps even frightening He had not thought to find them beautiful Yet they were As black as onyx polished smooth so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch They liked the fire he sensed He’d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him The teeth were long curving knives of black diamond The flame of the torch was nothing to them they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires When he had moved away Tyrion could have sworn that the beast’s empty eye sockets had watched him go

There were nineteen skulls The oldest was more than three thousand years old the youngest a mere century and a half The most recent were also the smallest a matched pair no bigger than mastiff’s skulls and oddly misshapen all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone They were the last of the Targaryen dragons perhaps the last dragons anywhere and they had not lived very long

From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old The singers had given them the names of gods Balerion Meraxes Vhaghar Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws wordless and awed You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar’s gullet although you would not have ridden it out again Meraxes was even bigger And the greatest of them Balerion the Black Dread could have swallowed an aurochs whole or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben

Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time staring at Balerion’s huge empty-eyed skull until his torch burned low trying to grasp the size of the living animal to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies breathing fire

His own remote ancestor King Loren of the Rock had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest That was close on three hundred years ago when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms and not mere provinces of a greater realm Between them the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying five thousand mounted knights and ten times as many freeriders and men-at-arms Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number the chroniclers said and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain their loyalties uncertain

The hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest When the Two Kings charged the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run For a few moments the chroniclers wrote the conquest was at an end… but only for those few moments before Aegon Targaryen and his sisters joined the battle

It was the only time that Vhaghar Meraxes and Balerion were all unleashed at once The singers called it the Field of Fire

Near four thousand men had burned that day among them King Mern of the Reach King Loren had escaped and lived long enough to surrender pledge his fealty to the Targaryens and beget a son for which Tyrion was duly grateful

Why do you read so much

Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice Jon Snow was standing a few feet away regarding him curiously He closed the book on a finger and said Look at me and tell me what you see

The boy looked at him suspiciously Is this some kind of trick I see you Tyrion Lannister

Tyrion sighed You are remarkably polite for a bastard Snow What you see is a dwarf You are what twelve

Fourteen the boy said

Fourteen and you’re taller than I will ever be My legs are short and twisted and I walk with difficulty I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse A saddle of my own design you may be interested to know It was either that or ride a pony My arms are strong enough but again too short I will never make a swordsman Had I been born a peasant they might have left me out to die or sold me to some slaver’s grotesquerie Alas I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock and the grotesqueries are all the poorer Things are expected of me My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years My brother later killed that very same king as it turns out but life is full of these little ironies My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him I must do my part for the honor of my House wouldn’t you agree Yet how Well my legs may be too small for my body but my head is too large although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses My mind is my weapon My brother has his sword King Robert has his warhammer and I have my mind… and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book That’s why I read so much Jon Snow

The boy absorbed that all in silence He had the Stark face if not the name long solemn guarded a face that gave nothing away Whoever his mother had been she had left little of herself in her son What are you reading about he asked

Dragons Tyrion told him

What good is that There are no more dragons the boy said with the easy certainty of youth

So they say Tyrion replied Sad isn’t it When I was your age used to dream of having a dragon of my own

You did the boy said suspiciously Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him
