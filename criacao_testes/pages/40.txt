439 I will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if I
bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the
blame for ever 4310 For except we had lingered surely now we had
returned this second time

4311 And their father Israel said unto them If it must be so now do
this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry
down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and
myrrh nuts and almonds 4312 And take double money in your hand
and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry
it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight 4313 Take
also your brother and arise go again unto the man 4314 And God
Almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your
other brother and Benjamin If I be bereaved of my children I am
bereaved

4315 And the men took that present and they took double money in
their hand and Benjamin and rose up and went down to Egypt and
stood before Joseph

4316 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the ruler of
his house Bring these men home and slay and make ready for these
men shall dine with me at noon

4317 And the man did as Joseph bade and the man brought the men into
Josephs house

4318 And the men were afraid because they were brought into Josephs
house and they said Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion
against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses

4319 And they came near to the steward of Josephs house and they
communed with him at the door of the house 4320 And said O sir we
came indeed down at the first time to buy food 4321 And it came to
pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold
every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full
weight and we have brought it again in our hand

4322 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks

4323 And he said Peace be to you fear not your God and the God of
your father hath given you treasure in your sacks I had your money
And he brought Simeon out unto them

4324 And the man brought the men into Josephs house and gave them
water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender

4325 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon for
they heard that they should eat bread there

4326 And when Joseph came home they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the
earth

4327 And he asked them of their welfare and said Is your father
well the old man of whom ye spake Is he yet alive  4328 And they
answered Thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive
And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance

4329 And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his
mothers son and said Is this your younger brother of whom ye spake
unto me And he said God be gracious unto thee my son

4330 And Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his
brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber
and wept there

4331 And he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and
said Set on bread

4332 And they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves
and for the Egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because
the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews for that is an
abomination unto the Egyptians

4333 And they sat before him the firstborn according to his
birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men
marvelled one at another

4334 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him but
Benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs And they
drank and were merry with him

441 And he commanded the steward of his house saying Fill the mens
sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money
in his sacks mouth

442 And put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the
youngest and his corn money And he did according to the word that
Joseph had spoken

443 As soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they
and their asses

444 And when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off
Joseph said unto his steward Up follow after the men and when thou
dost overtake them say unto them Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for
