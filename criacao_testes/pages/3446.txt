My brother is not here to answer questions Lannister Robb said curtly Do your business and be on your way

I have a gift for you the dwarf said to Bran Do you like to ride boy

Maester Luwin came forward My lord the child has lost the use of his legs He cannot sit a horse

Nonsense said Lannister With the right horse and the right saddle even a cripple can ride

The word was a knife through Bran’s heart He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes I’m not a cripple

Then I am not a dwarf the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth My father will rejoice to hear it Greyjoy laughed

What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting Maester Luwin asked

A smart horse Lannister replied The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal so you must shape the horse to the rider teach it to respond to the reins to the voice I would begin with an unbroken yearling with no old training to be unlearned He drew a rolled paper from his belt Give this to your saddler He will provide the rest

Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand curious as a small grey squirrel He unrolled it studied it I see You draw nicely my lord Yes this ought to work I should have thought of this myself

It came easier to me Maester It is not terribly unlike my own saddles

Will I truly be able to ride Bran asked He wanted to believe them but he was afraid Perhaps it was just another lie The crow had promised him that he could fly

You will the dwarf told him And I swear to you boy on horseback you will be as tall as any of them

Robb Stark seemed puzzled Is this some trap Lannister What’s Bran to you Why should you want to help him

Your brother Jon asked it of me And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned

The door to the yard flew open Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in breathless The direwolves were with him The boy stopped by the door wide-eyed but the wolves came on Their eyes found Lannister or perhaps they caught his scent Summer began to growl first Grey Wind picked it up They padded toward the little man one from the right and one from the left

The wolves do not like your smell Lannister Theon Greyioy commented

Perhaps it’s time I took my leave Tyrion said He took a step backward… and Shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him snarling Lannister recoiled and Summer lunged at him from the other side He reeled away unsteady on his feet and Grey Wind snapped at his arm teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth

No Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister’s men reached for their steel Summer here Summer to me

The direwolf heard the voice glanced at Bran and again at Lannister He crept backward away from the little man and settled down below Bran’s dangling feet

Robb had been holding his breath He let it out with a sigh and called Grey Wind His direwolf moved to him swift and silent Now there was only Shaggydog rumbling at the small man his eyes burning like green fire

Rickon call him Bran shouted to his baby brother and Rickon remembered himself and screamed Home Shaggy home now The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon who hugged him tightly around the neck

Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf mopped at his brow and said in a flat voice How interesting

Are you well my lord asked one of his men his sword in hand He glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke

My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp but nothing was harmed save my dignity

Even Robb looked shaken The wolves… I don’t know why they did that…

No doubt they mistook me for dinner Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran I thank you for calling them off young ser I promise you they would have found me quite indigestible And now I will be leaving truly

A moment my lord Maester Luwin said He moved to Robb and they huddled close together whispering Bran tried to hear what they were saying but their voices were too low

Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword I… I may have been hasty with you he said You’ve done Bran a kindness and well… Robb composed himself with an effort The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it Lannister

Spare me your false courtesies boy You do not love me and you do not want me here I saw an inn outside your walls in the winter town I’ll find a bed there and both of us will sleep easier For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me He spoke to one of the black brothers an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard Yoren we go south at daybreak You will find me on the road no doubt With that he made his exit struggling across the hall on his short legs past Rickon and out the door His men followed

The four of the Night’s Watch remained Robb turned to them uncertainly I have had rooms prepared and you’ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road I hope you will honor us at table tonight He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note it was a speech he had learned not words from the heart but the black brothers thanked him all the same

Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed Old Nan was asleep in her chair Hodor said Hodor gathered up his great-grandmother and carried her off snoring softly while Bran lay thinking Robb had promised that he could feast with the Night’s Watch in the Great Hall Summer he called The wolf bounded up on the bed Bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek I can ride now he whispered to his friend We can go hunting in the woods soon wait and see After a time he slept

In his dream he was climbing again pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones his feet scrabbling for purchase Higher and higher he climbed through the clouds and into the night sky and still the tower rose before him When he paused to look down his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping Bran cried out and clung for dear life The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly He could not fly He waited until his heart had stopped pounding until he could breathe and he began to climb again There was no way to go but up Far above him outlined against a vast pale moon he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles His arms were sore and aching but he dared not rest He forced himself to climb faster The gargoyles watched him ascend Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier Perhaps once they had been lions but now they were twisted and grotesque Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear He must not listen he told himself he must not hear so long as he did not hear them he was safe But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung he knew he was not safe after all I didn’t hear he wept as they came closer and closer I didn’t I didn’t

He woke gasping lost in darkness and saw a vast shadow looming over him I didn’t hear he whispered trembling in fear but then the shadow said Hodor and lit the candle by the bedside and Bran sighed with relief

Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands When it was time he carried him down to the Great Hall where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire The lord’s seat at the head of the table had been left empty but Robb sat to the right of it with Bran across from him They ate suckling pig that night and pigeon pie and turnips soaking in butter and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs Summer snatched table scraps from Bran’s hand while Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner Winterfell’s dogs would not come near the hall now Bran had found that strange at first but he was growing used to it

Yoren was senior among the black brothers so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester Luwin The old man had a sour smell as if he had not washed in a long time He ripped at the meat with his teeth cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow Ser Alliser’s bane he grunted and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen the black brothers grew ominously quiet

What is it Bran asked

Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest There’s hard news m’lords and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead but the man as asks the question must bear the answer Stark’s gone

One of the other men said The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce and he’s late returning my lord

Too long Yoren said Most like he’s dead

My uncle is not dead Robb Stark said loudly anger in his tones He rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword Do you hear me My uncle is not dead His voice rang against the stone walls and Bran was suddenly afraid

Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb unimpressed Whatever you say m’lord he said He sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth

The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat There’s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark He’ll find his way back

Well said Yoren maybe he will and maybe he won’t Good men have gone into those woods before and never come out

All Bran could think of was Old Nan’s story of the Others and the last hero hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds He was afraid for a moment until he remembered how that story ended The children will help him he blurted the children of the forest

Theon Greyjoy sniggered and Maester Luwin said Bran the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years All that is left of them are the faces in the trees

Down here might be that’s true Maester Yoren said but up past the Wall who’s to say Up there a man can’t always tell what’s alive and what’s dead

That night after the plates had been cleared Robb carried Bran up to bed himself Grey Wind led the way and Summer came close behind His brother was strong for his age and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags but the stairs were steep and dark and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top

He put Bran into bed covered him with blankets and blew out the candle For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark Bran wanted to talk to him but he did not know what to say We’ll find a horse for you I promise Robb whispered at last

Are they ever coming back Bran asked him

Yes Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord Mother will be home soon Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes Wouldn’t that surprise her to see you ahorse Even in the dark room Bran could feel his brother’s smile And afterward we’ll ride north to see the Wall We won’t even tell Jon we’re coming we’ll just be there one day you and me It will be an adventure
