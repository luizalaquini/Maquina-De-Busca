They tried Another spearman ran at him Tyrion lopped off the head of his spear then his hand then his arm trotting around him in a circle An archer bowless thrust at him with an arrow holding it as if it were a knife The destrier kicked at the man’s thigh to send him sprawling and Tyrion barked laughter He rode past a banner planted in the mud one of Stannis’s fiery hearts and chopped the staff in two with a swing of his axe A knight rose up from nowhere to hack at his shield with a two-handed greatsword again and again until someone thrust a dagger under his arm One of Tyrion’s men perhaps He never saw

I yield ser a different knight called out farther down the river Yield Ser knight I yield to you My pledge here here The man lay in a puddle of black water offering up a lobstered gauntlet in token of submission Tyrion had to lean down to take it from him As he did a pot of wildfire burst overhead spraying green flame In the sudden stab of light he saw that the puddle was not black but red The gauntlet still had the knight’s hand in it He flung it back Yield the man sobbed hopelessly helplessly Tyrion reeled away

A man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of his horse and thrust at Tyrion’s face with a dagger He knocked the blade aside and buried the axe in the nape of the man’s neck As he was wresting it free a blaze of white appeared at the edge of his vision Tyrion turned thinking to find Ser Mandon Moore beside him again but this was a different white knight Ser Balon Swann wore the same armor but his horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans of his House He’s more a spotted knight than a white one Tyrion thought inanely Every bit of Ser Balon was spattered with gore and smudged by smoke He raised his mace to point downriver Bits of brain and bone clung to its head My lord look

Tyrion swung his horse about to peer down the Blackwater The current still flowed black and strong beneath but the surface was a roil of blood and flame The sky was red and orange and garish green What he said Then he saw

Steel-clad men-at-arms were clambering off a broken galley that had smashed into a pier So many where are they coming from Squinting into the smoke and glare Tyrion followed them back out into the river Twenty galleys were jammed together out there maybe more it was hard to count Their oars were crossed their hulls locked together with grappling lines they were impaled on each other’s rams tangled in webs of fallen rigging One great hulk floated hull up between two smaller ships Wrecks but packed so closely that it was possible to leap from one deck to the other and so cross the Blackwater

Hundreds of Stannis Baratheon’s boldest were doing just that Tyrion saw one great fool of a knight trying to ride across urging a terrified horse over gunwales and oars across tilting decks slick with blood and crackling with green fire We made them a bloody bridge he thought in dismay Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment but that did not seem to stop them Those are brave men he told Ser Balon in admiration Let’s go kill them

He led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront pounding down a long stone quay with his own men and Ser Balon’s behind him Ser Mandon fell in with them his shield a ragged ruin Smoke and cinders swirled through the air and the foe broke before their charge throwing themselves back into the water knocking over other men as they fought to climb up The foot of the bridge was a half-sunken enemy galley with Dragonsbane painted on her prow her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion had placed between the quays A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar drove the point of his weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann’s horse before he could dismount spilling the knight from the saddle Tyrion hacked at the man’s head as he flashed by and by then it was too late to rein up His stallion leapt from the end of the quay and over a splintered gunwale landing with a splash and a scream in ankle-deep water Tyrion’s axe went spinning followed by Tyrion himself and the deck rose up to give him a wet smack

Madness followed His horse had broken a leg and was screaming horribly Somehow he managed to draw his dagger and slit the poor creature’s throat The blood gushed out in a scarlet fountain drenching his arms and chest He found his feet again and lurched to the rail and then he was fighting staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water Men came at him Some he killed some he wounded and some went away but always there were more He lost his knife and gained a broken spear he could not have said how He clutched it and stabbed shrieking curses Men ran from him and he ran after them clambering up over the rail to the next ship and then the next His two white shadows were always with him Balon Swann and Mandon Moore beautiful in their pale plate Surrounded by a circle of Velaryon spearmen they fought back to back they made battle as graceful as a dance

His own killing was a clumsy thing He stabbed one man in the kidney when his back was turned and grabbed another by the leg and upended him into the river Arrows hissed past his head and clattered off his armor one lodged between shoulder and breastplate but he never felt it A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm Stones began to plummet down crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot knocking him sideways

Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck deep A groaning filled the air like the death cries of some enormous beast The ship he had time to think the ship’s about to tear loose The broken galleys were ripping apart the bridge breaking apart No sooner had he come to that realization than he heard a sudden crack loud as thunder the deck lurched beneath him and he slid back down into the water

The list was so steep he had to climb back up hauling himself along a snapped line inch by bloody inch Out of the corner of his eye he saw the hulk they’d been tangled with drifting downstream with the current spinning slowly as men leapt over her side Some wore Stannis’s flaming heart some Joffrey’s stag-and-lion some other badges but it seemed to make no matter Fires were burning upstream and down On one side of him was a raging battle a great confusion of bright banners waving above a sea of struggling men shield walls forming and breaking mounted knights cutting through the press dust and mud and blood and smoke On the other side the Red Keep loomed high on its hill spitting fire They were on the wrong sides though For a moment Tyrion thought he was going mad that Stannis and the castle had traded places How could Stannis cross to the north bank Belatedly he realized that the deck was turning and somehow he had gotten spun about so castle and battle had changed sides Battle what battle if Stannis hasn’t crossed who is he fighting Tyrion was too tired to make sense of it His shoulder ached horribly and when he reached up to rub it he saw the arrow and remembered I have to get off this ship Downstream was nothing but a wall of fire and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into it

Someone was calling his name faintly through the din of battle Tyrion tried to shout back Here Here I’m here help me His voice sounded so thin he could scarcely hear himself He pulled himself up the slanting deck and grabbed for the rail The hull slammed into the next galley over and rebounded so violently he was almost knocked into the water Where had all his strength gone It was all he could do to hang on

MY LORD TAKE MY HAND MY LORD TYRION

There on the deck of the next ship across a widening gulf of black water stood Ser Mandon Moore a hand extended Yellow and green fire shone against the white of his armor and his lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood but Tyrion reached for it all the same wishing his arms were longer It was only at the very last as their fingers brushed across the gap that something niggled at him… Ser Mandon was holding out his left hand why…

Was that why he reeled backward or did he see the sword after all He would never know The point slashed just beneath his eyes and he felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze of pain His head spun around as if he’d been slapped The shock of the cold water was a second slap more jolting than the first He flailed for something to grab on to knowing that once he went down he was not like to come back up Somehow his hand found the splintered end of a broken oar Clutching it tight as a desperate lover he shinnied up foot by foot His eyes were full of water his mouth was full of blood and his head throbbed horribly Gods give me strength to reach the deck… There was nothing else only the oar the water the deck

Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted flat on his back Balls of green and orange flame crackled overhead leaving streaks between the stars He had a moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view The knight was a white steel shadow his eyes shining darkly behind his helm Tyrion had no more strength than a rag doll Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled both hands around the hilt

And suddenly he lurched to the left staggering into the rail Wood split and Ser Mandon Moore vanished with a shout and a splash An instant later the hulls came slamming together again so hard the deck seemed to jump Then someone was kneeling over him Jaime he croaked almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth Who else would save him if not his brother

Be still my lord you’re hurt bad A boy’s voice that makes no sense thought Tyrion It sounded almost like Pod





SANSA

When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said Tell my brother ser Her voice was distant as if the news were of no great interest to her

Your brother’s likely dead Ser Lancel’s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under his arm When he had arrived in the hall the sight of him had made some of the guests scream He was on the bridge of boats when it broke apart we think Ser Mandon’s likely gone as well and no one can find the Hound Gods be damned Cersei why did you have them fetch Joffrey back to the castle The gold cloaks are throwing down their spears and running hundreds of them When they saw the king leaving they lost all heart The whole Blackwater’s awash with wrecks and fire and corpses but we could have held if—

Osney Kettleblack pushed past him There’s fighting on both sides of the river now Y’Grace It may be that some of Stannis’s lords are fighting each other no one’s sure it’s all confused over there The Hound’s gone no one knows where and Ser Balon’s fallen back inside the city The riverside’s theirs They’re ramming at the King’s Gate again and Ser Lancel’s right your men are deserting the walls and killing their own officers There’s mobs at the Iron Gate and the Gate of the Gods fighting to get out and Flea Bottom’s one great drunken riot

Gods be good Sansa thought it is happening Joffrey’s lost his head and so have I She looked for Ser Ilyn but the King’s Justice was not to be seen I can feel him though He’s close I’ll not escape him he’ll have my head

Strangely calm the queen turned to his brother Osfryd Raise the drawbridge and bar the doors No one enters or leaves Maegor’s without my leave

What about them women who went to pray
